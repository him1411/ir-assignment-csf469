How can I make a layout with rounded corners? I want to apply rounded corners to my LinearLayout.1: Define layout_bg.xml in drawables:2: Add layout_bg.xml as background to your layoutHere\'s a copy of a XML file  to create a drawable with a white background, black border and rounded corners:  save it as a xml file in the drawable directory,\nUse it like you would use any drawable background(icon or resource file) using its resource name (R.drawable.your_xml_name)For API 21+, Use Clip ViewsRounded outline clipping was added to the View class in API 21. See this training doc or this reference for more info.This in-built feature makes rounded corners very easy to implement. It works on any view or layout and supports proper clipping.Here\'s What To Do:Unfortunately, there seems to be a bug and this XML attribute currently is not recognized. Luckily, we can set the clipping in Java:What It Looks Like:Special Note About ImageViewssetClipToOutline() only works when the View\'s background is set to a shape drawable. If this background shape exists, View treats the background\'s outline as the borders for clipping and shadowing purposes.This means that if you want to round the corners on an ImageView with setClipToOutline(), your image must come from android:src instead of android:background (since background is used for the rounded shape). If you MUST use background to set your image instead of src, you can use this nested views workaround:I have done this way:Check Screenshot:Create drawable file named with custom_rectangle.xml in drawable folder:Now apply Rectangle background on View:DoneI think a better way to do it is to merge 2 things:make a bitmap of the layout, as shown here.make a rounded drawable from the bitmap, as shown here set the drawable on an imageView.This will handle cases that other solutions have failed to solve, such as having content that has corners.I think it\'s also a bit more GPU-friendly, as it shows a single layer instead of 2 .The only better way is to make a totally customized view, but that\'s a lot of code and might take a lot of time. I think that what I suggested here is the best of both worlds.Here\'s a snippet of how it can be done:RoundedCornersDrawable.javaCustomView.javaUse CardView in android v7 support library.\nThough it\'s a bit heavy, it solves all problem, and easy enough.\nNot like the set drawable background method, it could clip subviews successfully.Try this...1.create drawable xml(custom_layout.xml):2.add your view background@David, just put padding same value as stroke, so border can be visible, regardeless image sizeThe best and simplest method would be to make use of card_background drawable in your layout. This also follows Google\'s material design guidelines. Just include this in you LinearLayout:Add this to your drawable directory and name it card_background.xml:Use CardView to get rounded edges for any layouts. \nUse card_view:cardCornerRadius="5dp" for cardview to get rounded layout edges.A better way to do it would be:background_activity.xmlThis will work below API 21 also, and give you something like this:If you are willing to make a little more effort more better control, then use android.support.v7.widget.CardView with its cardCornerRadius attribute (and set elevation attribute to 0dp to get rid of any accompanying drop shadow with the cardView). Also, this will work from API level as low as 15.
