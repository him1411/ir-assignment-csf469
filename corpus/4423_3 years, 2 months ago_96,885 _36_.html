I have been reading articles around the net to understand the differences between the following key types. But it just seems hard for me to grasp. Examples will definitely help  make understanding better.There is a lot of confusion around this, I will try to make it as simple as possible. The primary key is a general concept to indicate one or more columns used to retrieve data from a Table.The primary key may be SIMPLEThat means that it is made by a single column.But the primary key can also be COMPOSITE (aka COMPOUND), generated from more columns.In a situation of  COMPOSITE primary key, the "first part" of the key is called PARTITION KEY (in this example key_part_one is the partition key) and the second part of the key is the CLUSTERING KEY (key_part_two)Please note that the both partition and clustering key can be made by more columnsBehind these names ...Further usage information: DATASTAX DOCUMENTATIONtable contentCOMPOSITE/COMPOUND KEY can retrieve "wide rows"table contentBut you can query with all key ...query outputImportant note: the partition key is the minimum-specifier needed to perform a query using where clause.\nIf you have a composite partition key, like the followingeg: PRIMARY KEY((col1, col2), col10, col4))You can perform query only passing at least both col1 and col2, these are the 2 columns that defines the partition key. The "general" rule to make query is you have to pass at least all partition key columns, then you can add each key in the order they\'re set.so the valid queries are (excluding secondary indexes)Invalid:Hope this helps.Adding a redux answer as the accepted one is quite long. The terms "row" and "column" are used in the context of CQL, not how Cassandra is actually implemented.Examples:In cassandra , the difference between primary key,partition key,composite key, clustering key always makes some confusion.. So I am going to explain below and co relate to each others. We use CQL (Cassandra Query Language) for Cassandra database access. \nNote:- Answer is as per updated version of Cassandra. \n Primary Key :- In CQL, the order in which columns are defined for the PRIMARY KEY matters. The first column of the key is called the partition key having property that all the rows sharing the same partition key (even across table in fact) are stored on the same physical node. Also, insertion/update/deletion on rows sharing the same partition key for a given table are performed atomically and in isolation. Note that it is possible to have a composite partition key, i.e. a partition key formed of multiple columns, using an extra set of parentheses to define which columns forms the partition key.Partitioning and Clustering\nThe PRIMARY KEY definition is made up of two parts: the Partition Key and the Clustering Columns. The first part maps to the storage engine row key, while the second is used to group columns in a row.Here device_id is partition key and checked_at is cluster_key. We can have multiple cluster key as well as partition key too which depends on declaration. In database design, a compound key is a set of superkeys that is not minimal.A composite key is a set that contains a compound key and at least one attribute that is not a superkeyGiven table: EMPLOYEES {employee_id, firstname, surname}Possible superkeys are:{employee_id} is the only minimal superkey, which also makes it the only candidate key--given that {firstname} and {surname} do not guarantee uniqueness. Since a primary key is defined as a chosen candidate key, and only one candidate key exists in this example, {employee_id} is the minimal superkey, the only candidate key, and the only possible primary key.The exhaustive list of compound keys is:The only composite key is {employee_id, firstname, surname} since that key contains a compound key ({employee_id,firstname}) and an attribute that is not a superkey ({surname}).
