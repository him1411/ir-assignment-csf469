What\'s the difference between <a target="_new"> and <a target="_blank"> and which should I use if I just want to open a link in a new tab/window?According to the HTML5 Spec:A valid browsing context name is any string with at least one character that does not start with a U+005F LOW LINE character. (Names starting with an underscore are reserved for special keywords.)A valid browsing context name or keyword is any string that is either a valid browsing context name or that is an ASCII case-insensitive match for one of: _blank, _self, _parent, or _top." - SourceThat means that there is no such keyword as _new in HTML5, and not in HTML4 (and consequently XHTML) either. That means, that there will be no consistent behavior whatsoever if you use this as a value for the target attribute.Using target="_blank" will instruct the browser to create a new browser tab or window when the user clicks on the link.Using target="_new" is technically invalid according to the specifications, but as far as I know every browser will behave the same way:Note target="_new" will behave exactly the same as target="new", and the latter is valid HTML while the former is invalid HTML.Adding some confusion to this, in HTML4 the target attribute was deprecated. In HTML5 this decision was reversed, and it is an official part of the spec once again. All browsers support target no matter what version of HTML you are using, but some validators will flag the use as deprecated if your doctype is HTML4.TL;DR\n\nUSE _blankThe target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.SINCE "_new" is not any of these IT WILL COME UNDER "framename" so if a user re-clicks on that hyperlink it will not open a new tab instead update the existing tab. Whereas in  _blank if user clicks twice then 2 new tabs open.This may have been asked before but:"every link that specifies target="_new" looks for and finds that window by name, and opens in it.If you use target="_blank," a brand new window will be created each time, on top of the current window."from here: http://thedesignspace.net/MT2archives/000316.htmlit\'s my understanding that target = whatever will look for a frame/window with that name. If not found, it will open up a new window with that name. If whatever == "_new", it will appear just as if you used _blank except.....Using one of the reserved target names will bypass the "looking" phase.  So, target = "_blank" on a dozen links will open up a dozen blank windows, but target = whatever on a dozen links will only open up one window. target = "_new" on a dozen links may give inconstant behavior.  I haven\'t tried it on several browsers, but should only open up one window.At least this is how I interpret the rules.target="_blank" opens a new tab in most browsers.Caution - remember to always include the "quotes" - at least on Chrome, target=_blank (no quotes) is NOT THE SAME as target="_blank" (with quotes).The latter opens each link in a new tab/window.  The former (missing quotes) opens the first link you click in one new tab/window, then overwrites that same tab/window with each subsequent link you click (that\'s named also with the missing quotes).Also, every link clicked with a target value of _new will replace the page loaded in the previously spawned window.You can click here When to use _blank or _new to try it out for yourself.I know this is an old question and the correct answer, use _blank, has been mentioned several times, but using <a target="somesite.com" target=_blank>Link</a> is a security risk.It is recommended ( performance benefits) to use \n\n   <a href="somesite.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Link</a>\nThe target attribute of a link forces the browser to open the destination page in a new browser window. Using _blank as a target value will spawn a new window every time while using _new will only spawn one new window and every link clicked with a target value of _new will replace the page loaded in the previously spawned windowIn order to open a link in a new tab/window you\'ll use <a target="_blank">.value _blank = targeted browsing context: a new one: tab or window depending on your browsing settingsvalue _new = not valid; no such value in HTML5 for target attribute on a elementtarget attribute with all its values on a element: video demo The use of _New is useful when working on pages that are Iframed. Since target="_blank" doesn\'t do the trick and opens the page on the same iframe... target new is the best solution for Iframe Pages. Just my five cents.
