How would I get the path to the script in Node.js?I know there\'s process.cwd, but that only refers to the directory where the script was called, not of the script itself. For instance, say I\'m in /home/kyle/ and I run the following command:If I call process.cwd(), I get /home/kyle/, not /home/kyle/some/dir/.  Is there a way to get that directory?I found it after looking through the documentation again. What I was looking for were the __filename and __dirname module-level variables.So basically you can do this:Use resolve() instead of concatenating with \'/\' or \'\\\' else you will run into cross-platform issues.Note: __dirname is the local path of the module or included script. If you are writing a plugin which needs to know the path of the main script it is:or, to just get the folder name:When it comes to the main script it\'s as simple as:From the Node.js documentation:An array containing the command line arguments. The first element will be \'node\', the second element will be the name of the JavaScript file. The next elements will be any additional command line arguments.If you need to know the path of a module file then use __filename.Every Node.js program has some global variables in its environment, which represents some information about your process and one of it is __dirname.This command returns the current directory:For example, to use the path to read the file:You can use process.env.PWD to get the current app folder path.I know this is pretty old, and the original question I was responding to is marked as duplicate and directed here, but I ran into an issue trying to get jasmine-reporters to work and didn\'t like the idea that I had to downgrade in order for it to work. I found out that jasmine-reporters wasn\'t resolving the savePath correctly and was actually putting the reports folder output in jasmine-reporters directory instead of the root directory of where I ran gulp. In order to make this work correctly I ended up using process.env.INIT_CWD to get the initial Current Working Directory which should be the directory where you ran gulp. Hope this helps someone. If you are using pkg to package your app, you\'ll find useful this expression:process.pkg tells if the app has been packaged by pkg. process.execPath holds the full path of the executable, which is /usr/bin/node or similar for direct invocations of scripts (node test.js), or the packaged app.require.main.filename holds the full path of the main script, but it\'s empty when Node runs in interactive mode.__dirname holds the full path of the current script, so I\'m not using it (although it may be what OP asks; then better use appDirectory = process.pkg ? require(\'path\').dirname(process.execPath) : (__dirname || require(\'path\').dirname(process.argv[0])); noting that in interactive mode __dirname is empty.For interactive mode, use either process.argv[0] to get the path to the Node executable or process.cwd() to get the current directory.If you want something more like $0 in a shell script, try this:
