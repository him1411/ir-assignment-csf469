I want to automatically show the soft-keyboard when an EditText is focused (if the device does not have a physical keyboard) and I have two problems:When my Activity is displayed, my EditText is focused but the keyboard is not displayed, I need to click again on it to show the keyboard (it should be displayed when my Activity is displayed).And when I click done on the keyboard, the keyboard is dissmissed but the EditText stays focused and y don\'t want (because my edit is done).To resume, my problem is to have something more like on the iPhone: which keep the keyboard sync with my EditText state (focused / not focused) and of course does not present a soft-keyboard if there is a physical one.To force the soft keyboard to appear, you can useAnd for removing the focus on EditText, sadly you need to have a dummy View to grab focus.I hope this helpsTo close it you can useI had the same problem. Immediately after editText VISIBILITY change from GONE to VISIBLE, I had to set the focus and display the soft keyboard. I achieved this using the following code:It works for me with 100ms delay, but failed without any delay or with only a delay of 1ms. Commented part of code shows another approach, which works only on some devices. I tested on OS versions 2.2 (emulator), 2.2.1 (real device) and 1.6 (emulator).This approach saved me a lot of pain.To cause the keyboard to appear, useThis method is more reliable than invoking the InputMethodManager directly.To close it, useThe following code is pillaged from the Google\'s 4.1 source code for SearchView. Seems to work, fine on lesser versions of Android as well.Then in addition, the following code needs to be added as the Control/Activity is created. (In my case it\'s a composite control, rather than an activity).When nothing else works, force it to be shown:android:windowSoftInputMode="stateAlwaysVisible" -> in manifest File.  edittext.requestFocus();  -> in code.This will open soft keyboard on which edit-text has request focus as activity appears. I have had some recent luck in some simple cases with the code\nbelow.  I haven\'t finished all testing but....And presto the keyboard shows up.You can try to force the soft keyboard to appear, it works for me:Sometimes raukodraug\'s answer won\'t work. I\'ve make it in this way with some trials and errors:And the EditText part: showSoftInput was not working for me at all.I figured I needed to set the input mode: (here in the Activity component in the manifest)I combined everything here and for me it works:Believe or not my problem with Soft Keyboard was resolved when I discovered that the Activities animations can disable the Soft Keyboard. When you call the intent with the and It can hide the Soft Keyboard and there isn\'t a way to show it.To hide keyboard, use this one:and to show keyboard:For fragment, sure its working:It worked for me. You can try with this also to show the keyboard:I had the same problem in various different situations, and the solutions i have found work in some but dont work in others so here is a combine solution that works in most situations i have found:code snippet . . .just add  android:windowSoftInputMode="stateHidden" in manifest file...All solutions given above (InputMethodManager interaction in OnFocusChangeListener.onFocusChange listener attached to your EditText works fine if you have single edit in the activity.In my case I have two edits.I have observed that onFocusChange is triggered for tvX with hasFocus=true (keyboard shown) but then for tvY with  hasFocus=true (keyboard hidden). In the end, no keyboard was visible.General solution should have correct statement in if "show keyboard if EditText text has focus"In your onResume() section of the Activity you can do call the method bringKeyboard();I discovered a strange behaviour, since in one of my apps, the soft keyboard was automatically showing on entering the activity (there is an editText.requestFocus() in onCreate).On digging further, I discovered that this was because there is a ScrollView around the layout. If I remove the ScrollView, the behaviour is as described in the original problem statement: only on clicking the already focused editText does the soft keyboard show up.If it doesn\'t work for you, try putting in a ScrollView -- it\'s harmless anyway.I had a similar problem using view animations. So I\'ve put an animation listener to make sure I\'d wait for the animation to end before trying to request a keyboard access on the shown edittext.I am agree with raukodraug therefor using in a swithview you must request/clear focus like this : Regards.Inside your manifest:  android:windowSoftInputMode="stateAlwaysVisible" - initially launched keyboard.\nandroid:windowSoftInputMode="stateAlwaysHidden"  - initially hidden keyboard.I like to use also "adjustPan" because when the keyboard launches then the screen auto adjusts.Using Xamarin, this works for me inside a Fragment:I made this help class.\nJust pass the context and the View you want to focus and show keyboard and after hide keyboard.\nI hope it Helps.}add this line too do not forgetYou can also create a custom extension of the EditText that knows to open the soft keyboard when it receives focus. That\'s what I\'ve ended up doing. Here\'s what worked for me:
