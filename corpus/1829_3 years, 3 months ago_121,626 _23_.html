Keyboard does not show up when I run the simulator, and then click in the UITextView. How do I re-enable the keyboard?It used to work but now it doesn\'t - I don\'t know what I might have clicked on accident... any tips would be appreciated!I had the same issue. My solution was as follows:Mine was checked because I was using my mac keyboard, but if you make sure it is unchecked the iPhone keyboard will always come up.While testing in the ios8 beta simulator, you may toggle between the "software keyboard" and "hardware keyboard" with \xe2\x8c\x98K.UPDATE: Since iOS Simulator 8.0, the shortcut is \xe2\x87\xa7\xe2\x8c\x98K.Simulator -> Hardware -> Keyboard -> Toggle Software Keyboard should solve this problem.This seems to be a bug in iOS 8. There are two fixes to this problem :Toggle between simulator keyboard and MacBook keyboard using the [Command+K] shortcut.Reattach keyboard to simulator :a. Open Simulatorb. Select Hardware -> Keyboardc. Uncheck and then check \'Connect Hardware Keyboard\'OR simply press the [Shift + Command + K] shortcutTo enable/disable simulator keyboard,\xe2\x8c\x98 + K (Ctrl + k)To disable input from your keyboard,iOS Simulator -> Hardware -> Keyboard -> Uncheck "Connect Hardware Keyboard"You can use Command + Shift + K to show keyboardIt would be difficult to say if there\'s any issue with your code without checking it out, however this happens to me quite a lot in (Version 6.0 (6A216f)). I usually have to reset the simulator\'s Content and Settings and/or restart xCode to get it working again. Try those and see if that solves the problem.Simple way is just Press command + k
