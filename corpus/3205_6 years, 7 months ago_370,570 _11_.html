My issue is I have changed a file eg: README, added a new line \'this for my testing line\' and saved the file, then I issued the following commandsI didn\'t push the code to github, Now I want to cancel this commit.For this I used But I lost the newly added line \'this for my testing line\' from the README file.\nThis should not happen. I need the content to be there. Is there a way to retain the content and cancel my local commit?Just use git reset without the --hard flag:PS: On Unix based systems you can use HEAD^ which is equal to HEAD~1. On Windows HEAD^ will not work because ^ signals a line continuation. So your command prompt will just ask you More?.Use --soft instead of --hard flag:If you\'re in the middle of a commit (i.e. in your editor already), you can cancel it by deleting all lines above the first #. That will abort the commit.So you can delete all lines so that the commit message is empty, then save the file:You\'ll then get a message that says Aborting commit due to empty commit message..
