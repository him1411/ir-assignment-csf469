I\'m trying to get a wcf service running in IIS8 on 2012 build 8400.When installing the web role the wcf stuff (under 3.51) wasn\'t to be found like in 2008.When installed the svc handler mapping was missing, so i did a:Now the handler mapping is there, but I still get:(I removed the static file handler.)The site is using the classic pipeline in order to use impersonation.More specifically:I had to enable HTTP Activation in .NET Framework 4.5 Advanced Services > WCF Servicesturn ON the following on \'Turn Windows Features on or off\'a) .Net Framework 3.5 - WCF HTTP Activation and Non-Http Activationb) all under WCF ServicesI prefer to do this via a script nowadaysWe managed to solve the error under Windows Server 2012 by:It seams the order of installation is the cause.Also, make sure you have HTTP Activation installed under WCF Services.For Windows 8 machines there is no "Server Manager" application (at least I was not able to find it).Though I was able to resolve the problem. I\'m not sure in which sequence I did the following operations but looks like one/few of following actions help:Turn ON the following on \'Turn Windows Features on or off\' a) .Net Framework 3.5 - WCF HTTP Activation and Non-Http Activation b) all under WCF Services (as specified in one of the answers to this question)executed "ServiceModelReg.exe \xe2\x80\x93i" in "%windir%\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v3.0\\Windows Communication Foundation\\" folderRegistered ASP.NET 2.0 via two commands ( in folder C:\\WINDOWS\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727):aspnet_regiis -ga "NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE"\naspnet_regiis -iruRestarted PC... it looks like as a result as actions ## 3 and 4 something got broken in my ASP.NET configurationRepeat action #2Install two other options from the "Programs and Features": .Net Framework 4.5 Advanced Services. I checked both sub options: ASP.NET 4.5 and WCF servicesRestart App Pool.Sequence is kind of crazy, but that helped to me and probably will help to otherOrder of installation matters a lot when configuring IIS 8 on Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012.I faced lot of issues configuring IIS 8 but finally these links helped meusing PowerShell you can install the required feature with:It\'s HTTP Activation feature of .NET framework \nWindows Process Activation feature is required tooOn windows 10 (client) you can also script this usingNote that this is a different command from the server skusThis was a really silly one for me. Adding this here as it\'s one of the more popular threads on svc 404 issues.I had in my Project Settings\' \\ Web \\ Project URL, pasted:And for some unknown reason (having done this a thousand times) didn\'t spot straight away that the name of the .svc file was at the end. DOH! I had just pasted the address from my WCF test client and hadn\'t checked it sufficiently. What this did in the background was create an IIS application at the .svc address and I was getting nothing out of IIS. I couldn\'t work out how I couldn\'t even hit the .svc file.Simple fix, obviously, just remove the application in IIS and change the project URL.After almost 20 years at this, you can still make schoolboy errors / rookie mistakes. Hope this helps someone.
