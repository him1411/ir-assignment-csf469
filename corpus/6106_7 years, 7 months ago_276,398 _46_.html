I am trying to open an image / picture in the Gallery built-in app from inside my application.I have a URI of the picture (the picture is located on the SD card).Do you have any suggestions?This is a complete solution. I\'ve just updated this example code with the information provided in the answer below by @mad. Also check the solution below from @Khobaib explaining how to deal with picasa images.I\'ve just reviewed my original answer and created a simple Android Studio project you can checkout from github and import directly on your system. https://github.com/hanscappelle/SO-2169649(note that the multiple file selection still needs work)With support for images from file explorers thanks to user mad.Since someone requested that information in a comment and it\'s better to have information gathered.Set an extra parameter EXTRA_ALLOW_MULTIPLE on the intent:And in the Result handling check for that parameter:Note that this is only supported by API level 18+.Here is an update to the fine code that hcpl posted. but this works with OI file manager, astro file manager AND the media gallery too (tested). so i guess it will work with every file manager (are there many others than those mentioned?). did some corrections to the code he wrote.   hcpl\'s methods work perfectly pre-KitKat, but not working with the DocumentsProvider API. For that just simply follow the official Android tutorial for documentproviders: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider.html -> open a document, Bitmap section.Simply I used hcpl\'s code and extended it: if the file with the retrieved path to the image throws exception I call this function:Tested on Nexus 5.basis with the above code, I reflected the code like below, may be it\'s more suitable:Assuming you have an image folder in your SD card directory for images only.Then you can decide with what you would like to do with the content back in your activity. This was an example to retrieve the path name for the image, test this with your code just to make sure you can handle the results coming back. You can change the code as needed to better fit your needs.My advice is to try to get retrieving images working correctly, I think the problem is the content of accessing the images on the sdcard. Take a look at Displaying images on sd card. If you can get that up and running, probably by the example supplying a correct provider, you should be able to figure out a work-around for your code.Keep me updated by updating this question with your progress. Good luckI went through the solution from @hcpl & @mad. hcpl\'s solution supports well for local image in the gallery & mad provided a better solution on top of that - it helps to load OI/Astro/Dropbox image as well. But in my app, while working on picasa library that\'s now integrated in Android Gallery, both solution fail.I searched & analyzed a bit & eventually have come with a better & elegant solution that overcomes this limitation. Thanks to Dimitar Darazhanski for his blog, that helped me in this case, I modified a bit to make it easier to understand. Here is my solution goes -Check it & let me know if there\'s some issue with it. I have tested it & it works well in every case.Hope this will help everyone.There are two useful tutorials about image picker with downloadable source code here: How to Create Android Image Picker How to Select and Crop Image on Android However, the app will be forced to close sometime, you can fix it by adding android:configChanges attribute into main activity in Manifest file like as: It seems that the camera API lost control with orientation so this will help it. :)this is my revisit to this topic, gathering all the information here, plus from other relevant stack overflow questions. It returns images from some provider, while handling out-of-memory conditions and image rotation. It supports gallery, picasa and file managers, like drop box. Usage is simple: as input, the constructor receives the content resolver and the uri. The output is the final bitmap.References:Below solution work for 2.3(Gingerbread)-4.4(Kitkat), 5.0(Lollipop) and 6.0(Marshmallow) also:-Step 1 Code for opening the gallery to select pics:Step 2 Code for getting data in onActivityResult:To display images and videos try this:Above Answers are correct. I faced an different issue where in HTC M8 my application crashes when selecting an image from gallery. I\'m getting null value for image path. I fixed and optimized with the following solution. in onActivityResult method}Just in case it helps; I do this to get the Bitmap:This example will get a copy of the image.When running on 4.4 or higher, you request to open a file that\'s managed by another appOriginal sourceAdditional to previous answers, if you are having problems with getting the right path(like AndroZip) you can use this:Please find the answer for the selecting single image from gallery
