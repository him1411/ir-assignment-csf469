I would like to know the merits & de-merits ofI want to implement one common framework for two application, one in Perl and second in Java. So, would like to create common service which can be used by both technology i.e. Perl & Java.Both are web-applications.Please share me your valuable thoughts & suggestion on this. I have seen many links on google but all have mixed opinions.JsonXMLProtobufAll have good support on most platforms.Personally, I rarely use XML these days. If the consumer is a browser or a public API I tend to use json. For internal APIs I tend to use protobuf for performance. Offering both on public API (either via headers, or separate endpoints) works well too.
