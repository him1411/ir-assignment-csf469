I want to export and import a .sql file to and from a MySQL database from command line.Is there any command to export .sql file in MySQL? Then how do I import it?When doing the import, there may be constraints like enable/disable foreign key check or export only table structure.Can we set those options with mysqldump?If it\'s an entire DB, then:If it\'s all DBs, then:If it\'s specific tables within a DB, then:You can even go as far as auto-compressing the output using gzip (if your DB is very big):If you want to do this remotely and you have the access to the server in question, then the following would work (presuming the MySQL server is on port 3306):Type the following command to import sql data file:In this example, import \'data.sql\' file into \'blog\' database using sat as username:If you have a dedicated database server, replace localhost hostname with with actual server name or IP address as follows:OR use hostname such as mysql.cyberciti.bizIf you do not know the database name or database name is included in sql dump you can try out something as follows:Refer: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysqldump.htmlIf you want a GUI tool then you could probably use SQLyog Type the following command to import sql data file:In this example, import \'data.sql\' file into \'blog\' database using vivek as username:If you have a dedicated database server, replace localhost hostname with with actual server name or IP address as follows:To export a database, use the following:Note the < and > symbols in each case.Try    If you\'re already running the SQL shell, you can use the source command to import data:mysqldump will not dump database events, triggers and routines unless explicitly stated when dumping individual databases;Dump an entire database to a file:Well you can use below command to export,mysqldump --database --user=root --password your_db_name >\n  export_into_db.sqland the generated file will be available in the same directory where you had ran this command.Now login to mysql using command,mysql -u[username] -p then use "source" command with the file path.You could find more on : Import Export MySQL DBEnjoy :)You can use this script to export or import any database from terminal given at this link: https://github.com/Ridhwanluthra/mysql_import_export_script/blob/master/mysql_import_export_script.sh
