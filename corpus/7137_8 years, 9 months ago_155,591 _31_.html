I have a solution that contains a good deal of projects, I would like to remove the source control bindings completely, how can I do this?Update:\nWhat I really want to do is move one solution and its projects from TFS 2005 -> 2008. Thats why I am removing the bindings, is there a better way to do this?File -> Source Control -> Advanced -> Change Source Control and then unbind and/or disconnect all projects and the solution.This should remove all bindings from the solution and project files. (After this you can switch the SCC provider in Tools -> Options -> Source Control -> Plug-in Selection).The SCC specification prescribes that all SCC providers should implement this behavior. (I only tested it for VSS, TFS and AnkhSVN)I have no File -> Source Control menu in Visual Studio because I\'ve never used TFS with this installation of Visual Studio.My problem was I was opening a solution from the internet and the original author had forgotten to remove the TFS bindings, so every time I open the solution I\'d get an annoying popup saying To get rid of this, I deleted the .suo next to the .sln file, and then opened the .sln file in Notepad and deleted this entire section:Save the .sln in Notepad and then open in Visual Studio, problem solved.Update: Saveen Reddy has created a tool to do this. I haven\'t tried it though.The simplest solution would be to open Visual Studio, deactivate the TFS Plugin in Tools > Options > Source control and reopen the solution you want to clean. Visual Studio will ask to remove source controls bindingsIf anyone needs to do this outside the context of the Visual Studio application - via command-line for example, I wrote a small tool which will strip the source control bindings from Solution And Project files. The source is available here: https://github.com/saveenr/VS_unbind_source_controlOld post, so just adding to the answers of @Matt Frear and @Johan Buret. Both work. But in Matt\'s case, you also need to set these (VS 2012) in Notepad/text editor:To each project in the solution file (.sln). @Johan\'s answer effectively does this....You could try using this tool which automatically removes the Team Foundation Bindings from a project.\nhttp://www.softpedia.com/get/Programming/Other-Programming-Files/Team-Foundation-Binding-Remover.shtmlSometime, the binding info is cachedTo clear Team Explorer\'s cache:This come from a website I could not find now. Thanks for that guy for the tip.I found this tool that helped me get rid of a tfs binding complitly its found here\nhttps://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RonJacobs.CleanProject-CleansVisualStudioSolutionsForUploadiit creates a zip with the removed source binding without modifying the orginal project.In visual studio 2015,Here you can find another tool (including source code) to remove both SCC footprint from the solution and project files and the .vssscc and .vspscc files. In addition, it removes the output and other configurable directories.HthStefanVS2013 go to menu File -> Source Control -> Advanced -> Change Source Control Select Solution/Project to unbind and on tool bar click UnbindGo to menu Tools -> Options, in Options window on the left panel click node Source Control select Plug-in Selection. On drop down Current source control plugin select None.EDIT\nAbove solution did not work for my VS2013 project, however I solved it as above and shared, if you think it does not work for you please advise the reason what\'s wrong with it. Thanks.
