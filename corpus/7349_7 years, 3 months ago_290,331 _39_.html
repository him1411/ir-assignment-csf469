What is an index in SQL? Can you explain or reference to understand clearly? Where should I use an index?An index is used to speed up searching in the database. MySQL have some good documentation on the subject (which is relevant for other SQL servers as well):\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/mysql-indexes.htmlAn index can be used to efficiently find all row matching some column in your query and then walk through only that subset of the table to find exact matches. If you don\'t have indexes on any column in the WHERE clause, the SQL server have to walk through the whole table and check every row to see if it matches, which may be a slow operation on big tables.The index can also be a UNIQUE index, which means that you cannot have duplicate values in that column, or a PRIMARY KEY which in some storage engines defines where in the database file the value is stored.In MySQL you can use EXPLAIN in front of your SELECT statement to see if your query will make use of any index. This is a good start for troubleshooting performance problems. Read more here:\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/explain.htmlA clustered index is like the contents of a phone book. You can open the book at \'Hilditch, David\' and find all the information for all of the \'Hilditch\'s right next to each other. Here the keys for the clustered index are (lastname, firstname).This makes clustered indexes great for retrieving lots of data based on range based queries since all the data is located next to each other.Since the clustered index is actually related to how the data is stored, there is only one of them possible per table (although you can cheat to simulate multiple clustered indexes).A non-clustered index is different in that you can have many of them and they then point at the data in the clustered index. You could have e.g. a non-clustered index at the back of a phone book which is keyed on (town, address)Imagine if you had to search through the phone book for all the people who live in \'London\' - with only the clustered index you would have to search every single item in the phone book since the key on the clustered index is on (lastname, firstname) and as a result the people living in London are scattered randomly throughout the index.If you have a non-clustered index on (town) then these queries can be performed much more quickly.Hope that helps!An index is used to speed up the performance of queries. It does this by reducing the number of database data pages that have to be visited/scanned.In SQL Server, a clustered index determines the physical order of data in a table. There can be only one clustered index per table (the clustered index IS the table). All other indexes on a table are termed non-clustered.SQL Server Index BasicsSQL Server Indexes: The BasicsSQL Server Indexes Index BasicsIndex (wiki)A very good analogy is to think of a database index as an index in a book. If you have a book regarding countries and you are looking for India, then why would you flip through the entire book \xe2\x80\x93 which is the equivalent of a full table scan in database terminology \xe2\x80\x93 when you can just go to the index at the back of the book, which will tell you the exact pages where you can find information on India. Similarly, as a book index contains a page number, a database index contains a pointer to the row containing the value that you are searching for in your SQL. More HereIndexes are all about finding data quickly. Indexes in a database are analogous to indexes that you find in a book. If a book has an index, and I ask you to find a chapter in that book, you can quickly find that with the help of the index. On the other hand, if the book doesnot have an index, you will have to spend more time, looking for the chapter, by looking at every page from the start to the end of the book. In a similar fashion, indexes in a database, can help queries to find data quickly. If you are new to indexes, the following videos, can be very useful. Infact, I have learnt a lot from them.Index Basics\nClustered and Non-Clustered Indexes \nUnique and Non-Unique Indexes \nAdvantages and disadvantages of indexesWell in general index is a B-tree. There are two types of indexes: clustered and nonclustered. Clustered index creates a physical order of rows (it can be only one and in most cases it is also a primary key - if you create primary key on table you create clustered index on this table also).Nonclustered index is also a binary tree but it doesn\'t create a physical order of rows. So the leaf nodes of nonclustered index contain PK (if it exists) or row index. Indexes are used to increase the speed of search. Because the complexity is of O(log N). Indexes is very large and interesting topic. I can say that creating indexes on large database is some kind of art sometimes.INDEX is a performance optimization technique that speeds up the data retrieval process. It is a persistent data structure that associated with a Table (or View) in order to increase performance during retrieving the data from that table (or View).Index based search is applied more particularly when your queries include WHERE filter. Otherwise, i.e, a query without WHERE-filter selects whole data and process. Searching whole table without INDEX is called Table-scan.You will find exact information for Sql-Indexes in clear and reliable way:\nfollow these links:INDEXES - to find data easily UNIQUE INDEX - duplicate values are not allowed Syntax for INDEXSyntax for UNIQUE INDEXAn index is used for several different reasons. The main reason is to speed up querying so that you can get rows or sort rows faster. Another reason is to define a primary-key or unique index which will guarantee that no other columns have the same values.If you\'re using SQL Server, one of the best resources is its own Books Online that comes with the install!  It\'s the 1st place I would refer to for ANY SQL Server related topics.If it\'s practical "how should I do this?" kind of questions, then StackOverflow would be a better place to ask.Also, I haven\'t been back for a while but sqlservercentral.com used to be one of the top SQL Server related sites out there.
