Here is my git workflow.I work from two different computers (A and B) and store a common git remote in dropbox directory.Let\'s say I have two branches master and devel. Both are tracking their remote counterparts origin/master and origin/devel.Now while on computer A, I delete branch devel - both local and remote - as follows:Now if I do git branch -a on computer A, I getI now go to computer B. Do git fetch. I can remove the local devel branch byBut I can\'t remove the remote devel branch.Doing git branch -a still lists origin/devel in remote branches.How can I clean up the remote entry of devel from machine B?First, what is the result of git branch -a on machine B?Second, you have already deleted heads/devel on origin, so that\'s why you can\'t delete it from machine B.Tryororand feel free to add --dry-run to the end of your git statement to see the result of running it without actually running it. Here is bash script that can do it for you. It\'s modified version of http://snippets.freerobby.com/post/491644841/remove-merged-branches-in-git script. My modification enables it to support different remote locations.Consider to run :On a regular basis in each repo to remove local branches that have been tracking a remote branch that is deleted (no longer exists in remote GIT repo).This can be further simplified bythis is a per-repo setting that will make any future git fetch or git pull to automatically prune.Or you may also edit the global .gitconfig and addto make one setting for all your git repositories.This command will "dry run" delete all remote (origin) merged branches, apart from master. You can change that, or, add additional branches after master: grep -v for-example-your-branch-here |If it looks good, remove the --dry-run. Additionally you may like to test this on a fork first.Here is how to do it with SourceTree (v2.3.1):\n 1. Click Fetch\n 2. Check "Prune tracking branches ..."\n 3. Press OK\n 4. \xf0\x9f\x98\x80   This will remove all branches from the remote repo that you have deleted from your local repo
