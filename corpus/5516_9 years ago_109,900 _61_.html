I\'m looking for a simple algorithm to generate a large number of random, aesthetically pleasing colors. So no crazy neon colors, colors reminiscent of feces, etc. I\'ve found solutions to this problem but they rely on alternative color palettes than RGB.\nI would rather just use straight RGB than mapping back and forth. These other solutions also can at most generate only 32 or so pleasing random colors. Any ideas would be great.You could average the RGB values of random colors with those of a constant color:(example in Java)\nMixing random colors with white (255, 255, 255) creates neutral pastels by increasing the lightness while keeping the hue of the original color. These randomly generated pastels usually go well together, especially in large numbers.Here are some pastel colors generated using the above method:\nYou could also mix the random color with a constant pastel, which results in a tinted set of neutral colors. For example, using a light blue creates colors like these:\nGoing further, you could add heuristics to your generator that take into account complementary colors or levels of shading, but it all depends on the impression you want to achieve with your random colors.Some additional resources:I would use a color wheel and given a random position you could add the golden angle (137,5 degrees)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_anglein order to get different colours each time that do not overlap. Adjusting the brightness for the color wheel you could get also different bright/dark color combinations.I\'ve found this blog post that explains really well the problem and the solution using the golden ratio.http://martin.ankerl.com/2009/12/09/how-to-create-random-colors-programmatically/UPDATE: I\'ve just found this other approach:It\'s called RYB(red, yellow, blue) method and it\'s described in this paper:http://threekings.tk/mirror/ryb_TR.pdfas "Paint Inspired Color Compositing".The algorithm generates the colors and each new color is chosen to maximize its euclidian distance to the previously selected ones.Here you can find a a good implementation in javascript:http://afriggeri.github.com/RYB/UPDATE 2: The Sciences Po Medialb have just released a tool called "I want Hue" that generate color palettes for data scientists. Using different color spaces and generating the palettes by using k-means clustering or force vectors ( repulsion graphs) The results from those methods are very good, they show the theory and an implementation in their web page. http://tools.medialab.sciences-po.fr/iwanthue/index.phpIn javascript:Saw the idea here: http://blog.functionalfun.net/2008/07/random-pastel-colour-generator.htmlConverting to another palette is a far superior way to do this. There\'s a reason they do that: other palettes are \'perceptual\' - that is, they put similar seeming colors close together, and adjusting one variable changes the color in a predictable manner. None of that is true for RGB, where there\'s no obvious relationship between colors that "go well together".An answer that shouldn\'t be overlooked, because it\'s simple and presents advantages, is sampling of real life photos and paintings. sample as many random pixels as you want random colors on thumbnails of modern art pics, cezanne, van gogh, monnet, photos... the advantage is that you can get colors by theme and that they are organic colors. just put 20 - 30 pics in a folder and random sample a random pic every time.Conversion to HSV values is a widespread code algorithm for psychologically based palette. hsv is easier to randomize.In php:\nsource: https://stackoverflow.com/a/12266311/2875783Here is quick and dirty color generator in C# (using \'RYB approach\' described in this article). It\'s a rewrite from JavaScript.Use:First two colors tend to be white and a shade of black. I often skip them like this (using Linq):Implementation:David Crow\'s method in an R two-liner:For pastel, pass in higher luma dark/light integers - ie fnGetRandomColour(120, 250)Credits: all credits to \n  http://paulirish.com/2009/random-hex-color-code-snippets/\n  stackoverflow.com/questions/12043187/how-to-check-if-hex-color-is-too-blackyou could have them be within a certain brightness. that would control the ammount of "neon" colors a bit. for instance, if the "brightness"was within a certain high bound, it would have a washed out, light color to it. Conversely, if it was within a certain low bound, it would be darker. This would eliminate any crazy, standout colors and if you chose a bound really high or really low, they would all be fairly close to either white or black.Run the function using:It\'s going to be hard to get what you want algorithmically - people have been studying color theory for a long time, and they don\'t even know all the rules.However, there are some rules which you can use to cull bad color combinations (ie, there are rules for clashing colors, and choosing complementary colors).I\'d recommend you visit your library\'s art section and check out books on color theory to gain a better understanding of what is a good color before you try to make one - it appears you might not even know why certain combinations work and others don\'t.-AdamI\'d strongly recommend using a CG HSVtoRGB shader function, they are awesome... it gives you natural color control like a painter instead of control like a crt monitor, which you arent presumably!This is a way to make 1 float value. i.e. Grey, into 1000 ds of combinations of color and brightness and saturation etc:result is AWESOME COLOR RANDOMIZATION! it\'s not natural but it uses natural color gradients and it looks organic and controlleably irridescent / pastel parameters.For perlin, you can use this function, it is a fast zig zag version of perlin.Here is something I wrote for a site I made. It will auto-generate a random flat background-color for any div with the class .flat-color-gen. Jquery is only required for the purposes of adding css to the page; it\'s not required for the main part of this, which is the generateFlatColorWithOrder() method.JsFiddle LinkUse distinct-colors.Written in javascript.It generates a palette of visually distinct colors.distinct-colors is highly configurable:I\'ve has success using TriadMixing and CIE94 to avoid similar colors. The following image uses input colors red, yellow, and white. See here.
