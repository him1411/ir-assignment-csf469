I am trying to find an item index by searching a list. Does anybody know how to do that? I see there is list.StartIndex and list.EndIndex bu I want something like python\'s list.index("text")As swift is in some regards more functional than object-oriented (and Arrays are structs, not objects), use the function "find" to operate on the array, which returns an optional value, so be prepared to handle a nil value:Update for Swift 2.0:The old find function is not supported any more with Swift 2.0!With Swift 2.0, Array gains the ability to find the index of an element using a function defined in an extension of CollectionType (which Array implements):Additionally, finding the first element in an array fulfilling a predicate is supported by another extension of CollectionType:Note that these two functions return optional values, as find did before.Update for Swift 3.0:Note the syntax of indexOf has changed. For items conforming to Equatable you can use:A detailed documentation of the method can be found at https://developer.apple.com/reference/swift/array/1689674-indexFor array items that don\'t conform to Equatable you\'ll need to use index(where:):I think it\'s worth mentioning that with reference types (class) you might want to perform an "identity" comparison, in which case you just need to use the === identity operator in the predicate closure:Swift 3:Notice that the above syntax uses trailing closures syntax, and is equivalent to:Swift 2 - the index function syntax used to be:* Note the relevant and useful comment by paulbailey about class types that implement Equatable, where you need to consider whether you should be comparing using === (identity operator) or == (equality operator). If you decide to match using ==, then you can simply use the method suggested by others (people.index(of: person1)).You can filter an array with a closure:And you can count an array:So you can determine if an array includes your element by combining these:If you want to find the position, I don\'t see fancy way, but you can certainly do it like this:EDITWhile we\'re at it, for a fun exercise let\'s extend Array to have a find method:Now we can do this:While indexOf() works perfectly, it only returns one index.I was looking for an elegant way to get an array of indexes for elements which satisfy some condition.Here is how it can be done:Swift 3:Swift 2:For custom class, you need to implement the Equatable protocol.Update for Swift 2:sequence.contains(element): Returns true if a given sequence (such as\n  an array) contains the specified element.Swift 1:If you\'re looking just to check if an element is contained inside an array, that is, just get a boolean indicator, use contains(sequence, element) instead of find(array, element): contains(sequence, element): Returns true if a given sequence (such as\n  an array) contains the specified element.See example below: In Swift 2 (currently in beta with the Xcode 7 beta), Array includes an indexOf method provided by the CollectionType protocol. (Actually, two indexOf methods\xe2\x80\x94one that uses equality to match an argument, and another that uses a closure.)Prior to Swift 2, there wasn\'t a way for generic types like collections to provide methods for the concrete types derived from them (like arrays). So, in Swift 1.x, "index of" is a global function... And it got renamed, too, so in Swift 1.x, that global function is called find.It\'s also possible (but not necessary) to use the indexOfObject method from NSArray... or any of the other, more sophisticated search meth dis from Foundation that don\'t have equivalents in the Swift standard library. Just import Foundation (or another module that transitively imports Foundation), cast your Array to NSArray, and you can use the many search methods on NSArray.You can also use the functional library Dollar to do an indexOf on an array as such http://www.dollarswift.org/#indexof-indexofIf you are still working in Swift 1.xthen try,Swift 2.1 Swift 3For SWIFT 3 you can use a simple functionThis will give the number position, so you can use likeHope to be useful
