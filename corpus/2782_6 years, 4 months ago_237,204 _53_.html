Can someone tell me where can I find the Node.js modules, which I installed using npm?You can run npm list -g to see where global libraries are installed.On Unix systems they are normally placed in /usr/local/lib/node or /usr/local/lib/node_modules when installed globally. If you set the NODE_PATH environment variable to this path, the modules can be found by node.Windows XP - %USERPROFILE%\\Application Data\\npm\\node_modules\nWindows 7, 8 and 10 - %AppData%\\npm\\node_modulesNon-global libraries are installed the node_modules sub folder in the folder you are currently in. You can run npm list to see the installed non-global libraries for your current location.      The command npm root will tell you the effective installation directory of your npm packages.If your current working directory is a node package or a sub-directory of a node package, npm root will tell you the local installation directory. npm root -g will show the global installation root regardless of current working directory. See the documentation.Use npm root -g command for know your golbal npm path.On windows I used npm list -g to find out by default my (global) packages were being installed to C:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm.The other answers give you platform-specific responses, but a generic one is this:When you install global module with npm install -g something, npm looks up a config variable prefix to know where to install the module.You can get that value by running npm config get prefixTo display all the global modules available in that folder use npm ls -g --depth 0 (depth 0 to not display their dependencies).If you want to change the global modules path, use npm config edit and put prefix = /my/npm/global/modules/prefix in the file.When you use some tools like nodist, they change the platform-default installation path of global npm modules.In earlier versions of NPM modules were always placed in /usr/local/lib/node or wherever you specified the npm root within the .npmrc file. However, in NPM 1.0+ modules are installed in two places. You can have modules installed local to your application in /.node_modules or you can have them installed globally which will use the above.More information can be found at https://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/doc/install.mdIf module was installed with global (-g) flag, you can get parent location by running following command npm get prefixor npm ls -g --depth=0which will print location along with list of installed modulesCheers :-)The easiest way would be to do npm list -gto list the package and view their installed location.I had installed npm via chololatey, so the location isC:\\MyProgramData\\chocolatey\\lib\\nodejs.commandline.0.10.31\\tools\\node_modulesC:\\MyProgramData\\ is chocolatey repo location.From the docs:Packages are dropped into the node_modules folder under the prefix.\n  When installing locally, this means that you can\n  require("packagename") to load its main module, or\n  require("packagename/lib/path/to/sub/module") to load other modules.Global installs on Unix systems go to {prefix}/lib/node_modules.\n  Global installs on Windows go to {prefix}/node_modules (that is, no\n  lib folder.)Scoped packages are installed the same way, except they are grouped\n  together in a sub-folder of the relevant node_modules folder with the\n  name of that scope prefix by the @ symbol, e.g. npm install\n  @myorg/package would place the package in\n  {prefix}/node_modules/@myorg/package. See scope for more details.If you wish to require() a package, then install it locally.You can get your {prefix} with npm config get prefix. (Useful when you installed node with nvm).Read about locally.\nRead about globally.In Ubuntu 14.04 they are installed at /usr/lib/node_modulesNot direct answer but may help ....The npm also has a cache folder, which can be found by running npm config get cache (%AppData%/npm-cache on Windows). The npm modules are first downloaded here and then copied to npm global folder (%AppData%/npm/Roaming on Windows) or project specific folder (your-project/node_modules).So if you want to track npm packages, and some how, the list of all downloaded npm packages (if the npm cache is not cleaned)  have a look at this folder. The folder structure is as {cache}/{name}/{version}This may help also https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/cacheAs the other answers say, the best way is to do However, if you have a large number of npm packages installed, the output of this command could be very long and a big pain to scroll up (sometimes it\'s not even possible to scroll that far back).In this case, pipe the out to the more program, like thisFrom the docs:In npm 1.0, there are two ways to install things:globally \xe2\x80\x94- This drops modules in {prefix}/lib/node_modules, and puts executable files in {prefix}/bin, where {prefix} is usually\n  something like /usr/local. It also installs man pages in\n  {prefix}/share/man, if they\xe2\x80\x99re supplied.locally \xe2\x80\x94- This installs your package in the current working directory. Node modules go in ./node_modules, executables go in\n  ./node_modules/.bin/, and man pages aren\xe2\x80\x99t installed at all.You can get your {prefix} with npm config get prefix. (Useful when you installed node with nvm).
