I would like to convert tab to spaces in gvim. I added the following codes to my _vimrc:It works to stop at 2 spaces but it still looks like one tab key is inserted (I tried to use h key to count spaces afterwards). Not sure what should I do to make gvim to convert tab to spaces?IIRC, something like:should do the trick. If you already have tabs, then follow it up with a nice global RE to replace them with double spaces.Once you\'ve got expandtab on as per the other answers, the extremely convenient way to convert existing files according to your new settings is:It will work on the current buffer.Tryfor soft tabs.To fix pre-existing tabs:I used two spaces since you already set your tabstop to 2 spaces.Add following lines to your .vimrcOpen a file in vim and press F2\nThe tabs will be converted to 4 spaces and file will be saved automatically.gg=G will reindent the entire file and removes most if not all the tabs I get in files from co-workers. This worked for me:you can see tabs with first doing this:then to make it possible to replace tabs then do this:then now all tabs have been replaced with spaces \nyou can then go back to normal viewing like this :If you want to keep your \\t equal to 8 spaces then consider setting:This will give you two spaces per <TAB> press, but actual \\t in your code will still be viewed as 8 characters.first search for tabs in your file : /^I\n:set expandtab\n:retabwill work.This article has an excellent vimrc script for handling tabs+spaces, and converting in between them.These commands are provided:Space2Tab  Convert spaces to tabs, only in indents.Tab2Space  Convert tabs to spaces, only in indents.RetabIndent    Execute Space2Tab (if \'expandtab\' is set), or Tab2Space (otherwise).Each command accepts an argument that specifies the number of spaces in a tab column. By default, the \'tabstop\' setting is used.Source: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Super_retab#ScriptThis helped me a bit more than the answers here did when I first went searching for a solution.
