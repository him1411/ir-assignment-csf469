What\'s the height of the status bar in Android? Is it always the same?From my measurements it seems that it\'s 25dp, but I\'m not sure if it has the same height on all platforms.(I want to know this to properly implement a fade transition from an activity that doesn\'t have status bar to one that does)this question was answered before...\nHeight of statusbar?Update::ok, the height of the status bar depends on the screen size, for example in a device \nwith 240 X 320 screen size the status bar height is 20px, for a device with 320 X 480 screen size the status bar height is 25px, for a device with 480 x 800 the status bar height must be 38pxso i recommend  to use this script to get the status bar heightOut of all the code samples I\'ve used to get the height of the status bar, the only one that actually appears to work in the onCreate method of an Activity is this:Apparently the actual height of the status bar is kept as an Android resource. The above code can be added to a ContextWrapper class (e.g. an Activity).Found at http://mrtn.me/blog/2012/03/17/get-the-height-of-the-status-bar-in-android/On MDPI devices, the status bar is 25px. We can use this as the base and multiply it by the density (rounded up) to get the status bar height on any device:For reference: ldpi=.75, mdpi=1, hdpi=1.5, xhdpi=2According to Google design guidelines; height of status bar is 24 dp.If you want get status bar height in pixels you can use below method:which can be called from activity with:I\'ve merged some solutions together:another alternative: this also work with the refrence linkI have the same problem of having to get the status bar height in an onCreate. This works for me.Inside the onCreate:See:http://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/DisplayMetrics.html\nhttp://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design.htmlYes when i try it with View it provides the result of 25px.\nHere is the whole code :Official height is 24dp, \nas is stated officially by Google on Android Design webpage. The default height used to be 25dp. With Android Marshmallow (API 23) the height was reduced to 24dp.240x320 - 20px320x480 - 25px480x800+ - 38pxTry this:it didn\'t work for me in the onCreate method for the activity, but did when I put it in an onClickListener and gave me a measurement of 25To solve this, I used a combination approach.\nThis is necessary as on tablets the system bar already subtracts it\'s pixels when display.getHeight() is called.\nSo I first check if a system bar is present, and then Ben Claytons approach, which works fine on phones.  the height of the status bar is 24dp in android 6.0 you can find the answer in the source code: frameworks\\base\\core\\res\\res\\values\\dimens.xmlToggled Fullscreen Solution:This solution may look like a workaround, but it actually accounts for whether your app is fullscreen (aka hiding the status bar) or not:This way, if your app is currently fullscreen, barheight will equal 0.Personally I had to use this to correct absolute TouchEvent coordinates to account for the status bar as so:And that will get the absolute y-coordinate whether the app be fullscreen or not.EnjoyIf you know exactly the size VS heightlikefor example in a device with 320 X 480 screen size the status bar height is 25px, for a device with 480 x 800 the status bar height must be 38pxthen you can just get the width of your view / the screen size you can just use an if else statement to get the height of status barThe reason why the top answer does not work for some people is because you cannot get the dimensions of a view until it is ready to render. Use an OnGlobalLayoutListener to get said dimensions when you actually can:This is the most reliable method.On Android 4.1 and higher, you can set your application\'s content to appear behind the status bar, so that the content doesn\'t resize as the status bar hides and shows. To do this, use SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_FULLSCREEN. You may also need to use SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_STABLE to help your app maintain a stable layout.When you use this approach, it becomes your responsibility to ensure that critical parts of your app\'s UI (for example, the built-in controls in a Maps application) don\'t end up getting covered by system bars. This could make your app unusable. In most cases you can handle this by adding the android:fitsSystemWindows attribute to your XML layout file, set to true. This adjusts the padding of the parent ViewGroup to leave space for the system windows. This is sufficient for most applications.In some cases, however, you may need to modify the default padding to get the desired layout for your app. To directly manipulate how your content lays out relative to the system bars (which occupy a space known as the window\'s "content insets"), override fitSystemWindows(Rect insets). The fitSystemWindows() method is called by the view hierarchy when the content insets for a window have changed, to allow the window to adjust its content accordingly. By overriding this method you can handle the insets (and hence your app\'s layout) however you want.form:\nhttps://developer.android.com/training/system-ui/status.html#behind
