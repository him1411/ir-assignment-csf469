I have a class that must have some static methods. Inside these static methods I need to call the method getClass() to make the following call:However Eclipse tells me:What is the appropriate way to fix this compile time error?Just use TheClassName.class instead of getClass().As for the code example in the question, the standard solution is to reference the class explicitly by its name, and it is even possible to do without getClassLoader() call:This approach still has a back side that it is not very safe against copy/paste errors in case you need to replicate this code to a number of similar classes.And as for the exact question in the headline, there is a trick posted in the adjacent thread:It uses a nested anonymous Object subclass to get hold of the execution context. This trick has a benefit of being copy/paste safe...It may be also worth noting that if this snippet is shaped as a static method of some base class, then currentClass value will always be a reference to that base class rather than to any subclass that may be using that method.In Java7+ you can do this in static methods/fields:I wrestled with this myself.  A nice trick is to use use the current thread to get a ClassLoader when in a static context.  This will work in a Hadoop MapReduce as well.  Other methods work when running locally, but return a null InputStream when used in a MapReduce.Simply use a class literal, i.e. NameOfClass.classgetClass() method is defined in Object class with the following signature:public final Class getClass()Since it is not defined as static, you can not call it within a static code block. See these answers for more information: Q1, Q2, Q3.If you\'re in a static context, then you have to use the class literal expression to get the Class, so you basically have to do like:Foo.classThis type of expression is called Class Literals and they are explained in Java Language Specification Book as follows:A class literal is an expression consisting of the name of a class, interface, array, or primitive type followed by a `.\' and the token class. The type of a class literal is Class. It evaluates to the Class object for the named type (or for void) as defined by the defining class loader of the class of the current instance.You can also find information about this subject on API documentation for Class.Try itOrTry something like this. It works for me. Logg (Class name)
