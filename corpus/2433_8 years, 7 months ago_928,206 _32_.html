I have a few images and their rollover images. Using jQuery, I want to show/hide the rollover image when the onmousemove/onmouseout event happen. All my image names follow the same pattern, like this:Original Image: Image.gif Rollover Image: Imageover.gifI want to insert and remove the "over" portion of image source in the onmouseover and onmouseout event, respectively.  How can I do it using jQuery?To set up on ready:I know you\'re asking about using jQuery, but you can achieve the same effect in browsers that have JavaScript turned off using CSS:There\'s a longer description hereEven better, however, is to use sprites: simple-css-image-rolloverIf you have more than one image and you need something generic that doesn\'t depend on a naming convention.HTMLJavaScriptA generic solution that doesn\'t limit you to "this image" and "that image" only may be to add the \'onmouseover\' and \'onmouseout\' tags to the HTML code itself.HTMLJavaScriptDepending on your setup, maybe something like this would work better (and requires less HTML modification).HTMLJavaScript / jQueryYou may want to change the class of images from first line. If you need more image classes (or different path) you may useand so on.It should work, I didn\'t test it :)I was hoping for an \xc3\xbcber one liner like:If the solution you are looking for is for an animated button, then the best you can do to improve in performance is the combination of sprites and CSS. A sprite is a huge image that contains all the images from your site (header, logo, buttons, and all decorations you have). Each image you have uses an HTTP request, and the more HTTP requests the more time it will take to load.The 0px 0px coordinates will be the left upper corner from your sprites.But if you are developing some photo album with Ajax or something like that, then JavaScript (or any framework) is the best.Have fun!I wrote a small how-to with examples for beginners, Change image with JavaScript (or jQuery). There\'s also an example without using jQuery.Whilst looking for a solution some time back, I found a similar script to the below, which after some tweaking I got working for me.It handles two images, that almost always default to "off", where the mouse is off the image (image-example_off.jpg), and the occasional "on", where for the times the mouse is hovered, the required alternative image (image-example_on.jpg) is displayed.I\'ve made something like the following code :)It works only, when you have a second file named with _hover, for example, facebook.png and facebook_hover.pngAdapted from Richard Ayotte\'s code - \nTo target an img in a ul/li list (found via wrapper div class here), something like this:
