This question already has an answer here:In Mootools, I\'d just run if ($(\'target\')) { ... }.  Does if ($(\'#target\')) { ... } in jQuery work the same way?As the other commenters are suggesting the most efficient way to do it seems to be: If you absolutely must have an exists() function - which will be slower- you can do:Then in your code you can useAs answered hereno, jquery always returns a jquery object regardless if a selector was matched or not.\nYou need to use .lengthif you used:you would imply that chaining was possible when it is not.This would be betterYet another way:I think most of the people replying here didn\'t quite understand the question, or else I might be mistaken.The question is "how to check whether or not a selector exists in jQuery."Most people have taken this for "how to check whether an element exists in the DOM using jQuery."
