I have a Parallel.ForEach() async loop with which I download some webpages. My bandwidth is limited so I can download only x pages per time but Parallel.ForEach executes whole list of desired webpages.Is there a way to limit thread number or any other limiter while running Parallel.ForEach?Demo code:The real task has nothing to do with webpages, so creative web crawling solutions won\'t help.You can specify a MaxDegreeOfParallelism in a ParallelOptions parameter:MSDN: Parallel.ForEachMSDN: ParallelOptions.MaxDegreeOfParallelismYou can use ParallelOptions and set MaxDegreeOfParallelism to limit the number of concurrent threads :Use another overload of Parallel.Foreach that takes a ParallelOptions instance, and set MaxDegreeOfParallelism to limit how many instances execute in parallel.And for the VB.net users (syntax is weird and difficult to find)...
