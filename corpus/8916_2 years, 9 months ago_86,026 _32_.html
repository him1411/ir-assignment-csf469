I\'ve seen the writeup on using yum to install the dependencies, and then installing Node.JS & NPM from source.  While this does work, I feel like Node.JS and NPM should both be in a public repo somewhere.How can I install Node.JS and NPM in one command on AWS Amazon Linux?Stumbled onto this, was strangely hard to find again later.  Putting here for posterity:EDIT 3: As of July 2016, EDIT 1 no longer works for nodejs 4 (and EDIT 2 neither). This answer (https://stackoverflow.com/a/35165401/78935) gives a true one-liner for node 4.EDIT 1: If you\'re looking for nodejs 4, please try the EPEL testing repo:EDIT 2: To upgrade from nodejs 0.12 installed through the EPEL repo using the command above, to nodejs 4 from the EPEL testing repo, please follow these steps:The newer packages put the node binaries in /usr/bin, instead of /usr/local/bin.And some background:The option --enablerepo=epel causes yum to search for the packages in the EPEL repository.EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) is open source and free community based repository project from Fedora team which provides 100% high quality add-on software packages for Linux distribution including RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux), CentOS, and Scientific Linux. Epel project is not a part of RHEL/Cent OS but it is designed for major Linux distributions by providing lots of open source packages like networking, sys admin, programming, monitoring and so on. Most of the epel packages are maintained by Fedora repo.Via http://www.tecmint.com/how-to-enable-epel-repository-for-rhel-centos-6-5/Like @voltrevo, the accepted answer gave me the outdated v0.10.Here is another way to do it that works very well:You can also replace the 6.x with another version, such as 4.x, etc.You can see all available versions on the NodeSource Github page, and pull from there as well if desired.The accepted answer gave me node 0.10.36 and npm 1.3.6 which are very out of date. I grabbed the latest linux-x64 tarball from the nodejs downloads page and it wasn\'t too difficult to install: https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/.Now upzip the tar you just downloaded -  Run this command and then also add it to your .bashrc:(example : export PATH ="$PATH:/home/ec2-user/mydirectory/node/node4.5.0-linux-x64/bin")And update npm (only once, don\'t add to .bashrc):Note that the -g there which means global, really means global to that npm instance which is the instance we just installed and is limited to the current user. This will apply to all packages that npm installs \'globally\'.The procedure that worked for me (following these rather old instructions with a few updates):  Notes:For the v4 LTS version use:For the Node.js v6 use:I also ran into some problems when trying to install native addons on Amazon Linux. I you want to do this you should also install build tools:Simple install with NVM...I just came across this. I tried a few of the more popular answers, but in the end, what worked for me was Amazon\'s quick setup guide. Tutorial: Setting Up Node.js on an Amazon EC2 Instance The gist of the tutorial is:Hopefully this helps the next person.sudo yum install nodejs npm --enablerepo=epel works for Amazon Linux AMI.\n\ncurl --silent --location https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | bash -\nyum -y install nodejs\n\nworks for RedHat.
