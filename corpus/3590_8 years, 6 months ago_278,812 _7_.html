Is there a way of finding the absolute position of an element, i.e. relative to the start of the window, using jQuery?.offset() will return the offset position of an element as a simple object, eg:You can use this return value to position other elements at the same spot:Note that $(element).offset() tells you the position of an element relative to the document. This works great in most circumstances, but in the case of position:fixed you can get unexpected results.If your document is longer than the viewport and you have scrolled vertically toward the bottom of the document, then your position:fixed element\'s offset() value will be greater than the expected value by the amount you have scrolled. If you are looking for a value relative to the viewport (window), rather than the document on a position:fixed element, you can subtract the document\'s scrollTop() value from the fixed element\'s offset().top value. Example: $("#el").offset().top - $(document).scrollTop()If the position:fixed element\'s offset parent is the document, you want to read parseInt($.css(\'top\')) instead.
