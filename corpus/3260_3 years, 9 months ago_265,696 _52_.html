I try to remove a Windows Service with sc delete <service name>, and encounter the following error:[SC] DeleteService FAILED 1072:The specified service has been marked for deletion.What I\'ve already done:Stopped the service, obviously. The sc queryex "<service name>" gives the following result:Ensured that Microsoft Management Console is closed (taskkill /F /IM mmc.exe),Ensured that Event Viewer is closed,Removed the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\<service name> from the registry.Due to this removal, services.msc still shows the service (with a name, but no status or startup type), but the description is \xe2\x80\x9c<Failed to Read Description. Error Code: 2 >\xe2\x80\x9d. When attempting to view the properties, \xe2\x80\x9cThe system cannot find the file specified.\xe2\x80\x9d is shown five times.The problem persists.What is the next step?There may be several causes which lead to the service being stuck in \xe2\x80\x9cmarked for deletion\xe2\x80\x9d.SysInternals\' Process Explorer is opened. Closing it should lead to automatic removal of the service.Task Manager is opened.Microsoft Management Console (MMC) is opened. To ensure all instances are closed, run taskkill /F /IM mmc.exe.Services console is opened. This is the same as the previous point, since Services console is hosted by MMC.Event Viewer is opened. Again, this is the same as the first point.The key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\{service name} exists.Someone else is logged into the server and has one of the previously mentioned applications opened.An instance of Visual Studio used to debug the service is open.This can also be caused by leaving the Services console open.  Windows won\'t actually delete the service until it is closed.In my case it worked after closing the Services. Check if the Services.msc is open, if yes close it and check any process of service is found in Task Manager.hi guys i had the same problem  finaly i decide to kill service procces for it try below steps1- get procces id of service withsc queryex <service name>2- kil procces with taskkill /F /PID <Service PID>Deleting registry keys as suggested above got my service stuck in the stopping state. The following procedure worked for me: open task manager > select services tab > select the service > right click and select "go to process" > right click on the process and select End processService should be gone after thatIn my case, it was caused by unhandled exception while creating eventLog source. Use try catch to pin point the cause.Discovered one more thing to check - look in Task  manager - if other users are connected to this box, even if they are \'disconnected\' you have to actually sign them out to get the service to finally delete.In my case, I execute taskkill /f /im dongleserver.exe , \nwhere dongleserver.exe is my program\'s exe file.Then I can able to reinstall my program already.Closing every window that was currently open followed by running the following command solved the issue for me:It seems that on Windows versions later than Windows 7 (unverified, but by experience latest with Windows Server 2012 R2), the Service Control Manager (SCM) is more strict.While on Windows 7 it just spawns another process, it is now checking whether the service process is still around and may return ERROR_SERVICE_MARKED_FOR_DELETE (1072) for any subsequent call to CreateService/DeleteService even if the service appears to be stopped.I am talking Windows API code here, but I want to clearly outline what\'s happening, so this sequence may lead to mentioned error:The reason a service process is still around after it already has reported its SERVICE_STOPPED state isn\'t surprising. It\'s a regular process, whose main thread is \'stuck\' in its call to the StartServiceCtrlDispatcher API, so it first reacts to a stop control action, but then has to execute its remaining code sequence.It\'s kind of unfortunate the SCM/OS isn\'t handling this properly for us.\nA programmatic solution is kinda simple and accurate: obtain the service executable\'s process handle before stopping the service, then wait for this handle to become signaled.If approaching the issue from a system administration perspective the solution is also to wait for the service process to disappear completely.If the steps provided by @MainMa didn\'t work follow following stepsStep 1 Try killing the process from windows task manager or using taskkill /F /PID  . You can find pid of the process by command \'sc queryex \'. Try next step if you still can\'t uninstall.Step 2 If above Run Autoruns for Windows Search for service by name and delete results.The main reason for the error is the process is not stopped.\nto resolve it  start task manager go to services and see if you are still able to see your service than go to the process of that service and end process. Than the issue will be solved completely.I was having this issue when I was using Application Verifier to verify my win service. Even after I closed App Ver my service was blocked from deletion. Only removing the service from App Ver resolved the issue and service was deleted right away. Looks like some process still using your service after you tried to delete one.This is what worked for me:\n- I hit the same issue: my service was stuck in \'marked for deletion\'.\n- I opened services.msc\n  My service did show up as running, although it was already uninstalled.\n- I clicked Stop\n  Received an error message, saying the service is not in a state to receive control messages.\n  Nevertheless, the service was stopped.\n- Closed services.msc.\n- Reopened services.msc.\n  - The service was gone (no longer showing in the list of services).(The environment was Windows 7.)I tried to find the service in the process list but with no luck. At last I restarted the server and the service was gone
