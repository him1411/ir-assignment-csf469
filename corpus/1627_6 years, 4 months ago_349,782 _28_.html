Suppose I have any variable, which is defined as follows:I want a function which checks if the type of the variable is function-like. i.e. :How can I check if the variable \'a\' is of type function in the way defined above?Sure underscore\'s way is more efficient, but the best way to check, when efficiency isn\'t an issue, is written on underscore\'s page linked by @Paul Rosania.Inspired by underscore, the final isFunction function is as follows:Underscore.js uses a more elaborate but highly performant test:See: http://jsperf.com/alternative-isfunction-implementationsEDIT: updated tests suggest that typeof might be faster, see http://jsperf.com/alternative-isfunction-implementations/4There are several ways so I will summarize them all@grandecomplex: There\'s a fair amount of verbosity to your solution. It would be much clearer if written like this:If you use jquery you can use the isFunction:ReferenceTry instanceof: It seems that all functions inherit from the "Function" class:An other simply way:I found that when testing native browser functions in IE8, using toString, instanceof, and typeof did not work. Here is a method that works fine in IE8 (as far as I know):Alternatively, you can check for native functions using:Though, I have read somewhere that this will not always work in IE7 and below.Since node v0.11 you can use the standard util function :I think you can just define a flag on the Function prototype and check if the instance you want to test inherited thatdefine a flag:and then check if it exist The downside is that another prototype can define the same flag and then it\'s worthless, but if you have full control over the included modules it is the easiest way If you use Lodash you can do it with _.isFunction.This method returns true if value is a function, else false.The below seems to work for me as well (tested from node.js):you should use typeOf operator in js.The solution as some previous answers has shown is to use typeof. the following is a code snippet In NodeJs,
