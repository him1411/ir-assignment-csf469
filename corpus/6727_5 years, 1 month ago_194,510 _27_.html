How do I download a file with Node.js without using third-party libraries?I don\'t need anything special. I only want to download a file from a given URL, and then save it to a given directory.You can create an HTTP GET request and pipe its response into a writable file stream:If you want to support gathering information on the command line--like specifying a target file or directory, or URL--check out something like Commander.Don\'t forget to handle errors! The following code is based on Augusto Roman\'s answer.As Brandon Tilley said, but with the appropriate control flow:Without waiting for the finish event, naive scripts may end up with an incomplete file.Edit: Thanks to @Augusto Roman for pointing out that cb should be passed to file.close, not called explicitly.Speaking of handling errors, it\'s even better listening to request errors too. I\'d even validate by checking response code. Here it\'s considered success only for 200 response code, but other codes might be good. Despite the relative simplicity of this code, I would advise to use the request module as it handles much more protocols (hello HTTPS!) which aren\'t natively supported by http.That would be done like so:gfxmonk\'s answer has a very tight data race between the callback and the file.close() completing.  file.close() actually takes a callback that is called when the close has completed.  Otherwise, immediate uses of the of the file may fail (very rarely!).A complete solution is:Without waiting for the finish event, naive scripts may end up with an incomplete file. Without scheduling the cb callback via close, you may get a race between accessing the file and the file actually being ready.The following code is based on Brandon Tilley\'s answer :Don\'t make file when you get an error, and prefere to use timeout to close your request after X secondes.for those who came in search of  es6-style promise based way, I guess it would be something like: You can use https://github.com/douzi8/ajax-request#downloadVince Yuan\'s code is great but it seems to be something wrong.Path : img\ntype : jpg \nrandom uniqid (or)Download using promise, which resolve a readable stream. put extra logic to handle the redirect.Maybe node.js has changed, but it seems there are some problems with the other solutions (using node v8.1.2):Below is a modified solution (using ES6 and promises) which handles these problems.We can use the download node module and its very simple, please refer below\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/downloadTo Download text file use this to download any file use below
