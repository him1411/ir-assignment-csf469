What is Unit test, Integration Test, Smoke test, Regression Test and what are the differences between them? And Which tools can I use for each of them? For example I use JUnit and NUnit for Unit testing and Integration Testing. Are there any Smoke Test or Regression Test tools?Unit test: Specify and test one point of the contract of single method of a class. This should have a very narrow and well defined scope. Complex dependencies and interactions to the outside world are stubbed or mocked.Integration test: Test the correct inter-operation of multiple subsystems. There is whole spectrum there, from testing integration between two classes, to testing integration with the production environment.Smoke test (aka Sanity check): A simple integration test where we just check that when the system under test is invoked it returns normally and does not blow up. It is an analogy with electronics, where the first test occurs when powering up a circuit: if it smokes, it\'s bad.Regression test: A test that was written when a bug was fixed. It ensures that this specific bug will not occur again. The full name is "non-regression test". It can also be a test made prior to changing an application to make sure the application provides the same outcome.To this, I will add:Acceptance test: Test that a feature or use case is correctly implemented. It is similar to an integration test, but with a focus on the use case to provide rather than on the components involved.System test: Test that tests a system as a black box. Dependencies on other systems are often mocked or stubbed during the test (otherwise it would be more of an integration test).Pre-flight check: Tests that are repeated in a production-like environment, to alleviate the \'builds on my machine\' syndrome. Often this is realized by doing an acceptance or smoke test in a production like environmentPS: People claim smoke testing comes from plumbing where smoke is pumped in the system of pipes before it\'s connected to the water supply. If any smoke comes out, the pipes are not properly sealed. It might be more historically accurate, but I find it is less funny.Everyone will have slightly different definitions, and there are often grey areas. However:A new test category I\'ve just become aware of is the: Examples might be:apocryphal historical trivia: "smoke testing" comes from submarine engineering (inherited from plumbing) where literal smoke would be pumped into the hull to see if any of it came out again, which would be rather a dramatic failure for a submarine!Unit test: Verifying that particular component (i.e.,class) created or modified functions as designed. This test can be manual or automated but does not move beyond the boundary of the component.Integration test: Verifying that the interaction of particular components function as designed. Integration tests can be performed at the unit level or the system level. These tests can be manual or automated.Regression test: Verifying that new defects are not introduced into existing code. These tests can be manual or automated.Depending upon your SDLC (waterfall, rup, agile, etc) particular tests may be performed in \'phases\' or may all be performed, more or less, at the same time. For example, unit testing may be limited to developers who then turn the code over to testers for integration and regression testing. However another approach might have developers doing unit testing and some level of integration and regression testing (using a TDD approach along with continuous integration and automated unit and regression tests).The tool set will depend largely on the codebase but there are many open source tools for unit testing (JUnit). HP\'s (mercury) QTP or Borland\'s Silktest are both tools for automated integration and regression testing.unit test: testing of individual module or independent component in an application is known to be unit testing , the unit testing will be done by developer.integration test: combining all the modules and testing the application to verify the communication and the data flow between the modules are working properly or not , this testing also performed by developers.smoke test  IN smoke test they check the application in shallow and wide manner, In smoke testing they  check the main functionality of the application , if there is any blocker issue in the application they will report to developer team , and developing team will fix it and rectify the defect, and give it back to testing team and now  testing team will check all the modules to verify tat changes made in one module will impact the other module or not. IN SMOKE TESTING the test cases are scripted regression testing executing the same test cases repeatedly to ensure tat the unchanged module does not cause any defect. REGRESSION TESTING comes under functional testing"A regression test re-runs previous tests against the changed software to ensure that the changes made in the current software do not affect the functionality of the existing software."Unit test: Verifying that particular component (i.e.,class) created or modified functions as designed. This test can be manual or automated but does not move beyond the boundary of the component.Integration test: Verifying that the interaction of particular components function as designed. Integration tests can be performed at the unit level or the system level. These tests can be manual or automated.Regression test: Verifying that new defects are not introduced into existing code. These tests can be manual or automated.Depending upon your SDLC (waterfall, rup, agile, etc) particular tests may be performed in \'phases\' or may all be performed, more or less, at the same time. For example, unit testing may be limited to developers who then turn the code over to testers for integration and regression testing. However another approach might have developers doing unit testing and some level of integration and regression testing (using a TDD approach along with continuous integration and automated unit and regression tests).One type of test that seems to be worth mentioning in this thread is stress/performance/load tests which could be simply put as finding out the limits beyond which a certain piece of software breaks. \nNote that in terms of tooling it is essential to precisely determine the scope of what one proposes to stress tests from a system perspective. \nFor instance in the case of a "web application" stress testing can include in its scope the web server application itself and so the tooling could intervene on that end.\nHere is a nice post about http load testing Unit testing is directed at the smallest part of the implementation possible. In java this means you are testing a single class. If the class depends on other classes these are faked.When your test calls more than one class, its an integration test.Full test suites can take a long time to run, so after a change many teams run some quick to complete tests to detect significant breakages. For example, you have broken the URIs to essential resources. These are the smoke tests.Regression tests run on every build and allow you to refactor effectively by catching what you break. Any kind of test can be regression test, but I find unit tests are most helpful finding the source of fault. Answer from one of the best Websites for Software Testing Techniques:Types of Software Testing \xe2\x80\x93 Complete List Click HereIt\'s quite a long description, I\'m not going to paste it here: but it may be helpful for someone who wants to know all the testing techniques.Hope it\'ll be helpful :)Unit Testing:-\nunit testing is usually done by the developers side,where as testers are partly evolved in this type of testing where testing is done unit by unit.\nIn java Junit test cases can also be possible to test whether the written code is perfectly designed or not.Integration Testing:-\nThis type of testing is possible after the unit testing when all/some components are integrated.This type of testing will make sure that when components are integrated,do they affect each others working capabilities or functionalists.Smoke Testing:-\nThis type of testing is done at the last when system is integrated successfully and ready to go on production server.\nThis type of testing will make sure that every important functionality from start to end is working fine and system is ready to deploy on production server.Regression Testing:-\nThis type of testing is important to test that unintended/unwanted defects are not present in the system when developer fixed some issues.\nThis testing also make sure that all the bugs are successfully solved and because of that no other issues are occurred.Some good answers already but I would like further refine them:Unit testing is the only form of white box testing here. The others are black box testing. White box testing means that you know the input, you know the inner workings of the mechanism and can inspect it and you know the output. With black box testing you only know what the input is and what the output should be. So clearly unit testing is the only white box testing here.Regression test - Is a type of SW testing where we try to cover or check around the bug Fix. the functionality around the bug fix should not get changed or altered due to the Fix provided. Issues found in such process are called as Regression Issues.Smoke Testing : Is a kind of testing done to decide whether to accept the Build/Software for further QA testing .Unit testing: Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually and independently scrutinized for proper operation. Unit testing is often automated but it can also be done manually.Integration testing: (sometimes called integration and testing, abbreviated I&T) is the phase in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group. It occurs after unit testing and before validation testing.System testing: is most often the final test to verify that the system to be delivered meets the specification and its purpose.Regression test: after implementing new features or bug fixes, you re-test scenarios which worked in the past. Here you cover the possibility in which your new features break existing features.Smoke Testing: The objective is not to perform exhaustive testing, but to verify that the critical functionalities of the system is working fine. For Example a typical smoke test would be - Verify that the application launches successfully, Check that the GUI is responsive, etc.Unit Testing: It always performs by developer after their development done to find out issue from their testing side before they make any requirement ready for QA.Integration Testing: It means tester have to verify module to sub module verification when some data/function output are drive to one module to other module. Or in your system if using third party tool which using your system data for integrate.Smoke Testing: tester performed to verify system for high-level testing and trying to find out show stopper bug before changes or code goes live.Regression Testing: Tester performed regression for verification of existing functionality due to changes  implemented in system for newly enhancement or changes in system.
