I ran into an issue in my Rails 4 app while trying to organize JS files "the rails way". They were previously scattered across different views. I organized them into separate files and compile them with the assets pipeline. However, I just learned that jQuery\'s "ready" event doesn\'t fire on subsequent clicks when turbo-linking is turned on. The first time you load a page it works. But when you click a link, anything inside the ready( function($) { won\'t get executed (because the page doesn\'t actually load again). Good explanation: here.So my question is: What is the right way to ensure that jQuery events work properly while turbo-links are on? Do you wrap the scripts in a Rails-specific listener? Or maybe rails has some magic that makes it unnecessary? The docs are a bit vague on how this should work, especially with respect to loading multiple files via the manifest(s) like application.js.Here\'s what I do...\nCoffeeScript:last line listens for page load which is what turbo links will trigger.Edit...adding Javascript version (per request):Edit 2...For Rails 5 (Turbolinks 5) page:load becomes turbolinks:load and will be even fired on initial load. So we can just do the following:I just learned of another option for solving this problem. If you load the jquery-turbolinks gem it will bind the Rails Turbolinks events to the document.ready events so you can write your jQuery in the usual way. You just add jquery.turbolinks right after jquery in the js manifest file (by default: application.js).Recently I found the most clean and easy to understand way of dealing with it:OREDIT\nIf you have delegated events bound to the document, make sure you attach them outside of the ready function, otherwise they will get rebound on every page:load event (causing the same functions to be run multiple times). For example, if you have any calls like this:Take them out of the ready function, like this:Delegated events bound to the document do not need to be bound on the ready event.Found this in the Rails 4 documentation, similar to DemoZluk\'s solution but slightly shorter:ORIf you have external scripts that call $(document).ready() or if you can\'t be bothered rewriting all your existing JavaScript, then this gem allows you to keep using $(document).ready() with TurboLinks: https://github.com/kossnocorp/jquery.turbolinksAs per the new rails guides, the correct way is to do the following:or, in coffeescript:Do not listen to the event $(document).ready and only one event will be fired. No surprises, no need to use the jquery.turbolinks gem.This works with rails 4.2 and above, not only rails 5.NOTE: See @SDP\'s answer for a clean, built-in solutionI fixed it as follows:make sure you include application.js before the other app dependent js files get included by changing the include order as follows:Define a global function that handles the binding in application.jsNow you can bind stuff like:None of the above works for me, I solved this by not using jQuery\'s $(document).ready, but use addEventListener instead.I figured I\'d leave this here for those upgrading to Turbolinks 5: the easiest way to fix your code is to go from:to:Reference: https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks/issues/9#issuecomment-184717346Instead of using a variable to save the "ready" function and bind it to the events, you might want to trigger the ready event whenever page:load triggers.Here\'s what I have done to ensure things aren\'t executed twice:I find using the jquery-turbolinks gem or combining $(document).ready and $(document).on("page:load") or using $(document).on("page:change") by itself behaves unexpectedly--especially if you\'re in development. I found the following article which worked great for me and details the use of the following:Either use the or use jQuery\'s .on function to achieve the same effectsee here for more details: http://srbiv.github.io/2013/04/06/rails-4-my-first-run-in-with-turbolinks.htmlmaybe you can use like this to use "ready", it just like close your turbolink.You have to use:from turbolinks doc.First, install jquery-turbolinks gem. And then, don\'t forget to move your included Javascript files from end of body of your application.html.erb to its <head>.As described here, if you have put the application javascript link in the footer for speed optimization reasons, you will need to move it into the  tag so that it loads before the content in the  tag. This solution worked for me.Tested so many solution finally came to this.\nThis many your code is definitely not called twice.
