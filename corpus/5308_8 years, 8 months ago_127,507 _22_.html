What is the simplest way of testing if an object implements a given interface in C#? (Answer to this question \nin Java)orUsing the is or as operators is the correct way if you know the interface type at compile time and have an instance of the type you are testing. Something that no one else seems to have mentioned is Type.IsAssignableFrom:I think this is much neater than looking through the array returned by GetInterfaces and has the advantage of working for classes as well.For the instance:For the class:Check if typeof(MyClass).GetInterfaces() contains the interface.A variation on @AndrewKennan\'s answer I ended up using recently for types obtained at runtime:In addition to testing using the "is" operator, you can decorate your methods to make sure that variables passed to it implement a particular interface, like so:I\'m not sure which version of .Net this was implemented in so it may not work in your version.What worked for me is:Assert.IsNotNull(typeof (YourClass).GetInterfaces().SingleOrDefault(i => i == typeof (ISomeInterface)));Recently I tried using Andrew Kennan\'s answer and it didn\'t work for me for some reason. I used this instead and it worked (note: writing the namespace might be required).I usedAssert.IsTrue(myObject is ImyInterface); for a test in my unit test which tests that myObject is an object which has implemented my interface ImyInterface.This Post is a good answer.This is a simple sample:  orThis should work :But nice too :Or even (not very elegant) :
