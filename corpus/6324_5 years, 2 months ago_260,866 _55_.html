I have a big object I want to convert to JSON and send. However it has circular structure. I want to toss whatever circular references exist and send whatever can be stringified. How do I do that?Thanks.I want to stringify obj into:Use JSON.stringify with a custom replacer. For example:The replacer in this example is not 100% correct (depending on your definition of "duplicate"). In the following case, a value is discarded:But the concept stands: Use a custom replacer, and keep track of the parsed object values.In Node.js, you can use util.inspect(object). It automatically replaces circular links with "[Circular]".I really liked Trindaz\'s solution - more verbose, however it had some bugs. I fixed them for whoever likes it too.Plus, I added a length limit on my cache objects. If the object I am printing is really big - I mean infinitely big - I want to limit my algorithm.  Note that there is also a JSON.decycle method implemented by Douglas Crockford. See his\ncycle.js. This allows you to stringify almost any standard structure:You can also recreate original object with retrocycle method. So you don\'t have to remove cycles from objects to stringify them.However this will not work for DOM Nodes (which are typical cause of cycles in real life use-cases). For example this will throw:I\'ve made a fork to solve that problem (see my cycle.js fork). This should work fine:I\'d recommend checking out json-stringify-safe from @isaacs-- it\'s used in NPM.BTW- if you\'re not using Node.js, you can just copy and paste lines 4-27 from the relevant part of the source code.To install:To use:This yields:Note that, just like with the vanilla JSON.stringify function as @Rob W mentioned, you can also customize the sanitization behavior by passing in a "replacer" function as the second argument to stringify().  If you find yourself needing a simple example of how to do this, I just wrote a custom replacer which coerces errors, regexps, and functions into human-readable strings here.just do then in your js fileYou could also do https://github.com/WebReflection/circular-jsonNOTE: I have nothing to do with this package. But I do use it for this.For future googlers searching for a solution to this problem when you don\'t know the keys of all circular references, you could use a wrapper around the JSON.stringify function to rule out circular references. See an example script at https://gist.github.com/4653128.The solution essentially boils down to keeping a reference to previously printed objects in an array, and checking that in a replacer function before returning a value. It\'s more constrictive than only ruling out circular references, because it also rules out ever printing an object twice, one of the side affects of which is to avoid circular references.Example wrapper:Use the JSON.stringify method with a replacer. Read this documentation for more information. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc836459%28v=vs.94%29.aspxFigure out a way to populate the replacement array with cyclic references. You can use the typeof method to find if an the property is of type \'object\' ( reference ) and an exact equality check ( === ) to verify circular reference.evaluates to:with the function:I know this is an old question, but I\'d like to suggest an NPM package I\'ve created called smart-circular, which works differently from the other ways proposed. It\'s specially useful if you\'re using big and deep objects. Some features are:Replacing circular references or simply repeated structures inside the object by the path leading to its first occurrence (not just the string [circular]);By looking for circularities in a breadth-first search, the package ensures this path is as small as possible, which is important when dealing with very big and deep objects, where the paths can get annoyingly long and difficult to follow (the custom replacement in JSON.stringify does a DFS);Allows personalised replacements, handy to simplify or ignore less important parts of the object;Finally, the paths are written exactly in the way necessary to access the field referenced, which can help you debugging.I resolve this problem like this:I know this question is old and has lots of great answers but I post this answer because of it\'s new flavor (es5+) an other solution for resolving this issue with these kind of objects is that using this libraryhttps://github.com/ericmuyser/stringyits simple and you can in a few simple step solve this.I found circular-json library on github and it worked well for my problem.Some good features I found useful:Based on the other answers I end up with the following code. It works pretty well with circular references, objects with custom constructors.From the given object to be serialized, Github Link - DecycledJSONExample Usage 1:Example Usage 2:If results in a TypeError: cyclic object valueThen you may want to print like this:
