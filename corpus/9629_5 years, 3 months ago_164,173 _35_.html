possible duplicate : android-singleline-true-not-working-for-edittextI want to make the above EditText to have only single line. Even if the user presses "enter" the cursor should not get down to the second line. Can anybody help me doing that?Use android:maxLines="1" and android:inputType="text"You forgot the android:maxLines attribute. And refer for android:inputType With your example, below will give this result: Using android:singleLine="true" is deprecated.Just add your input type and set maxline to 1 and everything will work fineandroid:singleLine is now deprecated. From the documentation:This constant was deprecated in API level 3.This attribute is deprecated. Use maxLines instead to change the layout of a static text, and use the textMultiLine flag in the inputType attribute instead for editable text views (if both singleLine and inputType are supplied, the inputType flags will override the value of singleLine). So you could just set android:inputType="textEmailSubject" or any other value that matches the content of the field.You must add this line in your EditText in xml:Add the above code to have a single line in EditText tag in your layout.This constant was deprecated in API level 3.This attribute is deprecated.

Please add these attributes to your EditText for an EditText to be single line.I have done this in the past with android:singleLine="true" and then adding a listener for the "enter" key:Include  android:singleLine="true"Everyone\'s showing the XML way, except one person showed calling EditText\'s setMaxLines method.  However, when I did that, it didn\'t work.  One thing that did work for me was setting the input type.This allows A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and special characters, but does not allow enter to be pressed.  When you press enter, it\'ll go to the next GUI component, if applicable in your application.You may also want to set the maximum number of characters that can be put into that EditText, or else it\'ll push whatever\'s to the right of it off the screen, or just start trailing off the screen itself.  You can do this like this:This sets the max characters to 8 in that EditText.  Hope all this helps you.This will work for the EditText:Then I would set a max length for the input text:Those are the 2 that are needed now.In order to restrict you just need to set the single line option on "true".use    Use Below Code instead of your codeThe @Aleks G OnKeyListener() works really well, but I ran it from MainActivity and so had to modify it slightly:I hope this helps anyone trying to do the same.Also it\'s important to pay attention if the property android:inputType is textMultiLine. If so, the properties android:singleLine, android:imeOptions, android:ellipsize and android maxLines will be ignored and your EditText will accepted MultiLines anyway.Add this line to your edittextandroid:inputType="text"Programatically:As  android:singleLine="true" is now Depreciated so useUse maxLines instead to change the layout of a static text, and use the textMultiLine flag in the inputType attribute instead for editable text views (if both singleLine and inputType are supplied, the inputType flags will override the value of singleLine).
