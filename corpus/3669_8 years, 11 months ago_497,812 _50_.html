I have an ArrayList of Strings, and I want to remove repeated strings from it. How can I do this?If you don\'t want duplicates in a Collection, you should consider why you\'re using a Collection that allows duplicates. The easiest way to remove repeated elements is to add the contents to a Set (which will not allow duplicates) and then add the Set back to the ArrayList:Of course, this destroys the ordering of the elements in the ArrayList.Although converting the ArrayList to a HashSet effectively removes duplicates, if you need to preserve insertion order, I\'d rather suggest you to use this variantThen, if you need to get back a List reference, you can use again the conversion constructor.In Java 8:Please note that the hashCode-equals contract for list members should be respected for the filtering to work properly.If you don\'t want duplicates, use a Set instead of a List. To convert a List to a Set you can use the following code:If really necessary you can use the same construction to convert a Set back into a List.Here\'s a way that doesn\'t affect your list ordering:l1 is the original list, and l2 is the list whithout repeated items\n(Make sure YourClass has the equals method acording to what you want to stand for equality)There is also ImmutableSet from Guava as an option (here is the documentation):It is possible to remove duplicates from arraylist without using HashSet or one more arraylist. Try this code..Output isJava 8 streams provide a very simple way to remove duplicate elements from a list. Using the distinct method.\nIf we have a list of cities and we want to remove duplicates from that list it can be done in a single line - How to remove duplicate elements from an arraylistSuppose we have a list of String like:Then we can remove duplicate elements in in multiple ways.Note: If we want to maintain the insertion order then we need to use LinkedHashSet in place of HashSet.Probably a bit overkill, but I enjoy this kind of isolated problem. :)This code uses a temporary Set (for the uniqueness check) but removes elements directly inside the original list. Since element removal inside an ArrayList can induce a huge amount of array copying, the remove(int)-method is avoided.While we\'re at it, here\'s a version for LinkedList (a lot nicer!):Use the marker interface to present a unified solution for List:EDIT: I guess the generics-stuff doesn\'t really add any value here.. Oh well. :)this can solve the problem:You can also do it this way, and preserve order:If you\'re willing to use a third-party library, you can use the method distinct() in Eclipse Collections (formerly GS Collections).The advantage of using distinct() instead of converting to a Set and then back to a List is that distinct() preserves the order of the original List, retaining the first occurrence of each element. It\'s implemented by using both a Set and a List.If you cannot convert your original List into an Eclipse Collections type, you can use ListAdapter to get the same API.Note: I am a committer for Eclipse Collections.This three lines of code can remove the duplicated element from ArrayList or any collection.When you are filling the ArrayList, use a condition for each element. For example:We will get an array {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}If you want to preserve your Order then it is best to use LinkedHashSet.\nBecause if you want to pass this List to an Insert Query by Iterating it, the order would be preserved.Try thisThis conversion will be very helpful when you want to return a List but not a Set.Code:Note: Definitely, there will be memory overhead.As said before, you should use a class implementing Set interface instead of List to be sure of unicity of elements. If you have to keep the order of elements, the SortedSet interface can then be used ; the TreeSet class implements that interface.LinkedHashSet will do the trick.//output: 5,1,2,3,4If you want to remove duplicates from ArrayList means find the below logic,The @jonathan-stafford solution is OK. But this don\'t preserve the list order.If you want preserve the list order you have to use this:It\'s only to complete the answer. Very good!Here is my answer without using any other data structure like set or hashmap etc.Would something like this work better ? }That should maintain the order and also not be quadratic in run time.
