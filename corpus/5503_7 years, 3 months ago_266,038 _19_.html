This question already has an answer here:I have seen that chrome puts a thicker border on :focus but it kind of looks off in my case where I\'ve used border-radius also. Is there anyway to remove that? You should be able to remove it using but keep in mind this is potentially bad for usability: It will be hard to tell whether an element is focused, which can suck when you walk through all a form\'s elements using the Tab key - you should reflect somehow when an element is focused.I had to do all of the follow to completely remove itTo remove the default focus, use the following in your default .css file :You can then control the focus border color either individually by element, or in the default .css:Obviously replace red with your chosen hex code.You could also leave the border untouched and control the background color (or image) to highlight the field::-)This will definitely work. Orange outline won\'t show up anymore..\nCommon for all tags:Specific to some tag, ex: input tagThis should do the trick.you could just set outline: none; and border to a different color on focus.The simpliest way is to use something like this but note that it may not be that good.I hope you find this useful.Problem is when you already have an outline. Chrome still changes something and it\'s a real pain. I cannot find what to change : \n
