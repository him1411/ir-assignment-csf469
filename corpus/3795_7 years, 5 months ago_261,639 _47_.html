In my iPhone app, I take a picture with the camera, then I want to resize it to 290*390 pixels. I was using this method to resize the image :  It works perfectly, but it\'s an undocumented function, so I can\'t use it anymore with iPhone OS4.  So... what is the simplest way to resize an UIImage ?  The simplest way is to set the frame of your UIImageView and set the contentMode to one of the resizing options.Or you can use this utility method, if you actually need to resize an image:Example usage:Here\'s the Swift version of Paul Lynch\'s answerSwift 3.0 version:Trevor Howard has some UIImage categories that handle resize quite nicely. If nothing else you can use the code as examples. Note: As of iOS 5.1, this answer maybe invalid. See comment below.I\'ve also seen this done as well (which I use on UIButtons for Normal and Selected state since buttons don\'t resize to fit).  Credit goes to whoever the original author was.First make an empty .h and .m file called UIImageResizing.h and UIImageResizing.mInclude that .h file in whatever .m file you\'re going to use the function in and then call it like this:This improvement to Paul\'s code will give you a sharp high res image on an iPhone with a retina display. Otherwise when scaling down it\'s blurry.Here\'s a modification of the category written by iWasRobbed above. It keeps the aspect ratio of the original image instead of distorting it.Here is a simple way:resizedImage is a new image.If you just want an image smaller and don\'t care about exact size: Setting scale to 0.25f will give you a 816 by 612 image from a 8MP camera. Here\'s a category UIImage+Scale for those who needs one.I found a category for UIImage in Apple\'s own examples which does the same trick. Here\'s the link: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/sc2273/Listings/AirDropSample_UIImage_Resize_m.html.You\'ll just have to change the call:in imageWithImage:scaledToSize:inRect: with:In order to consider the alpha channel in the image.If you want to make a thumbnail of a UIImage (with proportional resizing or maybe some cropping involved), check out UIImage+Resize category that allows you to use concise, ImageMagick-like syntax:Why so complicated? I think using system API can achieve the same result:The only gotcha is you should pass inverse of target ratio as the second argument, as according to the document the second parameter specifies the ratio of original image compared to the new scaled one.Proper Swift 3.0 for iOS 10+ solution: Using ImageRenderer and closure syntaxRogerio Chaves answer as a swift extensionAnd also bonusSwift 3.0 with failsafe option (returns the original image in case of error):@Paul Lynch\'s answer is great, but it would change the image ratio. \nif you don`t want to change the image ratio, and still want the new image fit for new size, try this.use this extension[cf Chris] To resize to a desired size:or, equivalently, substitute CGImageGetWidth(...)/DESIREDWIDTHHere my somewhat-verbose Swift codeA more compact version for Swift 4 and iOS 10+:Usage:Swift 2.0 :This is an UIImage extension compatible with Swift 3 and Swift 4 which scales image to given size with an aspect ratioExample usageI\'ve discovered that it\'s difficult to find an answer that you can use out-of-the box in your Swift 3 project. The main problem of other answers that they don\'t honor the alpha-channel of the image. Here is the technique that I\'m using in my projects.Example of usage:This code is a rewrite of Apple\'s extension with added support for images with and without alpha channel.As a further reading I recommend checking this article for different image resizing techniques. Current approach offers decent performance, it operates high-level APIs and easy to understand. I recommend sticking to it unless you find that image resizing is a bottleneck in your performance.Swift 4 answer:(Swift 4 compatible) iOS 10+ and iOS < 10 solution (using UIGraphicsImageRenderer if possible, UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext otherwise)
