I am not able to find the mistake.I am getting a null\nvalue in my file.Controller:View:The Upload method\'s HttpPostedFileBase parameter must have the same name as the the file input.So just change the input to this:Also, you could find the files in Request.Files:Clarifying it.\nModel:Post ActionFinally the Extension method for checking the hasFile View Pagescript fileIn Controlleryou just have to change the name of your input filed because same name is required in parameter and input field name\njust replace this line Your code working fineI think, better way is use HttpPostedFileBase in your controller or API. After this you can simple detect size, type etc. File properties you can find here: MVC3 How to check if HttpPostedFileBase is an imageFor example ImageApi:Hope it help.
