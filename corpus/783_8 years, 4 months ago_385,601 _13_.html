How do I convert an NSString value to NSData?you can take reference from this linkConverting NSString like so will force a trailing \\0 byte, which means NSJSONSerialization:JSONObjectWithData and others will fail unless you remove it.I.e. do and then then feel free to proceed with NSJSONSerialization:JSONObjectWithData.In case of Swift Developer coming here,to convert from NSString / String to NSDataObjective-C:Swift:First off, you should use dataUsingEncoding: instead of going through UTF8String. You only use UTF8String when you need a C string in that encoding.Then, for UTF-16, just pass NSUnicodeStringEncoding instead of NSUTF8StringEncoding in your dataUsingEncoding: message.For Swift 3, you will mostly be converting from String to Data.
