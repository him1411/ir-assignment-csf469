Given this HTML:How do you make them display inline like this:foo bar baznot like this:foo\n  bar\n  baz  That\'s something else then:An inline div is a freak of the web & should be beaten until it becomes a span (at least 9 times out of 10)......answers the original question...Try writing it like this:Having read this question and the answers a couple of times, all I can do is assume that there\'s been quite a bit of editing going on, and my suspicion is that you\'ve been given the incorrect answer based on not providing enough information. My clue comes from the use of br tag.Apologies to Darryl. I read class="inline" as style="display: inline". You have the right answer, even if you do use semantically questionable class names ;-) The miss use of br to provide structural layout rather than for textual layout is far too prevalent for my liking. If you\'re wanting to put more than inline elements inside those divs then you should be floating those divs rather than making them inline.Floated divs:Inline divs:If you\'re after the former, then this is your solution and lose those br tags:note that the width of these divs is fluid, so feel free to put widths on them if you want to control the behavior.Thanks,\nSteveUse display:inline-block with a margin and media query for IE6/7:Just use a wrapper div with "float: left" and put boxes inside also containing float: left:CSS:HTML:<span> ?As mentioned, display:inline is probably what you want.  Some browsers also support inline-blocks.  http://www.quirksmode.org/css/display.html#inlineblockYou should use <span> instead of <div> for correct way of\n  inline. because div is a block level element, and your requirement is for inline-block level elements.Here is html code as per your requirements :     so you\'ve to change display property display:inline-block; forcefullyExample oneExample two you need to clear floatok, for me : I would use spans or float the div left. The only problem with floating is that you have to clear the float afterwards or the containing div must have the overflow style set to autoI know people say this is a terrible idea, but it can in practice be useful if you want to do something like tile images with comments underneath them.  e.g. Picasaweb uses it to display the thumbnails in an album.\nSee for example/demo http://closure-library.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/closure/goog/demos/inline_block_quirks.html ( class goog-inline-block ; I abbreviate it to ib here )Given that CSS, set your div to class ib, and now it\'s magically an inline block element.You need to contain the three divs. Here is an example:CSSNote: border-radius attributes are optional and only work in CSS3 compliant browsers.HTMLNote that the divs \'foo\' \'bar\' and \'baz\' are each held within the \'contain\' div.we can do this likehttp://jsfiddle.net/f8L0y5wx/I just tend to make them fixed widths so that they add up to the total width of the page - probably only works if you are using a fixed width page. Also "float".I think you can use this way without using any css -
