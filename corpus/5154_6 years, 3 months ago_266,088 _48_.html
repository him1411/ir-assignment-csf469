I had asked a question about this earlier, but it didn\'t get answered right and led nowhere.So I\'ve clarified few details on the problem and I would really like to hear your ideas on how could I fix this or what should I try. I have Java 1.6.0.12 installed on my Linux server and the code below runs just perfectly.Today I installed Java 1.6.0.26 on my server user and when I try to run my application, I get the following exception. My guess would be that it has something to do with the Java installation configuration because it works in the first one, but doesn\'t work in the later version.Line 25 is:\nc.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, secretKeySpec);Notes:\n* java.security on server\'s 1.6.0.12 java directory matches almost completely with the 1.6.0.26 java.security file. There are no additional providers in the first one.\n* The previous question is here.Most likely you don\'t have the unlimited strength file installed now.You may need to download this file:Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files 6\nJava Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files 7 DownloadJava Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files 8 DownloadExtract the jar files from the zip and save them in ${java.home}/jre/lib/security/.The JRE/JDK/Java 8 jurisdiction files can be found here:Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files 8 DownloadLike James said above:\nInstall the files in ${java.home}/jre/lib/security/.For JAVA 7 the download link is jce-7-downloadCopy the two downloaded jars in Java\\jdk1.7.0_10\\jre\\lib\\security\nTake a backup of older jars to be on safer side.  For JAVA 8 the download link is jce-8-download\nCopy the downloaded jars in Java\\jdk1.8.0_45\\jre\\lib\\security\nTake a backup of older jars to be on safer side.  "Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files 6"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-6-download-429243.htmlI experienced the same error while using Windows 7 x64, Eclipse, and JDK 1.6.0_30. In the JDK installation folder there is a jre folder. This threw me off at first as I was adding the aforementioned jars to the JDK\'s lib/security folder with no luck. Full path:Download and extract the files contained in the jce folder of this archive into that folder.In Java, by default AES supports a 128 Bit key, if you plans to use 192 Bit or 256 Bit key, java complier will throw  Illegal key size Exception, which you are getting.The solution is as victor & James suggested, you will need to download JCE (Java Cryptography Extension) as per your JRE version,(java6, java7 or java8).The JCE zip contains following JAR:You need to replace these jar form your /jre/lib/security.\n if you are on a unix system the  will probably refer to /home/urs/usr/lib/jvm/java--oracle/Sometimes just replacing local_policy.jar, US_export_policy.jar in security folder doesn\'t work on unix, so I suggest to copy security folder to your desktop first, replace the jar\'s @Desktop/security folder, delete the security folder from /jre/lib/ & move the Desktop security folder to /jre/lib/.eg :: sudo mv security /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/jre/lib This is a code only solution. No need to download or mess with configuration files. It\'s a reflection based solution, tested on java 8Call this method once, early in your program.//Imports//methodCredits: DelthasThere\'s a short discussion of what appears to be this issue here. The page it links to appears to be gone, but one of the responses might be what you need:Indeed, copying US_export_policy.jar and local_policy.jar from core/lib/jce to $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security helped. Thanks.the problem is the content of the file default_local.policy in local_policy.jar in the folder jre\\lib\\security, if you install the JRE:if you do not need worldwide valid settings you simply can edit this file and change the content tothis is what get if you download the JCE from Oracle.I also got the issue but after replacing existing one with the downloaded (from JCE) one resolved the issue. New crypto files provided unlimited strength.By default, Java only supports AES 128 bit (16 bytes) key sizes for encryption. If you do not need more than default supported, you can trim the key to the proper size before using Cipher. See javadoc for default supported keys.This is an example of generating a key that would work with any JVM version without modifying the policy files. Use at your own discretion.Here is a good article on whether key 128 to 256 key sizes matter on AgileBits BlogDefault JDK supports encryption only through 128 bit keys becuase of American restrictions.\nSo to support encryption from 256 bit long key we have to replace local_policy.jar and US_export_policy.jars in $JAVA_HOME/java-8-oracle/jre/lib/security folder otherwise it will give java.security.InvalidKeyException: Illegal key size or defaultBoth jars and detailed concept can be understand from the link:easybook4u.com Thanks,\nSulabh JainI fix this by just downgrading my Java version to Java 7 and it works for me
