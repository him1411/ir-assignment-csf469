I have a view made up of tablelayout, tablerows and textviews. I want it to look like a grid.  I need to get the height and width of this grid.  The methods getheight() and getwidth() always return 0.  This happens when I format the grid dynamically and also when I use an xml version.  How to retrieve the dimensions for a view?  Here is my test program I used in Debug to check the results: I believe the OP is long gone, but in case this answer is able to help future searchers, I thought I\'d post a solution that I have found. I have added this code into my onCreate() method:EDITED: 07/05/11 to include code from comments:First I get a final reference to my TextView (to access in the onGlobalLayout() method). Next, I get the ViewTreeObserver from my TextView, and add an OnGlobalLayoutListener, overriding onGLobalLayout (there does not seem to be a superclass method to invoke here...) and adding my code which requires knowing the measurements of the view into this listener. All works as expected for me, so I hope that this is able to help.I\'ll just add an alternative solution, override your activity\'s onWindowFocusChanged method and you will be able to get the values of getHeight(), getWidth() from there. You are trying to get width and height of an elements, that weren\'t drawn yet.If you use debug and stop at some point, you\'ll see, that your device screen is still empty, that\'s because your elements weren\'t drawn yet, so you can\'t get width and height of something, that doesn\'t yet exist.And, I might be wrong, but setWidth() is not always respected, Layout lays out it\'s children and decides how to measure them (calling child.measure()), so If you set setWidth(), you are not guaranteed to get this width after element will be drawn.What you need, is to use getMeasuredWidth() (the most recent measure of your View) somewhere after the view was actually drawn.Look into Activity lifecycle for finding the best moment.http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#ActivityLifecycleI believe a good practice is to use OnGlobalLayoutListener like this:You can place this code directly in onCreate(), and it will be invoked when views will be laid out.Use the View\'s post method like thisI tried to use onGlobalLayout() to do some custom formatting of a TextView, but as @George Bailey noticed, onGlobalLayout() is indeed called twice: once on the initial layout path, and second time after modifying the text.View.onSizeChanged() works better for me because if I modify the text there, the method is called only once (during the layout pass). This required sub-classing of TextView, but on API Level 11+ View. addOnLayoutChangeListener() can be used to avoid sub-classing.One more thing, in order to get correct width of the view in View.onSizeChanged(), the layout_width should be set to match_parent, not wrap_content.As F.X. mentioned, you can use an OnLayoutChangeListener to the view that you want to track itselfYou can remove the listener in the callback if you only want the initial layout.I guess this is what you need to look at: use onSizeChanged() of your view. Here is an EXTENDED code snippet on how to use onSizeChanged() to get your layout\'s or view\'s height and width dynamically http://syedrakibalhasan.blogspot.com/2011/02/how-to-get-width-and-height-dimensions.htmlAre you trying to get sizes in a constructor, or any other method that is run BEFORE you get the actual picture?You won\'t be getting any dimensions before all components are actually measured (since your xml doesn\'t know about your display size, parents positions and whatever)Try getting values after onSizeChanged() (though it can be called with zero), or just simply waiting when you\'ll get an actual image.You should rather look at View lifecycle: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html Generally you should not know width and height for sure until your activity comes to onResume state.ViewTreeObserver and onWindowFocusChanged() are not so necessary at all.If you inflate the TextView as layout and/or put some content in it and set LayoutParams then you can use getMeasuredHeight() and getMeasuredWidth().BUT you have to be careful with LinearLayouts (maybe also other ViewGroups). The issue there is, that you can get the width and height after onWindowFocusChanged() but if you try to add some views in it, then you can\'t get that information until everything have been drawn. I was trying to add multiple TextViews to LinearLayouts to mimic a FlowLayout (wrapping style) and so couldn\'t use Listeners. Once the process is started, it should continue synchronously. So in such case, you might want to keep the width in a variable to use it later, as during adding views to layout, you might need it.Simple Response:  This worked for me with no Problem. \nIt seems the key is to ensure that the View has focus before you getHeight etc. Do this by using the hasFocus() method, then using getHeight() method in that order. Just 3 lines of code required.ImageButton myImageButton1 =(ImageButton)findViewById(R.id.imageButton1);\nmyImageButton1.hasFocus();int myButtonHeight = myImageButton1.getHeight();Log.d("Button Height: ", ""+myButtonHeight );//Not requiredHope it helps.Use getMeasuredWidth() and getMeasuredHeight() for your view.Developer guide: ViewCORRECTION:\nI found out that the above solution is terrible.
