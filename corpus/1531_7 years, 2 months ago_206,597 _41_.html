What do the 3 dots in the following method mean?It means that zero or more String objects (or an array of them) may be passed as the argument(s) for that method.See the "Arbitrary Number of Arguments" section here: http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/javaOO/arguments.html#varargsIn your example, you could call it as any of the following:Important Note: The argument(s) passed in this way is always an array - even if there\'s just one. Make sure you treat it that way in the method body.Important Note 2: The argument that gets the ... must be the last in the method signature. So, myMethod(int i, String... strings) is okay, but myMethod(String... strings, int i) is not okay.Thanks to Vash for the clarifications in his comment.That feature is called varargs, and it\'s a feature introduced in Java 5. It means that function can receive multiple String arguments:Then, you can use the String var as an array:This answer borrows heavily from kiswa\'s and Lorenzo\'s... and also from the Graphain\'s comment.This is the Java way to pass varargs (variable number arguments).If you are familiar with C, this is similar to the ... syntax used it the printf function:but in a type safe fashion: every argument has to comply with the specified type (in your sample, they should be all String).This is a simple sample of how you can use varargs:The ... argument is actually an array, so you could pass a String[] as the parameter.Arguably, it is an example of syntactic sugar, since it is implemented as an array anyways (which doesn\'t mean it\'s useless) - I prefer passing an array to keep it clear, and also declare methods with arrays of given type. Rather an opinion than an answer, though.The varargs short for variable-length arguments is a feature that allows the method to accept variable number of arguments (zero or more). With varargs it has become simple to create methods that need to take a variable number of arguments. The feature of variable argument has been added in Java 5.Syntax of varargsA vararg is secified by three ellipsis (three dots) after the data type, its general form isNeed for varargsPrior to Java 5, in case there was a need of variable number of arguments, there were two ways to handle itIf the max number of arguments, a method can take was small and known, then overloaded versions of the method could be created.\nIf the maximum number of arguments a method could take was large or/and unknown then the approach was to put those arguments in an array and pass them to a method which takes array as a parameter.\nThese 2 approaches were error-prone - constructing an array of parameters every time and difficult to maintain - as the addition of new argument may result in writing a new overloaded method.Advantages of varargsOffers a much simpler option.\nLess code as no need to write overloaded methods.Example of varargsIt can be seen from the program that length is used here to find the number of arguments passed to the method. It is possible because varargs are implicitly passed as an array. Whatever arguments are passed as varargs are stored in an array which is referred by the name given to varargs. In this program array name is values.\nAlso note that method is called with different number of argument, first call with four arguments, then three arguments and then with zero arguments. All these calls are handled by the same method which takes varargs.Restriction with varargsIt is possible to have other parameters with varargs parameter in a method, however in that case, varargs parameter must be the last parameter declared by the method.Another restriction with varargs is that there must be only one varargs parameter.Overloading varargs MethodsIt is possible to overload a method that takes varargs parameter. \nVarargs method can be overloaded by -Types of its vararg parameter can be different.\nBy adding other parameters.\nExample of overloading varargs methodVarargs and overloading ambiguityIn some cases call may be ambiguous while we have overloaded varargs method.\nLet\'s see an exampleIn this program when we make a call to displayData() method without any parameter it throws error, because compiler is not sure whether this method call is for displayData(String ... values) or displayData(int ... values)Same way if we have overloaded methods where one has the vararg method of one type and another method has one parameter and vararg parameter of the same type, then also we have the ambiguity - \nAs Exp - \ndisplayData(int ... values) and displayData(int a, int ... values)These two overloaded methods will always have ambiguity.Also to shed some light, it is important to know that var-arg parameters are limited to one and you can\'t have several var-art params. For example this is illigal:Just think of it as the keyword params in C#, if you are coming from that background :)A really common way to see a clear example of the use of the three dots it is present in one of the most famous methods in android AsyncTask ( that today is not used too much because of RXJAVA, not to mention the Google Architecture components), you can find thousands of examples searching for this term, and the best way to understand and never forget anymore the meaning of the three dots is that they express a ...doubt... just like in the common language. Namely it is not clear the number of parameters that have to be passed, could be 0, could be 1 could be more( an array)...String... is the same as String[]
