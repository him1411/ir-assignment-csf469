I have a page structure similar to this:I would like for the parent div to expand in height when the inner div\'s height increases.Edit:\nOne problem is that if the width of the child content expands past the width of the browser window, my current CSS puts a horizontal scrollbar on the parent div.  I would like the scrollbar to be at the page level. Currently my parent div is set to overflow: auto;Can you please help me with the CSS for this?Try this for the parent, it worked for me.UPDATE:One more solution that worked:Parent:Child:add a clear:both.  assuming that your columns are floating.  Depending on how your height is specified parent you may need an overflow:auto;As Jens said in commentAn alternative answer is How to make div not larger than its contents?\xe2\x80\xa6 and it\n  proposes to set display:inline-block. Which worked great for me. \xe2\x80\x93\n  Jens Jun 2 at 5:41This works far better for me in all browsers.For those who can not figure out this in instructions from this answer there:Try to set padding value more then 0, if child divs have margin-top or margin-bottom you can replace it with paddingFor example if you haveit\'ll be better to replace it with:Add To the css of the parent div, or add a div at the bottom of the parent div that does clear:both;That is the correct answer, because overflow:auto; may work for simple web layouts, but will mess with elements that start using things like negative margin, etcUsing something like self-clearing div is perfect for a situation like this. Then you\'ll just use a class on the parent... like:Are you looking for a 2 column CSS layout?If so, have a look at the instructions, it\'s pretty straightforward for starting.I made a parent div expand around content of a child div by having the child div as a single column that does not have any positioning attribute such as absolute  specified.Example:Based on maincolumn div being the deepest child div of #wrap this defines the depth of the #wrap div and the 200px padding on either side creates two big blank columns for you to place absolutely positioned divs in as you please. You could even change the padding top and bottom to place header divs and footer divs using position:absolute.Does this do what you want?I use this CSS to parent and it works:You have to apply the clearfix solution on the parent container. Here is a nice article explaining the fix linkIf your content inside #childRightCol and #childRightCol are floated left or right, just add this into css:This is functioning as described by the spec - several answers here are valid, and consistent with the following:If it has block-level children, the height is the distance between the top border-edge of the topmost block-level child box that doesn\'t have margins collapsed through it and the bottom border-edge of the bottommost block-level child box that doesn\'t have margins collapsed through it. However, if the element has a nonzero top padding and/or top border, or is the root element, then the content starts at the top margin edge of the topmost child. (The first case expresses the fact that the top and bottom margins of the element collapse with those of the topmost and bottommost children, while in the second case the presence of the padding/border prevents the top margins from collapsing.) Similarly, if the element has a nonzero bottom padding and/or bottom border, then the content ends at the bottom margin edge of the bottommost child.from here: https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-box/#blockwidthyou are manage by using overflow:hidden; property in css
