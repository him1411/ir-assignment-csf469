Is there a realistic way of implementing a multi-threaded model in PHP whether truly, or just simulating it. Some time back it was suggested that you could force the operating system to load another instance of the PHP executable and handle other simultaneous processes.The problem with this is that when the PHP code finished executing the PHP instance remains in memory because there is no way to kill it from within PHP.  So if you are simulating several threads you can imagine whats going to happen.  So I am still looking for a way multi-threading can be done or simulated effectively from within PHP. Any ideas?Yes you can do multi-threading in PHP with pthreads From the PHP documentation:pthreads is an object-orientated API that provides all of the tools needed for multi-threading in PHP. PHP applications can create, read, write, execute and synchronize with Threads, Workers and Threaded objects.Warning:\n  The pthreads extension cannot be used in a web server environment. Threading in PHP should therefore remain to CLI-based applications only.Simple TestFirst RunSecond Run Real World Examplewhy don\'t you use popen?Threading isn\'t available in stock PHP, but concurrent programming is possible by using HTTP requests as asynchronous calls.With the curl\'s timeout setting set to 1 and using the same session_id for the processes you want to be associated with each other, you can communicate with session variables as in my example below. With this method you can even close your browser and the concurrent process still exists on the server.Don\'t forget to verify the correct session ID like this:http://localhost/test/verifysession.php?sessionid=[the correct id]While you can\'t thread, you do have some degree of process control in php. The two function sets that are useful here are:Process control functions\nhttp://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.pcntl.phpPOSIX functions\nhttp://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.posix.phpYou could fork your process with pcntl_fork - returning the PID of the child. Then you can use posix_kill to despose of that PID.That said, if you kill a parent process a signal should be sent to the child process telling it to die. If php itself isn\'t recognising this you could register a function to manage it and do a clean exit using pcntl_signal.using threads is made possible by the pthreads PECL extensionhttp://www.php.net/manual/en/book.pthreads.phpI know this is an old question but for people searching, there is a PECL extension written in C that gives PHP multi-threading capability now, it\'s located here https://github.com/krakjoe/pthreadsYou could simulate threading.  PHP can run background processes via popen (or proc_open).  Those processes can be communicated with via stdin and stdout.  Of course those processes can themselves be a php program.  That is probably as close as you\'ll get.  You can use exec() to run a command line script (such as command line php), and if you pipe the output to a file then your script won\'t wait for the command to finish.I can\'t quite remember the php CLI syntax, but you\'d want something like:I think quite a few shared hosting servers have exec() disabled by default for security reasons, but might be worth a try.Depending on what you\'re trying to do you could also use curl_multi to achieve it.I know this is way old, but you could look at http://phpthreadlib.sourceforge.net/It supports bi-directional inter-thread communication and also has builtin protections for killing off child threads (preventing orphans).You can have option of:How about pcntl_fork?check our the manual page for examples: PHP pcntl_forkpcntl_fork won\'t work in a web server environment if it has safe mode turned on. In this case, it will only work in the CLI version of PHP.The Thread class is available since PECL pthreads \xe2\x89\xa5 2.0.0.May be I missed something but exec did not worked as asynchronous for me in windows environment i used following in windows and it worked like charm ;)Multithreading means performing multiple tasks or processes simultaneously, we can achieve this in php by using following code,although there is no direct way to achieve multithreading in php but we can achieve almost same results by following way.}Test_1.phpThis will execute test_1.php two times simultaneously and both process will run in the background simultaneously ,so in this way you can achieve multithreading in php.This guy done really good work  Multithreading in php
