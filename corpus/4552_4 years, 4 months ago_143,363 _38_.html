I have uninstalled and installed Homebrew 3 times now because it seems to never allow me to install anything as it denies me permissions at the end of most installations.As an example I will post this libjpeg download scenario that I\'m currently facing.I try to install libjpeg and get:\'brew link jpeg\' results in Here is what my brew doctor readsThis permission issue has been making it impossible to use brew on anything and I would really appreciate any suggestions.I was able to solve the problem by using chown on the folder: Also you\'ll (most probably) have to do the same on /Library/Caches/Homebrew:Apparently I had used sudo before in a way that altered my folder permission on /usr/local,\nfrom here on forward all installations with brew have proven to be successful.This answer comes courtesy of gitHub\'s homebrew issue trackerAs a first option to whomever lands here like I did, follow whatever this suggests you to do:It\'s the safest path, and amongst other things, it suggested me to:which solved that permissions issue.The OP did just that but apparently didn\'t get the above suggestion; you might, and it\'s always better to start there first.Command from top-voted answer not work for me.It got output:chown: /usr/{my_username}dmin: illegal user nameThis command works fine (group for /usr/local was admin already):If you would like a slightly more targeted approach than the blanket chown -R, you may find this fix-homebrew script useful:Instead of doing a chmod to your user, it gives the admin group (to which you presumably belong) write access to the specific directories in /usr/local that homebrew uses. It also tells you exactly what it intends to do before doing it.I had this issue ..\nThe only solution I got is  to change ownership of /usr/local\nto current user instead of root by:But really this is not a proper way. Mainly if your machine is not a single-user. My suggestion is to change the ownership as above and do whatever you want to implement with Brew .. ( update, install ... etc ) then reset ownership back to root as:Thats would solve the issue and keep permissions in proper set.This solved the issue fore me.All of these suggestions may work.  In the latest version of brew doctor, better suggestions were made though.Firstly - fix the mess you have probably already made of /usr/local by running this in the command line:sudo chown -R root:wheel /usr/localThen take ownership of the paths that should be specifically for this user:All of this information is available if you run sudo brew update and then read all of the warnings and errors you will run into...If you don\'t have the latest Homebrew: I "fixed" this in the past by forcing Homebrew to run as root, which could only be done by changing the ownership of the Homebrew executables to root. At some point, they removed this feature.And I know they\'ll give lots of warnings saying it shouldn\'t run as root, but c\'mon, it doesn\'t work properly otherwise.There\'s a killer script on github that fixes perms on /usr/local and brew directories to be accessible by anyone who is a member of the \'admin\' group.  https://gist.github.com/jaibeee/9a4ea6aa9d428bc77925This is a better solution than the chosen answer, since if you chown the /usr/local/___ directories to $USER, then you break any other admin users of homebrew on that machine.Here are the guts of the script at the time I posted this:try also executing this command sudo chmod +t /tmp
