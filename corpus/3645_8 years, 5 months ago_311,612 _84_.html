Is there any relatively easy way to insert a modern browser into a .NET application? As far as I understand, the WebBrowser control is a wrapper for IE, which wouldn\'t be a problem except that it looks like it is a very old version of IE, with all that entails in terms of CSS screw-ups, potential security risks (if the rendering engine wasn\'t patched, can I really expect the zillion buffer overflow problems to be fixed?), and other issues. I am using Visual Studio C# (express edition - does it make any difference here?)I would like to integrate a good web browser in my applications. In some, I just use it to handle the user registration process, interface with some of my website\'s features and other things of that order, but I have another application in mind that will require more err... control. I need:I was thinking about Chrome, since it comes under the BSD license, but I would be just as happy with a recent version of IE. As much as possible, I would like to keep things simple. The best would be if one could patch the existing WebBrowser control, which does already about 70% of what I need, but I don\'t think that\'s possible.I have found an activeX control for Mozilla (http://www.iol.ie/~locka/mozilla/control.htm) but it looks like it\'s an old version, so it\'s not necessarily an improvement.I am open to suggestionsCheckout CefSharp .Net bindings, a project I started a while back that thankfully got picked up by the community and turned into something wonderful.The project wraps the Chromium Embedded Framework and has been used in a number of major projects including Rdio\'s Windows client, Facebook Messenger for Windows and Github for Windows.It features browser controls for WPF and Winforms and has tons of features and extension points.  Being based on Chromium it\'s blisteringly fast too.Grab it from NuGet: Install-Package CefSharp.Wpf or Install-Package CefSharp.WinFormsCheck out examples and give your thoughts/feedback/pull-requests: https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharpBSD Licensed Chrome uses (a fork of) Webkit if you didn\'t know, which is also used by Safari. Here\'s a few questions that are of the same vein:The webkit one isn\'t great as the other answer states, one version no longer works (the google code one) and the Mono one is experimental. It\'d be nice if someone made the effort to make a decent .NET wrapper for it but it\'s not something anyone seems to want to do - which is surprising given it now has support for HTML5 and so many other features that the IE(8) engine lacks.Update (2014)There\'s new dual-licensed project that allows you embed Chrome into your .NET applications called Awesomium. It comes with a .NET api but requires quite a few hacks for rendering (the examples draw the browser window to a buffer, paint the buffer as an image and refresh on a timer).I think this is the browser used by Origin in Battlefield 3.Update (2016)There is now DotnetBrowser, a commercial alternative to Awesomium. It\'s based off Chromium.I\'ve been testing alternatives to C# Web browser component for few days now and here is my list:1. Using newer IE versions 8,9:Web Browser component is IE7 not IE8? How to change this?Pros:Cons:This doesn\'t require much work and you can get some HTML5 and CSS3 support although IE9 lacks some of best CSS3 and HTML5 features. But I\'m sure you could get IE10 running same way. The problem would be that target system would have to have IE10 installed, and since is still in preview on Windows 7 I would suggest against it.2. OpenWebKitSharpOpenWebKitSharp is a .net wrapper for the webkit engine based on the WebKit.NET 0.5 project. WebKit is a layout engine used by Chrome/SafariPros:Cons:OpenWebKit is quite nice although many features are not yet implemented, I experienced few issues using it with visual studio which throws null object reference here and then in design mode, there are some js problems. Everyone using it will almost immediately notice js alert does nothing. Events like mouseup,mousedown... etc. doesn\'t work, js drag and drop is buggy and so on..I also had some difficulties installing it since it requires specific version of VC redistributable installed, so after exception I looked at event log, found version of VC and installed it.3. GeckoFXPros:Cons:GeckoFX is a cross platform Webrowser control for embedding into WinForms Applications. This can be used with .NET on Windows and with mono on Linux.\nGecko is a layout engine used by Firefox.I bumped into few information that GeckoFX is not actively developed which is not true, of course it\'s always one or two versions behind of Firefox but that is normal, I was really impressed by activity and the control itself. It does everything I needed, but I needed some time to get it running, here\'s a little tutorial to get it running:If your really must use Chrome, take a look at this product called Awesomium, it\'s free for non-commercial projects, but license is few thousand dollars for commercial.You can use registry to set IE version for webbrowser control.\nGo to: HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\Main\\FeatureControl\\FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION and add "yourApplicationName.exe" with value of browser_emulation\nTo see value of browser_emulation, refer link: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee330730%28VS.85%29.aspx#browser_emulationHave look at the Mono.WebBrowser control - it embeds either Gecko (as used by Firefox) or WebKit (as used by Safari) into WinForms (without using ActiveX).I know this isn\'t a \'replacement\' WebBrowser control, but I was having some awful rendering issues whilst showing a page that was using BootStrap 3+ for layout etc and then I found a post that suggested I use the following. Apparently it\'s specific to IE and tells it to use the latest variation found on the client machine for rendering (so it won\'t use IE7 as I believe is default)So just put:somewhere in the head part of your document.If of course it\'s not your document, then this obviously won\'t help (though I personally consider it to be a security hole if you\'re reading pages not created by yourself through the webbrowser control - why not just use a webbrowser!)Good luck.I had the same problem, the WebBrowser was using an old version of IE, with some googling I came across the following code that makes a change into registry and makes the WebBrowser to use the lastest IE version possible:You just need to create a class and put this code in it, then run the following code when the program starts:Take a look at the DotNetBrowser library. It provides Chromium-based WPF and WinForms browser controls, which are quite easy to embed into .NET application. It supports all the modern web standards including HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. The rendered page looks exactly like in Google Chrome.The library inherits Chromium\'s multi-process architecture \xe2\x80\x93 each web page is rendered in a separate Chromium process, and the application will continue working even after plugin crash or any other unexpected error occurs on the web page.Here are some other useful features, provided by DotNetBrowser: it is possible to listen to load events, handle network activity, configure proxy, simulate user actions, work with cookies, access and modify DOM, listen to DOM events, call JavaScript from .NET and vice versa, use web camera and microphone on the web page, set up WebRTC-based communication, and more. Check out the API Reference for more details.The code snippet below demonstrates how to create a BrowserView, embed it into a Form, and load a URL:Once you run the example above you will get the following output:The library is commercial, however it is free for use in Open-Source and Academic projects. Commercial licenses include support packages for different team sizes. It is also possible to purchase the library\xe2\x80\x99s source code.Besides its own page the component is available as NuGet package and as VSIX package in the Visual Studio Marketplace.I\'ve tried a handful of Webkit variants, but in my experience nothing beats the advancements that OpenWebkitSharp has. Love it love it.. HTML5 and CSS3 scores are as close as they can get to Google Chrome. Very nice API and eventing model. If you find "not implemented" APIs most likely because they are not implemented in Webkit. All else works great.OpenWebKitSharp is a .net wrapper for the webkit engine based on the\n  WebKit.NET 0.5 project. It adds more functionality to the 0.5 version\n  and it provides more methods than that build. OpenWebKitSharp supports\n  both the Cairo build (0.5) and the nightly builds of webkit (Nightly\n  by default). In Version 1.5 Stable and more the nightly build is\n  included and automatically copied after building. In earlier versions\n  this happens with the cairo build. OpenWebKitSharp currently powers\n  GTLite Navigator, a fast, stable and flexible web browser.Try EO.WebBrowser. It is new and is based on the latest version of Chrome browser. The best part about it is that it packs everything inside a single .NET dll so not only its very easy to use and deploy, but also the same DLL supports both 32 bit and 64 bit because it\'s a .NET dll.I have used GeckoFX and it serves me very well. It uses the Firefox engine. The only caveat I have ever run into with it, is that it emits the "DocumentLoaded" event once before the document is actually fully loaded... I think it shoots out one when the HTML is loaded, and then another one when all the images and stuff are loaded. I\'ve fixed it by simply ignoring the first one, and it has worked beautifully without fail so far.You can find it here: https://bitbucket.org/geckofx/Like most decent libraries, it is open-source.MozNet is a .NET control, previously based on the more or less abandoned GeckoFX control, but is under full development and has way more features than GeckoFX can shake a stick at. You can find it at the Se7en Soft website.EO.BrowserControl is quick and easy. It has Chrome browser engine and works with any version of .NEThttps://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/fcee0646-42e7-484f-b22e-f8b2ace55dd7Note: This is a commercially licensed product and I am not promoting it with that in mind. After trying out various other things, I ended up choosing this.Update 2016:There are 3 additional options I can suggest:1. BrowseEmAll.CefA .Net component that can be used to integrate the Chrome engine into your .Net Application. Based on CefGlue but a little faster on updates to the latest Chrome version. Also there is a commercial support option available which might come in handy for some. Of course the component itself is open source. 2. BrowseEmAll.GeckoAnother .Net component which can be used to integrate the Firefox engine into your .Net application. This is based on Geckofx but unlike the current version of Geckofx this will work with a normal release build of Firefox. To use Geckofx you will need to build Firefox yourself. Again commercial support is available but the component itself is fully open source. 3. BrowseEmAll Core APINeed all the different browsers in your .Net Application? Which the BrowseEmAll Core API you can integrate Chrome, Firefox, Webkit and Internet Explorer into your application. This is a commercial product though so be warned.(Full disclosure: I work for this company so take everything I say with a grain of salt)If you are looking for a nice IE based control--check out:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/csexwb2/I\'ve used it in production products.  It\'s pretty good and has good demos although does not seem to be being maintained as well now as it used to.Geckofx and Webkit.net were both promising at first, but they didn\'t keep up to date with Firefox and Chrome respectively while as Internet Explorer improved, so did the Webbrowser control, though it behaves like IE7 by default regardless of what IE version you have but that can be fixed by going into the registry and change it to IE9 allowing HTML5.Check out the GeckoFX control.I have tried all browsers that are out there.\nUnfortunately the only one that really worked for me under all circumstances was EO.Browser.\nI wish I could have chosen a free solution, but I ended up with EO.Browser.\nIt is pretty pricy, but well maintained. Update 2016:To me, the only reliable, maintained browser alternative to IE is EO.WebBrowser.\nI spent days and week trying out the others. All of them had some issues that stopped the show for me at some point.
