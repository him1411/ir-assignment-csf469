In Notepad++, I can use Ctrl + Shift + Up / Down to move the current line up and down. Is there a similar command to this in Vim?  I have looked through endless guides, but have found nothing.If there isn\'t, how could I bind the action to that key combination?Edit: Mykola\'s answer works for all lines, apart from those at the beginning and end of the buffer. Moving the first line up or the bottom line down deletes the line, and when moving the bottom line up it jumps two spaces initially, like a pawn! Can anyone offer any refinements?Put the following to your .vimrc to do the jobDisappearing of the line looks like a Vim bug. I put a hack to avoid it. Probably there is some more accurate solution.UpdateThere are a lot of unexplained difficulties with just using Vim combinations. These are line missing and extra line jumping.So here is the scripting solution which can be placed either inside .vimrc or ~/.vim/plugin/swap_lines.vimIf I want to swap one line with the line above I usually do the followingExplanationAssuming the cursor is on the line you like to move.Moving up and down:\n:m for move:m +1 - moves down 1 line:m -2 - move up 1 lines(Note you can replace +1 with any numbers depending on how many lines you want to move it up or down, ie +2 would move it down 2 lines, -3 would move it up 2 lines)To move to specific line:set number - display number lines (easier to see where you are moving it to):m 3 - move the line after 3rd line (replace 3 to any line you\'d like)Moving multiple lines:V (i.e. Shift-V) and move courser up and down to select multiple lines in VIMonce selected hit : and run the commands above, m +1 etcMove a line up: ddkPMove a line down: ddpThis worked for me:http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Moving_lines_up_or_down_in_a_fileBTW, if you want to use ALT+some_key and your terminal (urxvt does this) refuses to comply, you should enter something like this in your .vimrc:where ^] is a single character that represents the ALT key.\nTo input that character, use C+v, Esc in Vim (C+q, Esc on Windows).In command mode position the cursor on the line you want to move down, and thenExplanation:\ndd deletes the current line to the general buffer\np puts it back AFTER the cursor position, or in case of entire lines, one line below.There is some confusion regarding commands p and P in many docs.\nIn reality p pastes AFTER cursor, and P AT cursor.add the following to ~/.vimrc file (make sure you have no mapping for n,m )now pressing n key will move a line down and m will move a line up.Just add this code to .vimrc (or .gvimrc)Exactly what you\'re looking for in this awesome plugin: https://github.com/vim-scripts/upAndDownHere\'s a simplified version, for MacVim, using the the Wikia article examples (cf. link from gun\'s comment).I\'m using only the block selection variant, because all it takes is Shift-V to select the current line, and optionally cursor up/down to select some more lines.According to the shortcuts above, pressing Cmd-Shift-Up/Down will shift the block selection up/down. "D" is the Command key in MacVim, for Windows try "C" (Control), or "A" (Alt) (eg. <C-A-f> would be Control Alt f).The Wikia article adds "=gv" to these, which has the effect to adjust the indentation of the  block after the move, based on surrounding text. This is confusing so I removed it, and added shortcuts for quickly indenting the selection instead.Mind, the same can be done with << and >> but the selection would be lost, so these shortcuts above allow to indent multiple times and still move the block around because the selection is maintained.My MacVim is configured to switch Tabs with Cmd-Shift-Left/Right so I used Cmd-Alt-Left/Right.Here\'s the Tab switching for MacVim (put in .gvimrc with the rest above):I put the following at the end of my .vimrc file:So now \'H\' and \'N\' move current line up and down respectively.:m.+1 or :m.-2 would do if you\'re moving a single line. Here\'s my script to move multiple lines. In visual mode, Alt-up/Alt-down will move the lines containing the visual selection up/down by one line. In insert mode or normal mode, Alt-up/Alt-down will move the current line if no count prefix is given. If there\'s a count prefix, Alt-up/Alt-down will move that many lines beginning from the current line up/down by one line.In normal mode you can press:\nShift + jA simple solution is to put in your .vimrc these lines:vim plugin unimpaired.vim [e and ]eNot VIM, but I got here looking for a way to do this in Vintage Mode of ST2, so it might be useful to others.For those using Sublime Text 2 you can use...Control + Command + Up/Down ...to move a line up or down, respectively.
