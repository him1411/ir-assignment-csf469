I need to append text repeatedly to an existing file in Java. How do I do that?Are you doing this for logging purposes?  If so there are several libraries for this. Two of the most popular are Log4j and Logback.If you just need to do this one time, the Files class makes this easy:Careful: The above approach will throw a NoSuchFileException if the file does not already exist. It also does not append a newline automatically (which you often want when appending to a text file). Steve Chambers\'s answer covers how you could do this with Files class.However, if you will be writing to the same file many times, the above has to open and close the file on the disk many times, which is a slow operation. In this case, a buffered writer is better:Notes:If you need robust exception handling for older Java, it gets very verbose:You can use fileWriter with a flag set to true , for appending.Shouldn\'t all of the answers here with try/catch blocks have the .close() pieces contained in a finally block?Example for marked answer:Also, as of Java 7, you can use a try-with-resources statement. No finally block is required for closing the declared resource(s) because it is handled automatically, and is also less verbose:Edit - as of Apache Commons 2.1, the correct way to do it is:I adapted @Kip\'s solution to include properly closing the file on finally:It\'s a bit alarming how many of these answers leave the file handle open in case of an error. The answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/15053443/2498188 is on the money but only because BufferedWriter() cannot throw. If it could then an exception would leave the FileWriter object open. A more general way of doing this that doesn\'t care if BufferedWriter() can throw:As of Java 7, the recommended way is to use "try with resources" and let the JVM deal with it:In Java-7 it also can be done such kind://---------------------Sample, using Guava:This can be done in one line of code. Hope this helps :)I just add small detail:2.nd parameter (true) is a feature (or, interface) called appendable (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Appendable.html). It is responsible for being able to add some content to the end of particular file/stream. This interface is implemented since Java 1.5. Each object (i.e. BufferedWriter, CharArrayWriter, CharBuffer, FileWriter, FilterWriter, LogStream, OutputStreamWriter, PipedWriter, PrintStream, PrintWriter, StringBuffer, StringBuilder, StringWriter, Writer) with this interface can be used for adding contentIn other words, you can add some content to your gzipped file, or some http processUsing java.nio.Files along with java.nio.file.StandardOpenOptionThis creates a BufferedWriter using Files, which accepts StandardOpenOption parameters, and an auto-flushing PrintWriter from the resultant BufferedWriter. PrintWriter\'s println() method, can then be called to write to the file.The StandardOpenOption parameters used in this code: opens the file for writing, only appends to the file, and creates the file if it does not exist.Paths.get("path here") can be replaced with new File("path here").toPath().\nAnd Charset.forName("charset name") can be modified to accommodate the desired Charset.Try with bufferFileWriter.append, it works with me.To slightly expand on Kip\'s answer,\nhere is a simple Java 7+ method to append a new line to a file, creating it if it doesn\'t already exist:Note: The above uses the Files.write overload that writes lines of text to a file (i.e. similar to a println command). To just write text to the end (i.e. similar to a print command), an alternative Files.write overload can be used, passing in a byte array (e.g. "mytext".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)).this will do what you intend for..If we are using Java 7 and above and also know the content to be added (appended) to the file we can make use of newBufferedWriter method in NIO package.There are few points to note:Though OP has not asked but just in case we want to search for lines having some specific keyword e.g. confidential we can make use of stream APIs in Java:Then catch an IOException somewhere upstream.Create a function anywhere in your project and simply call that function where ever you need it.Guys you got to remember that you guys are calling active threads that you are not calling asynchronously and since it would likely be a good 5 to 10 pages to get it done right.\nWhy not spend more time on your project and forget about writing anything already written.\nProperlythree lines of code two really since the third actually appends text. :PLibraryCodeYou can also try this :Better to use try-with-resources then all that pre-java 7 finally businessThis code will fulifil your need:the true allows to append the data in the existing file. If we will writeIt will overwrite the existing file. So go for first approach.I might suggest the apache commons project. This project already provides a framework for doing what you need (i.e. flexible filtering of collections). The following method let\'s you append text to some file:Alternatively using FileUtils:It is not efficient but works fine. Line breaks are handled correctly and a new file is created if one didn\'t exist yet.My answer:In case you want to ADD SOME TEXT IN SPECIFIC LINES you can first read the whole file, append the text wherever you want and then overwrite everything like in the code below:
