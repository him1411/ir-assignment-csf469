I have a string, "004-034556", that I want to split into two strings:That means the first string will contain the characters before \'-\', and the second string will contain the characters after \'-\'. I also want to check if the string has \'-\' in it. If not, I will throw an exception. How can I do this?Just use the appropriate method: String#split().Note that this takes a regular expression, so remember to escape special characters if necessary.there are 12 characters with special meanings: the backslash \\, the caret ^, the dollar sign $, the period or dot ., the vertical bar or pipe symbol |, the question mark ?, the asterisk or star *, the plus sign +, the opening parenthesis (, the closing parenthesis ), and the opening square bracket [, the opening curly brace {, These special characters are often called "metacharacters".So, if you want to split on e.g. period/dot . which means "any character" in regex, use either backslash \\ to escape the individual special character like so split("\\\\."), or use character class [] to represent literal character(s) like so split("[.]"), or use Pattern#quote() to escape the entire string like so split(Pattern.quote(".")).To test beforehand if the string contains certain character(s), just use String#contains().Note, this does not take a regular expression. For that, use String#matches() instead.If you\'d like to retain the split character in the resulting parts, then make use of positive lookaround. In case you want to have the split character to end up in left hand side, use positive lookbehind by prefixing ?<= group on the pattern.In case you want to have the split character to end up in right hand side, use positive lookahead by prefixing ?= group on the pattern.If you\'d like to limit the number of resulting parts, then you can supply the desired number as 2nd argument of split() method. An alternative to processing the string directly would be to use a regular expression with capturing groups. This has the advantage that it makes it straightforward to imply more sophisticated constraints on the input. For example, the following splits the string into two parts, and ensures that both consist only of digits:As the pattern is fixed in this instance, it can be compiled in advance and stored as a static member (initialised at class load time in the example). The regular expression is:The parentheses denote the capturing groups; the string that matched that part of the regexp can be accessed by the Match.group() method, as shown. The \\d matches and single decimal digit, and the + means "match one or more of the previous expression). The - has no special meaning, so just matches that character in the input. Note that you need to double-escape the backslashes when writing this as a Java string. Some other examples:This will split your string into 2 parts.  The first element in the array will be the part containing the stuff before the -, and the 2nd element in the array will contain the part of your string after the -.If the array length is not 2, then the string was not in the format: string-string.Check out the split() method in the String class.https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#split-java.lang.String-int-should do thing you want. String class has many method to operate with string. The requirements left room for interpretation. I recommend writing a method,which encapsulate this function. Of course you can use String.split(..) as mentioned in the other answers for the implementation.You should write some unit-tests for input strings and the desired results and behaviour.Good test candidates should include:With defining the according test results, you can specify the behaviour.For example, if "-333" should return in [,333] or if it is an error.\nCan "333-333-33" be separated in [333,333-33] or [333-333,33] or is it an error? And so on.You can try like this alsoUse org.apache.commons.lang.StringUtils\' split method which can split strings based on the character or string you want to split.Method signature: In your case, you want to split a string when there is a "-".You can simply do as follows:Output:Assume that if - does not exists in your string, it returns the given string, and you will not get any exception.Assuming, thatThe easiest way is to use StringUtils#split(java.lang.String, char). That\'s more convenient than the one provided by Java out of the box if you don\'t need regular expressions. Like its manual says, it works like this:I would recommend using commong-lang, since usually it contains a lot of stuff that\'s usable. However, if you don\'t need it for anything else than doing a split, then implementing yourself or escaping the regex is a better option.With Java 8:For simple use cases String.split() should do the job. If you use guava, there is also a Splitter class which allows chaining of different string operations and supports CharMatcher:String Split with multiple characters using RegexOutput:But do not expect the same output across all JDK versions. I have seen one bug which exists in some JDK versions where the first null string has been ignored. This bug is not present in the latest JDK version, but it exists in some versions between JDK 1.7 late versions and 1.8 early versions.You can split a string by a line break by using the following statement:You can split a string by a hyphen/character by using the following statement:The fastest way, which also consumes the least resource could be:One way to do this is to run through the String in a for-each loop and use the required split character.Output:Please don\'t use StringTokenizer class as it is a legacy class that is retained for compatibility reasons, and its use is discouraged in new code. And we can make use of the split method as suggested by others as well.And as expected it will print:In this answer I also want to point out one change that has taken place for split method in Java 8. The String#split() method makes use of Pattern.split, and now it will remove empty strings at the start of the result array. Notice this change in documentation for Java 8:When there is a positive-width match at the beginning of the input\n  sequence then an empty leading substring is included at the beginning\n  of the resulting array. A zero-width match at the beginning however\n  never produces such empty leading substring.It means for the following example:we will get three strings: [0, 0, 4] and not four as was the case in Java 7 and before. Also check this similar question.You can use the Split().Else,\nYou can use StringTokenizer.Hope It Helps.. :)Here are two ways two achieve itWAY 1:\nAs you have to split two numbers by a special character you can use regexWAY 2:Using string split methodYou can use simply StringTokenizer to split string in two or more parts whether their is any type of delimiters:Check out the split() method in the String class on javadoc.https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#split(java.lang.String)Here many examples for split string but I little code optimized.As mentioned by everyone, split() is the best option which may be used in your case. An alternative method can be using substring().To split a string, use String.split(regex):output:004\n  034556From the documentation:public String[] split(String regex,int limit) Splits this string around matches of the given regular expression. The array returned by this method contains each\n  substring of this string that is terminated by another substring that\n  matches the given expression or is terminated by the end of the\n  string. The substrings in the array are in the order in which they\n  occur in this string. If the expression does not match any part of the\n  input then the resulting array has just one element, namely this\n  string.So basically what you can do is something like this:Output:Outputhttp://pfhppl.in/?uid\n   0SCQZ7W9DBB0SCQZ7W9DBBIf you have special character then you can use Patter.quote. If you are simple have dash (-) then you shorten the code If you try to add other special character in place of dash (^) then the error will generate ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. For that you have to use Pattern.quoteSometimes if you want to split string containing + then it won\'t split; instead you will get a runtime error. In that case, first replace + to _ and then split:
