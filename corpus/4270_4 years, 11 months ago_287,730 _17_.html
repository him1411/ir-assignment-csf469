I\'m working on a web page in Google Chrome. It displays correctly with the following styles.It is important to note that I didn\'t define these styles. On Chrome dev tools, it says \'user agent stylesheet\' in place of the CSS file name.Now if I submit a form and some validation error occurs, I get the following stylesheet:The font-size from these new styles is disturbing my design.
