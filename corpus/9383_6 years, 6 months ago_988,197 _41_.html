I attempted to create a calculator, but I can not get it to work because I don\'t know how to get user input.How can I get the user input in Java?One of the simplest ways is to use a Scanner object as follows:You can use any of the following options based on the requirements.The readLine method from the DataInputStream class has been deprecated. To get String value, you should use the previous solution with BufferedReaderApparently, this method does not work well in some IDEs.You can use the Scanner class or the Console classYou can get user input using BufferedReader.It will store a String value in accStr so you have to parse it to an int using Integer.parseInt.Here is how you can get the keyboard inputs:You can make a simple program to ask for user\'s name and print what ever the reply use inputs.Or ask user to enter two numbers and you can add, multiply, subtract, or divide those numbers and print the answers for user inputs just like a behavior of a calculator.So there you need Scanner class. You have to import java.util.Scanner; and in the code you need to use Input is a variable name.See how this differs: input.next();, i = input.nextInt();, d = input.nextDouble();According to a String, int and a double varies same way for the rest. Don\'t forget the import statement at the top of your code.Also see the blog post "Scanner class and getting User Inputs".To read a line or a string, you can use a BufferedReader object combined with an InputStreamReader one as follows:Here, the program asks the user to enter a number. After that, the program prints the digits of the number and the sum of the digits.Use the System class to get the input.http://fresh2refresh.com/java-tutorial/java-input-output/ :We need three objects,BufferedReaderHere is your program from the question using java.util.Scanner:Just one extra detail.  If you don\'t want to risk a memory/resource leak, you should close the scanner stream when you are finished:Note that java 1.7 and later catch this as a compile warning (don\'t ask how I know that  :-)Add throws IOException beside main(), thenIt is very simple to get input in java, all you have to do is:You can get user input like this using a BufferedReader: This is how you apply themSo when the user types in his name into the console, "String name" will store that information.If it is a number you want to store, the code will look like this:Hop this helps!Can be something like this...This is a simple code that uses the System.in.read() function. This code just writes out whatever was typed. You can get rid of the while loop if you just want to take input once, and you could store answers in a character array if you so choose.I like the following: and for example, I would do:Here is a more developed version of the accepted answer that addresses two common needs:CodeExampleNote that without nextLine(), the bad input will trigger the same exception repeatedly in an infinite loop.  You might want to use next() instead depending on the circumstance, but know that input like this has spaces will generate multiple exceptions.
