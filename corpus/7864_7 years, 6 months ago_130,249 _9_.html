I want to have 5 lines for the height of the text area. I am using the following code.The text area looks fine, but the problem is that the cursor is blinking in the middle of the text field. I want it to blink at first line, at the first character of the text field.Use android:gravity="top"This is similar to CommonsWare answer but with a minor tweak: android:gravity="top|left". Complete code example:U can use this Edittext....This will help you.    Use this:orit will workI think you can use layout:weight = 5 instead android:lines = 5 because when you port your  app to smaller device - it does it nicely.. well, both attributes will accomplish your job..
