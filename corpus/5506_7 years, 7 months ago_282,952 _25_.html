How can I get the last key of an array?A solution would be to use a combination of end and key (quoting) :So, a portion of code such as this one should do the trick :Will output :i.e. the key of the last element of my array.Although end() seems to be the easiest, it\'s not the fastest.The faster, and much stronger alternative is array_slice()Strike-out by editor: This claim has not been substantiated and\n  contrary evidence has been mentioned in the comments.  If there is any\n  shred of truth to this poster\'s assertions about speed/efficiency then a \n  benchmark test must be provided.I prefer Just use : echo $array[count($array) - 1];Dont know if this is going to be faster or not, but it seems easier to do it this way, and you avoid the error by not passing in a function to end()... it just needed a variable... not a big deal to write one more line of code, then unset it if you needed to.Try using array_pop and array_keys function as follows:You can use this:Another Solution is to create a function and use it:I just took the helper-function from Xander and improved it with the answers before:I would also like to offer an alternative solution to this problem.Assuming all your keys are numeric without any gaps,\nmy preferred method is to count the array then minus 1 from that value (to account for the fact that array keys start at 0.This would give you:int(1)\n  catThis works because PHP moves it\'s array pointer internally for $arrayanother way to this.Like this:It should be something like this...Cause it reverse the array when we call array_keys.
