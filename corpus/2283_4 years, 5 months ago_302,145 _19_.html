I used nvm to download node v0.4.10 and installed npm to work with that version of node. I am trying to install express using and I get an error that express requires node version >= 0.5.0. Well, this is odd, since I am following the directions for a node+express+mongodb tutorial here that used node v0.4.10, so I am assuming express is/was available to node v0.4.10. If my assumption is correct, how do I tell npm to fetch a version that would work with my setup?If you have to install an older version of a package, just specify itFor example: npm install express@3.0.0You can also add the --save flag to that command to add it to your package.json dependencies, or --save --save-exact flags if you want that exact version specified in your package.json dependencies.The install command is documented here: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/installIf you\'re not sure what versions of a package are available, you can use:And npm view can be used for viewing other things about a package too. https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/viewfirst remove old version thenIt\'s quite easy. Just write this, for example:In my opinion that is easiest and fastest way:$ npm -v4.2.0 $ npm install -g npm@latest-3...$ npm -v3.10.10
