I\'m using this code to let the user enter in names while the program stores them in an array until they enter an empty string (they must press enter after each name):This code would look much nicer in a do ... while loop:In this code I don\'t have to assign info to some random string.Unfortunately this type of loop doesn\'t seem to exist in Ruby. Can anybody suggest a better way of doing this?CAUTION:The begin <code> end while <condition> is rejected by Ruby\'s author Matz. Instead he suggests using Kernel#loop, e.g.For more details please refer to: http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-core/6745 (or via Wayback), and this wiki: http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Loops/Do-while#RubyOriginally written by Jeremy Voorhis.

Observe:As you would expect, the loop will continue to execute while the modifier is true.While I would be happy to never see this idiom again, begin...end is quite powerful. The following is a common idiom to memoize a one-liner method with no params:Here is an ugly, but quick way to memoize something more complex:Like this:Reference: http://archive.jvoorhis.com/articles/2007/06/13/ruby-hidden-do-while-loopHow about this?Here\'s the full text article from hubbardr\'s dead link to my blog.I found the following snippet while reading the source for Tempfile#initialize in the Ruby core library:At first glance, I assumed the while modifier would be evaluated before the contents of begin...end, but that is not the case.

See: http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-core/6745Matz recommended doing it this way:From what I gather, Matz does not like the constructbecause, it\'s semantics is different thanin that the first construct executes the code first before checking the condition,\nand the second construct tests the condition first before it executes the code (if ever). I take it Matz prefers to keep the second construct because it matches one line construct of if statements.I never liked the second construct even for if statements. In all other cases, the computer\nexecutes code left-to-right (eg. || and &&) top-to-bottom. Humans read code left-to-right\ntop-to-bottom.I suggest the following constructs instead:I don\'t know if those suggestions will parse with the rest of the language. But in any case\nI prefere keeping left-to-right execution as well as language consistency.Here\'s another one:
