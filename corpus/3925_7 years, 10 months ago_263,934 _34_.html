This is a probably an embarasing question as no doubt the answer is blindingly obvious.I\'ve used Visual Studio for years, but this is the first time I\'ve done any \'Console Application\' development.When I run my application the console window pops up, the program output appears and then the window closes as the application exits.Is there a way to either keep it open until I have checked the output, or view the results after the window has closed?If you run without debugging (Ctrl+F5) then by default it prompts your to press return to close the window. If you want to use the debugger, you should put a breakpoint on the last line.Right click on your project Properties>Configuration Properties> Linker> Systemselect Console (/SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE) in SubSystem option. Now try it...it should workHere is a way for C/C++:Put this at the top of your program, and IF it is on a Windows system (#ifdef _WIN32), then it will create a macro called WINPAUSE. Whenever you want your program to pause, call WINPAUSE; and it will pause the program, using the DOS command. For other systems like Unix/Linux, the console should not quit on program exit anyway.Goto Debug Menu->Press StartWithoutDebuggingIf you\'re using .NET, put Console.ReadLine() before the end of the program. It will wait for <ENTER>.try to call getchar() right before main() returns.(/SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE) did not worked for my vs2013 (I already had it)."run without debugging" is not an options, since I do not want to switch between debugging and seeing output.I ended withSolution used in qtcreator pre 2.6. Now while qt is growing, vs is going other way. As I remember, in vs2008 we did not need such tricks.Here\'s a solution that (1) doesn\'t require any code changes or breakpoints, and (2) pauses after program termination so that you can see everything that was printed.  It will pause after either F5 or Ctrl+F5.  The major downside is that on VS2013 Express (as tested), it doesn\'t load symbols, so debugging is very restricted.Create a batch file.  I called mine runthenpause.bat, with the following contents:The first line will run whatever command you provide and up to eight arguments.  The second line will... pause.Open the project properties | Configuration properties | Debugging.Now, when you run, runthenpause.bat will launch your application, and after your application has terminated, will pause for you to see the console output.I will post an update if I figure out how to get the symbols loaded.  I tried /Z7 per this but without success.You could run your executable from a command prompt. This way you could see all the output. Or, you could do something like this:and this way the window would not close until you enter data for the a variable.add \xe2\x80\x9c| pause\xe2\x80\x9d in command arguments box under debugging section at project properties.Just press CNTRL + F5 to open it in an external command line window (Visual Studio does not have control over it).If this doesn\'t work then add the following to the end of your code:This wait for you to press a key to close the terminal window once the code has reached the end.If you want to do this in multiple places, put the above code in a method (e.g. private void Pause()) and call Pause() whenever a program reaches a possible end.Visual Studio 2015, with imports. Because I hate\nwhen code examples don\'t give the needed imports.Use console.readline. Yours is writing the line but not reading it.
