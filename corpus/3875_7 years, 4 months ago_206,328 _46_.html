How can I check if the Android phone is in Landscape or Portrait? The current configuration, as used to determine which resources to retrieve etc, as available from the Resources\' Configuration object as:http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/res/Configuration.html#orientationIf you use getResources().getConfiguration().orientation on some devices you will get it wrong. We used that approach initially in http://apphance.com. Thanks to remote logging of Apphance we could see it on different devices and we saw that fragmentation plays its role here. \nI saw weird cases: for example alternating portrait and square(?!) on HTC Desire HD:or not changing orientation at all:On the other hand, width() and height() is always correct (it is used by window manager, so it should better be). I\'d say the best idea is to do the width/height checking ALWAYS. If you think about a moment, this is exactly what you want - to know if width is smaller than height (portrait), the opposite (landscape) or if they are the same (square).Then it comes down to this simple code:A fully way to specify the current orientation of the phone:Chear\nBinh NguyenAnother way of solving this problem is by not relying on the correct return value from the display but relying on the Android resources resolving.Create the file layouts.xml in the folders res/values-land and res/values-port with the following content:res/values-land/layouts.xml:res/values-port/layouts.xml:In your source code you can now access the current orientation as follows:Here is code snippet demo how to get screen orientation was recommend by hackbod and Martijn:\xe2\x9d\xb6 Trigger when change Orientation:\xe2\x9d\xb7 Get current orientation as hackbod recommend:\xe2\x9d\xb8There are alternative solution for get current screen orientation \xe2\x9d\xb7 follow Martijn solution:\xe2\x98\x85Note: \nI was try both implement \xe2\x9d\xb7 & \xe2\x9d\xb8, but on RealDevice (NexusOne SDK 2.3) Orientation it returns the wrong orientation.\xe2\x98\x85So i recommend to used solution \xe2\x9d\xb7 to get Screen orientation which have more advantage: clearly, simple and work like a charm. \xe2\x98\x85Check carefully return of orientation to ensure correct as our expected (May be have limited depend on physical devices specification)Hope it help,Use getResources().getConfiguration().orientation it\'s the right way.You just have to watch out for different types of landscapes, the landscape that the device normally uses and the other.Still don\'t understand how to manage that.Some time has passed since most of these answers have been posted and some use now deprecated methods and constants.I\'ve updated Jarek\'s code to not use these methods and constants anymore:Note that the mode Configuration.ORIENTATION_SQUARE isn\'t supported anymore.I found this to be reliable on all devices I\'ve tested it on in contrast to the method suggesting the usage of getResources().getConfiguration().orientationCheck screen orientation in runtime.There is one more way of doing it:The Android SDK can tell you this just fine:I think this code may work after orientation change has take effectoverride Activity.onConfigurationChanged(Configuration newConfig) function and use newConfig,orientation if you want to get notified about the new orientation before calling setContentView.i think using getRotationv() doesn\'t help because \nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Display.html#getRotation%28%29\n getRotation() Returns the rotation of the screen from its "natural" orientation.so unless you know the "natural" orientation, rotation is meaningless.i found an easier way, please tell me if there is a problem with this someone?Simple and easy :)At java file, write:at onCreate method and before setContentView write:Old post I know. Whatever the orientation may be or is swapped etc. I designed this function that is used to set the device in the right orientation without the need to know how the portrait and landscape features are organised on the device.Works like a charm!Use this way, in the String you have the Oriantionthere are many ways to do this , this piece of code works for me
