What is the difference between Math.Floor() and Math.Truncate() in .NET?Math.Floor rounds down, Math.Ceiling rounds up, and Math.Truncate rounds towards zero. Thus, Math.Truncate is like Math.Floor for positive numbers, and like Math.Ceiling for negative numbers. Here\'s the reference.For completeness, Math.Round rounds to the nearest integer. If the number is exactly midway between two integers, then it rounds towards the even one. Reference.See also: Pax Diablo\'s answer. Highly recommended!Follow these links for the MSDN descriptions of:The following diagram and table may help:Note that Round is a lot more powerful than it seems, simply because it can round to a specific number of decimal places. All the others round to zero decimals always. For example:With the other functions, you have to use multiply/divide trickery to achieve the same effect:Some examples:Math.Floor() rounds toward negative infinity Math.Truncate rounds up or down towards zero.For example:Math.Floor() rounds \n"toward negative infinity" in compliance to IEEE Standard 754 section 4.Math.Truncate() rounds " to the nearest integer towards zero." They are functionally equivalent with positive numbers. The difference is in how they handle negative numbers.For example:MSDN links:\n - Math.Floor Method\n - Math.Truncate MethodP.S. Beware of Math.Round it may not be what you expect.To get the "standard" rounding result use:Math.Floor(): Returns the largest integer less than or equal to the specified double-precision floating-point number.Math.Round(): Rounds a value to the nearest integer or to the specified number of fractional digits.math.floor()Returns the largest integer less than or equal to the specified number.MSDN system.math.floormath.truncate()Calculates the integral part of a number.MSDN system.math.truncateIn addition Math.Round()
