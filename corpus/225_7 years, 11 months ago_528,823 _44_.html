I have a project in which I have to change the mode of files with chmod to 777 while developing, but which should not change in the main repo. Git picks up on chmod -R 777 . and marks all files as changed. Is there a way to make Git ignore mode changes that have been made to files?Try:From git-config(1):The -c flag can be used to set this option for one-off commands:And the --global flag will make it be the default behavior for the logged in user.core.fileMode is not the best practice and should be used carefully. This setting only covers the executable bit of mode and never the read/write bits. In many cases you think you need this setting because you did something like chmod -R 777, making all your files executable. But in most projects most files don\'t need and should not be executable for security reasons.The proper way to solve this kind of situation is to handle folder and file permission separately, with something like:If you do that, you\'ll never need to use core.fileMode, except in very rare environment.undo mode change in working tree:Or in mingw-gitIf you want to set this option for all of your repos, use the --global option.If this does not work you are probably using a newer version of git so try the --add option.If you run it without the --global option and your working directory is not a repo, you\'ll getIfdoes not work for you, do it manually:cd into .git folder:edit the config file:change true to false->save, exit, go to upper folder:reinit the gityou are done!Adding to Greg Hewgill answer (of using core.fileMode config variable):You can use --chmod=(-|+)x option of git update-index (low-level version of "git add") to change execute permissions in the index, from where it would be picked up if you use "git commit" (and not "git commit -a").You can configure it globally:git config --global core.filemode falseIf the above doesn\'t work for you, the reason might be your local configuration overrides the global configuration. Remove your local configuration to make the global configuration take effect:git config --unset core.filemodeAlternatively, you could change your local configuration to the right value:git config core.filemode falseIf you want to set filemode to false in config files recursively (including submodules) :\nfind -name config | xargs sed -i -e \'s/filemode = true/filemode = false/\'By definining the following alias (in ~/.gitconfig) you can easily temporarily disable the fileMode per git command:When this alias is prefixed to the git command, the file mode changes won\'t show up with commands that would otherwise show them. For example:If you have used chmod command already then check the difference of file, It shows previous file mode and current file mode such as:new mode : 755old mode : 644set old mode of all files using below commandsudo chmod 644 .now set core.fileMode to false in config file either using command or manually.then apply chmod command to change the permissions of all files such as and again set core.fileMode to true.For best practises don\'t Keep core.fileMode false always.
