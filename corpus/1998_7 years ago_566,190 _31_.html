What is the correct way to check for equality between Strings in JavaScript?always Until you fully understand the differences and implications of using the == and === operators, use the === operator since it will save you from obscure (non-obvious) bugs and WTFs.  The "regular" == operator can have very unexpected results due to the type-coercion internally, so using === is always the recommended approach.For insight into this, and other "good vs. bad" parts of Javascript read up on Mr. Douglas Crockford and his work.  There\'s a great Google Tech Talk where he summarizes lots of good info: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQVTIJBZookUpdate:The You Don\'t Know JS series by Kyle Simpson is excellent (and free to read online).  The series goes into the commonly misunderstood areas of the language and explains the "bad parts" that Crockford suggests you avoid.  By understanding them you can make proper use of them and avoid the pitfalls.The "Up & Going" book includes a section on Equality, with this specific summary of when to use the loose (==) vs strict (===) operators:To boil down a whole lot of details to a few simple takeaways, and help you know whether to use == or === in various situations, here are my simple rules:I still recommend Crockford\'s talk for developers who don\'t want to invest the time to really understand Javascriptâ€”it\'s good advice for a developer who only occasionally works in Javascript.If you know they are strings, then there\'s no need to check for type.However, note that string objects will not be equal.will return false.Call the valueOf() method to convert it to a primitive for String objects,will return trueUnless you really know how coercion works, you should avoid == and use the identity operator === instead. But you should read this to understand how it works.If you use ==, you let the language do some type coercion for you, so for example:As Douglas Crockford\'s said in his book: It\xe2\x80\x99s always better use the identity operator.what led me to this question is the padding and white-spaces check my caseand title was "           this word"so maybe you have to use trim function like thisJust one addition to the answers: If all these methods return false, even if the strings seem to be equal, it is possible that there is a whitespace to the left and or right of one string. So, just put a .trim() at the end of the strings before comparing:I have lost hours trying to figure out what is wrong.\nHope this will help to someone!There are actually two ways in which strings can be made in javascript.var str = \'Javascript\'; This creates a primitive string value.var obj = new String(\'Javascript\'); This creates a wrapper object\nof type String.typeof str // string\ntypeof obj // objectSo the best way to check for equality is using the === operator because it checks value as well as type of both operands.If you want to check for equality between two objects then using String.prototype.valueOf is the correct way.I\'ve provided some code (same as below) to explain JavaScript type-converting equality comparison with examples.
