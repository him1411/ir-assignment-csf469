Whenever I use sys.path.append, the new directory will be added. However, once I close python, the list will revert to the previous (default?) values. How do I permanently add a directory to PYTHONPATH?You need to add your new directory to the environment variable PYTHONPATH, separated by a colon from previous contents thereof.  In any form of Unix, you can do that in a startup script appropriate to whatever shell you\'re using (.profile or whatever, depending on your favorite shell) with a command which, again, depends on the shell in question; in Windows, you can do it through the system GUI for the purpose.superuser.com may be a better place to ask further, i.e. for more details if you need specifics about how to enrich an environment variable in your chosen platform and shell, since it\'s not really a programming question per se.If you\'re using bash (on a Mac or GNU/Linux distro), add this to your ~/.bashrcInstead of manipulating PYTHONPATH you can also create a path configuration file. First find out in which directory Python searches for this information:For some reason this doesn\'t seem to work in Python 2.7. There you can use:Then create a .pth file in that directory containing the path you want to add (create the directory if it doesn\'t exist).For example:In case anyone is still confused - if you are on a Mac, do the following:This works on WindowsThen you\'ll be able to see all modules within those paths from your scripts.You could add the path via your pythonrc file, which defaults to ~/.pythonrc on linux. ie.You could also set the PYTHONPATH environment variable, in a global rc file, such ~/.profile on mac or linux, or via Control Panel -> System -> Advanced tab -> Environment Variables on windows.On linux you can create a symbolic link from your package to a directory of the PYTHONPATH without having to deal with the environment variables. Something like:For me it worked when I changed the .bash_profile file. Just changing .bashrc file worked only till I restarted the shell.For python 2.7 it should look like:at the end of the .bash_profile file.Just to add on awesomo\'s answer, you can also add that line into your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.profileTo give a bit more explanation, Python will automatically construct its search paths (as has mentioned above and here) using the site.py script (typically located in sys.prefix + lib/python/site-packages as well as lib/site-python). One can obtain the value of sys.prefix:The site.py script then adds a number of directories, dependent upon the platform, such as /usr/{lib,share}/python/dist-packages, /usr/local/lib/python/dist-packages to the search path and also searches these paths for <package>.pth config files which contain specific additional search paths. For example easy-install maintains its collection of installed packages which are added to a system specific file e.g on Ubuntu it\'s /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/easy-install.pth. On a typical system there are a bunch of these .pth files around which can explain some unexpected paths in sys.path:So one can create a .pth file and put in any of these directories (including the sitedir as mentioned above). This seems to be the way most packages get added to the sys.path as opposed to using the PYTHONPATH.I added permanently in Windows Vista, Python 3.5System > Control Panel > Advanced system settings > Advanced (tap) Environment Variables > System variables > (if you don\'t see PYTHONPATH in Variable column) (click) New > Variable name: PYTHONPATH > Variable value: Please, write the directory in the Variable value.
