I\'m working on a CMS that fetches a user\'s profile image from their Facebook URL (that is, http://facebook.com/users_unique_url). How can I accomplish this? Is there a Faceboook API call that fetches a user\'s profile image URL without the user needing to Allow the application?Simply fetch the data through this URL:http://graph.facebook.com/userid_here/pictureReplace userid_here with id of the user you want to get the photo of. You can also use HTTPS as well.You can use the PHP\'s file_get_contents function to read that URL and process the retrieved data.Resource:http://developers.facebook.com/docs/apiNote: In php.ini, you need to make sure that the OpenSSL extension is enabled to use thefile_get_contents function of PHP to read that URL.To show:NOTE: Don\'t use this. See @Foreever\'s comment below.Where $fid is your user id (or nickname) on Facebook.. NOTE: In case of images marked as "18+" you will need a valid access_token from a 18+ user:UPDATE:Starting end August 2012, the API has been updated to allow you to retrieve user\'s profile pictures in varying sizes. Add the optional width and height fields as URL parameters:where WIDTH and HEIGHT are your requested dimension values.This will return a profile picture with a minimum size of WIDTH x HEIGHT while trying to preserve the aspect ratio. For example,returnsEND UPDATETo get a user\'s profile picture, callwhere USER_ID can be the user id number or the user name.To get a user profile picture of a specific size, callwhere SIZE should be replaced with one of the wordsdepending on the size you want.This call will return a URL to a single image with its size based on your chosen type parameter.For example:returns a URL to a small version of the image.The API only specifies the maximum size for profile images, not the actual size.Square:maximum width and height of 50 pixels.Smallmaximum width of 50 pixels and a maximum height of 150 pixels.Normalmaximum width of 100 pixels and a maximum height of 300 pixels.Largemaximum width of 200 pixels and a maximum height of 600 pixels.If you call the default USER_ID/picture you get the square type.CLARIFICATIONIf you call (as per above example)it will return a JSON response if you\'re using one of the Facebook SDKs request methods. Otherwise it will return the image itself. To always retrieve the JSON, add:like so:To get the image URL, NOT binary content:You must use your FACEBOOK ID, NOT USERNAME. You can get your facebook id there:http://findmyfbid.com/Simple one-line code to save FULL size profile image on your server.This will only work if openssl will be enabled in php.ini.Added this as a comment to accepted answer, but felt it deserved a longer explanation. Starting around April 2015 this will probably be raised a few times.As of V2 of the graph api the accepted answer no longer works using a username. So now you need the userid first, and you can no longer use a username to get this. To further complicate matters, for privacy reasons, Facebook is now changing userid\'s per app (see https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.2/user/ and https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/upgrading/#upgrading_v2_0_user_ids ), so you will have to have some kind of proper authentication to retrieve a userid you can use. Technically the profile pic is still public and available at /userid/picture (see docs at https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.0/user/picture and this example user: http://graph.facebook.com/v2.2/4/picture?redirect=0) however figuring out a user\'s standard userid seems impossible based just on their profile - your app would need to get them to approve interaction with the app which for my use case (just showing a profile pic next to their FB profile link) is overkill. If someone has figured out a way to get the profile pic based on username, or alternatively, how to get a userid (even an alternating one) to use to retrieve a profile pic, please share! In the meantime, the old graph url still works until April 2015.There is way to do that ;)Thanks to "http://it.toolbox.com/wiki/index.php/Use_curl_from_PHP_-_processing_response_headers":I was thinking - maybe ID will be a useful tool. Every time a user creates a new account it should get a higher ID. I googled and found that there is a method to estimate the account creation date by ID and Massoud Seifi from metadatascience.com gathered some good data about it.Read this article:http://metadatascience.com/2013/03/11/inferring-facebook-account-creation-date-from-facebook-user-id/And here are some IDs to download:http://metadatascience.com/2013/03/14/lookup-table-for-inferring-facebook-account-creation-date-from-facebook-user-id/One way is to use the code Gamlet posted in his answer:Save it as curl.phpThen in your file:I thought I would post this, because it took me a bit of time to figure out the particulars... Even though profile pictures are public, you still need to have an access token in there to get it when you curl it.Working PHP (HTTP GET) solution from April 2015 (without PHP 5 SDK):You can change \'type\' in parametr:Square:maximum width and height of 50 pixels.Smallmaximum width of 50 pixels and a maximum height of 150 pixels.Normalmaximum width of 100 pixels and a maximum height of 300 pixels.Largemaximum width of 200 pixels and a maximum height of 600 pixels.The blog post Grab the Picture of a Facebook Graph Object might offer another form of solution. Use the code in the tutorial along with the Facebook\'s Graph API and its PHP SDK library.... And try not to use file_get_contents (unless you\'re ready to face the consequences - see file_get_contents vs curl).Are you concerned about the profile picture size? at the time of implementing login with Facebook using PHP. We\xe2\x80\x99ll show you the simple way to get large size profile picture in Facebook PHP SDK. Also, you can get the custom size image of Facebook profile.Set the profile picture dimension by using the following line of code.$userProfile = $facebook->api(\'/me?fields=picture.width(400).height(400)\');check this post:http://www.codexworld.com/how-to-guides/get-large-size-profile-picture-in-facebook-php-sdk/@NaturalBornCamper,Nice code! Here is a clean-cut code function for such process!This will return the raw Facebook avatar image URL. Feel free to do whatever you want with it then!
