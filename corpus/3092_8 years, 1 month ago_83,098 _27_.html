I have a big HTML file that has lots of markup that looks like this:I\'m trying to do a Vim search-and-replace to get rid of all class="" and style="" but I\'m having trouble making the match ungreedy.My first attempt was thisbut Vim doesn\'t seem to like the ?.  Unfortunately removing the ? makes the match too greedy.How can I make my match ungreedy?Instead of .* use .\\{-}.%s/style=".\\{-}"//gAlso, see :help non-greedyNon greedy search in vim is done using {-} operator. Like this:just try:What\'s wrong withIf you\'re more comfortable PCRE regex syntax, whichyou have [g]vim compiled with perl feature, test using:ver and inspect features; if +perl is there you\'re good to go)try search/replace usingExample. Swap src and alt attributes in img tag:I\'ve found that a good solution to this type of question is:(or perl if you prefer).  IOW, rather than learning vim\'s regex peculiarities, use a tool you already know.  Using perl would make the ? modifier work to ungreedy the match.With \\v (as suggested in several comments)Plugin eregex.vim handles Perl-style non-greedy operators *? and +?G\'day,Vim\'s regexp processing is not too brilliant. I\'ve found that the regexp syntax for sed is about the right match for vim\'s capabilities.I usually set the search highlighting on (:set hlsearch) and then play with the regexp after entering a slash to enter search mode.Edit: Mark, that trick to minimise greedy matching is also covered in Dale Dougherty\'s excellent book "Sed & Awk" (sanitised Amazon link).Chapter Three "Understanding Regular Expression Syntax" is an excellent intro to the more primitive regexp capabilities involved with sed and awk. Only a short read and highly recommended.HTHcheers,
