I am facing the below issue and am unable to build the application.XXX has conflicting provisioning settings. XXX is automatically\n  provisioned, but provisioning profile WildCard has been manually\n  specified. Set the provisioning profile value to "Automatic" in the\n  build settings editor, or switch to manual provisioning in the target\n  editor. Code signing is required for product type \'Application\' in SDK\n  \'iOS 10.0\'I am also unable to choose a particular profile.How to resolve this issue?Holy molly, I had to do all this in order for it to work. A picture is worth a thousand words.If you get this error while archiving then continue reading.Go to your app and click on the general tab. Under the signing section, uncheck "Automatically manage signing". As soon as you do that you will get a status of red error as shown below.Now here\'s the tricky part. You need to uncheck "Automatically manage Signing" in both the targets under your project. This step is very important.Now go under "build settings" tab of each of those targets and set "iOS Developer" under code signing identity. Do the same steps for your "PROJECT".Now do Xcode \xe2\x86\x92 Product \xe2\x86\x92 Clean. Close your project in Xcode and reopen it again.After this go to the general tab of each of your targets and check "Automatically manage signing" and under team drop down select your developer accountDo an archive of your project again and everything should work. Really, Apple? Was this supposed to make our lives easier?Great, now we can choose the profile for Debug and Release separately in the general tab itself as illustrated in the image below.Also when you click on Automatically manage signing it does all process that are created by Fix issue in previous Xcode versions. Disabling automatic and then re-enabling has solved this for me in Xcode 8 GM seed. This can be done in the project settings, info tab for each target that needs to be signed.For resovle this issue:Good luck!This is what I would call a classically Apple Xcode UX design bug. The error said there is a bunch of stuff YOU DID WRONG LOCALLY.The error actually meant "we have a new agreement you did not accept online".After checking and unchecking the Automatic Signing button I got this agreement error to display:Signing into the developer portal I was able to see a banner for the agreement update notice:.\nRestarting Xcode 8 then cleared that error and only forced me to reselect the certificate I already had on my machine and tied to the project.This could have been handled in a less confusing implementation, but this is how I fixed it. I am putting it here because it\'s way different than the steps everyone else gave.Oh and yeah, having the pre-latest iOS 10 device and latest Xcode (I was on 7.3.1 or something) also threw errors until I updated.I fixed it doing this:Set your team for all the targets of your project. Including the extensions. And left the automatic signing management.Steps:I hate to say it. I just quit Xcode and opened it again. Simple and effective :)I only needed to uncheck \'Automatically manage signing\', check it again, and rebuild.This is how it worked for me:P.S Killing Xcode and launch again is the best thing to do if facing any random issueIf you are finding the following screen and facing the problem of code signing required, then one of the following solutions may help you.Solution 1. As said before, sign in with an Apple ID. Then you will get options like this, if you enter correct bundle identifier. Then select the appropriate profile from the list.Solution 2. If you don\'t want to sign in with your Apple ID, then change a small flag in project.pbxproj file. Find the following text in the project file.Change flag ProvisioningStyle = Automatic; to ProvisioningStyle = Manual; Refer to the following image. After changing the flag, you will see the options to select appropriate profile from the list.Click on Add Account if not signed in. Then after select your team profile and check Automatically manage signing and leave everything else as is in Xcode. It will perform the remaining stuff by itself.I ran into this type error by updating the Xcode version to 8.0,\nand under the Code signing is required for product type \'Application\' in SDK \'iOS 10.0\'There is a warning:isn\'t code signed but requires entitlements. It is not possible to add entitlements to a binary without signing it.My solution is go to the TARGET \xe2\x86\x92 General \xe2\x86\x92 Signing -> click the  Enable signing... button, and I solved the issue.Firstly in general tab -> signing section -> select a development team, manage signings Similarly if you are working with multiple pod files select each pod target separately and go to general tab -> signing section -> select a development team, manage signings repeat the same process for all pods in your projectClean -> Build the project.This worked for meIn unit test targetXcode 7:  Xcode 8:  Even when installing the Watch OS application extension, the same error occured in Xcode 8.1:After updating the Provisioning Profile to Empty in Project of Build\nSettings, everything work fine.&& Code Signing Identity to iOS Developer in every targets Build Settings.I upgraded to Xcode 8, and iOS 10, but I had the problem.I fixed it by going to project general tab, signing section.Click "Enable signing....."That is it.If you get this error while compiling in Microsoft Mobile Center\xe2\x9d\x8c  Code signing is required for product type \'Application\' in SDK\n  \'iOS 10.3\'** ARCHIVE FAILED **be aware that Mobile center doesn\'t yet support automatic signing with certificates of type app-store, ad-hoc and enterprise. Automatic signing only works with development certificates.There are two things you can do to work around that limitation:Use a development certificate. You\'ll have to create a new one in the developer.apple.com portal, download it to your machine, export it to a .p12 file using keychain, then finally provide it to Mobile Center. You know the drill.Disable automatic signing. You will find that setting in Xcode in your project targets. Once disabled, a little "i" button will be displayed next to the "Xcode managed profile" label. Click that button, some info about the profile will be displayed. On the top left corner of that window, a "PROV" icon is displayed. That is the provisioning profile that you should provide to Mobile Center. Drag and drop the icon into the corresponding field in Mobile Center..  1.1: If you are using p12 and a provision file, but not using AppID to log in, do not Select Automatically manage signing.Which means you don\'t need to set your team. Just select your provision file and the machine code signing identity in Build Settings, like this Build Settings. Make sure the parameters are set as well.And then go back to General. You will see General set, and that\'s OK.Just download your provisioning profile again from your developer account.\nAnd sign out all developer accounts from Xcode \xe2\x86\x92 Preferences \xe2\x86\x92  Accounts \xe2\x86\x92  *Select Account showing at left and press -(subtract sign)After deleting all accounts, press the + sign (add) button and sign in with all developer accounts.It will work like a charm...It is because you have not choosen a team when you created the project.I am such fixed. And I choose it in build settings, but invalid. I must create a new project."I choose it in build settings, but invalid. I must create a new project." is wrong.It is invalid because I have not chosen it in extension. You must choose a profile at your project\'s all extension, and there is no need to create a new.[2
