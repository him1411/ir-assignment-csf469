The very common directory structure for even a simple Python module seems to be to separate the unit tests into their own test directory:for example see this Python project howto.My question is simply What\'s the usual way of actually running the tests? I suspect this is obvious to everyone except me, but you can\'t just run python test_antigravity.py from the test directory as its import antigravity will fail as the module is not on the path.I know I could modify PYTHONPATH and other search path related tricks, but I can\'t believe that\'s the simplest way - it\'s fine if you\'re the developer but not realistic to expect your users to use if they just want to check the tests are passing.The other alternative is just to copy the test file into the other directory, but it seems a bit dumb and misses the point of having them in a separate directory to start with.So, if you had just downloaded the source to my new project how would you run the unit tests? I\'d prefer an answer that would let me say to my users: "To run the unit tests do X."The best solution in my opinion is to use the unittest command line interface which will add the directory to the sys.path so you don\'t have to (done in the TestLoader class).For example for a directory structure like this:You can just run:For a directory structure like yours:And in the test modules inside the test package, you can import the antigravity package and its modules as usual:Running a single test module:To run a single test module, in this case test_antigravity.py:Just reference the test module the same way you import it.Running a single test case or test method:Also you can run a single TestCase or a single test method:Running all tests:You can also use test discovery which will discover and run all the tests for you, they must be modules or packages named test*.py (can be changed with the -p, --pattern flag):This will run all the test*.py modules inside the test package.The simplest solution for your users is to provide an executable script (runtests.py or some such) which bootstraps the necessary test environment, including, if needed, adding your root project directory to sys.path temporarily. This doesn\'t require users to set environment variables, something like this works fine in a bootstrap script:Then your instructions to your users can be as simple as "python runtests.py".Of course, if the path you need really is os.path.dirname(__file__), then you don\'t need to add it to sys.path at all; Python always puts the directory of the currently running script at the beginning of sys.path, so depending on your directory structure, just locating your runtests.py at the right place might be all that\'s needed.Also, the unittest module in Python 2.7+ (which is backported as unittest2 for Python 2.6 and earlier) now has test discovery built-in, so nose is no longer necessary if you want automated test discovery: your user instructions can be as simple as "python -m unittest discover".From the article you linked to:Create a test_modulename.py file and\n  put your unittest tests in it. Since\n  the test modules are in a separate\n  directory from your code, you may need\n  to add your module\xe2\x80\x99s parent directory\n  to your PYTHONPATH in order to run\n  them:Finally, there is one more popular\n  unit testing framework for Python\n  (it\xe2\x80\x99s that important!), nose. nose\n  helps simplify and extend the builtin\n  unittest framework (it can, for\n  example, automagically find your test\n  code and setup your PYTHONPATH for\n  you), but it is not included with the\n  standard Python distribution.Perhaps you should look at nose as it suggests?I generally create a "run tests" script in the project directory (the one that is common to both the source directory and test) that loads my "All Tests" suite. This is usually boilerplate code, so I can reuse it from project to project.run_tests.py:test/all_tests.py (from How do I run all Python unit tests in a directory?)With this setup, you can indeed just include antigravity in your test modules. The downside is you would need more support code to execute a particular test... I just run them all every time.Use setup.py develop to make your working directory be part of the installed Python environment, then run the tests.if you run "python setup.py develop" then the package will be in the path. But you may not want to do that because you could infect your system python installation, which is why tools like virtualenv and buildout exist.  I had the same problem, with a separate unit tests folder. From the mentioned suggestions I add the absolute source path to sys.path.The benefit of the following solution is, that one can run the file test/test_yourmodule.py without changing at first into the test-directory:It\'s possible to use wrapper which runs selected or all tests.For instance:or to run all tests recursively use extended globbing (tests/**/*.py).The wrapper can basically use argparse to parse the arguments like:Then load all the tests:then add them into your test suite (using inspect):and run them:Check this example for more details.See also: How to run all Python unit tests in a directory?If you use VS Code and your tests are located on the same level as your project then running and debug your code doesn\'t work out of the box. What you can do is change your launch.json file:The key line here is envFileIn the root of your project add .env fileInside of your .env file add path to the root of your project. This will temporarily add PYTHONPATH=C:\\YOUR\\PYTHON\\PROJECT\\ROOT_DIRECTORYpath to your project and you will be able to use debug unit tests from VS CodeSolution/Example for Python unittest moduleGiven the following project structure:You can run your project from the root directory with python project_name, which calls ProjectName/project_name/__main__.py.To run your tests with python test, effectively running ProjectName/test/__main__.py, you need to do the following:1) Turn your test/models directory into a package by adding a __init__.py file. This makes the test cases within the sub directory accessible from the parent test directory.2) Modify your system path in test/__main__.py to include the project_name directory.Now you can successfully import things from project_name in your tests.Following is my project structure:I found it better to import in the setUp() method:What\'s the usual way of actually running the testsI use Python 3.6.2To install pytest: sudo pip install pytestI didn\'t set any path variable and my imports are not failing with the same "test" project structure.I commented out this stuff: if __name__ == \'__main__\' like this:test_antigravity.pyI noticed that if you run the unittest command line interface from your "src" directory, then imports work correctly without modification.If you want to put that in a batch file in your project directory, you can do this:You should really use the pip tool.Use pip install -e to install your package in development mode. This is a very good practise.In the Ref url given below, 2 classic project (with test) layout are given, you can follow any of them.Ref:
