I\'ve got a simple package.json file and I want to add a comment. Is there a way to do this, or are there any hacks to make this work?The example comment above doesn\'t work as npm breaks. I\'ve also tried // style comments.This has recently been discussed in the node.js mailing list.According to Isaac Schlueter who created npm:... the "//" key will never be used by npm for any purpose, and is reserved for comments ... If you want to use a multiple line comment, you can use either an \n  array, or multiple "//" keys.Here is another hack for adding comments in JSON.  Since:Is equivalent to You can do something like:You can always abuse the fact that duplicated keys are overwritten. This is what I just wrote:However, it is not clear whether JSON allows duplicated keys (see\nDoes JSON syntax allow duplicate keys in an object?. It seems to work with npm, so I take the risk.The recommened hack is to use "//" keys (from the nodejs mailing list). When I tested it, it did not work with "dependencies" sections, though. Also, the example in the post uses multiple "//" keys, which implies that npm does not reject JSON files with duplicated keys. In other words, the hack above should always be fine.Update: One annoying disadvantage of the duplicated key hack is that npm install --save silently eliminates all duplicates. Unfortunately, it is very easy to overlook it and your well-intentioned comments are gone.The "//" hack is still the safest as it seems. However, multi-line comments will be removed by npm install --save, too.I have a funny hack idea.Create npm package name suitably as comment divider for dependencies and devDependencies block in package.json, for example x----x----xNOTE: Must add last comment divider line with valid version like * in block.Here\'s my take on comments within package.json / bower.json:I have package.json.js that contains a script that exports the actual package.json. Running the script overwrites the old package.json and tells me what changes it made, perfect to help you keep track of automatic changes npm made. That way I can even programatically define what packages I want to use. The latest grunt task is here:\nhttps://gist.github.com/MarZab/72fa6b85bc9e71de5991NPS (Node Package Scripts) solved this problem for me. Lets you put your NPM scripts into a separate JS file, where you can add comments galore and any other JS logic you need to.\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/npsSample of the package-scripts.js from one of my projectsI just did a local install npm install nps -save-dev and put this in my package.json scripts.So far, most "hacks" here suggest to abuse JSON. But instead, why not abuse the underlying scripting language?Edit The initial response was putting the description on the right using # add comments here to wrap it; however, this does not work on Windows, because flags (e.g. npm run myframework -- --myframework-flags) would be ignored. I changed my response to make it work on all platforms, and added some indents for readability purposes.This will:After wasting an hour on complex and hacky solutions I\'ve found myself a pretty simple, elegant and valid solution for commenting my bulky dependencies section in package.json. Just like this:When sorted the same way, it\'s now very easy for me to track these pairs of dependencies/comments either in git commit diffs or in editor while working with package.json.And no extra tools involved, just plain and valid JSON.Hope this helps anyone.
