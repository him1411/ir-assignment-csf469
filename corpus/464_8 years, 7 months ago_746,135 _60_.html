How do I trim a string in JavaScript?Since new Browsers (IE9+) have trim() already implemented, you should only implement trim() if it is not already available on the Prototype-Object (overriding it is a huge performance hit). This is generally recommended when extending Native Objects! Note that the added property is enumerable unless you use ES5 Object.defineProperty!For those browsers who does not support trim(), you can use this polyfill from MDN:See this:The trim from jQuery is convenient if you are already using that framework. I tend to use jQuery often, so trimming strings with it is natural for me.  But it\'s possible that there is backlash against jQuery out there? :) Although there are a bunch of correct answers above, it should be noted that the String object in JavaScript has a native .trim() method as of ECMAScript 5.  Thus ideally any attempt to prototype the trim method should really check to see if it already exists first.Added natively in:\nJavaScript 1.8.1 / ECMAScript 5Thus supported in:Firefox: 3.5+Safari: 5+Internet Explorer: IE9+ (in Standards mode only!) http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/06/25/enhanced-scripting-in-ie9-ecmascript-5-support-and-more.aspxChrome: 5+Opera: 10.5+ECMAScript 5 Support Table: http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/There are a lot of implementations that can be used. The most obvious seems to be something like this:Simple version here What is a general function for JavaScript trim?I know this question has been asked three years back.Now,String.trim() was added natively in JavaScript.For an instance, you can trim directly as following, Flagrant Badassery has 11 different trims with benchmark information:http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/faster-trim-javascriptNon-surprisingly regexp-based are slower than traditional loop.Here is my personal one. This code is old! I wrote it for JavaScript1.1 and Netscape 3 and it has been only slightly updated since. (Original used String.charAt)If you are using JQuery use jQuery.trim() function. For example,\nif( jQuery.trim(StringVariable) == \'\') Use the Native JavaScript Methods: String.trimLeft(), String.trimRight(), and String.trim().\nString.trim() is supported in IE9+ and all other major browsers:\nString.trimLeft() and String.trimRight() are non-standard, but are supported in all major browsers except IE\nIE support is easy with a polyfill however:Now days you can use string.trim() that is native Javascript implementationSee also Shamelessly stolen from Matt duereg.Trim code from angular js  projectand call it as trim(" hello ")Here\'s a very simple way:You can just declare your variable as string and use its trim function: use simply codeBrowser supportFor old browser add prototypeToday, pretty much every browser supports String.prototype.trim().You use it like this :In case you still might need to support an ancient browser that doesn\'t support this feature, this is a polyfill suggested by the MDN :I have a lib that uses trim. so solved it by using the following code.From the previous answers, it differs adding flag m. Flag m will search the text of several linear. In this mode, the mark the beginning and end of the pattern (^ $) is inserted before and after the newline character (\\n).Don\'t know what bugs can hide here, but I use this:Or this, if text contain enters:Another try:Here it is in TypeScript:It will fall back to the regex if the native prototype is not available.I had written this function for trim, when the .trim() function was not available in JS way back in 2008. Some of the older browsers still do not support the .trim() function and i hope this function may help somebody.TRIM FUNCTIONExplanation: The function trim() accept a string object and remove any starting and trailing whitespaces (spaces,tabs and newlines) and return the trimmed string. You can use this function to trim form inputs to ensure valid data to be sent.The function can be called in the following manner as an example.You can do it using the plain JavaScript:Here are some of the more examples to trim a string using JavaScript.mine uses a single regex to look for cases where trimming is necessary, and uses that regex\'s results to determine desired substring bounds:the one design decision that went into this was using a substring to perform the final capture. s/\\?:// (make the middle term capturing) and and the replacement fragment becomes:there\'s two performance bets I made in these impls:does the substring implementation copy the original string\'s data? if so, in the first, when a string needs to be trimmed there is a double traversal, first in the regex (which may, hopefully be partial), and second in the substring extraction. hopefully a substring implementation only references the original string, so operations like substring can be nearly free. cross fingershow good is the capture in the regex impl? the middle term, the output value, could potentially be very long. i wasn\'t ready to bank that all regex impls\' capturing wouldn\'t balk at a couple hundred KB input capture, but i also did not test (too many runtimes, sorry!). the second ALWAYS runs a capture; if your engine can do this without taking a hit, perhaps using some of the above string-roping-techniques, for sure USE IT!For IE9+ and other browsers
