How to convert String object to Boolean object?Try (depending on what result type you want):Advantage: The official documentation is in the Javadoc.UPDATED: Autoboxing could also be used, but it has a performance cost.\nI suggest to use it only when you would have to cast yourself, not when the cast is avoidable.You have to be carefull when using Boolean.valueOf(string) or Boolean.parseBoolean(string). The reason for this is that the methods will always return false if the String is not equal to "true" (the case is ignored).For example: Because of that behaviour I would recommend to add some mechanism to ensure that the string which should be translated to a Boolean follows a specified format.For instance:Beside the excellent answer of KLE, we can also make something more flexible:(inspired by zlajo\'s answer... :-))The value of b is true if the string is not a null and equal to true (ignoring case).My way to convert string to boolean.To get the boolean value of a String, try this:If there is an error, it will return null.\nExample:Result:This is how I did it:"1##true".contains( string )For my case is mostly either 1 or true. I use hashes as dividers. Why not use a regular expression ?you can directly set boolean value equivalent to any string by System class\nand access it anywhere..Visit http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.boolean.parse.aspxThis will give you an idea of what to do.This is what I get from the Java documentation:Method DetailparseBooleanpublic static boolean parseBoolean(String s)Parses the string argument as a boolean. The boolean returned represents the value true if the string argument is not null and is equal, ignoring case, to the string "true".Parameters:s - the String containing the boolean representation to be parsedReturns: the boolean represented by the string argumentSince:\n  1.5
