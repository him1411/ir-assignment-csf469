I have quite a few controls scattered throughout many table cells in my table, and I was wondering if there\'s an easier way to dismiss the keyboard without having to loop through all my controls and resigning them all as the first responder. I guess the question is.. How would I get the current first responder to the keyboard?Try:\n[self.view endEditing:YES];You can force the currently-editing view to resign its first responder status with [view endEditing:YES]. This hides the keyboard. Unlike -[UIResponder resignFirstResponder], -[UIView endEditing:] will search through subviews to find the current first responder.  So you can send it to your top-level view (e.g. self.view in a UIViewController) and it will do the right thing.(This answer previously included a couple of other solutions, which also worked but were more complicated than is necessary. I\'ve removed them to avoid confusion.)You can send a nil targeted action to the application, it\'ll resign first responder at any time without having to worry about which view currently has first responder status.Objective-C:Swift 3.0:Nil targeted actions are common on Mac OS X for menu commands, and here\'s a use for them on iOS.To be honest, I\'m not crazy about any of the solutions proposed here.  I did find a nice way to use a TapGestureRecognizer that I think gets to the heart of your problem: When you click on anything besides the keyboard, dismiss the keyboard. In viewDidLoad, register to receive keyboard notifications and create a UITapGestureRecognizer:Add the keyboard show/hide responders.  There you add and remove the TapGestureRecognizer to the UIView that should dismiss the keyboard when tapped.  Note: You do not have to add it to all of the sub-views or controls.The TapGestureRecognizer will call your function when it gets a tap and you can dismiss the keyboard like this:The nice thing about this solution is that it only filters for Taps, not swipes.  So if you have scrolling content above the keyboard, swipes will still scroll and leave the keyboard displayed.  By removing the gesture recognizer after the keyboard is gone, future taps on your view get handled normally.This is a solution to make the keyboard go away when hit return in any textfield, by adding code in one place (so don\'t have to add a handler for each textfield):consider this scenario: i have a viewcontroller with two textfields (username and password).\nand the viewcontroller implements UITextFieldDelegate protocoli do this in viewDidLoadand the viewcontroller implements the optional method asand irrespective of the textfield you are in, as soon as i hit return in the keyboard, it gets dismissed!In your case, the same would work as long as you set all the textfield\'s delegate to self and implement textFieldShouldReturnA better approach is to have something "steal" first responder status.Since UIApplication is a subclass of UIResponder, you could try:Failing that, create a new UITextField with a zero sized frame, add it to a view somewhere and do something similar (become followed by resign).Tuck this away in some utility class.@Nicholas Riley & @Kendall Helmstetter Geln & @cannyboy:Absolutely brilliant!Thank you.Considering your advice and the advice of others in this thread, this is what I\'ve done:What it looks like when used:[[self appDelegate] dismissKeyboard]; (note: I added appDelegate as an addition to NSObject so I can use anywhere on anything)What it looks like under the hood:EDITAmendment to my answer to included tempTextField.enabled = NO;.  Disabling the text field will prevent UIKeyboardWillShowNotification and UIKeyboardWillHideNotification keyboard notifications from being sent should you rely on these notifications throughout your app.A lot of overly-complicated answers here, perhaps because this is not easy to find in the iOS documentation. JosephH had it right above:Quick tip on how to dismiss the keyboard in iOS when a user touches anywhere on the screen outside of the UITextField or keyboard. Considering how much real estate the iOS keyboard can take up, it makes sense to have an easy and intuitive way for your users to dismiss the keyboard.Here\'s a linkEven Simpler than Meagar\'s answeroverwrite touchesBegan:withEvent: This will dismiss the keyboardwhen you touch anywhere in the background.In your view controller\'s header file add <UITextFieldDelegate> to the definition of your controller\'s interface so that it conform to the UITextField delegate protocol...... In the controller\'s implementation file (.m) add the following method, or the code inside it if you already have a viewDidLoad method ...... Then,  link yourTextBox to your actual text field Here\'s what I use in my code. It works like a charm!In yourviewcontroller.h add:@property (nonatomic) UITapGestureRecognizer *tapRecognizer;Now in the .m file, add this to your ViewDidLoad function:Also, add this function in the .m file:You should send endEditing: to working window being the subclass of UIViewJeremy\'s answer wasn\'t quite working for me, I think because I had a navigation stack in a tab view with a modal dialog on top of it.  I\'m using the following right now and it is working for me, but your mileage may vary.You may also need to override UIViewController disablesAutomaticKeyboardDismissal to get this to work in some cases. This may have to be done on the UINavigationController if you have one.Subclass your textfields... and also textviewsIn the subclass put this code..  In the textfield delegates (similarly for textview delegates)All set.. Now just post the notification from anywhere in your code. It will resign any keyboard.And in swift we can do To dismiss a keyboard after the keyboard has popped up, there are 2 cases,when the UITextField is inside a UIScrollView when the UITextField is outside a UIScrollView 2.when the UITextField is outside a UIScrollView\noverride the method in your UIViewController subclassyou must also add delegate for all UITextViewto create a IBAction, press ctrl+ click the UITapGesture and drag it to the .h file of viewcontroller. Here I have named tappedEvent as my action namethe abouve given Information was derived from the following link, please refer for more information or contact me if you dont understand the abouve data.http://samwize.com/2014/03/27/dismiss-keyboard-when-tap-outside-a-uitextfield-slash-uitextview/The best way to dismiss keyboard from UITableView and UIScrollView are:In swift 3 you can do the followingI hate that there\'s no "global" way to programmatically dismiss the keyboard without using private API calls. Frequently, I have the need to dismiss the keyboard programmatically without knowing what object is the first responder. I\'ve resorted to inspecting the self using the Objective-C runtime API, enumerating through all of its properties, pulling out those which are of type UITextField, and sending them the resignFirstResponder message.It shouldn\'t be this hard to do this...It\'s not pretty, but the way I resign the firstResponder when I don\'t know what that the responder is:Create an UITextField, either in IB or programmatically. Make it Hidden. Link it up to your code if you made it in IB.\nThen, when you want to dismiss the keyboard, you switch the responder to the invisible text field, and immediately resign it:You can recursively iterate through subviews, store an array of all UITextFields, and then loop through them and resign them all.Not really a great solution, especially if you have a lot of subviews, but for simple apps it should do the trick.I solved this in a much more complicated, but much more performant way, but using a singleton/manager for the animation engine of my app, and any time a text field became the responder, I would assign assign it to a static which would get swept up (resigned) based on certain other events... its almost impossible for me to explain in a paragraph.Be creative, it only took me 10 minutes to think through this for my app after I found this question.A slightly more robust method I needed to use recently:I found some of the other "global" methods didn\'t work (for example, UIWebView & WKWebView refused to resign).Add A Tap Gesture Recognizer to your view.And define it ibaction your .m file will be like It\'s worked for meYes, endEditing is the best option. And From iOW 7.0, UIScrollView has a cool feature to dismiss the keyboard on interacting with the scroll view. For achieving this, you can set keyboardDismissMode property of UIScrollView.Set the keyboard dismiss mode as:It has few other types. Have a look at this apple document.In swift :the easist way is to call the methodYou have to use one of these methods,or
