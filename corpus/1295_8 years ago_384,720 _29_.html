Instead of individually calling $("#item").removeClass() for every single class an element might have, is there a single function which can be called which removes all CSS classes from the given element? Both jQuery and raw JavaScript will work.Calling removeClass with no parameters will remove all of the item\'s classes.You can also use (but is not necessarily recommended, the correct way is the one above):If you didn\'t have jQuery, then this would be pretty much your only option:Hang on, doesn\'t removeClass() default to removing all classes if nothing specific is specified? Sowill do it on its own...Just set the className attribute of the real DOM element to \'\' (nothing).Edit: Other people have said that just calling removeClass works - I tested this with the Google JQuery Playground: http://savedbythegoog.appspot.com/?id=ag5zYXZlZGJ5dGhlZ29vZ3ISCxIJU2F2ZWRDb2RlGIS61gEM ... and it works. So you can also do it this way:Of course.Heh, came searching for a similar answer. \nThen it hit me.Remove Specific ClassesSay if element has class="class another-class"The shortest methodno longer class attr wil be present in "elm".try with removeClassFor instance:1.2.$("#item").removeClass();$("#item").removeClass("class1 ... classn"); You can just tryIf you have to access to that element without class name, for example you have to add a new class name, you can do that:I use that function in my projet to remove and add class in a html builder. Good luck.Since not all versions of jQuery are created equal, you may run into the same issue I did which means calling $("#item").removeClass(); does not actually remove the class. (Probably a bug)A more reliable method is to simply use raw JavaScript and remove the class attribute altogether.I had similar issue. In my case on disabled elements was applied that aspNetDisabled class and all disabled controls had wrong colors. So, I used jquery to remove this class on every element/control I wont and everything works and looks great now.This is my code for removing aspNetDisabled class:
