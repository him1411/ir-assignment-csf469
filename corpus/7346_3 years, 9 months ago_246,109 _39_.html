So this is embarrassing. I\'ve got an application that I threw together in Flask and for now it is just serving up a single static HTML page with some links to CSS and JS. And I can\'t find where in the documentation Flask describes returning static files. Yes, I could use render_template but I know the data is not templatized. I\'d have thought send_file or url_for was the right thing, but I could not get those to work. In the meantime, I am opening the files, reading content, and rigging up a Response with appropriate mimetype:Someone want to give a code sample or url for this? I know this is going to be dead simple.The preferred method is to use nginx or another web server to serve static files; they\'ll be able to do it more efficiently than Flask.However, you can use send_from_directory to send files from a directory, which can be pretty convenient in some situations:Do not use send_file or send_static_file with an user-supplied path.send_static_file example:I\'m sure you\'ll find what you need there: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/quickstart/#static-filesBasically you just need a "static" folder at the root of your package, and then you can use url_for(\'static\', filename=\'foo.bar\') or directly link to your files with http://example.com/static/foo.bar.EDIT: As suggested in the comments you could directly use the \'/static/foo.bar\' URL path BUT url_for() overhead (performance wise) is quite low, and using it means that you\'ll be able to easily customise the behaviour afterwards (change the folder, change the URL path, move your static files to S3, etc).You can also, and this is my favorite, set a folder as static path so that the files inside are reachable for everyone.With that set you can use the standard HTML:What I use (and it\'s been working great) is a "templates" directory and a "static" directory. I place all my .html files/Flask templates inside the templates directory, and static contains CSS/JS. render_template works fine for generic html files to my knowledge, regardless of the extent at which you used Flask\'s templating syntax. Below is a sample call in my views.py file.Just make sure you use url_for() when you do want to reference some static file in the separate static directory. You\'ll probably end up doing this anyways in your CSS/JS file links in html. For instance...Here\'s a link to the "canonical" informal Flask tutorial - lots of great tips in here to help you hit the ground running. http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-worldYou can use this function :send_static_file(filename)\n    Function used internally to send static\n    files from the static folder to the browser.A simplest working example based on the other answers is the following:With the HTML called index.html:IMPORTANT: And index.html is in a folder called static, meaning <projectpath> has the .py file, and <projectpath>\\static has the html file.If you want the server to be visible on the network, use app.run(debug=True, host=\'0.0.0.0\')EDIT: For showing all files in the folder if requested, use thisWhich is essentially BlackMamba\'s answer, so give them an upvote.For angular+boilerplate flow which creates next folders tree:I use following solution:It helps to redefine \'static\' folder to custom.So i got things working (based on @user1671599 answer) and wanted to share it with you guys\n(i hope i\'m doing it right since it\'s my first app in python)so based on @user1671599 answer i did this -Project structure:server.py:AppStarter.py:If you just want to move the location of your static files, then the simplest method is to declare the paths in the constructor. In the example below, I have moved my templates and static files into a sub-folder called web.Using this method, the following URL will return a CSS file:And finally, here\'s a snap of the folder structure, where flask_server.py is the Flask instance:   By default, flask use a "templates" folder to contain all your template files(any plain-text file, but usually .html or some kind of template language such as jinja2 ) & a "static" folder to contain all your static files(i.e. .js .css and your images). \n   In your routes, u can use render_template() to render a template file (as I say above, by default it is placed in the templates folder) as the response for your request. And in the template file (it\'s usually a .html-like file), u may use some .js and/or `.css\' files, so I guess your question is how u link these static files to the current template file. This servers all the files (css & js...) referenced in your html file.If you are just trying to open a file, you could use  app.open_resource(). So reading a file would look something like
