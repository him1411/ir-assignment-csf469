In a Git code repository I want to list all commits that contain a certain word. I tried thisbut it does not necessarily give me back the filename (unless it\'s less that 5\nlines away from the word I searched for. I also triedbut it gives me only present files and not the history.How do I search the entire history so I can follow changes on a particular word? I mean to search my codebase for occurrences of word to track down changes (search in files history).If you want to find all commits where commit message contains given word, useIf you want to find all commits where "word" was added or removed in the file contents (to be more exact: where number of occurences of "word" changed), i.e. search the commit contents, use so called \'pickaxe\' search withIn modern git there is alsoto look for differences whose added or removed line matches "word" (also commit contents).Note that -G by default accepts a regex, while -S accepts a string, but can be modified to accept regexes using the --pickaxe-regex.To illustrate the difference between -S<regex> --pickaxe-regex and -G<regex>, consider a commit with the following diff in the same file:While git log -G"regexec\\(regexp" will show this commit, git log -S"regexec\\(regexp" --pickaxe-regex will not (because the number of occurrences of that string did not change).git log\'s pickaxe will find commits with changes including "word" with git log -SwordOne more way/syntax to do it is: git log -S "word"\nLike this you can search for example git log -S "with whitespaces and stuff @/#\xc3\xbc !"After a lot of experimentation, I can recommend the following, which shows commits that introduce or remove lines containing a given regexp, and displays the text changes in each, with colours showing words added and removed. Takes a while to run though... ;-)You can try the following command:or using grep in the following way:Run this command in the parent directory where you would like to search.vim-fugitive is versatile for that kind of examining in Vim. Use :Ggrep to do that. For more information you can install vim-fugitive and look up the turorial by :help Grep. And this episode: exploring-the-history-of-a-git-repository will guide you to do all that.To use boolean connector on regular expression:This regular expression search for regular expression [0-9]* or [a-z]* on commit messages.
