I keep hearing people say they\'re forking code in git.  Git "fork" sounds suspiciously like git "clone" plus some (meaningless) psychological willingness to forgo future merges.  There is no fork command in git, right?Github makes forks a little more real by stapling correspondence onto it.  That is, you press the fork button and later, when you press the pull request button, the system is smart enough to email the owner. Hence, it\'s a little bit of a dance around repo ownership and permissions.Yes/No? Any angst over Github extending git in this direction? Or any rumors of git absorbing the functionality?Fork, in the GitHub context,  doesn\'t extend Git.\nIt only allows clone on the server side.When you clone a GitHub repo on your local workstation, you cannot contribute back to the upstream repo unless you are explicitly declared as "contributor". That\'s because your clone is a separate instance of that project. If you want to contribute to the project, you can use forking to do it, in the following way:Check also "Collaborative GitHub Workflow".If you want to keep a link with the original repo (also called upstream), you need to add a remote referring that original repo.\nSee "What is the difference between origin and upstream in github"I keep hearing people say they\'re forking code in git. Git "fork" sounds suspiciously like git "clone" plus some (meaningless) psychological willingness to forgo future merges. There is no fork command in git, right?I think you have a funny idea of what "forking" means. It is a concept, not a command specifically supported by any version control system.The simplest kind of forking is synonymous with branching. Every time you create a branch, regardless of your VCS, you\'ve "forked". These forks are usually pretty easy to merge back together.The kind of fork you\'re talking about, where a separate party takes a complete copy of the code and walks away, necessarily happens outside the VCS in a centralized system like subversion. A distributed VCS like Git has much better support for forking the entire codebase and effectively starting a new project.Git (not GitHub) natively supports "forking" an entire repo (ie, cloning it) in a couple of ways:Git makes contributing changes back to the source of the fork is as simple as asking someone from the original project to pull from you, or requesting write access to push changes back yourself. This is the part that GitHub makes easier, and standardizes.Any angst over Github extending git in this direction? Or any rumors of git absorbing the functionality?There is no angst because your assumption is wrong. GitHub "extends" the forking functionality of Git with a nice GUI and a standardized way of issuing pull requests, but it doesn\'t add the functionality to Git. The concept of full-repo-forking is baked right into distributed version control at a fundamental level. You could abandon GitHub at any point and still continue to push/pull projects you\'ve "forked".Yes Fork is a clone. It emerged because, you cannot push to others\' copies without their permission. What they do is make a copy of it for you (fork), where you will have write permission as well.In the future if the actual owner or others users with a fork like your changes they can pull it back to their own repo. Alternatively you can send them a "pull-request"."Fork" in this context means "Make a copy of their code so that I can add my own modifications". There\'s not much else to say. Every clone is essentially a fork, and it\'s up to the original to decide whether to pull the changes from the fork.Cloning involves making a copy of the git repository to a local machine, while forking is cloning the repository into another repository. Cloning is for personal use only (although future merges may occur), but with forking you are copying and opening a new possible project pathI think fork is a copy of other repository but with your account modification. for example, if you directly clone other repository locally, the remote object origin is still using the account who you clone from. You can\'t commit and contribute your code. It is just a pure copy of codes. Otherwise, If you fork a repository, it will clone the repo with the update of your account setting in you github account. And then cloning the repo in the context of your account, you can commit your codes.Forking is done when you decide to contribute to some project. You would make a copy of the entire project along with its history logs. This copy is made entirely in your repository and once you make these changes, you issue a pull request. Now its up-to the owner of the source to accept your pull request and incorporate the changes into the original code.Git clone is an actual command that allows users to get a copy of the source.\ngit clone [URL]\nThis should create a copy of [URL] in your own local repository.Apart from the fact that cloning is from server to your machine and forking is making a copy on the server itself, an important difference is that when we clone, we actually get all the branches, labels, etc. But when we fork, we actually only get the current files in the master branch, nothing other than that. This means we don\'t get the other branches, etc.\nHence if you have to merge something back to the original repo, it is a inter-repo merge and will definitely need higher privileges.Fork is not a command in git, it is just a concept which Github implements. Remember Git was designed to work in peer to peer environment without the need to synchronize stuff with any master copy. The server is just another peer but we look at it as a master copy.There is a misunderstanding here with respect to what a "fork" is. A fork is in fact nothing more than a set of per-user branches. When you push to a fork you actually do push to the original repo because that is the ONLY repo.You can try this out by pushing to a fork, noting the commit and then going to the original repo and using the commit ID, you\'ll see that the commit is "in" the original repo.This makes a lot of sense but is far from obvious (I only discovered this accidentally recently).When John forks repo SuperProject what seems to actually happen is that all branches in the source repo are replicated with a name like "John.master" and "John.new_gui_project" etc.Github "hides" the "John." from us and gives us the illusion we have our own "copy" of the repo in Github, but we don\'t and nor is one even needed.So my fork\'s branch "master" is actually named "Korporal.master" but the Github UI never reveals this, showing me only "master".This is pretty much what I think goes on under the hood anyway based on stuff I\'ve been doing recently and when you ponder it, is very good design.For this reason I think it would be very easy for Microsoft to implement Git forks in their Visual Studio Team services offering.
