I have two collections which have property Email in both collections. I need to get a list of the items in the first list where Email does not exist in the second list. With SQL I would just use "not in", but I do not know the equivalent in LINQ. How is that done?So far I have a join, like...But I cannot join since I need the difference and the join would fail. I need some way of using Contains or Exists I believe. I just have not found an example to do that yet.I don\'t know if this will help you but..from The NOT IN clause in LINQ to SQL by Marco RussoYou want the Except operator.Better explanation here: http://blogs.msdn.com/charlie/archive/2008/07/12/the-linq-set-operators.aspxNOTE: This technique works best for primitive types only, since you have to implement an iEqualityComparor to use the Except method with complex types.items in the first list where the Email does not exist in the second list. For people who start with a group of in-memory objects and are querying against a database, I\'ve found this to be the best way to go:This produces a nice WHERE ... IN (...) clause in SQL.You can use a combination of Where and Any for finding not in:You can take both the collections in two different lists, say list1 and list2.Then just writeThis will work.In the case where one is using the ADO.NET Entity Framework, EchoStorm\'s solution also works perfectly. But it took me a few minutes to wrap my head around it. Assuming you have a database context, dc, and want to find rows in table x not linked in table y, the complete answer answer looks like:In response to Andy\'s comment, yes, one can have two from\'s in a LINQ query. Here\'s a complete working example, using lists. Each class, Foo and Bar, has an Id. Foo has a "foreign key" reference to Bar via Foo.BarId. The program selects all Foo\'s not linked to a corresponding Bar.While Except is part of the answer, it\'s not the whole answer.  By default, Except (like several of the LINQ operators) does a reference comparison on reference types.  To compare by values in the objects, you\'ll have toExample using List of int for simplicity.For anyone who also wants to use a SQL-alike IN operator in C#, download this package : Mshwf.NiceLinqIt has In and NotIn methods:Even you can use it this wayThank you, Brett. Your suggestion helped me too. I had a list of Objects and wanted to filter that using another list of objects.\nThanks again....If anyone needs, please have a look at my code sample:I did not test this with LINQ to Entities:Alternatively:Couldn\'t you do an outer join, only selecting the items from the first list if the group is empty? Something like:I\'m unsure whether this would work in any sort of efficient way with the Entity framework.One could also use All()
