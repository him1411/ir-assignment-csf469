How (if possible) could I set a custom font in a ActionBar title text(only - not the tab text) with a font in my assets folder? I don\'t want to use the android:logo option. I agree that this isn\'t completely supported, but here\'s what I did. You can use a custom view  for your action bar (it will display between your icon and your action items). I\'m using a custom view and I have the native title disabled. All of my activities inherit from a single activity, which has this code in onCreate:And my layout xml (R.layout.titleview in the code above) looks like this:You can do this using a custom TypefaceSpan class. It\'s superior to the customView approach indicated above because it doesn\'t break when using other Action Bar elements like expanding action views.The use of such a class would look something like this:The custom TypefaceSpan class is passed your Activity context and the name of a typeface in your assets/fonts directory. It loads the file and caches a new Typeface instance in memory. The complete implementation of TypefaceSpan is surprisingly simple:Simply copy the above class into your project and implement it in your activity\'s onCreate method as shown above.The Calligraphy library let\'s you set a custom font through the app theme, which would also apply to the action bar.All it takes to activate Calligraphy is attaching it to your Activity context:The default custom attribute is fontPath, but you may provide your own custom attribute for the path by initializing it in your Application class with CalligraphyConfig.Builder. Usage of android:fontFamily has been discouraged.It\'s an ugly hack but you can do it like this (since action_bar_title is hidden) :This code is for post-GINGERBREAD devices but this can be easily extended to work with actionbar Sherlock as wellP.S. Based on @pjv comment there\'s a better way to find action bar title idFollowing code will work for all the versions. I did checked this in a device with gingerbread as well as on JellyBean deviceuse new toolbar in support library design your actionbar as your own or use below codeInflating Textview is not an good option try Spannable String builder copy below classIf you want to set typeface to all the TextViews in the entire Activity you can use something like this:And the TypefaceCache:To add to @Sam_D\'s answer, I had to do this to make it work:It seems like overkill - referencing v.findViewById(R.id.title)) twice - but that\'s the only way it would let me do it.To update the correct answer.firstly : set the title to false, because we are using custom viewsecondly : create titleview.xmlLastly : DOWNLOAD FONT FILE : because i am storing the file into cloudinary so I have link on it to download it.We need to use reflections for achieving thisTRY THIS
