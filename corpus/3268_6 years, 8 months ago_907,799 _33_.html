I\'ve a String representing a date.I\'d like to convert it to a Date and output it in YYYY-MM-DD format.2011-01-18How can I achieve this?Okay, based on the answers I retrieved below, here\'s something I\'ve tried:But it outputs 02011-00-1 instead of the desired 2011-01-18. What am I doing wrong?Use LocalDateTime#parse() (or ZonedDateTime#parse() if the string happens to contain a time zone part) to parse a String in a certain pattern into a LocalDateTime.Use LocalDateTime#format() (or ZonedDateTime#format()) to format a LocalDateTime into a String in a certain pattern.Or, when you\'re not on Java 8 yet, use SimpleDateFormat#parse() to parse a String in a certain pattern into a Date.Use SimpleDateFormat#format() to format a Date into a String in a certain pattern.Update: as per your failed attempt: the patterns are case sensitive. Read the java.text.SimpleDateFormat javadoc what the individual parts stands for. So stands for example M for months and m for minutes. Also, years exist of four digits yyyy, not five yyyyy. Look closer at the code snippets I posted here above.Formatting are CASE-SENSITIVE so USE MM for month not mm (this is for minute) and yyyy \nFor Reference you can use following cheatsheet.Examples:The answer is of course to create a SimpleDateFormat object and use it to parse Strings to Date and to format Dates to Strings.  If you\'ve tried SimpleDateFormat and it didn\'t work, then please show your code and any errors you may receive.Addendum:  "mm" in the format String is not the same as "MM".  Use MM for months and mm for minutes. Also, yyyyy is not the same as yyyy.  e.g.,:Using the java.time package in Java 8 and later:Why not simply use thisAlso, this is the other way :or Cheers![edited to include BalusC\'s corrections]\nThe SimpleDateFormat class should do the trick:Please refer "Date and Time Patterns" here. http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html Other answers are correct, basically you had the wrong number of "y" characters in your pattern.One more problem though\xe2\x80\xa6 You did not address time zones. If you intended UTC, then you should have said so. If not, the answers are not complete. If all you want is the date portion without the time, then no issue. But if you do further work that may involve time, then you should be specifying a time zone.Here is the same kind of code but using the third-party open-source Joda-Time 2.3 libraryWhen run\xe2\x80\xa6You can also use substring()If you want a space in front of the date, useYou can just use:It works perfectly!remove one y form SimpleDateFormat dt1 = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyyy-mm-dd"); should be SimpleDateFormat dt1 = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-mm-dd");You could try java 8 new date, more information can be found on the oracle documentation.    Or you can try the old one
