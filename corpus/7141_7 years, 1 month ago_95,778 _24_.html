Does iOS SDK provides an easy way to check if the currentDevice has an high-resolution display (retina) ?The best way I\'ve found to do it now is :In order to detect the Retina display reliably on all iOS devices, you need to check if the device is running iOS4+ and if the [UIScreen mainScreen].scale property is equal to 2.0.  You CANNOT assume a device is running iOS4+ if the scale property exists, as the iPad 3.2 also contains this property.On an iPad running iOS3.2, scale will return 1.0 in 1x mode, and 2.0 in 2x mode -- even though we know that device does not contain a Retina display. Apple changed this behavior in iOS4.2 for the iPad: it returns 1.0 in both 1x and 2x modes. You can test this yourself in the simulator.I test for the -displayLinkWithTarget:selector: method on the main screen which exists in iOS4.x but not iOS3.2, and then check the screen\'s scale:@sickp\'s answer is correct. Just to make things easier, add this line into your Shared.pch file:Then in any file you can just do:This snippet...Will return...\n0 for standard resolution iPhone/iPod touch,\n1 for retina iPhone,\n2 for standard resolution iPad,\n3 for retina iPad.SSToolkit has a method that does this:http://sstoolk.it/documentation/Categories/UIScreen(SSToolkitAdditions).htmlIt is used in the following way:It always feels a bit dodgy to compare floating-point values for equality.\nI prefer going for eitherorHere is a handy swift extension:Usage: This is a riff on Matt MC\'s answer above. Just a category on UIScreen.Swift version of the answers above, with >= 2.0 scale so it includes iPhone 6+ and other future devices with higher-than-Retina scale:Just to combine the answer from @sickp and the following comment from @n13 I made this into a UIScreen category which seems to work nicely. The check is done the first time you call it and then saved for later calls.Might be useful to someone.try thisModified version of primulaveris\'s for simplicity of most common use cases. I\'m on swift 2.2 but it shouldn\'t matter.Then simply use them like thisThis worked for me
