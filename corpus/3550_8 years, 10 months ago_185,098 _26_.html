I\'m writing a Python application that takes as a command as an argument, for example:I want the application to be extensible, that is, to be able to add new modules that implement new commands without having to change the main application source. The tree looks something like:So I want the application to find the available command modules at runtime and execute the appropriate one.Currently this is implemented something like:This works just fine, I\'m just wondering if there is possibly a more idiomatic way to accomplish what we are doing with this code.Note that I specifically don\'t want to get in to using eggs or extension points. This is not an open-source project and I don\'t expect there to be "plugins". The point is to simplify the main application code and remove the need to modify it each time a new command module is added.With Python older than 2.7/3.1, that\'s pretty much how you do it. For newer versions, see importlib.import_module for 2.7+ and for 3.1+.You can use exec if you want to as well.Note you can import a list of modules by doing this:Ripped straight from Dive Into Python.The recommended way for Python 2.7 and later is to use importlib module:As mentioned the imp module provides you loading functions:I\'ve used these before to perform something similar.  In my case I defined a specific class with defined methods that were required.\nOnce I loaded the module I would check if the class was in the module, and then create an instance of that class, something like this:Use the imp module, or the more direct __import__() function.If you want it in your locals:same would work with globals()You can use exec:Similar as @monkut \'s solution but reusable and error tolerant described here http://stamat.wordpress.com/dynamic-module-import-in-python/:It sounds like what you really want is a plugin architecture.  You should have a look at the  entry points functionality provided by the setuptools package.  It offers a great way to discover plugins that are loaded for your application.The below piece worked for me:if you want to import in shell-script:The following worked for me:It loads modules from the folder \'modus\'. The modules have a single class with the same name as the module name. E.g. the file modus/modu1.py contains:The result is a list of dynamically loaded classes "adapters".
