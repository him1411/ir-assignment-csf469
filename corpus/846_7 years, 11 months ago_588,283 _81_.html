I have two JavaScript arrays:I want the output to be:The output array should have repeated words removed.How do I merge two arrays in JavaScript so that I get only the unique items from each array in the same order they were inserted into the original arrays?To just merge the arrays (without removing duplicates) use Array.concat:Since there is no \'built in\' way to remove duplicate (ECMA-262 actually has Array.forEach which would be great for this..), so we do it manually:Then, to use it:This will also preserve the order of the arrays (i.e, no sorting needed).EDITED:Since many people are annoyed about prototype augmentation of Array.prototype and for in loops, here is a less invasive way to use it:For those who are fortunate enough to work with progressive browsers where ES5 is available, you can use Object.defineProperty like this:Time flies when you\'re having fun. With Underscore or Lo-Dash you can do:http://underscorejs.org/#unionhttp://lodash.com/docs#unionFirst concatenate the two arrays, next filter out only the unique items.http://jsfiddle.net/simo/98622/As suggested by @Dmitry (see the second comment below) a more performance wise solution would be to filter out the unique items in b before concatenating with aes6 solution using spread operator and array generics.\nCurrently only works with Firefox, and possibly IE Technical Preview.\nBut if you use Babel, you can have it now.Here is a slightly different take on the loop. With some of the optimizations in the latest version of chrome, it is the fastest method for resolving the union of the two arrays (Chrome 38.0.2111).http://jsperf.com/merge-two-arrays-keeping-only-unique-valueswhile loop: ~589k ops/s\nfilter: ~445k ops/s\nlodash: 308k ops/s\nfor loops: 225k ops/s  Edit: A comment pointed out that one of my setup variables was causing my loop to pull ahead of the rest because it didn\'t have to initialize an empty array to write to. I agree with that, so I\'ve rewritten the test to even the playing field, and included an even faster option.http://jsperf.com/merge-two-arrays-keeping-only-unique-values/21In this alternate solution, I\'ve combined one answer\'s associative array solution to eliminate the .indexOf() call in the loop which was slowing things down a lot with a second loop, and included some of the other optimizations that other users have suggested in their answers as well.The top answer here with the double loop on every value (i-1) is still significantly slower. lodash is still doing strong, and I still would recommend it to anyone who doesn\'t mind adding a library to their project. For those who don\'t want to, my while loop is still a good answer and the filter answer has a very strong showing here, beating out all on my tests with the latest Canary Chrome (44.0.2360) as of this writing.Edit 2: Check out Mike\'s answer here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/13847481/259809 and Dan Stocker\'s answer here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/28631880/259809 if you want to step it up a notch in speed. Those are by far the fastest of all results after going through almost all of the viable answers.You can do it simply with ES6,A much better array merge function. Why don\'t you use an object?  It looks like you\'re trying to model a set.  This wont preserve the order, however.Just throwing in my two cents.This is a method I use a lot, it uses an object as a hashlookup table to do the duplicate checking. Assuming that the hash is O(1), then this runs in O(n) where n is a.length + b.length. I honestly have no idea how the browser does the hash, but it performs well on many thousands of data points.My one and a half penny:Just steer clear of nested loops (O(n^2)), and .indexOf() (+O(n)).Implementation of indexOf method for other browsers is taken from MDCSimplified simo\'s answer and turned it into a nice function.Best Solution.... you can check directly in browser Console by hitting...Without DuplicateWith Duplicateif you Want Without Duplicate you can try better Sol. from here - Shouting CodeTry On Chrome Browser Console OutPut: You can achieve it simply using underscoreJS => uniqarray3 = _.uniq(array1.concat(array2))console.log(array3)it will print ["Vijendra", "Singh", "Shakya"]New solution ( which uses Array.prototype.indexOf and Array.prototype.concat ):Usage:Array.prototype.indexOf ( for internet explorer ):In Dojo 1.6+UpdateSee working code.http://jsfiddle.net/UAxJa/1/Merge an unlimited number of arrays or non-arrays and keep it unique:Assuming original arrays don\'t need de-duplication, this should be pretty fast, retain original order, and does not modify the original arrays...usage:looks like the accepted answer is the slowest in my tests;note I am merging 2 arrays of objects by KeyThe easiest way to do this is either to use concat() to merge the arrays and then use filter() to remove the duplicates, or to use concat() and then put the merged array inside a Set().First way: Second way (but with performance implications on the UI):Here is about the most effective one, in terms of computation time. Also keeps initial order of elements.\nFirst filter all duplicates from second array, then concat what is left to the first one.EditHere is slightly improved(faster) version of it, with a downside, that arrays must not miss valuesThis is simple and can be done in one line with jqueryHere is a simple example:We define unique(array) to remove redundant elements and use concat function to combine to arrays. Well i know it is old question but there is another nice trick with push()Now array b is concatenate into a.-- Editing after @Steel Brain comment --Brain is right, the result of the above will be a === [1,2,3,4,5,6].\nThus if one want a whole new array and like to use this approach may write the following:However I would use this approach when one want to merge one array into another rather than create new arrayFollowing the functional approach a union of two Arrays is just the composition of concat and filter. In order to provide optimal performance we resort to the native Set data type, which is optimized for property lookups.Anyway, the key question in conjunction with a union function is how to treat duplicates. The following permutations are possible:The first two permutations are easy to handle with a single function. However, the last two are more complicated, since you can\'t process them as long as you rely on Set lookups. Since switching to plain old Object property lookups would entail a serious performance hit the following implementation just ignores the third and fourth permutation. You would have to build a separate version of union to support them.From here on it gets trivial to implement an unionn function, which accepts any number of arrays (inspired by naomik\'s comments):It turns out unionn is just foldl (aka Array.prototype.reduce), which takes union as its reducer. Note: Since the implementation doesn\'t use an additional accumulator, it will throw an error when you apply it without arguments.Leveraging dictionaries and Jquery you could merge the two arrays and not get duplicates. In my example I\'m using a given field on the object but could be just the object itself. Another approach for your review with reduce func:
