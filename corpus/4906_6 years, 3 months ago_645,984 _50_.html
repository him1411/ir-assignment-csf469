I want to clear all input and textarea fields in a form. It works like the following when using an input button with the reset class:This will clear all fields on the page, not just the ones from the form. How would my selector look like for just the form the actual reset button lives in?Please see this post: \nResetting a multi-stage form with jQueryOrAny reason this shouldn\'t be used?This won\'t handle cases where form input fields have non empty default values.Something like should workif you use selectors and make values to empty values, it is not resetting the form, it\'s making all fields empty. Reset is to make form as it was before any edit actions from user after the load of form from server side. If there is an input with name "username" and that username was prefilled from server side, most of solutions on this page will delete that value from input, not reset it to the value how it was before user\'s changes. If you need to reset the form, use this:if you need not to reset the form, but fill all inputs with some value, for example empty value, then you can use most of the solutions from other comments.Simple but works like a charm.If someone is still reading this thread, here is the simplest solution using not jQuery, but plain JavaScript. If you\'re input fields are inside a form, there is a simple JavaScript reset command:More about it here:\nhttp://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_form_reset.aspCheers!Why does it need to be done with any JavaScript at all?http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/the-input-element.html#attr-input-type-keywordsTried that one first, it won\'t clear fields with default values.Here\'s a way to do it with jQuery, then:I got easiest trick to reset formor                       With Javascript you can simply do it with this syntax getElementById("your-form-id").reset();you can also use jquery by calling the reset function this way $(\'#your-form-id\')[0].reset();Remember not to forget [0]. You will get the following error if TypeError: $(...).reset is not a functionJQuery also provides an event you can use$(\'#form_id\').trigger("reset");I tried and it works.Note: Its important to notice that these methods only reset your form to their initial value set by the server on page load. This means if your input was set on the value \'set value\' before you did a random change, the field will be reset to that same value after reset method is called.Hope it helpswhere editPOIForm is the id attribute of your form.Why you dont use document.getElementById("myId").reset(); ? this is the simple and prettyTested and verified code:Javascript must be included in $(document).ready and it must be with your logic.If you want to empty all input boxes irrespective of its type then it\'s a minute step by Let us say if you want to clear the fields and except accountType,in the mean time dropdown box will be reset to particular value,i.e \'All\'.Remaining fields should be reset to empty i.e text box.This approach will be used for clearing particular fields as our requirement.I use this :And here is my button:Use this Code Where you want to Call Normal Reset Function by jQueryAnd Write this Function Out Site jQuery on Document ReadyOnSuccess of the operation we call the JavaScript function with the name "ClearInput"if you do both of these right, then you will not be able to stop it from working...If i want to clear all the fields except accountType..Use the followingthe code I see here and on related SO questions seems incomplete.Resetting a form means setting the original values from the HTML, so I put this together for a little project I was doing based on the above code:Please let me know if I\'m missing anything or anything can be improved.None of the above works on a simple case when the page includes a call to web user control that involves IHttpHandler request processing (captcha).\nAfter sending the requsrt (for image processing) the code below does not clear the fields on the form (before sending the HttpHandler request ) everythings works correctly.I\'ve written a universal jQuery plugin:Add hidden reset button as follows$(\'form\').submit(function() {});
