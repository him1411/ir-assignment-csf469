I\'m from a Subversion background and, when I had a branch, I knew what I was working on with "These working files point to this branch".But with Git I\'m not sure when I am editing a file in NetBeans or Notepad++, whether it\'s tied to the master or another branch.There\'s no problem with git in bash, it tells me what I\'m doing.git branch should show all the local branches of your repo.  The starred branch is your current branch.That will display the current branch.Reference:You have also git symbolic-ref HEAD which displays the full refspec.To show only the branch name in Git v1.8 and later (thank\'s to Greg for pointing that out):On Git v1.7+ you can also do:Both should give the same branch name if you\'re on a branch. If you\'re on a detached head answers differ.Note:On an earlier client, this seems to work:\xe2\x80\x93  Darien 26. Mar 2014For my own reference (but it might be useful to others) I made an overview of most (basic command line) techniques mentioned in this thread, each applied to several use cases: HEAD is (pointing at):Results:(FYI this was done with git version 1.8.3.1)One more alternative:Well simple enough, I got it in a one liner (bash)(credit: Limited Atonement)And while I am there, the one liner to get the remote tracking branch (if any)You can just type in command line (console) on Linux, in the repository directory:and you will see some text, among which something similar to:which means you are currently on master branch. If you are editing any file at that moment and it is located in the same local repository (local directory containing the files that are under Git version control management), you are editing file in this branch.I use this in scripts that need the current branch name. It will show you the current short symbolic reference to HEAD, which will be your current branch name.Found a command line solution of the same length as Oliver Refalo\'s, using good ol\' awk:awk reads that as "do the stuff in {} on lines matching the regex". By default it assumes whitespace-delimited fields, so you print the second. If you can assume that only the line with your branch has the *, you can drop the ^.  Ah, bash golf!will show only the branch nameyou  can use git bash on the working directory\ncommand is as followit will tell you on which branch you are on \nthere are many commands which are useful some of them are --short\nGive the output in the short-format.-b\n--branch\nShow the branch and tracking info even in short-format.--porcelain[=]\nGive the output in an easy-to-parse format for scripts. This is similar to the short output, but will remain stable across Git versions and regardless of user configuration. See below for details.The version parameter is used to specify the format version. This is optional and defaults to the original version v1 format.--long\nGive the output in the long-format. This is the default.-v\n--verbose\nIn addition to the names of files that have been changed, also show the textual changes that are staged to be committed (i.e., like the output of git diff --cached). If -v is specified twice, then also show the changes in the working tree that have not yet been staged (i.e., like the output of git diff).In Netbeans, ensure that versioning annotations are enabled (View -> Show Versioning\nLabels). You can then see the branch name next to project name.http://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=213582Over time, we might have a really long list of branches.While some of the other solutions are great, Here is what I do (simplified from Jacob\'s answer):Now,works, but only If there are any local changesWhy not use git-aware shell prompt, which would tell you name of current branch?  git status also helps.How git-prompt.sh from contrib/ does it (git version 2.3.0), as defined in __git_ps1 helper function:First, there is special case if rebase in progress is detected.  Git uses unnamed branch (detached HEAD) during the rebase process to make it atomic, and original branch is saved elsewhere.If the .git/HEAD file is a symbolic link (a very rare case, from the ancient history of Git), it uses git symbolic-ref HEAD 2>/dev/nullElse, it reads .git/HEAD file. Next steps depends on its contents:If this file doesn\'t exist, then there is no current branch.  This usually happens if the repository is bare.If it starts with \'ref: \' prefix, then .git/HEAD is symref (symbolic reference), and we are on normal branch.  Strip this prefix to get full name, and strip refs/heads/ to get short name of the current branch:If it doesn\'t start with \'ref: \', then it is detached HEAD (anonymous branch), pointing directly to some commit. Use git describe ... to write the current commit in human-readable form.I hope that helps.What about this?I have a simple script called git-cbr (current branch) which prints out the current branch name.I put this script in a custom folder (~/.bin). The folder is in $PATH.So now when I\'m in a git repo, I just simply type git cbr to print out the current branch name.This works because the git command takes its first argument and tries to run a script that goes by the name of git-arg1. For instance, git branch tries to run a script called git-branch, etc.The following shell command tells you the branch that you are currently in.When you don\'t want to type that long command every time you want to know the branch and you are using Bash, give the command a short alias, for example alias cb, like so.When you are in branch master and your prompt is $, you will get * master as follows.You can permanently set up your bash output to show your git-branch name. It is very handy when you work with different branches, no need to type $ git status all the time. \nGithub repo git-aware-prompt\n.Open your terminal (ctrl-shift-t) and enter the commandsEdit your .bashrc with sudo nano ~/.bashrc command (for Ubuntu) and add the following to the top:Then paste the code     at the end of the same file you pasted the installation code into earlier. This will give you the colorized output:If you really want the last branch/tag checked out in detached HEAD state as well.Update\nThis is nicer if you have and aren\'t scared of awk.Sorry this is another command-line answer, but that\'s what I was looking for when I found this question and many of these answers were helpful. My solution is the following bash shell function:This should always give me something both human-readable and directly usable as an argument to git checkout.Add it to PS1 using Mac : Before running the command above : After running that command : Dont worry, if it is not GIT repository , it will not display error because of [-d .git] which checks if .git folder exists or not. you can also use GIT_BRANCH variable as appears here:\nhttps://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Git+PluginThe git plugin sets several environment variables you can use in your scripts:GIT_COMMIT - SHA of the currentGIT_BRANCH - Name of the branch currently being used, e.g. "master" or "origin/foo"GIT_PREVIOUS_COMMIT - SHA of the previous built commit from the same branch (the current SHA on first build in branch)GIT_URL - Repository remote URLGIT_URL_N - Repository remote URLs when there are more than 1 remotes, e.g. GIT_URL_1, GIT_URL_2GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL - Committer/Author EmailGIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL - Committer/Author EmailI  know this is late but on a linux/mac ,from the terminal  you can use the following.Explanation:git status -> gets the working tree status\nsed -n 1p -> gets the first line from the status body       Response to the above command will look as follows:                                                Using earlier ideas; assuming sha1 is 40 characters; and chasing references  (yea, should delete the debug print lines :-):gives the raw output:To directly copy the result to the pasteboard.
