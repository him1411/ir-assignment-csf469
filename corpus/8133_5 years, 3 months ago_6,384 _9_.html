Pardon the funny title. I\'ve created a little graphic demo of 200 balls bouncing and colliding, both against the walls and each other. You can see what I have currently here: http://www.exeneva.com/html5/multipleBallsBouncingAndColliding/The problem is that whenever they collide with each other, they disappear. I\'m not sure why. Can someone take a look and help me out?UPDATE: Apparently the balls array has balls with coordinates of NaN. Below is the code where I push balls to the array. I\'m not entirely sure how the coordinates are getting NaN.Your error comes from this line initially:You have ball1.velocitY (which is undefined) instead of ball1.velocityY. So Math.atan2 is giving you NaN, and that NaN value is propagating through all your calculations.This is not the source of your error, but there is something else that you might want to change on these four lines:You don\'t need the extra assignments, and can just use the += operator alone:There\'s an error in the collideBalls function:It should be:
