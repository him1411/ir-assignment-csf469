jQuery has height() en width() functions that returns the height or width in pixels as integer... How can I get a padding or margin value of an element in pixels and as integer using jQuery?My first idea was to do the following:But if padding is given in ems for example, how can I get the value in pixels?Looking into the JSizes plugin suggested by Chris Pebble i realized that my own version was the right one :). jQuery returns always value in pixels, so just parsing it to integer was the solution.Thanks to Chris Pebble and Ian RobinsonYou should be able to use CSS (http://docs.jquery.com/CSS/css#name). You may have to be more specific such as "padding-left" or "margin-top".Example:CSSJSThe result is 10px.If you want to get the integer value, you can do the following:Compare outer and inner height/widths to get the total margin and padding:The parseInt function has a "radix" parameter which defines the numeral system used on the conversion, so calling parseInt(jQuery(\'#something\').css(\'margin-left\'), 10); returns the left margin as an Integer.This is what JSizes use.PLEASE don\'t go loading another library just to do something that\'s already natively available!jQuery\'s .css() converts %\'s and em\'s to their pixel equivalent to begin with, and parseInt() will remove the \'px\' from the end of the returned string and convert it to an integer:http://jsfiddle.net/BXnXJ/This simple function will do it:Usage:Here\'s how you can get the surrounding dimentions:Pay attention that each variable, paddingTopBottom for example, contains the sum of the margins on the both sides of the element; i.e., paddingTopBottom == paddingTop + paddingBottom. I wonder if there is a way to get them separately. Of course, if they are equal you can divide by 2 :)Parse intreturns 0 for 0pxYou can just grab them as with any CSS attribute:You can set them with a second attribute in the css method:EDIT: If you need just the pixel value, use parseInt(val, 10):ok just to answer the original question:you can get the padding as a usable integer like this:var padding =\n  parseInt($("myId").css("padding-top").replace("ems",""));If you have defined another measurement like px just replace "ems" with "px". \nparseInt interprets the stringpart as a wrong value so its important to replace it with ... nothing.You could also extend the jquery framework yourself with something like:Thereby adding a function on your jquery objects called margin(), which returns a collection like the offset function. fx. I probably use github.com/bramstein/jsizes jquery plugin for paddings and margins in very comfortable way, Thanks...Shamelessly adopted from Quickredfox.updateChanged to parseInt(val, 10) since it is faster than parseFloat.http://jsperf.com/number-vs-plus-vs-toint-vs-tofloat/20Not to necro but I made this which can determine pixels based on a variety of values:This way, we take into account for sizing, and auto / inherit.Don\'t use string.replace("px", ""));Use parseInt or parseFloat!
