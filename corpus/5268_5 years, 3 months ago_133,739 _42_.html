I\'m new to Obj-C, so my first question is:What are the differences between strong and weak in @property declarations of pointers to objects?Also, what does nonatomic mean?A strong reference (which you will use in most cases) means that you want to "own" the object you are referencing with this property/variable. The compiler will take care that any object that you assign to this property will not be destroyed as long as you point to it with a strong reference. Only once you set the property to nil will the object get destroyed (unless one or more other objects also hold a strong reference to it).In contrast, with a weak reference you signify that you don\'t want to have control over the object\'s lifetime. The object you are referencing weakly only lives on because at least one other object holds a strong reference to it. Once that is no longer the case, the object gets destroyed and your weak property will automatically get set to nil. The most frequent use cases of weak references in iOS are:delegate properties, which are often referenced weakly to avoid retain cycles, andsubviews/controls of a view controller\'s main view because those views are already strongly held by the main view.atomic vs. nonatomic refers to the thread safety of the getter and setter methods that the compiler synthesizes for the property. atomic (the default) tells the compiler to make the accessor methods thread-safe (by adding a lock before an ivar is accessed) and nonatomic does the opposite. The advantage of nonatomic is slightly higher performance. On iOS, Apple uses nonatomic for almost all their properties so the general advice is for you to do the same.It may be helpful to think about strong and weak references in terms of balloons.A balloon will not fly away as long as at least one person is holding on to a string attached to it. The number of people holding strings is the retain count. When no one is holding on to a string, the ballon will fly away (dealloc). Many people can have strings to that same balloon. You can get/set properties and call methods on the referenced object with both strong and weak references.A strong reference is like holding on to a string to that balloon. As long as you are holding on to a string attached to the balloon, it will not fly away.A weak reference is like looking at the balloon. You can see it, access it\'s properties, call it\'s methods, but you have no string to that balloon. If everyone holding onto the string lets go, the balloon flies away, and you cannot access it anymore.strong: assigns the incoming value to it, it will retain the incoming value and release the existing value of the instance variableweak: will assign the incoming value to it without retaining it.So the basic difference is the retaining of the new variable. \nGeneraly you want to retain it but there are situations where you don\'t want to have it otherwise you will get a retain cycle and can not free the memory the objects. Eg. obj1 retains obj2 and obj2 retains obj1. To solve this kind of situation you use weak references.strong and weak, these keywords revolves around Object Ownership in Objective-CWhat is object ownership ?Pointer variables imply ownership of the objects that they point to.Anytime a pointer variable points to an object, that object has an owner and will stay alive. This is known as a strong reference.A variable can optionally not take ownership of an object that it points to. A variable that does not take ownership of an object is known as a weak reference.Here, Apple Documentation has explained the difference between weak and strong property using various examples :https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/cocoa/conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/EncapsulatingData/EncapsulatingData.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011210-CH5-SW3 Here, In this blog author has collected all the properties in same place. It will help to compare properties characteristics :http://rdcworld-iphone.blogspot.in/2012/12/variable-property-attributes-or.htmlstrong is the default. An object remains \xe2\x80\x9calive\xe2\x80\x9d as long as there is a strong pointer to it.weak specifies a reference that does not keep the referenced object alive. A weak reference is set to nil when there are no strong references to the object. The strong and weak are new ARC types replacing retain and assign respectively.\nDelegates and outlets should be weak.\nA strong reference is a reference to an object that stops it from being deallocated. In other words it creates a owner relationship.\nA weak reference is a reference to an object that does not stop it from being deallocated. In other words, it does not create an owner relationship.A dummy answer :-I think explanation is given in above answer, so i am just gonna tell you where to use STRONG and where to use WEAK :Use of Weak :-\n1. Delegates\n2. Outlets\n3. Subviews\n4. Controls, etc.Use of Strong :-\n Remaining everywhere which is not included in WEAK.In simple words:Strong\nstrong is a replacement for the retain attribute, as  part of Objective-C Automated Reference Counting (ARC). In non-ARC code  it\'s just a synonym for retain. Weakweak is similar to strong except that it  won\'t increase the reference count by 1. It does not become an owner of  that object but just holds a reference to it. If the object\'s reference  count drops to 0, even though you may still be pointing to it here, it  will be deallocated from memory.The strong and weak are new ARC types replacing retain and assign respectively. Delegates and outlets should be weak.StrongA strong reference is a reference to an object that stops it from being deallocated. In other words it creates a owner relationship. Weak A weak reference is a reference to an object that does not stop it from being deallocated. In other words, it does not create an owner relationship.Strong: Basically Used With Properties we used to get or send data from/into another classes.\nWeak: Usually all outlets, connections are of Weak type from Interface.Nonatomic: Such type of properties are used in conditions when we don\'t want to share our outlet or object into different simultaneous Threads. In other words, Nonatomic instance make our properties to deal with one thread at a time.\nHopefully it helpful for you.
