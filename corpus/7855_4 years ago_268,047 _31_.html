First time I work with jQuery.inArray() and it acts kinda strange.If the object is in the array, it will return 0, but 0 is false in Javascript. So the following will output: "is NOT in array"I will have to change the if statement to:But this makes the code unreadable. Especially for someone who dont know this function. He will expect that jQuery.inArray("test", myarray) gives true when "test" is in the array.So my question is, why is it done this way? I realy dislike this. But there must be a good reason to do it like that.inArray returns the index of the element in the array, not a boolean indicating if the item exists in the array. If the element was not found, -1 will be returned.So, to check if an item is in the array, use:$.inArray returns the index of the element if found or -1 if it isn\'t -- not a boolean value. So the correct isThe answer comes from the first paragraph of the documentation check if the results is greater than -1, not if it\'s true or false.The $.inArray() method is similar to JavaScript\'s native .indexOf() method in that it returns -1 when it doesn\'t find a match. If the first element within the array matches value, $.inArray() returns 0.Because JavaScript treats 0 as loosely equal to false (i.e. 0 == false, but 0 !== false), if we\'re checking for the presence of value within array, we need to check if it\'s not equal to (or greater than) -1.The right way of using inArray(x, arr) is not using it at all, and using instead arr.indexOf(x).The official standard name is also more clear on the fact that the returned value is an index thus if the element passed is the first one you will get back a 0 (that is falsy in Javascript).(Note that arr.indexOf(x) is not supported in Internet Explorer until IE9, so if you need to support IE8 and earlier, this will not work, and the jQuery function is a better alternative.)Or if you want to get a bit fancy you can use the bitwise not (~) and logical not(!) operators to convert the result of the inArray function to a boolean value.The inArray function returns the index of the object supplied as the first argument to the function in the array supplied as the second argument to the function.When inArray returns 0 it is indicating that the first argument was found at the first position of the supplied array.To use inArray within an if statement use:inArray returns -1 when the first argument passed to the function is not found in the array passed as the second argument.I usually useorjQuery inArray() method is use to search a value in an array and return its index not a Boolean value. And if the value was not found it\xe2\x80\x99ll return -1.So, to check if a value is present in an array, follow the below practice:ReferencejQuery.inArray() returns index of the item in the array, or -1 if item was not found. Read more here: jQuery.inArray()It will return the index of the item in the array. If it\'s not found you will get -1If we want to check an element is inside a set of elements we can do for example:This is useful for checking dynamic variables. This method is easy to read.Just no one use $ instead of jQuery:Man, check the doc.for example:
