I am running Python 2.5.This is my folder tree:(I also have __init__.py in each folder, omitted here for readability)How do I import the nib module from inside the life module? I am hoping it is possible to do without tinkering with sys.path.Note: The main module being run is in the ptdraft folder.It seems that the problem is not related to the module being in a parent directory or anything like that.You need to add the directory that contains ptdraft to PYTHONPATHYou said that import nib worked with you, that probably means that you added ptdraft itself (not its parent) to PYTHONPATH.You could use relative imports (python >= 2.5):(What\xe2\x80\x99s New in Python 2.5) PEP 328: Absolute and Relative ImportsEDIT: added another dot \'.\' to go up two packagesRelative imports (as in from .. import mymodule) only work in a package.\nTo import \'mymodule\' that is in the parent directory of your current module:edit: the __file__ attribute is not allways given. Instead of using os.path.abspath(__file__) I now suggested using the inspect module to retrieve the filename (and path) of the current fileIf adding your module folder to the PYTHONPATH didn\'t work, You can modify the sys.path list in your program where the Python interpreter searches for the modules to import, the python documentation says:When a module named spam is imported, the interpreter first searches for a built-in module with that name. If not found, it then searches for a file named spam.py in a list of directories given by the variable sys.path. sys.path is initialized from these locations:After initialization, Python programs can modify sys.path. The directory containing the script being run is placed at the beginning of the search path, ahead of the standard library path. This means that scripts in that directory will be loaded instead of modules of the same name in the library directory. This is an error unless the replacement is intended. Knowing this, you can do the following in your program:You can use OS depending path in "module search path" which is listed in sys.path .\nSo you can easily add parent directory like following If you want to add parent-parent directory,Here is more generic solution that includes the parent directory into sys.path (works for me):Using information from a Stack Overflow answer\n"How do I get the path of the current executed file in Python?", here is a short, simple, hopefully easy to understand answer. It should be cross-compatible with different operating systems as the modules os, sys and inspect come as part of Python (which is built for many OS-es, so they are designed to be).Next, wherever you want to find the source file from you just use:Also, my answer doesn\'t use the __file__ variable because Stackoverflow users have often mentioned that it can be unreliable and doesn\'t work on every O.S. - it\'s not always available and doesn\'t always contain the full file path. Of course you can use __file__ in your own code if you don\'t care about the problems caused or want slightly less code.\nQuote of some problems with this common approach from the question How do I get the path of the current executed file in Python?:To avoid filling up the sys.path python path list with the file paths of modules that get imported, I recommend adding the code sys.path.pop(0) to the above code on a new line. Make sure that the removed path is same item added before the module import so no other paths are accidentally deleted. This code is most important when the directory added contains a module with the same name as another module imported later in the program.\nYou can leave it changed instead as I have discovered that any edits made to sys.path in a program are not permanent and after restarting the Python shell, new module locations added there disappear from sys.path.If you want even more minimal code you can remove the first line and replace the second line with import os.path as path, sys, inspect then prefix getsourcefile with inspect., however this will import the whole inspect module so could take more time, memory and resources.Don\'t know much about python 2.\nIn python 3, the parent folder can be added as follows:...and then one is able to import modules from itWhen not being in a package environment with __init__.py files the pathlib library (included with >= Python 3.4) makes it very concise and intuitive to append the path of the parent directory to the PYTHONPATH:\nimport sys\nsys.path.append(\'../\')\nsame sort of style as the past answer - but in fewer lines :Pfile returns the location you are working inWork with libraries.\nMake a library called nib, install it using setup.py, let it reside in site-packages and your problems are solved.\nYou don\'t have to stuff everything you make in a single package. Break it up to pieces.you can append your directory path to sys
