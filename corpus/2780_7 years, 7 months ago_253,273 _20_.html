I\'ve been using the Split() method to split strings, but this only appears to work if you are splitting a string by a character. Is there any way to split a string, with another string being the split by parameter?  I\'ve tried converting the splitter into a character array, with no luck.In other words, I\'d like to split the string:THExxQUICKxxBROWNxxFOXby xx, and return an array with values:  THE, QUICK, BROWN, FOXIn order to split by a string you\'ll have to use the string array overload.There is an overload of Split that takes strings.You can use either of these StringSplitOptionsSo if the string is "THExxQUICKxxxxBROWNxxFOX", StringSplitOptions.None will return an empty entry in the array for the "xxxx" part while StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries will not.is the way I do it usually. Of course you\'ll need a but than again I need that lib all the time.There\'s an overload of String.Split for this:I generally like to use my own extension for that:This will however lead to an Exception, if Microsoft decides to include this method-overload in later versions. It is also the likely reason why Microsoft has not included this method in the meantime: At least one company I worked for, used such an extension in all their C# projects.It may also be possible to conditionally define the method at runtime if it doesn\'t exist.Just choose the replace character carefully (choose one that isn\'t likely to be present in the string already)!The above answers are all correct.  I go one step further and make C# work for me by defining an extension method on String:That way I can call it on any string in the simple way I naively expected the first time I tried to accomplish this:The easiest way is to use String.Replace:Or more simply:
