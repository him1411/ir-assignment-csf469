I\'m working with HTML5 elements on my webpage. By default input type="date" shows date as YYYY-MM-DD. The question is, is it possible to change it\'s format to something like: DD-MM-YYYY? There is no way possible to change the formatWe have to differentiate between the over the wire format and the browser\'s presentation format.Wire format The HTML5 date input specification [1] refers to the RFC3339 specification [2], which specifies a full-date format equal to: yyyy-mm-dd. See section 5.6 of the RFC3339 specification for more details.Presentation format Browsers are unrestricted in how they present a date input. At the time of writing Chrome [3] and Microsoft Edge have the most extensive date support. They displays a date picker using the user\'s local calendar format. Opera 10.6+ also displays a date picker, but shows the date in the wire format. Other browsers, such as Firefox 51.0.1 and Internet Explorer 9/10/11 display a text input field with the wire format.Since this answer was asked quite a few things have happened in the web realm, and one of the most exciting is the landing of web components. Now you can solve this issue elegantly with a custom HTML5 element designed to suit your needs. If you wish to override/change the workings of any html tag just build yours playing with the shadow dom. The good news is that there\xe2\x80\x99s already a lot of boilerplate available so most likely you won\xe2\x80\x99t need to come up with a solution from scratch. Just check what people are building and get ideas from there.You can start with a simple (and working) solution like date-util for polymer that allows you to use a tag like this one:and adapt it as an input field... or you can get creative and pop-up complete date-pickers styled as you wish, with the formatting and locales you desire, callbacks, and your long list of options (you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a whole custom API at your disposal!)Standards-compliant, no hacks. There\xe2\x80\x99s only a catch, although we\'re almost there, this is still a forward-looking\'ish solution: IE 10 and old pals won\xe2\x80\x99t support the custom tag, so double-check the available polyfills, what browsers/versions they support, and if it covers enough % of your user base\xe2\x80\xa6 In a few months it\'ll surely cover most of your users, since all major browser vendors are on board and enthusiastic about the spec, and a 360 implementation is really near.Hope it helps!It\'s important to distinguish two different formats:The HTML5 specification does not include any means of overriding or manually specifying either format.As previously mentioned it is officially not possible to change the format. However it is possible to style the field, so (with a little JS help) it displays the date in a format we desire. Some of the possibilities to manipulate the date input is lost this way, but if the desire to force the format is greater, this solution might be a way. A date fields stays only like that:The rest is a bit of CSS and JS: http://jsfiddle.net/g7mvaosL/It works nicely on Chrome for desktop, and Safari on iOS (especially desirable, since native date manipulators on touch screens are unbeatable IMHO). Didn\'t check for others, but don\'t expect to fail on any Webkit.I believe the browser will use the local date format. Don\'t think it\'s possible to change. You could of course use a custom date picker.After many hurdles, I came up with a solution that allows changing the  format. There are a few caveats but it is usable if you wish to have \'Jan\' or \'01\' displayed consistently. It works in Chrome on Windows and Mac only due to the fact that Firefox does not yet support native date pickers at all.https://github.com/northamerican/custom-input-date-formatJS:SASS:Google Chrome in its last beta version finally uses the input type=date, and the format is DD-MM-YYYY.So there must be a way to force a specific format.  I\'m developing a HTML5 web page and the date searches now fail with different formats.As said, the <input type=date ... > is not fully implemented in most browsers, so let\'s talk about webkit like browsers (chrome).Using linux, you can change it by changing the environment variable LANG,  LC_TIME don\'t seems to work(for me at least).You can type locale in a terminal to see your current values. I think the same concept can be applied to IOS.eg:\nUsing:The date is showed as mm/dd/yyyyUsing: The date is showed as dd/mm/yyyyYou can use http://lh.2xlibre.net/locale/pt_BR/ (change pt_BR by your locale) to create you own custom locale and format your dates as you want.A nice more advanced reference on how change default system date is:\nhttps://ccollins.wordpress.com/2009/01/06/how-to-change-date-formats-on-ubuntu/\nand\nhttps://askubuntu.com/questions/21316/how-can-i-customize-a-system-localeYou can see you real current date format using date:But as LC_TIME and d_fmt seems to be rejected by chrome ( and I think it\'s a bug in webkit or chrome ), sadly it don\'t work. :\'(So, unfortunately the response, is IF LANG environment variable do not solve your problem, there is no way yet.Try this if you need a quick solution To make yyyy-mm-dd go "dd- Sep -2016"1) Create near your input one span class (act as label)2) Update the label everytime your date is changed by user, or when need to load from data.Works for webkit browser mobiles and pointer-events for IE11+ requires jQuery and Jquery DateIts not possible to change web-kit browsers use user\'s computer or mobiles default date format.\nBut if you can use jquery and jquery ui there is a date-picker which is designable and can be shown in any format as developer wants.\nthe link to the jquery ui date-picker is \non this page http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/ you can find demo as well as code and documentation or documentation link\nIf any one want further help he / she can connect me on the best social network http://www.funnenjoy.com Edit:-I find that chrome uses language settings that are by default equal to system settings but user can change them but developer cant force users to do so so you have to use other js solutions like i tell you can search web with query like javascript date-pickers or jquery date-pickerAfter having read lots of discussions, I have prepared a simple solution but I don\'t want to use lots of Jquery and CSS, just some javascript.HTML Code:CSS Code:Javascript Code :Output:The format of the HTML5 date picker depends on the format of the server machine date time Format.So you can change it by changing the format on you deployment server in Task bar..
