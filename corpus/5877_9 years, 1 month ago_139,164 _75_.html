What do the result codes in SVN mean? I need a quick reference.For additional details see the SVNBook: "Status of working copy files and directories".The common statuses:U: Working file was updatedG: Changes on the repo were automatically merged into the working copyM: Working copy is modifiedC: This file conflicts with the version in the repo ?: This file is not under version control!: This file is under version control but is missing or incompleteA: This file will be added to version control (after commit)A+: This file will be moved (after commit)D: This file will be deleted (after commit)S: This signifies that the file or directory has been switched from the path of the rest of the working copy (using svn switch) to a\n  branchI: IgnoredX: External definition~: Type changedR: Item has been replaced in your working copy. This means the file was scheduled for deletion, and then a new file with the same name was scheduled for addition in its place.L    : Item is lockedE: Item existed, as it would have been created, by an svn update.Also note that a result code in the second column refers to the properties of the file. For example:filename.1: the file was updated\nfilename.2: a property or properties on the file (such as svn:keywords) was updated\nfilename.3: both the file and its properties were updatedYou can always get a list by running:There is also an \'E\' statusE = File existed before updateThis can happen if you have manually created a folder that would have been created by performing an update.I want to say something about the "G" status,G: Changes on the repo were automatically merged into the working copyI think the above definition is not cleary, it can generate a little confusion, because all files are automatically merged in to working copy, the correct one should be:U  = item (U)pdated to repository versionG  = item\xe2\x80\x99s local changes mer(G)ed with repositoryC  = item\xe2\x80\x99s local changes (C)onflicted with repositoryD  = item (D)eleted from working copyA  = item (A)dded to working copyI usually use svn through a gui, either my IDE or a client. Because of that, I can never remember the codes when I do have to resort to the command line.I find this cheat sheet a great help:\nSubversion Cheat SheetTake a look in the Subversion Book reference: "Status of working copy files and directories"Highly recommended for anyone doing pretty much anything with SVN.Whenever you don\'t have access to documentation (SVNBook), type (Linux):or insert the following function in your ~/.bashrc file, like so:The output of the command is split into six columns, but that is not obvious because sometimes the columns are empty. Perhaps it would have made more sense to indicate the empty columns with dashes, the way ls -l does, instead of nothing. Then, for example, L index.html would look like --L--- index.html, which makes it obvious the only information we have is in the third column the one about locking. Anyway, once you know that it begins to make more sense.The first column indicates that an item was added, deleted, or otherwise changed.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 No modifications.\xc2\xa0A\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Item is scheduled for Addition.\xc2\xa0D\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Item is scheduled for Deletion.\xc2\xa0M\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Item has been modified.\xc2\xa0R\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Item has been replaced in your working copy. This means the file was scheduled for deletion, and then a new file with the same name was scheduled for addition in its place.\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 The contents (as opposed to the properties) of the item conflict with updates received from the repository.\xc2\xa0X\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Item is related to an externals definition.\xc2\xa0I\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Item is being ignored (e.g. with the svn:ignore property).\xc2\xa0?\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Item is not under version control.\xc2\xa0!\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Item is missing (e.g. you moved or deleted it without using svn). This also indicates that a directory is incomplete (a checkout or update was interrupted).\xc2\xa0~\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Item is versioned as one kind of object (file, directory, link), but has been replaced by different kind of object. The second column tells the status of a file\xe2\x80\x99s or directory\xe2\x80\x99s properties.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 No modifications.\xc2\xa0M\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Properties for this item have been modified.\xc2\xa0C\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Properties for this item are in conflict with property updates received from the repository.The third column is populated only if the working copy directory is locked (an svn cleanup should normally be enough to clear it out)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Item is not locked.\xc2\xa0L\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Item is locked.The fourth column is populated only if the item is scheduled for addition-with-history.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 No history scheduled with commit.\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 History scheduled with commit.The fifth column is populated only if the item\xe2\x80\x99s working copy is switched relative to its parent\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Item is a child of its parent directory.\xc2\xa0S\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Item is switched.The sixth column is populated with lock information.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 When \xe2\x80\x93show-updates is used, the file is not locked. If \xe2\x80\x93show-updates is not used, this merely means that the file is not locked in this working copy.\xc2\xa0K\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 File is locked in this working copy.\xc2\xa0O\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 File is locked either by another user or in another working copy. This only appears when \xe2\x80\x93show-updates is used.\xc2\xa0T\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 File was locked in this working copy, but the lock has been stolen and is invalid. The file is currently locked in the repository. This only appears when \xe2\x80\x93show-updates is used.-\xc2\xa0B\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 File was locked in this working copy, but the lock has been broken and is invalid. The file is no longer locked This only appears when \xe2\x80\x93show-updates is used.The out-of-date information appears in the seventh column (only if you pass the \xe2\x80\x93show-updates switch). This is something people who are new to SVN expect the command to do, not realizing it only compare the current state of the file with what information it fetched from the server on the last update.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 The item in your working copy is up-to-date.\xc2\xa0*\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 A newer revision of the item exists on the server.
