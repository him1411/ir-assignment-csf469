In case of a change of the database this query perhaps might not work anymore and the migration would be broken. So, is there a way to express the undo of a default setting for a column in rails?change_column_default(table_name, column_name, nil) also works to drop the column\'s default value entirely.  No need to use execute.Sounds like you\'re doing the right thing with your \'execute\', as the docs point out:Sets a new default value for a column.\n  If you want to set the default value\n  to NULL, you are out of luck. You need\n  to DatabaseStatements#execute the\n  appropriate SQL statement yourself.\n  ExamplesThe following snippet I use to make NULL columns NOT NULL, but skip DEFAULT at schema level:Rails 4
