I want to read a text file line by line. I wanted to know if I\'m doing it as efficiently as possible within the .NET C# scope of things.This is what I\'m trying so far:If you\'re using .NET 4, simply use File.ReadLines which does it all for you. I suspect it\'s much the same as yours, except it may also use FileOptions.SequentialScan and a larger buffer (128 seems very small).To find the fastest way to read a file line by line you will have to do some benchmarking. I have done some small tests on my computer but you cannot expect that my results apply to your environment.Using StreamReader.ReadLineThis is basically your method. For some reason you set the buffer size to the smallest possible value (128). Increasing this will in general increase performance. The default size is 1,024 and other good choices are 512 (the sector size in Windows) or 4,096 (the cluster size in NTFS). You will have to run a benchmark to determine an optimal buffer size. A bigger buffer is - if not faster - at least not slower than a smaller buffer.The FileStream constructor allows you to specify FileOptions. For example, if you are reading a large file sequentially from beginning to end, you may benefit from FileOptions.SequentialScan. Again, benchmarking is the best thing you can do.Using File.ReadLinesThis is very much like your own solution except that it is implemented using a StreamReader with a fixed buffer size of 1,024. On my computer this results in slightly better performance compared to your code with the buffer size of 128. However, you can get the same performance increase by using a larger buffer size. This method is implemented using an iterator block and does not consume memory for all lines.Using File.ReadAllLinesThis is very much like the previous method except that this method grows a list of strings used to create the returned array of lines so the memory requirements are higher. However, it returns String[] and not an IEnumerable<String> allowing you to randomly access the lines.Using String.SplitThis method is considerably slower, at least on big files (tested on a 511 KB file), probably due to how String.Split is implemented. It also allocates an array for all the lines increasing the memory required compared to your solution.My suggestion is to use File.ReadLines because it is clean and efficient. If you require special sharing options (for example you use FileShare.ReadWrite), you can use your own code but you should increase the buffer size.While File.ReadAllLines() is one of the simplest ways to read a file, it is also one of the slowest.If you\'re just wanting to read lines in a file without doing much, according to these benchmarks, the fastest way to read a file is the age old method of:However, if you have to do a lot with each line, then this article concludes that the best way is the following (and it\'s faster to pre-allocate a string[] if you know how many lines you\'re going to read) :Use the following code:This was a HUGE difference in reading performance.It comes at the cost of memory consumption, but totally worth it!If file size is not big, is faster to read all file then split string:There\'s a good topic about this in Stack Overflow question Is \'yield return\' slower than "old school" return?.It says:ReadAllLines loads all of the lines into memory and returns a\n  string[]. All well and good if the file is small. If the file is\n  larger than will fit in memory, you\'ll run out of memory.ReadLines, on the other hand, uses yield return to return one line at\n  a time. With it, you can read any size file. It doesn\'t load the whole\n  file into memory.Say you wanted to find the first line that contains the word "foo",\n  and then exit. Using ReadAllLines, you\'d have to read the entire file\n  into memory, even if "foo" occurs on the first line. With ReadLines,\n  you only read one line. Which one would be faster?If you are aiming at the execution speed, yes you are. The code could be shorter by using StreamReader constructor.If you have enough memory, I\'ve found some performance gains by reading the entire file into a memory stream, and then opening a stream reader on that to read the lines.  As long as you actually plan on reading the whole file anyway, this can yield some improvements.You can\'t get any faster if you want to use an existing API to read the lines. But reading larger chunks and manually find each new line in the read buffer would probably be faster.
