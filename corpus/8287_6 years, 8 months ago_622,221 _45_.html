I need to know where JDK is located on my machine. On running Java -version in cmd, it shows the version as \'1.6.xx\'.\nTo find the location of this SDK on my machine I tried using echo %JAVA_HOME% but it is only showing \'JAVA_HOME\' (as there is no \'JAVA_PATH\' var set in my environment variables).If you are using Linux/Unix/Mac OS X:Try this:Should output the exact location.After that, you can set JAVA_HOME environment variable yourself.In my computer (Mac OS X - Snow Leopard):If you are using Windows:Windows > Start > cmd > If you have a JDK installed, the Path is displayed,\nfor example: C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.6.0_30\\bin\\javac.exeIn Windows at the command promptwhere javacJava installer puts several files into %WinDir%\\System32 folder (java.exe, javaws.exe and some others). When you type java.exe in command line or create process without full path, Windows runs these as last resort if they are missing in %PATH% folders. You can lookup all versions of Java installed in registry. Take a look at HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\JavaSoft\\Java Runtime Environment and HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\JavaSoft\\Java Runtime Environment for 32-bit java on 64 bit Windows.This is how java itself finds out different versions installed. And this is why both 32-bit and 64-bit version can co-exist and works fine without interfering.In windows the default is: C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.6.0_14 (where the numbers may differ, as they\'re the version).Plain and simple on Windows platforms:where javaThe batch script below will print out the existing default JRE. It can be easily modified to find the JDK version installed by replacing the Java Runtime Environment with Java Development Kit.More on Windows... variable java.home is not always the same location as the binary that is run. As Denis The Menace says, the installer puts Java files into Program Files, but also java.exe into System32. With nothing Java related on the path java -version can still work. However when PeterMmm\'s program is run it reports the value of Program Files as java.home, this is not wrong (Java is installed there) but the actual binary being run is located in System32.One way to hunt down the location of the java.exe binary, add the following line to PeterMmm\'s code to keep the program running a while longer:Compile and run it, then hunt down the location of the java.exe image. E.g. in Windows 7 open the task manager, find the java.exe entry, right click and select \'open file location\', this opens the exact location of the Java binary. In this case it would be System32.Run this program from commandline:In a Windows command prompt, just type:Or, if you don\'t like the command environment, you can check it from:Start menu > Computer > System Properties > Advanced System Properties. Then open Advanced tab > Environment Variables and in system variable try to find JAVA_HOME. Under Windows, you can useto print the full path of each and every "java.exe" on your C: drive, regardless of whether they are on your PATH environment variable.Have you tried looking at your %PATH% variable. That\'s what Windows uses to find any executable.Just execute the  set command in your command line. Then you see all the environments variables you have set.Or if on Unix you can simplify it:This is OS specific. On Unix:will display the path to the executable. I don\'t know of a Windows equivalent, but there you typically have the bin folder of the JDK installation in the system PATH:None of these answers are correct for Linux if you are looking for the home that includes the subdirs such as: bin, docs, include, jre, lib, etc.On Ubuntu for openjdk1.8.0, this is in:\n/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64and you may prefer to use that for JAVA_HOME since you will be able to find headers if you build JNI source files. While it\'s true which java will provide the binary path, it is not the true JDK home.Powershell one liner:in Windows cmd:For windows:This link might help to explain how to find java executable from bash: http://srcode.org/2014/05/07/detect-java-executable/On Windows 10 you can find out the path by going to Control Panel > Java. In the panel that shows up, you can find the path as demonstrated in the screenshot below. In the Java Control Panel, go to the \'Java\' tab and then click the \'View\' button under the description \'View and manage Java Runtime versions and settings for Java applications and applets.\'This should work on Windows 7 and possibly other recent versions of Windows.
