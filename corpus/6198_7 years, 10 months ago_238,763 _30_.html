I\'m trying to find out if a row exists in a table. Using MySQL, is it better to do a query like this:and check to see if the total is non-zero or is it better to do a query like this:and check to see if any rows were returned?In both queries, the WHERE clause uses an index.You could also try usingper the documentationPer a comment below:I have made some researches on this subject recently. The way to implement it has to be different if the field is a TEXT field, a non unique field.I have made some tests with a TEXT field. Considering the fact that we have a table with 1M entries. 37 entries are equal to \'something\':But now, with a BIGINT PK field, only one entry is equal to \'321321\' :A short example of @ChrisThompson\'s answerExample:Using an alias:Suggest you not to use Count because count always makes extra loads for db use SELECT 1 and it returns 1 if your record right there otherwise it returns null and you can handle it.At times it is quite handy to get the auto increment primary key (id) of the row if it exists and 0 if it doesn\'t.Here\'s how this can be done in a single query:In my research, I can find the result getting on following speed. I\'d go with COUNT(1). It is faster than COUNT(*) because COUNT(*) tests to see if at least one column in that row is != NULL. You don\'t need that, especially because you already have a condition in place (the WHERE clause). COUNT(1) instead tests the validity of 1, which is always valid and takes a lot less time to test.I feel it is worth pointing out, although it was touched on in the comments, that in this situation:Is superior to:This is because the first query can be satisfied by the index, whereas the second requires a row look up (unless possibly all the table\'s columns are in the index used).Adding the LIMIT clause allows the engine to stop after finding any row.The first query should be comparable to:Which sends the same signals to the engine.It may make sense to add the EXISTS wrapping is if you require an explicit return when no rows match.For non-InnoDB tables you could also use the information schema tables:http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/tables-table.htmlOr you can insert raw sql part to conditions\nso I have \n\'conditions\'=>array(\'Member.id NOT IN (SELECT Membership.member_id FROM memberships AS Membership)\')A COUNT query is faster, although maybe not noticeably, but as far as getting the desired result, both should be sufficient.COUNT(*) are optimized in MySQL, so the former query is likely to be faster, generally speaking.
