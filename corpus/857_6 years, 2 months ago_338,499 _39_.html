I need to write a script that create patches for a list of SHA1 commit numbers.I tried using git format-patch <the SHA1>, but that generated a patch for each commit since that SHA1. After a few hundred patches were generated, I had to kill the process.Is there a way to generate a patch only for the specific SHA1?Try:For generating the patches from the topmost  commits from a specific sha1 hash:The last 10 patches from head in a single patch file:Say you have commit id 2 after commit 1 you would be able to run:where 2 and 1 are SHA hashes.This command (as suggested already by @Naftuli Tzvi Kay):Replace HEAD with specific hash or range.will generate the patch file for the latest commit formatted to resemble UNIX mailbox format.-<n> - Prepare patches from the topmost  commits.Then you can re-apply the patch file in a mailbox format by:See: man git-format-patch.If you want to be sure the (single commit) patch will be applied on top of a specific commit, you can use the new git 2.9 (June 2016) option git format-patch --baseSee commit bb52995, commit 3de6651, commit fa2ab86, commit ded2c09 (26 Apr 2016) by Xiaolong Ye (``).\n(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit 72ce3ff, 23 May 2016) Maintainers or third party testers may want to know the exact base tree\n  the patch series applies to. Teach git format-patch a \'--base\' option\n  to record the base tree info and append it at the end of the first\n  message (either the cover letter or the first patch in the series).The base tree info consists of the "base commit", which is a well-known\n  commit that is part of the stable part of the project history everybody\n  else works off of, and zero or more "prerequisite patches", which are\n  well-known patches in flight that is not yet part of the "base commit"\n  that need to be applied on top of "base commit" in topological order\n  before the patches can be applied.The "base commit" is shown as "base-commit: " followed by the 40-hex of\n  the commit object name.\n  A "prerequisite patch" is shown as "prerequisite-patch-id: " followed by the 40-hex "patch id", which can be obtained by passing the patch through the "git patch-id --stable" command.Fast and simple solution.To generate path from a specific commit (not the last commit):What is the way to generate a patch only for the specific SHA1?It\'s quite simple:Option 1. git show commitID > myFile.patchOption 2. git commitID~1..commitID > myFile.patchNote: Replace commitID with actual commit id (SHA1 commit code).Examples (source)Extract commits between revisions R1 and R2, and apply them on top of the current branch using git am to cherry-pick them:$ git format-patch -k --stdout R1..R2 | git am -3 -kExtract all commits which are in the current branch but not in the origin branch:$ git format-patch originFor each commit a separate file is created in the current directory.Extract all commits that lead to origin since the inception of the project:$ git format-patch --root originThe same as the previous one:$ git format-patch -M -B originAdditionally, it detects and handles renames and complete rewrites intelligently to produce a renaming patch. A renaming patch reduces the amount of text output, and generally makes it easier to review. Note that non-Git "patch" programs won\xe2\x80\x99t understand renaming patches, so use it only when you know the recipient uses Git to apply your patch.Extract three topmost commits from the current branch and format them as e-mailable patches:$ git format-patch -3
