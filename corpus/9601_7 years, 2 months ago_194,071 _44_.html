I have a large bitmap (say 3888x2592) in a file. Now, I want to resize that bitmap to 800x533 and save it to another file.\nI normally would scale the bitmap by calling Bitmap.createBitmap method but it needs a source bitmap as the first argument, which I can\'t provide because loading the original image into a Bitmap object would of course exceed the memory (see here, for example).I also can\'t read the bitmap with, for example, BitmapFactory.decodeFile(file, options), providing a BitmapFactory.Options.inSampleSize, because I want to resize it to an exact width and height. Using inSampleSize would resize the bitmap to 972x648 (if I use inSampleSize=4) or to 778x518 (if I use inSampleSize=5, which isn\'t even a power of 2).I would also like to avoid reading the image using inSampleSize with, for example, 972x648 in a first step and then resizing it to exactly 800x533 in a second step, because the quality would be poor compared to a direct resizing of the original image.To sum up my question:\nIs there a way to read a large image file with 10MP or more and save it to a new image file, resized to a specific new width and height, without getting an OutOfMemory exception?I also tried BitmapFactory.decodeFile(file, options) and setting the Options.outHeight and Options.outWidth values manually to 800 and 533, but it doesn\'t work that way.No.  I\'d love for someone to correct me, but I accepted the load/resize approach you tried as a compromise.Here are the steps for anyone browsing:Justin answer translated to code (works perfect for me):This is \'Mojo Risin\'s and \'Ofir\'s solutions "combined". This will give you a proportionally resized image with the boundaries of max width and max height.For me it has been performing fine on 5 MegaPixel images an below.Why not use the API?Acknowledging the other excellent answer so far, the best code I\'ve seen yet for this is in the documentation for the photo taking tool.See the section entitled "Decode a Scaled Image".http://developer.android.com/training/camera/photobasics.htmlThe solution it proposes is a resize then scale solution like the others here, but it\'s quite neat.I\'ve copied the code below as a ready-to-go function for convenience.After reading these answers and android documentation here\'s the code to resize bitmap without loading it into memory:When i have large bitmaps and i want to decode them resized i use the followingThis may be useful for someone else looking at this question. I rewrote Justin\'s code to allow the method to receive the target size object required as well. This works very well when using Canvas. All credit should go to JUSTIN for his great initial code.Justin\'s code is VERY effective at reducing the overhead of working with large Bitmaps. I don\'t know if my solution is best practice, but I achieved loading a bitmap with my desired scaling by using the inDensity and inTargetDensity options. inDensity is 0 initially when not loading a drawable resource, so this approach is for loading non resource images.The variables imageUri, maxImageSideLength and context are parameters of my method. I posted only the method implementation without the wrapping AsyncTask for clarity.Taking into account that you want to resize to exact size and want to keep as much quality as needed I think you should try this.Motivation: multiple-steps scaling could give you higher quality picture, however there is no guarantee that it will work better than using high inSampleSize. \nActually, I think that you also can use inSampleSize like 5 (not pow of 2) to have direct scaling in one operation. Or just use 4 and then you can just use that image in UI. if you send it to server - than you can do scaling to exact size on server side which allow you to use advanced scaling techniques.Notes: if the Bitmap loaded in step-3 is at least 4 times larger (so the 4*targetWidth < width) you probably can use several resizing to achieve better quality. \nat least that works in generic java, in android you don\'t have the option to specify the interpolation used for scaling\nhttp://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2007/04/03/perils-of-image-getscaledinstance.htmlI used code like this:I tried original image is 1230 x 1230, and got bitmap says is 330 x 330.\nAnd if tried 2590 x 3849, I\'ll got OutOfMemoryError.I traced it, it still throw OutOfMemoryError on line "BitmapFactory.decodeStream(is, null, options);", if original bitmap too large...Above code made a little cleaner. InputStreams have finally close wrapping to ensure they get closed as well:*Note\nInput: InputStream is, int w, int h \n\nOutput: BitmapTo scale the image the "correct" way, without skipping any pixels, you\'d have to hook into the image decoder to perform the down-sampling row by row. Android (and the Skia library that underlies it) provides no such hooks, so you\'d have to roll your own. Assuming you\'re talking jpeg images, your best bet would be to use libjpeg directly, in C.Given the complexities involved, using the two-step subsample-then-rescale is probably best for image-preview type apps.Here is an article that takes a different approach to resizing. It will attempt to load the largest possible bitmap into memory based on available memory in the process and then perform the transforms.http://bricolsoftconsulting.com/2012/12/07/handling-large-images-on-android/If you absolutely want to do one step resize you could probably load entire bitmap if\nandroid:largeHeap = true but as you can see this is not really advisable.From docs:\nandroid:largeHeap\nWhether your application\'s processes should be created with a large Dalvik heap. This applies to all processes created for the application. It only applies to the first application loaded into a process; if you\'re using a shared user ID to allow multiple applications to use a process, they all must use this option consistently or they will have unpredictable results.\nMost apps should not need this and should instead focus on reducing their overall memory usage for improved performance. Enabling this also does not guarantee a fixed increase in available memory, because some devices are constrained by their total available memory.There is a great article about this exact issue on the Android developer website:\nLoading Large Bitmaps EfficientlyThis worked for me. The function gets a path to a file on the sd card and returns a Bitmap in the maximum displayable size.\nThe code is from Ofir with some changes like image file on sd instead a Ressource and the witdth and heigth are get from the Display Object.or:Here is the code I use which doesn\'t have any issues decoding large images in memory on Android.  I have been able to decode images larger then 20MB as long as my input parameters are around 1024x1024. You can save the returned bitmap to another file.  Below this method is another method which I also use to scale images to a new bitmap.  Feel free to use this code as you wish.NOTE: Methods have nothing to do with each other except createScaledBitmap calls decode method above. Note width and height can change from original image.Resize the bitmap using the following codeThe same is also explained in the following tip/trickhttp://www.codeproject.com/Tips/625810/Android-Image-Operations-Using-BitmapFactory
