I\'ve got a project checked locally from github, that remote repo has since had changes made to it. What\'s the correct command to update my local copy with the latest changes?probably:However you\'ll need to merge any changes into your local branches. If you\'re on a branch that\'s tracking a remote branch on Github, thenwill first do a fetch, and then merge in the tracked branchThis should work for every default repo:If your default branch is different than master, you will need to specify the branch name:With already set origin master, you just have to use below command - \ngit pull "https://github.com/yourUserName/yourRepo.git"
