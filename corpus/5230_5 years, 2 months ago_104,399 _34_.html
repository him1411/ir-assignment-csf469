I\'ve upgraded the SDK tools to revision 20 (from 18) and since the upgrade, the emulator doesn\'t seem to accept input from laptop\'s keyboard. But only using the emulator\'s own \'soft\' keyboard (that appears when an input field is focused).I\'ve tried reinstalling the SDK tools (and the whole SDK for that matter), uninstalled and reinstalled Eclipse Android plugins, re-created emulator devices. But none of that seem to help and its driving me mad. Its hopeless to key-in using a laptop\'s trackpad.Has anyone encountered this problem?UpdateAs of SDK rev 21 the Android Virtual Device Manager has an improved UI which resolves this issue.  I have highlighted some of the more important configuration settings below:If you notice that the soft (screen-based) main keys Back, Home, etc. are missing from your emulator you can set hw.mainKeys=no to enable them.Original answerEven though the developer documentation says keyboard support is enabled by default it doesn\'t seem to be that way in SDK rev 20.  I explicitly enabled keyboard support in my emulator\'s config.ini file and that worked!Add: hw.keyboard=yesTo: ~/.android/avd/<emulator-device-name>.avd/config.iniSimilarly, add hw.dPad=yes if you wish to use the arrow-keys to navigate the application list.Reference: http://developer.android.com/tools/devices/managing-avds-cmdline.html#hardwareoptsOn Mac OS and Linux you can edit all of your emulator configurations with one Terminal command:for f in ~/.android/avd/*.avd/config.ini; do echo \'hw.keyboard=yes\' >> "$f"; doneOn a related note, if your tablet emulator is missing the BACK/HOME buttons, try selecting WXGA800 as the Built-in skin in the AVD editor:\nOr by manually setting the skin in config.ini:(example is for API 16)Confirmed. I had the same problem after upgrading to Tools version 20. I had to Edit the AVD to add an option as follows:This will add a property hw.keyboard=yes in config.ini file for the AVD.In Android Studio, open AVD Manager (Tools > Android > AVD Manager).\nTap the Edit button of the emulator:\nSelect "Show Advanced Settings"\nCheck "Enable keyboard input"\nClick Finish and start the emulator to enjoy the keyboard input.Look in AVD Manager, select the AVD and click in Edit. In Hardware section: click in "New" and search for "Keyboard support" and add with OK button and set the value to "yes" and save changes with "Edit AVD"Google wanted to give some more headache to the developers.  So, what you have to do now is edit your AVD and add "Keyboard Support" for it in the Hardware section and change the value to "Yes"In your home folder\n/.android/avd//config.ini\nadd the line\nhw.keyboard=yesJust in case somebody finds it usefull.I had a problem with the KEYCODE_DPAD_UP it belongs to the trackBall. to solve this change your avdfolder/config.ini hw.trackBall=yes and push DEL or F6Restarting emulator helps sometimes when typing is unavailable inspite of AVD keyboard input enabled.Look for the hidden .android folder in your user home folder. You might rename or delete this folder, recreate your AVD, and restart the emulator. It could be there is a .ini file in that folder that has that setting munged.Recreating an AVD with the Hardware Keyboard + setting the boolean to true was the only solution that worked for me; the other two main solutions (terminal or editing an existing AVD  via GUI) both resulted in software/emulator crashes on my Mac. Making a new AVD resulted in the keyboard working just fine.
