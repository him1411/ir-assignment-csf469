I really like Araxis Merge for a graphical DIFF program for the PC.  I have no idea\nwhat\'s available for linux, though.  We\'re running SUSE linix on our z800 mainframe.\nI\'d be most grateful if I could get a few pointers to what programs everyone else likes.I know of two graphical diff programs: Meld and KDiff3. I haven\'t used KDiff3, but Meld works well for me.It seems that both are in the standard package repositories for openSUSE 11.0BeyondCompare has also just been released in a Linux version.Not free, but the Windows version is worth every penny - I\'m assuming the Linux version is the same.If you use vim, you can use the inbuilt diff functionality. vi -d file1 file2 takes you right into the diff screen.. where you can do all sort of merge and deletes.Diffuse (http://diffuse.sourceforge.net/) is also very good.  It even lets you easily adjust how lines are matched up.Emacs comes with Ediff.EdiffScreenshot http://www.emacswiki.org/pics/static/EdiffScreenshot.pngMeld and KDiff are two of the most popular.I am using ubuntu and installed meld package. Meld is a very good graphical diff/merge program.xxdiff is lightweight if that\'s what you\'re after.I have used Meld once, which seemed very nice, and I may try more often. vimdiff works well, if you know vim well. Lastly I would mention I\'ve found xxdiff does a reasonable job for a quick comparison. There are many diff programs out there which do a good job.Kompare is fine for diff, but I use dirdiff. Although it looks ugly, dirdiff can do 3-way merge - and you can get everything done inside the tool (both diff and merge). There is DiffMerge from SourceGear. It\'s pretty good.  Araxis Merge is one of the programs I miss from Windows.  I wonder if it works under Wine ;)  Might have to give it a trySubclipse for Eclipse has an excellent graphical diff plugin if you are using SVN (subversion) source control. I use Guiffy and it works well.\n alt text http://guiffy.org/images/CompareReportInFFThumb.jpgI generally need to diff codes from subversion repositories and so far eclipse has worked really nicely for me... I use KDiff3 for other works.ExamDiff Pro has a nice diff tool for Windows.  I just played around with their latest version, 5.5.1.18, under Wine v1.01.  Based on a very brief period of use, the only problem I ran into was that you have to open the files for comparison using the main interface, not the Compare New Pair window.  The program crashes after selecting the second file for comparison under the Compare New Pair window.
