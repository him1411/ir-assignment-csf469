Is there any standard way for a Web Server to be able to determine a user\'s timezone within a web page? Perhaps from a HTTP header or part of the user-agent string?getTimezoneOffset() will subtract your time from GMT and return the number of minutes. So if you live in GMT-8, it will return 480. To put this into hours, divide by 60. Also, notice that the sign is the opposite of what you need -- it\'s calculating GMT\'s offset from your time zone, not your time zone\'s offset from GMT. To fix this, simply multiply by -1. Edit Also note that w3school says:The returned value is not a constant, because of the practice of using\n  Daylight Saving Time.The most popular (==standard?) way of determining the time zone I\'ve seen around is simply asking the users themselves. If your website requires subscription, this could be saved in the users\' profile data. For anon users, the dates could be displayed as UTC or GMT or some such.I\'m not trying to be a smart aleck. It\'s just that sometimes some problems have finer solutions outside of any programming context.There are no HTTP headers that will report the clients timezone so far although it has been suggested to include it in the HTTP specification.If it was me, I would probably try to fetch the timezone using clientside JavaScript and then submit it to the server using Ajax or something.Javascript is the easiest way to get the client\'s local time.  I would suggest using an XMLHttpRequest to send back the local time, and if that fails, fall back to the timezone detected based on their IP address.As far as geolocation, I\'ve used MaxMind GeoIP on several projects and it works well, though I\'m not sure if they provide timezone data.  It\'s a service you pay for and they provide monthly updates to your database.  They provide wrappers in several web languages.Here is a robust JavaScript solution to determine the time zone the browser is in.https://bitbucket.org/pellepim/jstimezonedetectHere is a more complete way.Except Below:Getting TZ and DST from JS (via Way Back Machine)Using Unkwntech\'s approach, I wrote a function using jQuery and PHP.  This is tested, and does work!On the PHP page where you are want to have the timezone as a variable, have this snippet of code somewhere near the top of the page:This will read the session variable "time", which we are now about to create.On the same page, in the , you need to first of all include jQuery:Also in the , below the jQuery, paste this:You may or may not have noticed, but you need to change the url to your actual domain.One last thing.  You are probably wondering what the heck timezone.php is.  Well, it is simply this:\n(create a new file called timezone.php and point to it with the above url)If this works correctly, it will first load the page, execute the JavaScript, and reload the page.  You will then be able to read the $timezone variable and use it to your pleasure!  It returns the current UTC/GMT time zone offset (GMT -7) or whatever timezone you are in.  I still have not seen a detailed answer here that gets the time zone. You shouldn\'t need to geocode by IP address or use PHP (lol) or incorrectly guess from an offset. Firstly a time zone is not just an offset from GMT. It is an area of land in which the time rules are set by local standards. Some countries have daylight savings, and will switch on DST at differing times. It\'s usually important to get the actual zone, not just the current offset.If you intend to store this timezone, for instance in user preferences you want the zone and not just the offset. For realtime conversions it won\'t matter much.Now, to get the time zone with javascript you can use this:However I found it easier to simply use this robust plugin which returns the Olsen formatted timezone:https://github.com/scottwater/jquery.detect_timezoneTo submit the timezone offset as an HTTP header on AJAX requests with jQueryYou can also do something similar to get the actual time zone name by using moment.tz.guess(); from http://momentjs.com/timezone/docs/#/using-timezones/guessing-user-timezone/Easy, just use the JavaScript getTimezoneOffset function like so:With PHP date function you will get the date time of server on which site is located. The only way to get user time is to use JavaScript.But I suggest you to, if your site have registration required then best way is to ask user while registration as compulsory field. You can list various time zones in register page and save that in database. After this if user login to site then you can set default time zone for that session as per users\xe2\x80\x99 selected time zone. You can set any specific time zone using PHP function date_default_timezone_set. This set the specified time zone for users.Basically users\xe2\x80\x99 time zone is goes to client side, so we must use JavaScript for this.Below is the script to get users\xe2\x80\x99 time zone using PHP and JavaScript.But as per my point of view, it\xe2\x80\x99s better to ask to the users if registration is mandatory in your project.Anyone know of any services that will\n  match IP to geographic locationWell, lucky for you that answer can be found on our very own stackoverflow website:\nHow to get the Country according to a certain IP?spoiler: http://www.hostip.info/use.htmljavascript:simply provide your times in UNIX Timestamp format to this function, javascript already knows the timezone of the user.like this:php:this will always show the times correctly based on the timezone the person has set on his computer clock, no need to ask anything to anyone and save it into places thank god!Don\'t use IP address to definitively determine location (and hense timezone)-- that\'s because with NAT, Proxies (increasingly popular), and VPNs, IP addresses do not necessarily realistically reflect the user\'s actual location, but the location at which the servers implementing those protocols reside.Similar to how Area Codes are no longer useful for locating a telephone user, given the popularity of Number Portability.IP and other techniques shown above are useful for suggesting a default that the user can adjust/correct.The magic all seems to be in That\'s cool, I didn\'t know about that. Does it work in IE, etc?\nFrom there you should be able to use JS to ajax, set cookies, whatever. I\'d probably go the cookie route myself.You\'ll need to allow the user to change it though. We tried to use geolocation (via maxmind) to do this a while ago, and it was wrong reasonably often - enough to make it not worth doing, so we just let the user set it in their profile, and show a notice to users who haven\'t set theirs yet.If you happen to be using OpenID for authentication, Simple Registration Extension would solve the problem for authenticated users (You\'ll need to convert from tz to numeric).Another option would be to infer the time zone from the user agent\'s country preference. This is a somewhat crude method (won\'t work for en-US), but makes a good approximation.A simple way to do it is by using:Here is an article (with source code) that explains how to determine and use localized time in an ASP.NET (VB.NET, C#) application: It\'s About TimeIn short, the described approach relies on the JavaScript getTimezoneOffset function, which returns the value that is saved in the session cookie and used by code-behind to adjust time values between GMT and local time. The nice thing is that the user does not need to specify the time zone (the code does it automatically). There is more involved (this is why I link to the article), but provided code makes it really easy to use. I suspect that you can convert the logic to PHP and other languages (as long as you understand ASP.NET). Simple with JS and PHP:Even though the user can mess with his internal clock and/or timezone, the best way i found so far, to get the offset, remains new Date().getTimezoneOffset();. Its non-invasive, doesn\'t give head-aches and eliminates the need to rely on third parties.Say i have a table users that contains a field date_created int(13), for storing unix timestamps;Assuming a client creates a new account, data is received by post, and i need to insert/update the date_created column with the client\'s unix timestamp, not the server\'s.Since the timezoneOffset is needed at the time of insert/update, it is passed as an extra $_POST element when the client submits the form, thus eliminating the need to store it in sessions and/or cookies, and no additional server hits either.Say the server receives tzo as $_POST[\'tzo\'];Insert/update date_created=$user_timestamp.When retrieving the date_created, you can convert the timestamp like so:Now, this example may fit one\'s needs, when it comes to inserting a first timestamp... When it comes to an additional timestamp, or table, u may want to consider inserting the tzo value into the users table for future reference, or setting it as session or as a cookie.P.S. BUT what if the user travels and switches timezones. Logs in at GMT+4, travels fast to GMT-1 and logs in again. Last login would be in the future.I think... we think too much.Try this php codeOne possible option is to use the Date header field, which is defined in RFC 7231 and is supposed to include the timezone. Of course, it is not guaranteed that the value is really the client\'s timezone, but it can be a convenient starting point.Here\'s how I do it. This will set the PHP default timezone to the user\'s local timezone. Just paste the following on the top of all your pages:Getting a valid TZ Database timezone name in PHP is a two step process :1) With Javascript, get timezone offset in minutes through getTimezoneOffset. This offset will be positive if the local timezone is behind UTC and negative if it is ahead. So you must add an opposite sign to the offset.Pass this offset to PHP.2) In PHP convert this offset into a valid timezone name with timezone_name_from_abbr function.I\'ve written a blog post on it : http://usefulangle.com/post/31/detect-user-browser-timezone-name-in-php\nIt contains a demo also.you could do it on client with moment-timezone and send the value to server; sample usage:
