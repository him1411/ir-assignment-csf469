I would like to check to see if I have an Internet connection on iOS using the Cocoa Touch libraries or on OSX using the Cocoa libraries.I came up with a way to do this using an NSURL. The way I did it seems a bit unreliable (because even Google could one day be down and relying on a third party seems bad), and while I could check to see for a response from some other websites if Google didn\'t respond, it does seem wasteful and an unnecessary overhead on my application.Is what I have done bad? (Not to mention stringWithContentsOfURL is deprecated in iOS 3.0 and OSX 10.4)  and if so, what is a better way to accomplish this?METHOD 1: Use a simple (ARC and GCD compatible) class to do it1) Add SystemConfiguration framework to the project but don\'t worry about including it anywhere2) Add Tony Million\'s version of Reachability.h and Reachability.m to the project (found here: https://github.com/tonymillion/Reachability)3) Update the interface section4) Then implement this method in the .m file of your view controller which you can callMETHOD 2: Do it yourself the old way using Apple\'s outdated Reachability class1) Add SystemConfiguration framework to the project but don\'t worry about including it anywhere2) Add Apple\'s version of Reachability.h and Reachability.m to the project (you can get those here)3) Add @class Reachability; to the .h file of where you are implementing the code4) Create a couple instances to check in the interface section of the .h file:5) Add a method in the .h for when the network status updates:6) Add #import "Reachability.h" to the .m file where you are implementing the check7) In the .m file of where you are implementing the check, you can place this in one of the first methods called (init or viewWillAppear or viewDidLoad etc):8) Set up the method for when the notification gets sent and set whatever checks or call whatever methods you may have set up (in my case, I just set a BOOL)9) In your dealloc or viewWillDisappear or similar method, remove yourself as an observerNote: There might be an instance using viewWillDisappear where you receive a memory warning and the observer never gets unregistered so you should account for that as well.Note: The domain you use doesn\'t matter. It\'s just testing for a gateway to any domain.Important Note: The Reachability class is one of the most used classes in projects so you might run into naming conflicts with other projects like ShareKit.  If this happens, you\'ll have to rename one of the pairs of Reachability.h and Reachability.m files to something else to resolve the issue.I like to keep things simple. The way I do this is:Then, I use this whenever I want to see if I have a connection:This method doesn\'t wait for changed network statuses in order to do stuff. It just tests the status when you ask it to.Using Apple\'s Reachability code, I created a function that\'ll check this correctly without you having to include any classes.Include the SystemConfiguration.framework in your project.Make some imports:Now just call this function:And it\'s iOSÂ 5 tested for you.This used to be the correct answer, but it is now outdated as you should subscribe to notifications for reachability instead. This method checks synchronously:You can use Apple\'s Reachability class. It will also allow you to check if Wi-Fi is enabled:The Reachability class is not shipped with the SDK, but rather a part of this Apple sample application. Just download it, and copy Reachability.h/m to your project. Also, you have to add the SystemConfiguration framework to your project.Here\'s a very simple answer:The URL should point to an extremely small website. I use Google\'s mobile website here, but if I had a reliable web server I\'d upload a small file with just one character in it for maximum speed.If checking whether the device is somehow connected to the Internet is everything you want to do, I\'d definitely recommend using this simple solution. If you need to know how the user is connected, using Reachability is the way to go.Careful: This will briefly block your thread while it loads the website. In my case, this wasn\'t a problem, but you should consider this (credits to Brad for pointing this out).Here is how I do it in my apps: While a 200 status response code doesn\'t guarantee anything, it is stable enough for me. This doesn\'t require as much loading as the NSData answers posted here, as mine just checks the HEAD response.Apple supplies sample code to check for different types of network availability. Alternatively there is an example in the iPhone developers cookbook.Note: Please see @KHG\'s comment on this answer regarding the use of Apple\'s reachability code.You could use Reachability by \xef\xa3\xbf (available here).Apple provides a sample app which does exactly this:ReachabilityOnly the Reachability class has been updated. You can now use:A version on Reachability for iOS 5 is darkseed/Reachability.h. It\'s not mine! =)There\'s a nice-looking, ARC- and GCD-using modernization of Reachability here:ReachabilityIf you\'re using AFNetworking you can use its own implementation for internet reachability status.The best way to use AFNetworking is to subclass the AFHTTPClient class and use this class to do your network connections.One of the advantages of using this approach is that you can use blocks to set the desired behavior when the reachability status changes. Supposing that I\'ve created a singleton subclass of AFHTTPClient (as said on the "Subclassing notes" on AFNetworking docs) named BKHTTPClient, I\'d do something like:You could also check for Wi-Fi or WLAN connections specifically using the AFNetworkReachabilityStatusReachableViaWWAN and AFNetworkReachabilityStatusReachableViaWiFi enums (more here).I\'ve used the code in this discussion, and it seems to work fine (read the whole thread!).I haven\'t tested it exhaustively with every conceivable kind of connection (like ad hoc Wi-Fi). Very simple.... Try these steps:Step 1: Add the SystemConfiguration framework into your project.Step 2: Import the following code into your header file.Step 3: Use the following methodType 1:Type 2:Import header : #import "Reachability.h"Step 4: How to use:Or use the Reachability class.There are two ways to check Internet availability using the iPhone SDK:1. Check the Google page is opened or not.2. Reachability ClassFor more information, please refer to Reachability (Apple Developer).Use http://huytd.github.io/datatify/. It\'s easier than adding libraries and write code by yourself.First: Add CFNetwork.framework in frameworkCode: ViewController.mFirst download the reachability class and put reachability.h and reachabilty.m file in your Xcode.The best way is to make a common Functions class (NSObject) so that you can use it any class. These are two methods for a network connection reachability check:Now you can check network connection in any class by calling this class method.To do this yourself is extremely simple. The following method will work. Just be sure to not allow a hostname protocol such as HTTP, HTTPS, etc. to be passed in with the name.It is quick simple and painless.I found it simple and easy to use library SimplePingHelper.Sample code: chrishulbert/SimplePingHelper (GitHub)The Reachability class is OK to find out if the Internet connection is available to a device or not...But in case of accessing an intranet resource:Pinging the intranet server with the reachability class always returns true.So a quick solution in this scenario would be to create a web method called pingme along with other webmethods on the service.\nThe pingme should return something.So I wrote the following method on common functionsThe above method was so useful for me, so whenever I try to send some data to the server I always check the reachability of my intranet resource using this low timeout URLRequest.I think this one is the best answer."Yes" means connected. "No" means disconnected.Download the Reachability file, https://gist.github.com/darkseed/1182373And add CFNetwork.framework and \'SystemConfiguration.framework\' in frameworkDo #import "Reachability.h"First: Add CFNetwork.framework in frameworkCode: ViewController.mChecking the Internet connection availability in (iOS) Xcode 8 , Swift 3.0 This is simple method for checking the network availability like our device is connected to any network or not. I have managed to translate it to Swift 3.0 and here the final code. The existing Apple Reachability class and other third party libraries seemed to be too complicated to translate to Swift.This works for both 3G,4G and WiFi connections.Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to add \xe2\x80\x9cSystemConfiguration.framework\xe2\x80\x9d to your project builder.Import Reachable.h class in your ViewController, and use the following code to check connectivity:There is also another method to check Internet connection using the iPhone SDK.Try to implement the following code for the network connection.Apart from reachability you may also use the Simple Ping helper library. It works really nice and is simple to integrate.Step 3: Create the below functionStep 4: Call the function as below:
