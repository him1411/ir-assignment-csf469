Is there any quick way to, given an executable file, create a Windows service that, when started, launches it?To create a Windows Service from an executable, you can use sc.exe:You must have quotation marks around the actual exe path, and a space after the binPath=.More information on the sc command can be found in Microsoft KB251192. Note that it will not work for just any executable: the executable must be a Windows Service (i.e. implement ServiceMain). When registering a non-service executable as a service, you\'ll get the following error upon trying to start the service:Error 1053: The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion.There are tools that can create a Windows Service from arbitrary, non-service executables, see the other answers for examples of such tools.Use NSSM( the non-Sucking Service Manager ) to run a .BAT or any .EXE file as a service. http://nssm.cc/It works for me :)Extending (Kevin Tong) answer.Step 1: Download & Unzip nssm-2.24.zipStep 2: From command line type: C:\\> nssm.exe install [servicename]it will open GUI as below (the example is UT2003 server), then simply browse it to: yourapplication.exeMore information on: https://nssm.cc/usageMany existing answers include human intervention at install time. This can be an error-prone process. If you have many executables wanted to be installed as services, the last thing you want to do is to do them manually at install time.Towards the above described scenario, I created serman, a command line tool to install an executable as a service. All you need to write (and only write once) is a simple service configuration file along with your executable. Run will install the service. stdout and stderr are all logged. For more info, take a look at the project website.A working configuration file is very simple, as demonstrated below. But it also has many useful features such as <env> and <persistent_env> below.these extras prove useful.. need to be executed as an administratorIf your service name has any spaces, enclose in "quotes".I\'ve tested a good product for that: AlwaysUp. Not free but they have a 30 days trial period so you can give it a try...For some reasons, I couldn\'t overwrite the path to the executable directory using NSSM.This is what I did to have the service point to the correct executable.SC CONFIG YourServiceName binPath= "C:\\SomeDirectory\\YourFile.EXE"\nFor more details
