This question already has an answer here:I want to create string using integer appended to it, in a for loop.  Like this:But it returns an error:What\'s the best way to concatenate the String and Integer?The method used in this answer (backticks) is deprecated in later versions of Python 2, and removed in Python 3. Use the str() function instead.You can use :It will print string012345678910.To get string0, string1 ..... string10 you can use this as @YOU suggestedYou can use :It will print string012345678910.To get string0, string1 ..... string10 you can use this as @YOU suggestedTo get string0, string1 ..... string10, you could do likeThe str(i) function converts the integer into a string.What you did (range[1,10]) is And string = "string" + i is a TypeError since you can\'t add an integer to a string (unlike JavaScript).Look at the documentation for Python\'s new string formatting method, it is very powerful.You can use a generator to do this ! If we want output like \'string0123456789\' then we can use map function and join method of string. If we want List of string values then use list comprehension method. Note:Use xrange() for Python 2.xUSe range() for Python 3.xI did something else.\nI wanted to replace a word, in lists off lists, that contained phrases.\nI wanted to replace that sttring / word with a new word that will be a join between string and number, and that number / digit will indicate the position of the phrase / sublist / lists of lists. That is, I replaced a string with a string and an incremental number that follow it. Concatenation of a string and integer is simmple:\njust use
