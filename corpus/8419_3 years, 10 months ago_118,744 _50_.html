I\'m making a responsive layout with a top fixed navbar.  Underneath I have two columns, one for a sidebar (3), and one for content (9).  Which on desktop looks like thisnavbar\n  [3][9]When I resize to mobile the navbar is compressed and hidden, then the sidebar is stacked on top of the content, like this:navbar\n  [3]\n  [9]I would like the main content at the top, so I need to change the order on mobile to this:navbar\n  [9]\n  [3]I found this article which covers the same points, but the accepted answer has been edited to say that the solution no applies to the current version of Bootstrap.How can I reorder these columns on mobile?  Or alternatively, how can I get the sidbar list-group into my expanding navbar?Here is my code:You cannot change the order of columns in smaller screens but you can do that in large screens.So change the order of your columns.By default this displays the main content first. So in mobile main content is displayed first. By using col-lg-push and col-lg-pull we can reorder the columns in large screens and display sidebar on the left and main content on the right.Working fiddle here.The answers here work for just 2 cells, but as soon as those columns have more in them it can lead to a bit more complexity. I think I\'ve found a generalized solution for any number of cells in multiple columns.Get a vertical sequence of tags on mobile to arrange themselves in whatever order the design calls for on tablet/desktop. In this concrete example, one tag must enter flow earlier than it normally would, and another later than it normally would.So headline needs to shuffle right on tablet+, and technically, so does desc - it sits above the caption tag that precedes it on mobile. You\'ll see in a moment 4 caption is in trouble too.Let\'s assume every cell could vary in height, and needs to be flush top-to-bottom with its next cell (ruling out weak tricks like a table).As with all Bootstrap Grid problems step 1 is to realize the HTML has to be in mobile-order, 1 2 3 4 5, on the page. Then, determine how to get tablet/desktop to reorder itself in this way - ideally without Javascript.The solution to get 1 headline and 3 qty to sit to the right not the left is to simply set them both pull-right. This applies CSS float: right, meaning they find the first open space they\'ll fit to the right. You can think of the browser\'s CSS processor working in the following order: 1 fits in to the right top corner. 2 is next and is regular (float: left), so it goes to top-left corner. Then 3, which is float: right so it leaps over underneath 1.But this solution wasn\'t enough for 4 caption; because the right 2 cells are so short 2 image on the left tends to be longer than the both of them combined. Bootstrap Grid is a glorified float hack, meaning 4 caption  is float: left. With 2 image occupying so much room on the left, 4 caption attempts to fit in the next available space - often the right column, not the left where we wanted it.The solution here (and more generally for any issue like this) was to add a hack tag, hidden on mobile, that exists on tablet+ to push caption out, that then gets covered up by a negative margin - like this:http://jsfiddle.net/b9chris/52VtD/16633/HTML:CSS:So, the generalized solution here is to add hack tags that can disappear on mobile. On tablet+ the hack tags allow displayed tags to appear earlier or later in the flow, then get pulled up or down to cover up those hack tags.Note: I\'ve used fixed heights for the sake of the simple example in the linked jsfiddle, but the actual site content I was working on varies in height in all 5 tags. It renders properly with relatively large variance in tag heights, especially image and desc.Note 2: Depending on your layout, you may have a consistent enough column order on tablet+ (or larger resolutions), that you can avoid use of hack tags, using margin-bottom instead, like so:Note 3: This uses Bootstrap 3. Bootstrap 4 uses a different grid set, and won\'t work with these examples.http://jsfiddle.net/b9chris/52VtD/16632/Update 2017For the original question based on Bootstrap 3, the solution was to use push-pull for the larger widths, and then the columns will show is their natural order on smaller (xs) widths.Bootstrap 3: http://www.codeply.com/go/wgzJXs3gel@emre stated, "You cannot change the order of columns in smaller screens but you can do that in large screens".However, this should be clarified to state: "You cannot change the order of full-width "stacked" columns.." in Bootstrap 3.However, in Bootstrap 4 (alpha 6) it\'s now possible to change the order, even when the columns are full-width stacked vertically, thanks to Bootstrap 4 flexbox. OFC, the push pull method will still work, but now there are other ways to change column order in Bootstrap 4, making it possible to re-order full-width columns.Method 1 - Use flex-column-reverse for xs screens:Method 2 - Use flex-first for xs screens:Bootstrap 3: http://www.codeply.com/go/bBMOsvtJhDStarting with the mobile version first, you can achieve what you want, most of the time.
