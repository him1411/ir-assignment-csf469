I would like to use Class.newInstance() but the class I am instantiating does not have a nullary constructor. Therefore I need to be able to pass in constructor arguments. Is there a way to do this?Edit: according to the comments seems like pointing class and method names is not enough for some users. For more info take a look at the documentation for getting constuctor and invoking it.Assuming you have the following constructorYou will need to show you intend to use this constructor like so:Do not use Class.newInstance(); see this thread: Why is Class.newInstance() evil?Like other answers say, use Constructor.newInstance() instead.You can get other constructors with getConstructor(...).Follow below steps to call parameterized consturctor.Example code:output:You can use the getDeclaredConstructor method of Class. It expects an array of classes. Here is a tested and working example:I think this is exactly what you want \nhttp://da2i.univ-lille1.fr/doc/tutorial-java/reflect/object/arg.htmlAlthough it seems a dead thread, someone might find it useful
