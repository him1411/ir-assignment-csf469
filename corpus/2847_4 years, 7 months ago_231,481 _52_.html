I just got started with Markdown. I love it, but there is one thing bugging me: how can I change the size of an image using Markdown?The documentation only gives the following suggestion for an image: If it is possible I would like the picture to also be centered.With certain Markdown implementations (including Mou and Marked 2 (only macOS)) you can append =WIDTHxHEIGHT after the URL of the graphic file to resize the image. Do not forget the space before the =.You can skip the HEIGHTYou could just use some HTML in your Markdown:Or you could use a custom CSS file as described in this answer on Markdown and image alignmentCSS in another file:The accepted answer here isn\'t working with any Markdown editor available in the apps I have used till date like Ghost, Stackedit.io or even in the Stack Overflow editor. I found a workaround here in the StackEdit.io issue tracker. The solution is to directly use HTML syntax, and it works perfectly:I hope this helps.Just use:instead of:Maybe this has recently changed but the Kramdown docs show a simple solution.From the docsWorks on github with Jekyll and Kramdown.One might draw on the alt attribute that can be set in almost all Markdown implementations/renderes together with CSS-selectors based on attribute values. The advantage is that one can easily define a whole set of different picture sizes (and further attributes). Markdown:CSS:If you are writing MarkDown for PanDoc, you can do this:This adds style="width: 50%;" to the HTML <img> tag, or [width=0.5\\textwidth] to \\includegraphics in LaTeX.Source: http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-link_attributesIf you are using kramdown, you can do this:Then add this to your Custom CSS:Building on from Tiemes answer, if you\'re using CSS 3 you can use a substring selector:This selector will match any image with an alt tag that ends with \'-fullwidth\':Then you can still use the alt tag for its intended purpose to describe the image.The Markdown for the above could be something like:I\'ve been using this in Ghost markdown, and it has been working well.I scripted the simple tag parser for using a custom-size img tag in Jekyll.https://gist.github.com/nurinamu/4ccf7197a1bdfb0d7079You can add the file to the _plugins folder.You could use this one as well with kramdown:orThis way you can directly add arbitrary attributes to the last html element. To add classes there is a shortcut .class.secondclass.I know that this answer is a bit specific, but it might help others in need.As many photos are uploaded using the Imgur service, you can use the API detailed here to change the size of the photo.When uploading a photo in a GitHub issue comment, it will be added through Imgur, so this will help a lot if the photo is very big.Basically, instead of http://i.imgur.com/12345.jpg, you would put http://i.imgur.com/12345m.jpg for medium sized image.![pic][logo]{.classname}Reference HereI came here searching for an answer. Some awesome suggestions here. And gold information pointing out that markdown supports HTMl completely!A good clean solution is always to go with pure html syntax for sure. With the  tag.But I was trying to still stick to the markdown syntax so I tried wrapping it around a  tag and added whatever attributes i wanted for the image inside the div tag. And it WORKS!!So this way external images are supported! Just thought I would put this out there as it isn\'t in any of the answers. :)When using Flask (I am using it with flat pages)... I found that enabling explicitly (was not by default for some reason) \'attr_list\' in extensions within the call to markdown does the trick - and then one can use the attributes (very useful also to access CSS - class="my class" for example...).FLATPAGES_HTML_RENDERER = prerender_jinjaand the function:And then in Markdown:For R-Markdown, neither of the above solutions worked for me, so I turned to regular LaTeX syntax, which works just fine.Then you can use e.g. the \\begin{center} statement to center the image.
