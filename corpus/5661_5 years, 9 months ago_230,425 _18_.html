Is it possible, using jQuery, to find out the type of an element with jQuery? For example, is the element a div, span, select, or input?For example, if I am trying to load values into a drop-down list with jQuery, but the same script can generate code into a set of radio buttons, could I create something like:Given a drop-down list with a button next to it with the trigger class, my elementType variable should return select upon the button being pressed.Getting the element type the jQuery way:doing the same without jQueryChecking for specific element type:also you can use:you should use tagName property and attr(\'type\') for inputsAs Distdev alluded to, you still need to differentiate the input type. That is to say,will tell you input, but that doesn\'t differentiate between checkbox/text/radio. If it\'s an input, you can then use to tell you checkbox/text/radio, so you know what kind of control it is.use get(0).tagName. See this linkyou can use .is():see sourceUse Nodename over tagName :nodeName contains all functionalities of tagName, plus a few more. Therefore nodeName is always the better choice.see DOM CoreDoh.. be careful not to use  bold (or similar styling) tags if you want to check on a higher level element like a div - tagname will show \'B\'. I think Style tags should be deprecated .
