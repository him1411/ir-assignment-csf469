What\'s the alternative to show tables (from MySQL) in PostgreSQL?From the psql command line interface:Programmatically (or from the psql interface too, of course):The system tables live in the pg_catalog database.Login as superuser:You can list all databases and users by \\l command, (list other commands by \\?).Now if you want to see other databases you can change user/database by \\c command like \\c template1, \\c postgres postgres and use \\d, \\dt or \\dS to see tables/views/etc.(For completeness)You could also query the (SQL-standard) information schema:First login as postgres user:sudo su - postgresconnect to the required db: psql -d databaseName\\dt would return the list of all table in the database you\'re connected to.Running psql with the -E flag will echo the query used internally to implement\n\\dt and similar:If you only want to see the list of tables you\'ve created, you may only say:\\dtBut we also have PATTERN which will help you customize which tables to show. To show all including pg_catalog Schema, you can add *.\\dt *If you do: \\?\\dt[S+] [PATTERN]      list tablesFirst Connect with the Database using following command And you will see this message You are now connected to database database_name and them run the following command In database_name and table_name just update with your database and table name\\dt (no * required) -- will list all tables for an existing database you are already connected to. Also useful to note:\\d [table_name] -- will show all columns for a given table including type information, references and key constraints.use only see a tables \n=> \\dtif want to see schema tables\n=>\\dt+if you want to see specific schema tables\n=>\\dt schema_name.* You can list the tables in the current database with \\dt.Fwiw, \\d tablename will show details about the given table, something like show columns from tablename in MySQL, but with a little more information.If you are using pgAdmin4 in PostgreSQL, you can use this to show the tables in your database:\\dt will list tables, and "\\pset pager off" shows them in the same window, without switching to a separate one. Love that feature to death in dbshell.First of all you have to connect with your database likemy database is ubuntuuse this command to connectThis message will show "You are now connected to database "ubuntu" as user "postgres"."NowRun this command to show all tables in it First you can connect with your postgres database using the postgre.app on mac or using postico.\nRun the following command: then you enter your password, this should give access to your database
