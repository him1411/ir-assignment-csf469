Is there a way to force maven(2.0.9) to include all the dependencies in a single jar file?I have a project the builds into a single jar file. I want the classes from dependencies to be copied into the jar as well.Update: I know that I cant just include a jar file in a jar file. I\'m searching for a way to unpack the jars that are specified as dependencies, and package the class files into my jar.You can do this using the maven-assembly plugin with the "jar-with-dependencies" descriptor. Here\'s the relevant chunk from one of our pom.xml\'s that does this:With Maven 2, the right way to do this is to use the Maven2 Assembly Plugin which has a pre-defined descriptor file for this purpose and that you could just use on the command line:If you want to make this jar executable, just add the main class to be run to the plugin configuration:If you want to create that assembly as part of the normal build process, you should bind the single or directory-single goal (the assembly goal should ONLY be run from the command line) to a lifecycle phase (package makes sense), something like this:Adapt the configuration element to suit your needs (for example with the manifest stuff as spoken).There\'s the shade maven plugin. It can be used to package and rename dependencies (to omit dependency problems on the classpath).If you (like me) dont particularly like the jar-with-dependencies approach described above,\nthe maven-solution I prefer is to simply build a WAR-project,\neven if it is only a stand-alone java application you are building:Make a normal maven jar-project, that will build your jar-file (without the dependencies).Also, setup a maven war-project (with only an empty src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml file, which will avoid a warning/error in the maven-build), that only has your jar-project as a dependency, and make your jar-project a <module> under your war-project. (This war-project is only a simple trick to wrap all your jar-file dependencies into a zip-file.)Build the war-project to produce the war-file.In the deployment-step, simply rename your .war-file to *.zip and unzip it.You should now have a lib-directory (which you can move where you want it) with your jar and all the dependencies you need to run your application:(The wildcard in classpath works in Java-6 or higher)I think this is both simpler to setup in maven (no need  to mess around with the assembly plugin) and also gives you a clearer view of the application-structure (you will see the version-numbers of all dependent jars in plain view, and avoid clogging everything into a single jar-file).You can use the newly created jar using a <classifier> tag.http://fiji.sc/Uber-JAR provides an excellent explanation of the alternatives: There are three common methods for constructing an uber-JAR:If you want to do an executable jar file, them need set the main class too. So the full configuration should be.My definitive solution on Eclipse Luna and m2eclipse:\nCustom Classloader (download and add to your project, 5 classes only)\n:http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/plain/org.eclipse.jdt.ui/jar%20in%20jar%20loader/org/eclipse/jdt/internal/jarinjarloader/;\nthis classloader is very best of one-jar classloader and very fast;<project.mainClass>org.eclipse.jdt.internal.jarinjarloader.JarRsrcLoader</project.mainClass>\n<project.realMainClass>my.Class</project.realMainClass>Edit in JIJConstants "Rsrc-Class-Path" to "Class-Path"\n    mvn clean dependency:copy-dependencies package \nis created a jar with dependencies in lib folder with a thin classloader Putting Maven aside, you can put JAR libraries inside the Main Jar but you will need to use your own classloader.Check this project: One-JAR link textThis post may be a bit old, but I also had the same problem recently. The first solution proposed by John Stauffer is a good one, but I had some problems as I am working this spring. The spring\'s dependency-jars I use have some property files and xml-schemas declaration which share the same paths and names. Although these jars come from the same versions, the jar-with-dependencies maven-goal was overwriting theses file with the last file found. In the end, the application was not able to start as the spring jars could not find the correct properties files. In this case the solution propose by Rop have solved my problem.Also since then, the spring-boot project now exist. It has a very cool way to manage this problem by providing a maven goal which overload the package goal and provide its own class loader. See spring-boots Reference GuideHave a look at this answer:I am creating an installer that runs as a Java JAR file and it needs to unpack WAR and JAR files into appropriate places in the installation directory. The dependency plugin can be used in the package phase with the copy goal and it will download any file in the Maven repository (including WAR files) and write them where ever you need them. I changed the output directory to ${project.build.directory}/classes and then end result is that the normal JAR task includes my files just fine. I can then extract them and write them into the installation directory.Thanks\nI have added below snippet in POM.xml file and Mp problem resolved and \ncreate fat jar file that include all dependent jars.
