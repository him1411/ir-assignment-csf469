Because of the Twitter API 1.0 retirement as of June 11th 2013, the script below does not work anymore.How can I get the user_timeline (recent statuses) with the least code possible?I found this: https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/get/statuses/user_timeline\nbut I get the following error:There are a lot of classes out there but after trying several none of them seem to work because of these updates at Twitter, plus some of them are pretty advanced classes with a lot of functionality that I don\'t really need. What is the simplest/shortest way to get the recent user statuses with PHP?Note: the files for these are on GitHub.Version 1.0 will soon be deprecated and unauthorised requests won\'t be allowed. So, here\'s a post to help you do just that, along with a PHP class to make your life easier.1. Create a developer account: Set yourself up a developer account on TwitterYou need to visit the official Twitter developer site and register for a developer account.\nThis is a free and necessary step to make requests for the v1.1 API.2. Create an application: Create an application on the Twitter developer siteWhat? You thought you could make unauthenticated requests? Not with Twitter\'s v1.1 API.\nYou need to visit http://dev.twitter.com/apps and click the "Create Application" button.On this page, fill in whatever details you want. For me, it didn\'t matter, because I just wanted to make a load of block requests to get rid of spam followers. The point is you are going to get yourself a set of unique keys to use for your application.So, the point of creating an application is to give yourself (and Twitter) a set of keys. These are:There\'s a little bit of information here on what these tokens for.3. Create access tokens: You\'ll need these to make successful requestsOAuth requests a few tokens. So you need to have them generated for you.Click "create my access token" at the bottom. Then once you scroll to the bottom again, you\'ll have some newly generated keys. You need to grab the four previously labelled keys from this page for your API calls, so make a note of them somewhere.4. Change access level: You don\'t want read-only, do you?If you want to make any decent use of this API, you\'ll need to change your settings to Read & Write if you\'re doing anything other than standard data retrieval using GET requests.Choose the "Settings" tab near the top of the page.Give your application read / write access, and hit "Update" at the bottom.You can read more about the applications permission model that Twitter uses here.5. Write code to access the API: I\'ve done most of it for youI combined the code above, with some modifications and changes, into a PHP class so it\'s really simple to make the requests you require.This uses OAuth and the Twitter v1.1 API, and the class I\'ve created which you can find below.Make sure you put the keys you got from your application above in their respective spaces.Next you need to choose a URL you want to make a request to. Twitter has their API documentation to help you choose which URL and also the request type (POST or GET).In the documentation, each URL states what you can pass to it. If we\'re using the "blocks" URL like the one above, I can pass the following POST parameters:Now that you\'ve set up what you want to do with the API, it\'s time to make the actual request.And for a POST request, that\'s it!For a GET request, it\'s a little different. Here\'s an example:Final code example: For a simple GET request for a list of my followers.I\'ve put these files on GitHub with credit to @lackovic10 and @rivers! I hope someone finds it useful; I know I did (I used it for bulk blocking in a loop).Also, for those on Windows who are having problems with SSL certificates, look at this post. This library uses cURL under the hood so you need to make sure you have your cURL certs set up probably. Google is also your friend.Go to dev.twitter.com and create an application. This will provide you with the credentials you need. Here is an implementation I\'ve recently written with PHP and cURL.This can be run from the command line:The code pasted by Rivers is great. Thanks a lot! I\'m new here and can\'t comment, I\'d just want to answer to the question from javiervd (How would you set the screen_name and count with this approach?), as I\'ve lost a lot of time to figure it out.You need to add the parameters both to the URL and to the signature creating process.\nCreating a signature is the article that helped me. Here is my code:Like stated in other answers, create a Twitter app to get the token, key and secret.\nUsing the code bellow, you can modify request parameters from one spot and avoid typos and similar errors (change $request array in returnTweet() function).and then just call returnTweet()Thank you Kris!It worked for me without using parameters to the query, whenever I used more than one parameter it showed me the error: 32 Could not authenticate you.The problem for me, was in the ampersand encoding. So in your code where it\'s the following lineI added the following line below:And it worked using two or more parameters like screen_name and count.The whole code looks like this:Hope It helps somebody with the same problem I had.This question helped me a lot but didn\'t get me all the way in understanding what needs to happen. This blog post did an amazing job of walking me through it.Here are the important bits all in one place:I sympathize with all the headaches, so here\'s some code to wrap it all up:If you have the OAuth PHP library installed, you don\'t have to worry about forming the request yourself.For more information, check out The docs or their example. You can use pecl install oauth to get the library.First of all I wanted to thank jimbo and (his post / twitter-api-php simple library).If you are going to use the GET search/tweets API with "twitter-api-php" PHP library (TwitterAPIExchange.php):First, you have to just comment "Perform a POST request and echo the response " code area.Just use "Perform a GET request and echo the response" code and echo the response and change these two lines:to(Change screen_name to q, that\'s it :)You\'ll need a to create an "app" on Twitter (and you need a Twitter account to do this).Then, you need to use OAuth to make an authorized request to Twitter.You can use the GET statuses/user_timeline resource to get a list of recent tweets.Here\'s a brief one for getting a specified number of tweets from your timeline. It basically does the same thing as the other examples, only with less code.Just fill in the keys and adjust $count to your liking:This one uses anonymous functions and file_get_contents instead of the cURL library. Note the use of an MD5 hashed nonce. Everyone seems to be going along with the time() nonce, however, most examples on the web concerning OAuth use some kind of encrypted string (like this one: http://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-oauth-1/). This makes more sense to me too.Further note: you need PHP 5.3+ for the anonymous functions (in case your server/computer is in some cold war cave and you can\'t upgrade it).From their signature generator, you can generate curl commands of the  form:Thanks to this thread, and especially budidino because his code is what drove it home for me.\nJust wanted to contribute how to retrieve the JSON data from a request.\nMake changes to "//create request" request array part of the code to perform different requests. Ultimately, this will output the JSON onto the browser screenIf it is useful for anyone...\nIn my blog I\'ve implement the following PHP code in order to retrieve the last tweets, extract their most relevant data  and then saved them into a MySQL database.\nIt works because I got it in my blog.The "tweets" table where store them:get_tweets.php:The function to save the tweets:
