I got an error on Xcode saying that there was no information about the view controller.Could not insert new outlet connection: Could not find any information for the class namedWhy is this happening?Here are some things that can fix this (in increasing order of difficulty):Or if none of the above works, type out the name of the outlet into the file first @IBOutlet weak var headerHeightConstraint: NSLayoutConstraint! and then click and drag from the outlet in the nib to the variable you just programmatically created. It should work without any of the hassle of cleaning, building, and deleting anything.Just perform the two following steps to get rid of this errorNow try to add the action or outlet.\nThat\'s it. Happy CodingThis is a BUG in XCode, and I don\'t know why they don\'t fix it. You have to close XCode and re open. When you do try again to put the outlets, but this time leave a bunch of ENTERS before making it. You don\'t have to delete anything or waste your time on other options...This will solve your problems. Here are the steps solved for me:Done !I had the same issue. I tired below solutions but didn\xe2\x80\x99t worked :Below workaround to this issue :I solved this problem by programmatically creating the Labels and Textfields, and then Command-Dragged from the little empty circles on the left of the code to the components on the Storyboard. To illustrate my point: I wrote @IBOutlet weak var HelloLabel: UILabel!, and then pressed Command and dragged the code into the component on the storyboard. I simply quitted Xcode, then re-open it. the compiler will re-load all files and it can detect the file you are looking for In my case this was bc I chose a new UIViewController file in IB and then tried to ctrl-drag to this new controller without first removing the previous connections in the Connections Inspector. Remove those first and try again.For me it worked  when on the right tab > Localization, I checked English check box. Initially only Base was checked. After that I had no more problems. Hope this helps!Check you don\'t already have an unconnected outlet in your view controller file. I discovered that I did. After I deleted it I had no issues.For me none of above solutions worked.I had to delete view controller, which i copied and pasted again in my storyboard to reuse that.Then I dragged a new view controller in storyboard and every thing got fine :). I hope it might help someone with same problem.no need to delete anything. Just add the outlet manually\n@IBoutlet weak var imageName: UIImageView!\nand connect it to image by dragging this outlet to image. so rest of the items can be connected simplyI got this bug when I renamed the class. Then I solved it just by following the below stepsSimplest solution:- I used xCode 7 and iOS 9.in your .mdelete #import "VC.h"save .m and link your outlet again it work fine.I used xCode 7 and iOS 9.in your .mdelete #import "VC.h"save .m and link your outlet again it work fine.in your .madd #import "VC.h"save .mI was having the same exact issue. Make sure cells have reuse identifier. Table Views using Dynamic Prototypes require cells to have reuse identifier. Hope this solves your problem like it did mine:)Just restarted XCode and no longer getting the error.. For me it happened when I renamed the class best way to resolve this try to create a new "tableviewcell" class of type UITableViewCell and assign class of tableview cell to this tableviewcell and then clean your project ,after doing this you will not going to get this error.What worked for me was to delete a reference to an outlet from storyboard to .swift file. Then clean and reattach the outlet and it worked...No idea why it worked.None of this worked for me but I did figure this out.Inside the storyboard I copied the corresponding ViewController into the clipboard and deleted it, afterwards I pasted it again.Suddenly everything was working like a charm again!
