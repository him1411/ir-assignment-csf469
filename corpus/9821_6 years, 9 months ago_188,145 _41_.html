I already have an ssh agent set up, and I can run commands on an external server in Bash script doing stuff like:Now, what I\'d really like to do is run a lot of long commands on an external server. Enclosing all of these in between quotation marks would be quite ugly, and I\'d really rather avoid ssh\'ing multiple times just to avoid this. So, is there a way I can do this in one go enclosed in parentheses or something? I\'m looking for something along the lines of:Basically, I\'ll be happy with any solution as long as it\'s clean.To clarify, I\'m talking about this being part of a larger bash script. Other people might need to deal with the script down the line, so I\'d like to keep it clean. I don\'t want to have a bash script with one line that looks like:because it is extremely ugly and difficult to read.How about a Bash Here Document:To avoid the problems mentioned by @Globalz in the comments, you may be able to (depending what you\'re doing on the remote site) get away with replacing the first line withEdit your script locally, then pipe it into ssh, e.g.where commands-to-execute-remotely.sh looks like your list above:I see two ways:First you make a control socket like this:and run your commandsThis way you can write an ssh command without actually reconnecting to the server.The second would be to dynamically generate the script, scping it and running.To match your sample code, you can wrap your commands inside single or double qoutes. For exampleThis can also be done as follows.\nPut your commands in a script, let\'s name it commands-inc.shSave the fileNow run it on the remote server.Never failed for me.SSH and Run Multiple Commands in Bash.Separate commands with semicolons within a string, passed to echo, all piped into the ssh command.  For example:Put all the commands on to a script and it can be run likeA thought:Wrap your long commands in a bash script, scp it to the destination server, execute it with ssh and have a "delete-self" command at the end of the script.This works well for creating scripts, as you do not have to include other files:The easiest way to configure your system to use single ssh sessions by default with multiplexing.This can be done by creating a folder for the sockets:And then adding the following to your .ssh configuration:Now, you do not need to modify any of your code. This allows multiple calls to ssh and scp without creating multiple sessions, which is useful when there needs to be more interaction between your local and remote machines.Thanks to @terminus\'s answer, http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-osx-bsd-ssh-multiplexing-to-speed-up-ssh-connections/ and https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSSH/Cookbook/Multiplexing.For anyone stumbling over here like me - I had success with escaping the semicolon and the newline:First step: the semicolon. This way, we do not break the ssh command:Listed the remote hosts /home directory (logged in as root), whereaslisted the current working directory.Next step: breaking up the line:This again listed the remote working directory - improved formatting:If really nicer than here document or quotes around broken lines - well, not me to decide...(Using bash, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.)The posted answers using multiline strings and multiple bash scripts did not work for me.Here is a functional way to ssh and run multiple commands while keeping local context.
