How do I list the user-installed package ONLY in npm? When I do npm -g list it outputs every package and their dependencies, which is not what I want.This works pretty well too: npm list -g --depth=0You can get a list of all globally installed modules using:ls `npm root -g`\nAs of 13 December 2015Whilst I found the accepted answer 100% correct, and useful, wished to expand upon it a little based on my own experiences, and hopefully for the benefit of others too. (Here I am using the terms package and module interchangeably)In answer to the question, yes the accepted answer would be:You might wish to check for a particular module installed globally, on *nix systems / when grep available. This is particularly useful when checking what version of a module you are using (globally installed, just remove the -g flag if checking a local module):If you\'d like to see all available (remote) versions for a particular module, then do:Note, versions is plural. This will give you the full listing of versions to choose from.For latest remote version:Note, version is singular.To find out which packages need to be updated, you can use To update global packages, you can useTo update all global packages, you can use:(However, for npm versions less than 2.6.1, please also see this link as there is a special script that is recommended for globally updating all packages).The above commands should work across NPM versions 1.3.x, 1.4.x, 2.x and 3.xFor project dependencies use:For global dependencies use:For local modules:For global modules:npm list is just an alias for npm lsFor the extended info useYou can always set --depth=0 at the end to get the first level deep.You can check development and production packages.To show the info in json formatThe default is falseYou can insist on long format to show extended information.You can show parseable output instead of tree view.You can list packages in the global install prefix instead of in the current project.Full documentation you can find here. One way might be to find the root directory of modules using:And then list that directory...The user-installed packages in this case are grunt and grunt-contrib-jshintNode has a concept of Local modules & Global modulesLocal modules are located within current project directory.Global Modules are generally located at  user\'s home directory, though we can change the path where global modules resides.To see list of all packages that are installed.show parseable of npm packages list https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/ls#parseableNode_modules contains user-installed packages so change the directory to node_modules and list the items. Core Modules are defined in node\'s source in the lib/ folder.Example: I use npm -g outdated --depth=0 to list outdated versions\nin the global space.I prefer tools with some friendly gui! I used npm-gui which gives you list of local and global packagesThe package is at https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-gui and https://github.com/q-nick/npm-guiAt your browser http:\\\\localhost:9000
