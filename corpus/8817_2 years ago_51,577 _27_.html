What is the difference between @Component and @Directive in Angular?\nBoth of them seem to do the same task and have the same attributes.What are the use cases and when to prefer one over another?A @Component requires a view whereas a @Directive does not.I liken a @Directive to an Angular 1.0 directive with the option restrict: \'A\' (Directives aren\'t limited to attribute usage.) Directives add behaviour to an existing DOM element or an existing component instance. One example use case for a directive would be to log a click on an element.Which would be used like so:A component, rather than adding/modifying behaviour, actually creates its own view (hierarchy of DOM elements) with attached behaviour. An example use case for this might be a contact card component:Which would be used like so:ContactCard is a reusable UI component that we could use anywhere in our application, even within other components. These basically make up the UI building blocks of our applications.Write a component when you want to create a reusable set of DOM elements of UI with custom behaviour. Write a directive when you want to write reusable behaviour to supplement existing DOM elements.
