What are differences in the assignment operators \'=\' and \'<-\' in R? I know that operators are slightly different as this example showsBut is this the only difference? The difference in assignment operators is clearer when you use them to set an argument value in a function call.  For example:In this case, x is declared within the scope of the function, so it does not exist in the user workspace.In this case, x is declared in the user workspace, so you can use it after the function call has been completed.There is a general preference among the R community for using \' <- \' for assignment (other than in function signatures)  for compatibility with (very) old versions of S-Plus.  Note that the spaces help to clarify situations likeMost R IDEs have keyboard shortcuts to make \' <- \' easier to type.  Ctrl + = in Architect, Alt + - in RStudio, Shift + - (underscore) in emacs+ESS.If you prefer writing = to <- but want to use the more common assignment symbol for publicly released code (on CRAN, for example), then you can use one of the tidy_* functions in the formatR package to automatically replace = with <-.The answer to the question "Why does x <- y = 5 throw an error but not x <- y <- 5?" is "It\'s down to the magic contained in the parser".  R\'s syntax contains many ambiguous cases that have to be resolved one way or another.  The parser chooses to resolve the bits of the expression in different orders depending on whether = or <- was used.To understand what is happening, you need to know that assignment silently returns the value that was assigned.  You can see that more clearly by explicitly printing, for example print(x <- 2 + 3).Secondly, it\'s clearer if we use prefix notation for assignment.  So The parser interprets x <- y <- 5 as We might expect that x <- y = 5 would then bebut actually it gets interpreted asI\'m not sure why this happens, since = is higher precedence than <-.  Maybe a bug in the parser, but good luck trying to get that changed now.The documentation is wrong. = is actually lower precedence than <-, which is why the order is unexpectedly different.The ?Syntax help page now correctly shows that = is lower precedence than <-.Google\'s R style guide simplifies the issue by prohibiting the "=" for assignment. Not a bad choice.https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xmlThe R manual goes into nice detail on all 5 assignment operators.http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/base/html/assignOps.htmlAccording to John Chambers, the operator = is only allowed at "the top level," which means it is not allowed in control structures like if, making the following programming error illegal.As he writes, "Disallowing the new assignment form [=] in control expressions avoids programming errors (such as the example above) that are more likely with the equal operator than with other S assignments."You can manage to do this if it\'s "isolated from surrounding logical structure, by braces or an extra pair of parentheses," so if ((x = 0)) 1 else x would work.See http://developer.r-project.org/equalAssign.htmlx = y = 5 is equivalent to x = (y = 5), because the assignment operators "group" right to left, which works. Meaning: assign 5 to y, leaving the number 5; and then assign that 5 to x.This is not the same as (x = y) = 5, which doesn\'t work!Meaning: assign the value of y to x, leaving the value of y; and then assign 5 to, umm, what exactly?When you mix the different kinds of assignment operator, <- binds tighter than =So x = y <- 5 is interpreted as x = (y <- 5), which is the case that makes sense.Unfortunately, x <- y = 5 is interpreted as (x <- y) = 5, which is the case that doesn\'t work!See ?Syntax and ?assignOps for the precedence (binding) and grouping rules.The operators <- and = assign into the environment in which they are evaluated. The operator <- can be used anywhere, whereas the operator = is only allowed at the top level (e.g., in the complete expression typed at the command prompt) or as one of the subexpressions in a braced list of expressions. This may also add to understanding of the difference between those two operators:For the first element R has assigned values and proper name, while the name of the second element looks a bit strange.R version 3.3.2 (2016-10-31); macOS Sierra 10.12.1
