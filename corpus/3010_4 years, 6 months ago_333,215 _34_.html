I have a data array which contains many objects (JSON format). The following can be assumed as  the contents of this array:Now, I display these details as:Here, query is modeled to an input field in which the user can restrict the data displayed.Now, I have another location in which I display the current count of people / person being display, i.e Showing {{data.length}} Persons What I want to do is that when the user searches for a person and the data displayed is filtered based on the query, the Showing...persons also change the value of people being shown currently. But it is not happening. It always displays the total persons in data rather than the filtered one - how do I get the count of filtered data?For Angular 1.3+ (credits to @Tom)Use an alias expression (Docs: Angular 1.3.0: ngRepeat, scroll down to the Arguments section):For Angular prior to 1.3Assign the results to a new variable (e.g. filtered) and access it:Display the number of results:Fiddle a similar example. Credits go to Pawel KozlowskiFor completeness, in addition to previous answers (perform calculation of visible people inside controller) you can also perform that calculations in your HTML template as in the example below.Assuming your list of people is in data variable and you filter people using query model, the following code will work for you:\nNote that this solution works fine if you want to use filtered data only once in a page. However, if you use filtered data more than once e.g. to present items and to show length of filtered list, I would suggest using alias expression (described below) for AngularJS 1.3+ or the solution proposed by @Wumms for AngularJS version prior to 1.3.New Feature in Angular 1.3AngularJS creators also noticed that problem and in version 1.3 (beta 17) they added "alias" expression which will store the intermediate results of the repeater after the filters have been applied e.g. The alias expression will prevent multiple filter execution issue.I hope that will help.ngRepeat creates a copy of the array when it applies a filter, so you can\'t use the source array to reference only the filtered elements.In your case, in may be better to apply the filter inside of your controller using the $filter service:And then you use the filteredData property in your view instead. Here is a working Plunker: http://plnkr.co/edit/7c1l24rPkuKPOS5o2qtx?p=previewSince AngularJS 1.3 you can use aliases:  and somewhere:From docs: You can also provide an\n  optional alias expression which will then store the intermediate\n  results of the repeater after the filters have been applied. Typically\n  this is used to render a special message when a filter is active on\n  the repeater, but the filtered result set is empty.For example: item in items | filter:x as results will store the\n  fragment of the repeated items as results, but only after the items\n  have been processed through the filter.It is also useful to note that you can store multiple levels of results by grouping filtershere\'s a demo fiddle The easiest way if you haveFiltered data length Here is worked example See on PlunkerYou can do it with 2 ways. In template and in Controller. In template you can set your filtered array to another variable, then use it like you want. Here is how to do it:If you need examples, see the AngularJs filtered count examples/demos
