I have a UITableView with 5 UITableViewCells. Each cell contains a UIButton which is set up as follows:My question is this: in the buttonPressedAction: method, how do I know which button has been pressed. I\'ve considered using tags but I\'m not sure this is the best route. I\'d like to be able to somehow tag the indexPath onto the control.What\'s the standard way of doing this?Edit:I\'ve kinda solved it by doing the following. I would still like to have an opinion whether this is the standard way of doing it or is there a better way?What\'s important to note is that I can\'t set the tag in the creation of the cell since the cell might be dequeued instead. It feels very dirty. There must be a better way.In Apple\'s Accessory sample the following method is used:Then in touch handler touch coordinate retrieved and index path is calculated from that coordinate: I found the method of using the superview\'s superview to obtain a reference to the cell\'s indexPath worked perfectly. Thanks to iphonedevbook.com (macnsmith) for the tip link textHere\'s how I do it.  Simple and concise:Found a nice solution to this problem elsewhere, no messing around with tags on the button:How about sending the information like NSIndexPath in the UIButton using runtime injection.1) You need runtime on the import2) add static constant3) add NSIndexPath to your button on runtime using:(void)setMetaData:(id)target withObject:(id)newObj4) on button press get metadata using:(id)metaData:(id)targetEnjoyTo do (@Vladimir)\'s answer is Swift:Although checking for indexPath != nil gives me the finger..."NSIndexPath is not a subtype of NSString"I would use the tag property like you said, setting the tag like so:then getting the tag inside of the buttonPressedAction like so:OrThough I like the tag way... if you don\'t want to use tags for whatever reason,\nyou could create a member NSArray of premade buttons:then create those buttons before rendering the tableView and push them into the array.Then inside of the tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath: function you can do:Then in the buttonPressedAction: function, you can doTO HANDLE SECTIONS - I stored the NSIndexPath in a custom UITableViewCellIN CLKIndexPricesHEADERTableViewCell.xibIN IB Add UIButton to XIB - DONT add action!Add outlet @property (retain, nonatomic) IBOutlet UIButton *buttonIndexSectionClose;DO NOT CTRL+DRAG an action in IB(done in code below)In viewForHeaderInSection (should also work for cellForRow.... etc if you table has only 1 section)...use the section to get data for your cell...fill it in USER presses DELETE Button on a Section header and this callsIn this example I added a Delete button so should show UIAlertView to confirm itI store the section and key into the dictionary storing info about the section in a ivar in the VCIt works for me aswell, Thanks @CocoanutI found the method of using the superview\'s superview to obtain a reference to the cell\'s indexPath worked perfectly. Thanks to iphonedevbook.com (macnsmith) for the tip link textyou can use the tag pattern:Am I missing something?  Can\'t you just use sender to identify the button.  Sender will give you info like this:Then if you want to change the properties of the button, say the background image you just tell sender:If you need the tag then ACBurk\'s method is fine.Pretty straightforward actually:Working well for me :Pif you want to adjust your target-action setup, you can include the event parameter in the method, and then use the touches of that event to resolve the coordinates of the touch. The coordinates still need to be resolved in the touch view bounds, but that may seem easier for some people.create an nsmutable array and put all button in that array usint[array addObject:yourButton];in the button press method -A slight variation on Cocoanuts answer (that helped me solve this) when the button was in the footer of a table (which prevents you from finding the \'clicked cell\':I always use tags.You need to subclass the UITableviewCell and handle the button press from there.It\'s simple; make a custom cell and take a outlet of buttonchange id in above method to (UIButton *)You can get the value that which button is being tapped by doing sender.tag.Subclass the button to store the required value, maybe create a protocol (ControlWithData or something). Set the value when you add the button to the table view cell. In your touch up event, see if the sender obeys the protocol and extract the data. I normally store a reference to the actual object that is rendered on the table view cell.SWIFT 2 UPDATEHere\'s how to find out which button was tapped + send data to another ViewController from that button\'s indexPath.row as I\'m assuming that\'s the point for most!  For those who are using a ViewController class and added a tableView, I\'m using a ViewController instead of a TableViewController so I manually added the tableView in order to access it.Here is the code for passing data to another VC when tapping that button and passing the cell\'s indexPath.row Note here i am using custom cell this code is perfectly working for meChris Schwerdt\'s solution but then in Swift worked for me: This problem has two parts:1) Getting the index path of UITableViewCell which contains pressed UIButtonThere are some suggestions like:Updating UIButton\'s tag in cellForRowAtIndexPath: method using index path\'s row value. This is not an good solution as it requires updating tag continuously and it does not work with table views with more than one section. Adding an NSIndexPath property to custom cell and updating it instead of UIButton\'s tag in cellForRowAtIndexPath: method. This solves multiple section problem but still not good as it requires updating always.Keeping a weak refence to parent UITableView in the custom cell while creating it and using indexPathForCell: method to get the index path. Seems a little bit better, no need to update anything in cellForRowAtIndexPath: method, but still requires setting a weak reference when the custom cell is created.Using cell\'s superView property to get a reference to parent UITableView. No need to add any properties to the custom cell, and no need to set/update anything on creation/later. But cell\'s superView depends on iOS implementation details. So it can not be used directly.But this can be achieved using a simple loop, as we are sure the cell in question has to be in a UITableView:So, these suggestions can be combined into a simple and safe custom cell method for getting the index path:From now on, this method can be used to detect which UIButton is pressed.2) Informing other parties about button press eventAfter internally knowing which UIButton is pressed in which custom cell with exact index path, this information needs to be sent to other parties (most probably the view controller handling the UITableView). So, this button click event can be handled in a similar abstraction and logic level to didSelectRowAtIndexPath: method of UITableView delegate.Two approaches can be used for this: a) Delegation: custom cell can have a delegate property and can define a protocol. When button is pressed it just performs it\'s delegate methods on it\'s delegate property. But this delegate property needs to be set for each custom cell when they are created. As an alternative, custom cell can choose to perform its delegate methods on it\'s parent table view\'s delegate too.b) Notification Center: custom cells can define a custom notification name and post this notification with the index path and parent table view information provided in userInfo object. No need to set anything for each cell, just adding an observer for the custom cell\'s notification is enough.I use a solution that subclass UIButton and I thought I should just share it here, codes in Swift:Then remember to update it\'s indexPath in cellForRow(at:)So when responding to the button\'s event you can use it like
