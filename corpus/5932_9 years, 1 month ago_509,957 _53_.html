I\'ve created a script that runs every night on my Linux server that uses mysqldump to back up each of my MySQL databases to .sql files and packages them together as a compressed .tar file.  The next step I want to accomplish is to send that tar file through email to a remote email server for safekeeping.  I\'ve been able to send the raw script in the body an email by piping the backup text file to mailx like so:cat echoes the backup file\'s text which is piped into the mailx program with the recipient\'s email address passed as an argument.While this accomplishes what I need, I think it could be one step better, Is there any way, using shell scripts or otherwise, to send the compressed .tar file to an outgoing email message as an attachment?  This would beat having to deal with very long email messages which contain header data and often have word-wrapping issues etc.None of the mutt ones worked for me.  It was thinking the email address was part of the attachemnt. Had to do:Or, failing mutt:From looking at man mailx, the mailx program does not have an option for attaching a file. You could use another program such as mutt.Command line options for mutt can be shown with mutt -h.Depending on your version of linux it may be called mail.  To quote @David above:or also:I use mpack.Unfortunately mpack does not recognize \'-\' as an alias for stdin. But the following work, and can easily be wrapped in an (shell) alias or a script:I use SendEmail, which was created for this scenario. It\'s packaged for Ubuntu so I assume it\'s available sendemail -f sender@some.where -t receiver@some.place -m "Here are your files!" -a file1.jpg file2.ziphttp://caspian.dotconf.net/menu/Software/SendEmail/You can use mutt to send the email with attachmentBelow is the same command as above, without the newlinesMake sure you have a file /home/el/attachfile.txt defined with this contents:If you don\'t have uuencode read this: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/16277/how-do-i-get-uuencode-to-workMake sure you have ksh installed: yum info kshMake sure you have sendmail installed and configured.Make sure you have uuencode installed and available: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/16277/how-do-i-get-uuencode-to-workMake a new file called test.sh and put it in your home directory: /home/elPut the following code in test.sh:Change the export variables on the top of test.sh to reflect your address and filenames.Download a test pdf document and put it in /home/el called pdf-test.pdfMake a file called /home/el/email_body.htm and put this line in it:Make sure the pdf file has sufficient 755 permissions.Run the script ./test.shCheck your email inbox, the text should be in HTML format and the pdf file automatically interpreted as a binary file.  Take care not to use this function more than say 15 times in a day, even if you send the emails to yourself, spam filters in gmail can blacklist a domain spewing emails without giving you an option to let them through.  And you\'ll find this no longer works, or it only lets through the attachment, or the email doesn\'t come through at all.  If you have to do a lot of testing on this, spread them out over days or you\'ll be labelled a spammer and this function won\'t work any more.I once wrote this function for ksh on Solaris (uses Perl for base64 encoding): metamail has the tool metasendI used and this worked well for me....mailx does have a -a option now for attachments.I usually only use the mail command on RHEL. I have tried mailx and it is pretty efficient.the shortest way for me isso for your example it\'ll bethe good part is that I can recall it with Ctrl+r to send another file... If the file is text, you can send it easiest in the body as:Just to add my 2 cents, I\'d write my own PHP Script:http://php.net/manual/en/function.mail.phpThere are lots of ways to do the attachment in the examples on that page.Not a method for sending email, but you can use an online Git server (e.g. Bitbucket or a similar service) for that.This way, you can use git push commands, and all versions will be stored in a compressed and organized way.This is how I am doing with one large log file in CentOS:From source machineOn Destination machine. Save the received mail body as db.sql.gz.b64; then..If mutt is not working or not installed,try this-Another alternative - Swaks (Swiss Army Knife for SMTP).using mailx commandusing sendmail One more thing about mutt: by default it uses your address and name in "From:" field.\nIf it\'s not what you need, you can create alternative muttrc file containing a string like this:\n    set from="My mail daemon "Use this file with -F command line option.
