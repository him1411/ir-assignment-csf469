How do you change the size of figure drawn with matplotlib?figure tells you the call signature:So figure(figsize=(1,1)) creates an inch-by-inch image, which will be 80-by-80 pixels unless you also give a different dpi argument.If you\'ve already got the figure created you can quickly do this:To propagate the size change to an existing gui window add forward=TrueDeprecation note:\n  As per the official Matplotlib guide, usage of the pylab module is no longer recommended. Please consider using the matplotlib.pyplot module instead, as described by this other answer.The following seems to work:This makes the figure\'s width 5 inches, and its height 10 inches. The Figure class then uses this as the default value for one of its arguments.Please try a simple code as following:You need to set the figure size before you plot.The first link in Google for \'matplotlib figure size\' is AdjustingImageSize (Google cache of the page).Here\'s a test script from the above page. It creates test[1-3].png files of different sizes of the same image:Output:Two notes:The module comments and the actual output differ.This answer allows easily to combine all three images in one image file to see the difference in sizes.There is also this workaround in case you want to change the size without using the figure environment. So in case you are using plt.plot() for example.This is very useful when you plot inline (e.g. with IPython Notebook).Try commenting out the fig = ... lineIn case you\'re looking for a way to change the figure size in Pandas, you could do e.g.:where df is a Pandas dataframe. If you want to change the default settings, you could do the following:To increase size of your figure N times you need to insert this just before your pl.show():It also works well with ipython notebook.This works well for me:This might also help: http://matplotlib.1069221.n5.nabble.com/Resizing-figure-windows-td11424.htmlSince Matplotlib isn\'t able to use the metric system natively, if you want to specify the size of your figure in a reasonable unit of length such as centimeters, you can do the following (code from gns-ank):Then you can use:This resizes the figure immediately even after the figure has been drawn (at least using Qt4Agg/TkAgg - but not MacOSX - with matplotlib 1.4.0):This is my setting in routine analytics in matplotlibTo make the plot in 16:9 Ratio size
