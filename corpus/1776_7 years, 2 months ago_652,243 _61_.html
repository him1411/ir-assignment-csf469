Here is my JavaScript code so far:Currently it takes the second to last item in the array from the URL. However I want to do a check for the last item in the array to be "index.html" and if so, grab the third to last item instead.In the event that your server serves the same file for "index.html" and "inDEX.htML" you can also use: .toLowerCase().Though, you might want to consider doing this server-side if possible: it will be cleaner and work for people without JS.Not sure if there\'s a drawback, but this seems quite concise: orBoth will return undefined if the array is empty. Use Array.pop:Important : This returns the last element and removes it from the arrayA shorter version of what @chaiguy posted:Reading the -1 index returns undefined already.Two options are:orThe former is faster, but the latter looks nicerhttp://jsperf.com/slice-vs-length-1-arrHere\'s how to get it with no effect on the original ARRAYIf you use pop(), it will modify your arrayBut you can use this so it has no effect on the original array:I\'d rather use array.pop() than indexes.this way you always get the element previous to index.html (providing your array has isolated index.html as one item). You\'ll lose the last elements from the array, though.Getting the last item of an array can be achieved by using the slice method with negative values.You can read more about it here at the bottom.Using pop() will change your array, which is not always a good idea.The "cleanest" ES6 way (IMO) would be:This avoids mutating foo as pop would had we not used the spread operator. That said, I rather like the foo.slice(-1)[0] solution, too.jQuery solves this neatly:I generally use underscorejs, with it you can just do For me that is more semantic than loc_array.slice(-1)[0]For those not afraid to overload the Array prototype (and with enumeration masking you shouldn\'t be):If one wants to get the last element in one go, he/she may use Array#splice():Here, there is no need to store the split elements in an array, and then get to the last element. If getting last element is the only objective, this should be used.Note: This changes the original array by removing its last element. Think of splice(-1,1) as a pop() function that pops the last element.Personally I would upvote answer by kuporific / kritzikratzi. The array[array.length-1] method gets very ugly if you\'re working with nested arrays.This is the best options from performance point of view (~1000 times faster than arr.slice(-1)).I think the easiest and super inefficient way is:You could add a new property getter to the prototype of Array so that it is accessible through all instances of Array.Getters allow you to access the return value of a function just as if it were the value of a property. The return value of the function of course is the last value of the array (this[this.length - 1]).Finally you wrap it in a condition that checks whether the last-property is still undefined (not defined by another script that might rely on it).Does not work in IE \xe2\x89\xa4 8.to add a last() function to an array.I\'ll suggest to create helper function and reuse it every time, you\'ll need it. Lets make function more general to be able to get not only last item, but also second from the last and so on.Usage is simpleNow, lets solve the original issueGrab second to last item form array. If the last item in the loc_array is "index.html" grab the third to last item instead.Next line does the jobSo, you\'ll need to rewritein this wayor use additional variable to increase readabilityWill this work?You can achieve this issue also without extracting an array from the urlThis is my alternative!Greetings\xc2\xa1Using ES6/ES2015 spread operator (...) you can do the following way.Please notice that using spread operator and reverse we did not mutated original array, this is a pure way of getting a last element of the array.Using reduceRight:There is also a npm module, that add last to Array.prototypeusageThe arrow function makes the fastest-performing method more concise, by not repeating the name of the array.Using lodash _.last(array) Gets the last element of array.
