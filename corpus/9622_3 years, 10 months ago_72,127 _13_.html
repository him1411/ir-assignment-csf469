At the Angular-UI-Bootstrap page on cdnjs, is says:Native AngularJS (Angular) directives for Twitter\'s Bootstrap. Small footprint (5 kB gzipped!), no third-party JavaScript dependencies (jQuery, Bootstrap JavaScript) required!... and has options forandDiff\'ing these shows a subtle difference, and I can\'t seem to find any documentation on it...Long story short, use tpls unless you are going to create customized\n  templates.It is documented here:\n  github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/tree/gh-pages#build-files (linked from\n  the home page as well). In short the -tpls version has default Bootstrap\n  templates bundled. In any case you should only include one of the\n  listed files. - Thanks pkozlowski.opensourceSo,  ui-bootstrap-tpls.min.js == (ui-bootstrap.min.js + HTML templates) required by the JavaScript code. If you only included ui-bootstrap.min.js, you will also need to provide your own HTML templates.Otherwise you will see something like:The tpls tag means that the file also contains templates.Here is an example:For example: template/alert/alert.htmlPeople have answered this question already, but I wanted to point out that starting with release 0.13.4, we\'ve added the ability to provide your own templates on a case-by-case basis (i.e., each directive use, not application wide, though, the latter would not be hard to do).
