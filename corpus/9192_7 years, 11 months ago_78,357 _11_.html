I\'m working on a CSS file and find the need to style text input boxes, however, I\'m running into problems. I need a simple declaration that matches all these elements:... but doesn\'t match these ones:Here\'s what I would like to do:In the above CSS, notice the first selector is input[!type]. What I mean by this is I want to select all input boxes where the type attribute is not specified (because it defaults to text but input[type=\'text\'] doesn\'t match it). Unfortunately, there is no such selector in the CSS3 spec that I could find.Does anyone know of a way to accomplish this?:not selectorSupport: in Internet Explorer 9 and higherFor a more cross-browser solution you could style all inputs the way you want the non-typed, text, and password then another style the overrides that style for radios, checkboxes, etc.- Or -could whatever part of your code that is generating the non-typed inputs give them a class like .no-type or simply not output at all? Additionally this type of selection could be done with jQuery.Just wanted to add to this, you can have the :not selector in oldIE using selectivizr: http://selectivizr.com/
