I have an array of integers.For example:Is there any nice way to get the sum of them?I know, that would work.Try this:See Ruby\'s Enumerable Documentation(note: the 0 base case is needed so that 0 will be returned on an empty array instead of nil)Or try the Ruby 1.9 way:Note: the 0 base case is needed otherwise nil will be returned on empty arrays:While equivalent to array.inject(0, :+), the term reduce is entering a more common vernacular with the rise of MapReduce programming models.inject, reduce, fold, accumulate, and compress are all synonymous as a class of folding functions. I find consistency across your code base most important, but since various communities tend to prefer one word over another, it\xe2\x80\x99s nonetheless useful to know the alternatives.To emphasize the map-reduce verbiage, here\xe2\x80\x99s a version that is a little bit more forgiving on what ends up in that array.Some additional relevant reading:Alternatively (just for comparison), if you have Rails installed (actually just ActiveSupport):It is dangerous to mokeypatch base classes and now that Ruby 2.4.0 has sum on Enumerables it is not needed and dangerous.  If you like danger and using an older version of Ruby, you could add #sum to the Array class:Then do fun stuff like:ruby 1.8.7 way is the following:Just for the sake of diversity, you can also do this if your array is not an array of numbers, but rather an array of objects that have properties that are numbers (e.g. amount):You can simply use:You can use the aptly named method Enumerable#sum. It has a lot of advantages over inject(:+) but there are some important notes to read at the end as well. This method is not equivalent to #inject(:+). For example Also,See this answer for more information on why sum is like this.Ruby 2.4+ / Rails - array.sum i.e. [1, 2, 3].sum # => 6Ruby pre 2.4 - array.inject(:+) or array.reduce(:+)*Note: The #sum method is a new addition to 2.4 for enumerable so you will now be able to use array.sum in pure ruby, not just Rails.Also allows for [1,2].sum{|x| x * 2 } == 6:Works for Ranges too...\nhence,Ruby 2.4.0 is released, and it has an Enumerable#sum method. So you can doExamples from the docs:You could also use recursionif you don\'t want to be destructive, make a clone.If you feel golfy, you can doThis will create a string "123+321+12389" and then use function eval to do the sum. This is only for golfing purpose, you should not use it in proper code.You can also do it in easy wayOr you can try this method:You can use .map and .sum like:
