I have a <div> element and I want to put a border on it.  I know I can write style="border: 1px solid black", but this adds 2px to either side of the div, which is not what I want.  I would rather have this border be -1px from the edge of the div. The div itself is 100px x 100px, and if I add a border, then I have to do some mathematics to make the border appear.Is there any way that I can make the border appear, and ensure the box will still be 100px (including the border)?Set box-sizing property to border-box:It works on IE8 & above.You can also use box-shadow like this:Example here: http://jsfiddle.net/nVyXS/ (hover to view border)This works in modern browsers only. For example: No IE 8 support.\nSee caniuse.com (box-shadow feature) for more info.Probably it is belated answer, but I want to share with my findings. I found 2 new approaches to this problem that I have not found here in the answers:Yes, box-shadow is used to add box-shadows to the elements. But you can specify inset shadow, that would look like a inner border rather like a shadow. You just need to set horizontal and vertical shadows to 0px, and the "spread" property of the box-shadow to the width of the border you want to have. So for the \'inner\' border of 10px you would write the following:Here is jsFiddle example that illustrates the difference between box-shadow border and \'normal\' border. This way your border and the box width are of total 100px including the border.More about box-shadow:hereHere is another approach, but this way the border would be outside of the box. Here is an example.\nAs follows from the example, you can use css outline property, to set the border that does not affect the width and height of the element. This way, the border width is not added to the width of an element. More about outline: hereYahoo! This is really possible. I found it.For Bottom Border:For Top Border:Use pseudo element:Using ::after you are styling the virtual last child of the selected element. content property creates an anonymous replaced element.We are containing the pseudo element using absolute position relative to the parent. Then you have freedom to have whatever custom background and/or border in the background of your main element.This approach does not affect placement of the contents of the main element, which is different from using box-sizing: border-box;.Consider this example:Here .button width is constrained using the parent element. Setting the border-left-width adjusts the content-box size and thus the position of the text.Using the pseudo-element approach does not affect the content-box size. Depending on the application, approach using a pseudo-element might or might not be a desirable behaviour.I know this is somewhat older, but since the keywords "border inside" landed me directly here, I would like to share some findings that may be worth mentioning here.\nWhen I was adding a border on the hover state, i got the effects that OP is talking about. The border ads pixels to the dimension of the box which made it jumpy. \nThere is two more ways one can deal with this that also work for IE7.1)\nHave a border already attached to the element and simply change the color. This way the mathematics are already included.2 )\nCompensate your border with a negative margin. This will still add the extra pixels, but the positioning of the element will not be jumpy on for consistent rendering between new and older browsers, add a double container, the outer with the width, the inner with the border.this is obviously only if your precise width is more important than having extra markup!If you use box-sizing: border-box means not only border,\n  padding,margin, etc. All element will come inside of the parent\n  element.Best cross browser solution (mostly for IE support) like @Steve said is to make a div 98px in width and height than add a border 1px around it, or you could make a background image for div 100x100 px and draw a border on it.
