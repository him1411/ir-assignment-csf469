Since the new ADT preview version (version 21), they have a new lint warning that tells me the next thing on the manifest file (in the application tag):Should explicitly set android:allowBackup to true or false (it\'s true by default, and that can have some security implications for the application\'s data)In the official website, they\'ve written:A couple of new checks: you must explicitly decide whether your app allows backups, and a label check. There\'s a new command line flag for setting the library path. Many improvements to the incremental lint analysis while editing.What is this warning? What is the backup feature, and how do I use it?Also, why does the warning tell me it has security implications? What are the disadvantages and advantages of disabling this feature?There are two concepts of backup for the manifest:Whether to allow the application to participate in the backup and\n  restore infrastructure. If this attribute is set to false, no backup\n  or restore of the application will ever be performed, even by a\n  full-system backup that would otherwise cause all application data to\n  be saved via adb. The default value of this attribute is true.This is considered a security issue because people could backup your app via ADB and then get private data of your app into their PC.However, I think it\'s not that of a problem, since most users don\'t know what adb is, and if they do, they will also know how to root the device. ADB functions would only work if the device has the debugging feature enabled, and this needs the user to enable it.So, only users that connect their devices to the PC and enable the debugging feature would be affected. If they have a malicious app on their PC that uses the ADB tools, this could be problematic since the app could read the private storage data.I think Google should just add a feature that is disabled by default, in the developer category, to allow backup&restore of apps via ADB.The name of the class that implement\'s the application\'s backup agent,\n  a subclass of BackupAgent. The attribute value should be a fully\n  qualified class name (such as, "com.example.project.MyBackupAgent").\n  However, as a shorthand, if the first character of the name is a\n  period (for example, ".MyBackupAgent"), it is appended to the package\n  name specified in the  element. There is no default. The\n  name must be specified.This isn\'t a security issue.For this lint warning, and for all other lint warnings, note that you can get a fuller explanation than just what is in the one line error message; you don\'t have to search the web for more info.If you are using lint via Eclipse, either open the lint warnings view, where you can select the lint error and see a longer explanation, or invoke the quickfix (Ctrl-1) on the error line, and one of the suggestions is "Explain this issue", which will also pop up a fuller explanation. If you are not using Eclipse, you can generate an HTML report from lint (lint --html ) which includes full explanations next to the warnings, or you can ask lint to explain a particular issue. For example, the issue related to allowBackup has the id "AllowBackup" (shown at the end of the error message), so the fuller explanation is:$ ./lint --show AllowBackupSummary: Ensure that allowBackup is explicitly set in the application\'s\nmanifestPriority: 3 / 10\nSeverity: Warning\nCategory: SecurityThe allowBackup attribute determines if an application\'s data can be backed up\nand restored. It is documented here.By default, this flag is set to true. When this flag is set to true,\napplication data can be backed up and restored by the user using adb backup\nand adb restore.This may have security consequences for an application. adb backup allows\nusers who have enabled USB debugging to copy application data off of the\ndevice. Once backed up, all application data can be read by the user. adb\nrestore allows creation of application data from a source specified by the\nuser. Following a restore, applications should not assume that the data, file\npermissions, and directory permissions were created by the application\nitself.Setting allowBackup="false" opts an application out of both backup and\nrestore.To fix this warning, decide whether your application should support backup,\nand explicitly set android:allowBackup=(true|false)"Click here for More informationHere is what backup in this sense really means:Android\'s backup service allows you to copy your persistent application data to remote "cloud" storage, in order to provide a restore point for the application data and settings. If a user performs a factory reset or converts to a new Android-powered device, the system automatically restores your backup data when the application is re-installed. This way, your users don\'t need to reproduce their previous data or application settings.~Taken from http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/backup.htmlYou can register for this backup service as a developer here:\nhttps://developer.android.com/google/backup/signup.htmlThe type of data that can be backed up are files, databases, sharedPreferences, cache, and lib.  These are generally stored in your device\'s /data/data/[com.myapp] directory, which is read-protected and cannot be accessed unless you have root privileges.UPDATE:\nYou can see this flag listed on BackupManager\'s api doc: BackupManagerThis is not explicitly mentioned, but based on the following docs, I think it is implied that an app needs to declare and implement a BackupAgent in order for data backup to work, even in the case when allowBackup is set to true (which is the default value).http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#allowBackup\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/backup/BackupManager.html\nhttp://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/backup.htmlWhen should we set android:allowBackup=false You don\'t need root to backup data from an android device to a PC, you only need physical access and to enable debugging in the developer menu. This lets you copy data from the app\'s internal storage, which may contain sensitive information that you don\'t want to let somebody steal, like your facebook access token.I agree that it is pretty trivial in most cases, but there are some cases which require this extra layer of protection against attacks where physical access is involved.Note that in order to get around this you would need to root the phone, in which case the sensitive data in the internal storage would be wiped when the factory reset occurs.it is recommended to disallow users to backup an app if it contains sensitive data. Having access to backup files it is possible to modify the content of an app on a non rooted device.Solution -  use android:allowBackup="false" in the manifest file.http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/android-hacking-security-part-15-hacking-android-apps-using-backup-techniques/
