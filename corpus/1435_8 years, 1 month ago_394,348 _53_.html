How can one decompile Android DEX (VM bytecode) files into corresponding Java sourcecode?Get these tools:1) dex2jar, which is made by a Chinese student. It will translate dex files to jar files2) jd-gui to view the java files in the jarThe source code is quite readable as dex2jar makes some optimizations. And here\'s the procedure on how to decompile:Convert classes.dex in test_apk-debug.apk to test_apk-debug_dex2jar.jarNote: In the Windows machines all the .sh scripts are replaced by .bat scriptsdex2jar documentationOpen the jar in JD-GUITo clarify somewhat, there are two major paths you might take here depending on what you want to accomplish:Decompile the Dalvik bytecode (dex) into readable Java source. You can do this easily with dex2jar and jd-gui, as fred mentions. The resulting source is useful to read and understand the functionality of an app, but will likely not produce 100% usable code. In other words, you can read the source, but you can\'t really modify and repackage it. Note that if the source has been obfuscated with proguard, the resulting source code will be substantially more difficult to untangle.The other major alternative is to disassemble the bytecode to smali, an assembly language designed for precisely this purpose. I\'ve found that the easiest way to do this is with apktool. Once you\'ve got apktool installed, you can just point it at an apk file, and you\'ll get back a smali file for each class contained in the application. You can read and modify the smali or even replace classes entirely by generating smali from new Java source (to do this, you could compile your .java source to .class files with javac, then convert your .class files to .dex files with Android\'s dx compiler, and then use baksmali (smali disassembler) to convert the .dex to .smali files, as described in this question. There might be a shortcut here). Once you\'re done, you can easily package the apk back up with apktool again. Note that apktool does not sign the resulting apk, so you\'ll need to take care of that just like any other Android application.If you go the smali route, you might want to try APK Studio, an IDE that automates some of the above steps to assist you with decompiling and recompiling an apk and installing it on a device.In short, your choices are pretty much either to decompile into Java, which is more readable but likely irreversible, or to disassemble to smali, which is harder to read but much more flexible to make changes and repackage a modified app. Which approach you choose would depend on what you\'re looking to achieve. Lastly, the suggestion of dare is also of note. It\'s a retargeting tool to convert .dex and .apk files to java .class files, so that they can be analyzed using typical java static analysis tools.I\'d actually recommend going here:\nhttps://github.com/JesusFreke/smaliIt provides BAKSMALI, which is a most excellent reverse-engineering tool for DEX files.\nIt\'s made by JesusFreke, the guy who created the fameous ROMs for Android.A more complete version of fred\'s answer:First you need a tool to extract all the (compiled) classes on the DEX to a JAR.\nThere\'s one called dex2jar, which is made by a chinese student.Then, you can use jd-gui to decompile the classes on the JAR to source code.\nThe resulting source should be quite readable, as dex2jar applies some optimizations.You can use APKTool. It will automatically extract all the classes (.dex), resources (.asrc), then it will convert binary XML to human-readable XML, and it will also  dissassemble the classes for you.\nDisassembly will always be more robust than decompiling, especially with\nJARs obfuscated with Pro Guard!Just tell APKTool to decode the APK into a directory, then modify what you want,\nand finally encode it back to an APK. That\'s all.Important: APKTool dissassembles. It doesn\'t decompile.\nThe generated code won\'t be Java source.\nBut you should be able to read it, and even edit it if you\'re familiar with jasmin.\nIf you want Java source, please go over the Manual way.Sometimes you get broken code, when using dex2jar/apktool, most notably in loops. To avoid this, use jadx, which decompiles dalvik bytecode into java source code, without creating a .jar/.class file first as dex2jar does (apktool uses dex2jar I think). It is also open-source and in active development. It even has a GUI, for GUI-fanatics. Try it!Since no one mentioned this, there\'s one more tool: DED homepageInstall how-to and some explanations: Installation. It was used in a quite interesting study of the security of top market apps(not really related, just if you\'re curious): A Survey of Android Application SecurityOnce you downloaded your APK file , You need to do the following steps to get a editable java code/document.With Dedexer, you can disassemble the .dex file into dalvik bytecode (.ddx).Decompiling towards Java isn\'t possible as far as I know.\nYou can read about dalvik bytecode here.Android Reverse Engineering is possible \n . Follow these steps to get .java file from apk file.Step1 . Using dex2jarStep2 . Decompiling .jar using JD-GUIYou might try JADX (https://bitbucket.org/mstrobel/procyon/wiki/Java%20Decompiler), this is a perfect tool for DEX decompilation.And yes, it is also available online on (my :0)) new site: http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk/A lot has changed since most of these answers were posted. Now-a-days there a are many easy tools with GUI\'s, like these: Best place to find them is on the XDA Developers forum.Recent Debian have Python package androguard:Install corresponding packages:Decompile DEX file:Extract classes.dex from Apk + Decompile:Apk file is nothing more that Java archive (JAR), you may extract files from archive via:This can be done in following five steps:This gem does these things for you automatically even the installation of required toolsIf you\'re not looking to download dex2jar, then just use the apk_grabber python script to decompile any apk into jar files.  Then you read them with jd-gui.Easiest method to decompile an android app is to download an app named ShowJava from playstore . Just select the application that needs to be decompiled from the list of applications. There are three different decompiler you can use to decompile an app namely - CFR 0.110, JaDX 0.6.1 or FernFlower (analytical decompiler) .I have usedBut none beats google\'s own tools1)Android Studio 2.x:\nbuild> analyze apk\n2)Android Studio 3.0:\nProfile or Debug APK\n\n
