I apologize for such a question that likely has a trivial solution, but strangely, I could not find a concise API for this problem.Essentially, I would like to truncate a string such that its length is not longer than a given value.  I am writing to a database table and want to ensure that the values I write meet the constraint of the column\'s datatype.For instance, it would be nice if I could write the following:Unfortunately, this raises an exception because maxLength generally exceeds the boundaries of the string value.  Of course, I could write a function like the following, but I was hoping that something like this already exists.Where is the elusive API that performs this task?  Is there one?There isn\'t a Truncate() method on string, unfortunately. You have to write this kind of logic yourself. What you can do, however, is wrap this in an extension method so you don\'t have to duplicate it everywhere:Now we can write:Or instead of the ternary operator, you could use Math.minI figured I would throw in my implementation since I believe it covers all of the cases that have been touched on by the others and does so in a concise way that is still readable.This solution mainly builds upon the Ray\'s solution and opens up the method for use as an extension method by using the this keyword just as LBushkin does in his solution.You could use LINQ... it eliminates the need to check string length.  Admittedly maybe not the most efficient, but it\'s fun.orIn .NET 4.0 you can use the Take method:Not tested for efficiency!The .NET Framework has an API to truncate a string like this:But in a C# app you\'ll probably prefer to roll your own than taking a dependency on Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll, whose main raison d\'etre is backwards compatibility.Seems no one has posted this yet:Using the && operator makes it marginally better than the accepted answer.Because performance testing is fun: (using linqpad extension methods)The truncate method was "significantly" faster. #microoptimizationEarlyLateToo LongWhy noti.e. in the event value.Length < maxLength pad spaces to the end or truncate the excess.Taking @CaffGeek and simplifying it:Kndly note that truncating a string not merely means justing cutting a string at a specified length alone but have to take care not to split the word. eg string : this is a test string. I want to cut it at 11 . If we use any of the method given above the result will bethis is a teThis is not the thing we wantThe method i am using may also not so perfect but it can handle most of the situationA similar variant with C# 6\'s Null propagation operatorPlease note, we are essentially checking if value is null twice here.I know this is an old question, but here is a nice solution:Returns: hello...Just in case there\'s not enough answers here, here\'s mine :)to use:For the sake of (over)complexity I\'ll add my overloaded version which replaces the last 3 characters with an ellipsis in respect with the maxLength parameter.Still no Truncate method in 2016 for C# strings. \nBut - Using C# 6.0 Syntax:It works like a charm:I did mine in one line sort of like thisI prefer jpierson\'s answer, but none of the examples here that I can see are handling an invalid maxLength parameter, such as when maxLength < 0.Choices would be either handle the error in a try/catch, clamp the maxLength parameter min to 0, or if maxLength is less than 0 return an empty string.Not optimized code:Here is a vb.net solution, mark that the if (although ugly) statement improves performance because we do not need the substring statement when string is already smaller than maxlength...\nBy making it an extention to string it is easy to use...TruncateStringI know there are a ton of answers already but my need was to keep the beginning and end of the string intact but shorten it to under the max length.This is for creating SharePoint URLs that have a max length of 260 characters. I didn\'t make length a parameter since it is a constant 260.  I also didn\'t make the first substring length a parameter because I want it to break at a specific point.  Finally, the second substring is the length of the source - 20 since I know the folder structure.  This could easily be adapted to your specific needs.There is nothing in .net for this that I am aware of - here is my version which adds "...":This is the code I usually use:Truncate String
