I\'m uploading a binary for the first time. iTunes Connect has asked me:Export laws require that products containing encryption be properly authorized for export.\n  Failure to comply could result in severe penalties.\n  For further information, click here.\n  Does your product contain encryption?I use https://, but only via NSURLConnection and UIWebView.My reading of this is that my app doesn\'t "contain encryption," but I\'m wondering if this is spelled out anywhere. "Severe penalties" doesn\'t sound pleasant at all, so "I think that\'s right" is a bit sketchy... an authoritative answer would be better.Thanks.[UPDATE: Using HTTPS is now exempt from the ERN as of late September, 2016]\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/40919650/4976373Unfortunately, I believe that your app "contains encryption" in terms of US BIS even if you just use HTTPS (if your app is not an exception included in question 2).Quote from FAQ on iTunes Connect:"How do I know if I can follow the Exporter Registration and Reporting (ERN) process?If your app uses, accesses, implements or incorporates industry standard encryption algorithms for purposes other than those listed as exemptions under question 2, you need to submit for an ERN authorization. Examples of standard encryption are: AES, SSL, https. This authorization requires that you submit an annual report to two U.S. Government agencies with information about your app every January. \n""2nd Question: Does your product qualify for any exemptions provided under category 5 part 2?There are several exemptions available in US export regulations under Category 5 Part 2 (Information Security & Encryption regulations) for applications and software that use, access, implement or incorporate encryption.All liabilities associated with misinterpretation of the export regulations or claiming exemption inaccurately are borne by owners and developers of the apps.You can answer \xe2\x80\x9cYES\xe2\x80\x9d to the question if you meet any of the following criteria:(i) if you determine that your app is not classified under Category 5, Part 2 of the EAR based on the guidance provided by BIS at encryption question. The Statement of Understanding for medical equipment in Supplement No. 3 to Part 774 of the EAR can be accessed at Electronic Code of Federal Regulations site. Please visit the Question #15 in the FAQ section of the encryption page for sample items BIS has listed that can claim Note 4 exemptions.(ii) your app uses, accesses, implements or incorporates encryption for authentication only(iii) your app uses, accesses, implements or incorporates encryption with key lengths not exceeding 56 bits symmetric, 512 bits asymmetric and/or 112 bit elliptic curve(iv) your app is a mass market product with key lengths not exceeding 64 bits symmetric, or if no symmetric algorithms, not exceeding 768 bits asymmetric and/or 128 bits elliptic curve.Please review Note 3 in Category 5 Part 2 to understand the criteria for mass market definition.(v) your app is specially designed and limited for banking use or \xe2\x80\x98money transactions.\xe2\x80\x99 The term \xe2\x80\x98money transactions\xe2\x80\x99 includes the collection and settlement of fares or credit functions.(vi) the source code of your app is \xe2\x80\x9cpublicly available\xe2\x80\x9d, your app distributed at free of cost to general public, and you have met the notification requirements provided under 740.13.(e).Please visit encryption web page in case you need further help in determining if your app qualifies for any exemptions.If you believe that your app qualifies for an exemption, please answer \xe2\x80\x9cYES\xe2\x80\x9d to the question."It\'s not hard to get approval for your app the proper way.  SSL (HTTPS/TLS) is still encryption and unless you are using it just for authentication, then you should get the proper approval.  I just received approval, and my app is in the store now for something that uses SSL to encrypt data traffic (not just authentication).  Here is a blog entry I made so that others can do this the proper way.apple itunes export restrictionsI asked Apple the very same question and got the answer (from a Sr. Export Compliance Specialist), that "sending information over https is forcing the data to go through a secure channel from SSL, therefore it falls under the U.S. Government requirement for a CCATS review and approval." Note that it doesn\'t matter that Apple has already done this for their SSL implementation, but for the government, if you USE encryption that is the same (to them) as you would\'ve coded it yourself. I also updated our blog (http://blog.theanimail.com) since Tim linked to it with updates and details on the process. Hope that helps.If you use the Security framework or CommonCrypto libraries provided by Apple you do include crypto in your App and you have to answer yes - so simply because libraries were provided by Apple does not take you off the hook.With regards to the original question, recent posts in the Apple Development Forums lead me to believe that you need to answer yes even if all you use is SSL.All of this can be very confusing for an app developer that\'s simply using TLS to connect to their own web servers.  Because ATS (App Transport Security) is becoming more important and we are encouraged to convert everything to https - I think more developers are going to encounter this issue.My app simply exchanges data between our server and the user using the https protocol.  Seeing the words "USES ENCRYPTION" in the disclaimers is a bit scary so I gave the US government office a call at their office and spoke to a representative of the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/about-bis/contact-bis.  The representative asked me about my app and since it passed the "primary function test" in that it had nothing to do with security/communications and simply uses https as a channel for connecting my customer data to our servers - it fell in the EAR99 category which means it\'s exempt from getting government permission (see https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/licensing/commerce-control-list-classification/export-control-classification-number-eccn) I hope this helps other app developers.As of September 20th, 2016, registering is no longer required for apps that use https (or perhaps other forms of encryption): https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/informationsecurity2016-updatesIn fact, on SNAP-R you can no longer choose \'encryption registration\':\nSpecifically, they note:Encryption Registrations no longer required \xe2\x80\x93 some of the information\n  from the registration now goes into the Supp. No. 8 to Part 742\n  report.This means you may need to send an annual report to BIS, but you don\'t need to register and you can note when submitting your app that it is exempt.I found this FAQ from the US Bureau of Industry and Security very helpful. encryption Question 15 (What is Note 4?) is the important point:...Examples of items that are excluded from Category 5, Part 2 by Note 4 include, but are not limited to, the following:    Consumer applications.  Some examples:piracy and theft prevention for software or music;\n      music, movies, tunes/music, digital photos \xe2\x80\x93 players, recorders and organizers\n      games/gaming \xe2\x80\x93 devices, runtime software, HDMI and other component interfaces, development tools\n      LCD TV, Blu-ray / DVD, video on demand (VoD), cinema, digital video recorders (DVRs) / personal video recorders (PVRs) \xe2\x80\x93 devices, on-line media guides, commercial content integrity and protection, HDMI and other component interfaces (not videoconferencing);\n      printers, copiers, scanners, digital cameras, Internet cameras \xe2\x80\x93 including parts and sub-assemblies\n      household utilities and appliancesYes, according to iTunes Connect Export Compliance Information screens, if you use built-in iOS or MacOS encryption (keychain, https), you are using encryption for purposes of US Government Export regulations. Whether you qualify for an export compliance exemption depends on what your app does and how it uses this encryption. Attached images show the iTunes Connect Export Compliance Screens to help you determine your export reporting obligations. In particular, it states: If you are making use of ATS or making a call to HTTPS please note that you are required to submit a year-end self classification report to the US government. Learn more@hisnameisjimmy is correct: You will notice (at least as of today, Dec 1st 2016) when you go to submit your app for review and reach the Export Compliance walkthrough, you\'ll notice the menu now states that HTTPS is an exempt version of encryption (if you use it for every call):If you\'re not explicitly using an encryption library, or rolling your own encryption code, then I think the answer is "no"If you have to ask, the answer is probably no. When Apple talks about encryption, they\'re talking about adding routines or libraries to your code to explicitly encrypt data before storing or transmitting it. If you haven\'t done this, you haven\'t added encryption (https does not count, as that\'s provided by Apple).
