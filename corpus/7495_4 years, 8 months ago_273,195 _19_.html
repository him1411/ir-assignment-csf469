I am wondering if there is a function to clear the console in R, and RStudio in particular. I am looking for a function that I can type into the console, and not a keyboard shortcut.Someone has already provided such a function in this StackExchange post from 2010. Unfortunately, this depends on the RCom package and will not run on Mac OS X.I know this is an old question - but as it comes up high in the list of hits on Google when I Googled the same thing it made sense to add an answer...is the code to send ctrl+L to the console and therefore will clear the screen.Far better than just sending a whole lot of returns!If you are using the default R console, try: Option + Command + L \nIt will clear the console.Ok,  posting the comment Joshua and I came up with as an answer for you to accept.In Ubuntu-Gnome,  simply pressing ctrl  + l should clear the screen.(based on comments): This also seems to work well in : Windows 10 and macOS sierratldr;is maybe easier to remember than cat("\\014") which is E Luxo So \'s answer (from where I\'ve derived my solution). I intended to comment his answer, but I dont have reputation 50 to comment, so I \'ve made new answer, which is basicly the same then his.\nWorks fine for me on Windows 10.Not to mention of course shortcut Ctrl+L on Windows.As none of the answers (except CTRL+l of course) quite worked, here\'s a function:Maybe this will help someone else with the ineradicable reflex of typing \'clear\'.  I put this (along with len <- length) in my ~/.Rprofile. EDIT: see the comment from @GregoryDemin below for how to use makeActiveBinding to use without the ().I developed an R package that will do this, borrowing from the suggestions above.  The package is called called mise, as in "mise en place."  You can install and run it usingNote that mise() also deletes all variables and functions and closes all figures by default.  To just clear the console, use mise(vars = FALSE, figs = FALSE).  Use the combination of Luxo and Carl\'s answers to clear and clc
