I use Ubuntu and installed Curl on it. I want to test my Spring REST application with Curl. I wrote my POST code at Java side. However, I want to test it with Curl. I am trying to post a JSON data. An example data is like this:I use this command:It returns this error:The error description is this:The server refused this request because the request entity is in a format not supported by the requested resource for the requested method ().Tomcat log:\n    "POST /ui/webapp/conf/clear HTTP/1.1" 415 1051Any ideas about the right format of the Curl command?EDIT:This is my Java side PUT code (I have tested GET and DELETE and they work)You need to set your content-type to application/json. But -d sends the Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded, which is not accepted on Spring\'s side.Looking at the curl man page, I think you can use -H:Full example:(-H is short for --header, -d for --data)Note that -X POST is optional if you use -d, as the -d flag implies a POST request.On Windows, things are slightly different. See the comment thread.Try to put your data in a file, say body.json and then useYou might find resty useful:\nhttps://github.com/micha/restyIt\'s a wrapper round CURL which simplifies command line REST requests. You point it to your API endpoint, and it gives you PUT and POST commands. (Examples adapted from the homepage)Also, it\'s often still necessary to add the Content Type headers. You can do this once, though, to set a default, of add config files per-method per-site: Setting default RESTY optionsIt worked for me using:It was happily mapped to the Spring controller:IdOnly is a simple POJO with an id property.For Windows, having a single quote for the -d value did not work for me, but it did work after changing to double quote. Also I needed to escape double quotes inside curly brackets.That is, the following did not work:But the following worked:As an example, create a JSON file, params.json, and add this content to it:Then you run this command:This worked well for me.Where,-X Means the http verb.--data Means the data you want to send.I just run into the same problem. I could solve it by specifyingUsing CURL Windows, try this:If you\'re testing a lot of JSON send/responses against a RESTful interface, you may want to check out the Postman plug-in for Chrome (which allows you to manually define web service tests) and its Node.js-based Newman command-line companion (which allows you to automate tests against "collections" of Postman tests.)  Both free and open!This worked for me:This worked well for me, additionally using BASIC authentication:Of course, you should never use BASIC authentication without SSL and a checked certificate.I ran into this again today, using Cygwin\'s cURL 7.49.1 for Windows... And when using --data or --data-binary with a JSON argument, cURL got confused and would interpret the {} in the JSON as a URL template. Adding a -g argument to turn off cURL globbing fixed that.See also Passing a URL with brackets to curl.A bit late to the party, but I don\'t see this posted, so here goes, you could also put your json in a file and pass it to curl using --file-upload option via standard input, like this:I am using the below format to test with a web server.Let\'s assume this JSON dict format:For really simple params when you don\'t want to escaping json things, you could just pass params in querystring-like manner:
