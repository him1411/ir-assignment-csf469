I am trying to write a windows client application that calls a web site for data. To keep the install to a minimum I am trying only use dlls in the .NET Framework Client Profile. Trouble is that I need to UrlEncode some parameters, is there an easy way to do this without importing System.Web.dll which is not part of the Client Pofile?System.Uri.EscapeUriString() can be problematic with certain characters, for me it was a number / pound \'#\' sign in the string.If that is an issue for you, try:Here is a SO question answer that explains the difference:What's the difference between EscapeUriString and EscapeDataString?and recommends to use Uri.EscapeDataString() in any aspect.In .Net 4.5+ use WebUtilityJust for formatting I\'m submitting this as an answer.Couldn\'t find any good examples comparing them so:Outputs:In .Net 4.5+ use WebUtility.UrlEncodeThis appears to replicate HttpUtility.UrlEncode (pre-v4.0) for the more common characters:\nUri.EscapeDataString(testString).Replace("%20", "+").Replace("\'", "%27").Replace("~", "%7E")\nNote: EscapeUriString will keep a valid uri string, which causes it to use as many plaintext characters as possible.See this answer for a Table Comparing the various Encodings:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/11236038/555798Line Breaks\nAll of them listed here (other than HttpUtility.HtmlEncode) will convert "\\n\\r" into %0a%0d or %0A%0DPlease feel free to edit this and add new characters to my test string, or leave them in the comments and I\'ll edit it.You can useUri.EscapeUriString (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.uri.escapeuristring.aspx)The answers here are very good, but still insufficient for me.I wrote a small loop that compares Uri.EscapeUriString with Uri.EscapeDataString for all characters from 0 to 255.NOTE: Both functions have the built-in intelligence that characters above 0x80 are first UTF-8 encoded and then percent encoded.Here is the result:EscapeUriString is to be used to encode URLs, while EscapeDataString is to be used to encode for example the content of a Cookie, because Cookie data must not contain the reserved characters \'=\' and \';\'.There\'s a client profile usable version, System.Net.WebUtility class, present in client profile System.dll. Here\'s the MSDN Link:WebUtilityHere\'s an example of sending a POST request that properly encodes parameters using  application/x-www-form-urlencoded content type:To UrlEncode without using System.Web:more details:\nhttps://www.samnoble.co.uk/2014/05/21/beware-webutility-urlencode-vs-httputility-urlencode/
