In Python remove() will remove the first occurrence of value in a list.How to remove all occurrences of a value from a list, without sorting the list?This is what I have in mind.Functional approach:2.x3.xor You can use a list comprehension:You can use slice assignment if the original list must be modified, while still using an efficient list comprehension (or generator expression).Repeating the solution of the first post in a more abstract way:All of the answers above (apart from Martin Andersson\'s) create a new list without the desired items, rather than removing the items from the original list. This can be important if you have other references to the list hanging around.To modify the list in place, use a method like thisAs far as speed is concerned, results on my laptop are (all on a 5000 entry list with 1000 entries removed)So the .remove loop is about 100x slower........ Hmmm, maybe a different approach is needed. The fastest I\'ve found is using the list comprehension, but then replace the contents of the original list.you can do thisSee the simple solutions\nSolution 1:This will return a list having all elements of x without 2\n\nSolution 2:At the cost of readability, I think this version is slightly faster as it doesn\'t force the while to reexamine the list, thus doing exactly the same work remove has to do anyway:To remove all duplicate occurrences and leave one in the list:Here is the function I\'ve used for Project Euler:I believe this is probably faster than any other way if you don\'t care about the lists order, if you do take care about the final order store the indexes from the original and resort by that."""\nResult:\n6.9\n8.9\n3\n5\n4.9\n1\n2.9\n9\n12.9\n10.9\n11\n""""""\nResult:\n6.9\n8.9\n3\n5\n4.9\n1\n2.9\n9\n12.9\n10.9\n11\n"""Numpy approach and timings against a list/array with 1.000.000 elements:Timings:Conclusion: numpy is 27 times faster (on my notebook) compared to list comprehension approachPS if you want to convert your regular Python list lst to numpy array:Setup:Check:Much simpler I believe.About the speed!Only with Python 3
