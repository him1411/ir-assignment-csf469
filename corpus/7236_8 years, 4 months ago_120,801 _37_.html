I would need to rename a few columns in some tables in a SQLite database.\nI know that a similar question has been asked on stackoverflow previously, but it was for SQL in general, and the case of SQLite was not mentioned.From the SQLite documentation for ALTER TABLE, I gather that it\'s not possible to do such a thing "easily" (i.e. a single ALTER TABLE statement).I was wondering someone knew of a generic SQL way of doing such a thing with SQLite.Say you have a table and need to rename "colb" to "col_b":First you rename the old table:Then create the new table, based on the old table but with the updated column name:Then copy the contents across from the original table.Lastly, drop the old table.Wrapping all this in a BEGIN TRANSACTION; and COMMIT; is also probably a good idea.While it is true that there is no ALTER COLUMN, if you only want to rename the column, drop the NOT NULL constraint, or change the data type, you can use the following set of commands:Note: These commands have the potential to corrupt your database, so make sure you have a backupYou will need to either close and reopen your connection or vacuum the database to reload the changes into the schema.For example:REFERENCES FOLLOW:\nalter table\nSQLite supports a limited subset of ALTER TABLE. The ALTER TABLE command in SQLite allows the user to rename a table or to add a new column to an existing table. It is not possible to rename a column, remove a column, or add or remove constraints from a table. Digging around, I found this multiplatform (Linux | Mac | Windows) graphical tool called DB Browser for SQLite that actually allows one to rename columns in a very user friendly way!Edit | Modify Table | Select Table | Edit Field. Click click! Voila!However, if someone want to share a programmatic way of doing this, I\'d be happy to know!Recently I had to do that in SQLite3 with a table named points with the colunms id, lon, lat. Erroneusly, when the table was imported, the values for latitude where stored in the lon column and viceversa, so an obvious fix would be to rename those columns. So the trick was:I hope this would be useful for you!Quoting the sqlite documentation:SQLite supports a limited subset of\n  ALTER TABLE. The ALTER TABLE command\n  in SQLite allows the user to rename a\n  table or to add a new column to an\n  existing table. It is not possible to rename a colum, remove a column, or add or remove constraints from a table.What you can do of course is, create a new table with the new layout, SELECT * FROM old_table, and fill the new table with the values you\'ll receive.First off, this is one of those things that slaps me in the face with surprise: renaming of a column requires creating an entirely new table and copying the data from the old table to the new table...The GUI I\'ve landed on to do SQLite operations is Base. It\'s got a nifty Log window that shows all the commands that have been executed. Doing a rename of a column via Base populates the log window with the necessary commands:These can then be easily copied and pasted where you might need them. For me, that\'s into an ActiveAndroid migration file. A nice touch, as well, is that the copied data only includes the SQLite commands, not the timestamps, etc.Hopefully, that saves some people time.As mentioned before, there is a tool SQLite Database Browser, which does this. Lyckily, this tool keeps a log of all operations performed by the user or the application. Doing this once and looking at the application log, you will see the code involved. Copy the query and paste as required. Worked for me. Hope this helpsOne option, if you need it done in a pinch, and if your initial column was created with a default, is to create the new column you want, copy the contents over to it, and basically "abandon" the old column (it stays present, but you just don\'t use/update it, etc.)ex:This leaves behind a column (and if it was created with NOT NULL but without a default, then future inserts that ignore it might fail), but if it\'s just a throwaway table, the tradeoffs might be acceptable.  Otherwise use one of the other answers mentioned here, or a different database that allows columns to be renamed.Create a new column with the desired column name: COLNew. Copy contents of old column COLOld to new column COLNew.Note: brackets are necessary in above line. sqlite3 yourdb .dump > /tmp/db.txt \nedit /tmp/db.txt change column name in Create line\nsqlite2 yourdb2 < /tmp/db.txt\nmv/move yourdb2 yourdb
