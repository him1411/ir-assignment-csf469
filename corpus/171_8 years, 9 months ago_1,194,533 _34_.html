How do you safely encode a URL using JavaScript such that it can be put into a GET string?I assume that you need to encode the myUrl variable on that second line?Check out the built-in function encodeURIComponent(str) and encodeURI(str).\nIn your case, this should work:You have three options:escape() will not encode: @*/+encodeURI() will not encode: ~!@#$&*()=:/,;?+\'encodeURIComponent() will not encode: ~!*()\'But in your case, if you want to pass a URL into a GET parameter of other page, you should use escape or encodeURIComponent, but not encodeURI.See Stack Overflow question Best practice: escape, or encodeURI / encodeURIComponent for further discussion.Stick with encodeURIComponent(). The function encodeURI() does not bother to encode many characters that have semantic importance in URLs (e.g. "#", "?", and "&"). escape() is deprecated, and does not bother to encode "+" characters, which will be interpreted as encoded spaces on the server (and, as pointed out by others here, does not properly URL-encode non-ASCII characters).There is a nice explanation of the difference between encodeURI() and encodeURIComponent() elsewhere. If you want to encode something so that it can safely be included as a component of a URI (e.g. as a query string parameter), you want to use encodeURIComponent().Personally, I find that many APIs want to replace " " with "+" so I use the following:escape is implemented differently in different browsers and encodeURI doesn\'t encode most of the characters that are functional in a URI (like # and even /) -- it\'s made to be used on a full URI/URL without breaking it.EDIT: You use encodeURIComponent for the values of the query string (not fields/value names and definitely not the entire URL).  If you do it any other way it won\'t encode characters like =, ?, &, possibly leaving your query string exposed.If you are using jQuery I would go for $.param method. It URL encodes an object mapping fields to values, which is easier to read than calling an escape method on each value.encodeURIComponent() is the way to go.BUT you should keep in mind that there are small differences from php version urlencode() and as @CMS mentioned, it will not encode every char. Guys at http://phpjs.org/functions/urlencode/ made js equivalent to phpencode():Similar kind of thing I tried with normal javascriptTo encode a URL, as has been said before, you have two functions:and The reason both exist is that the first preserves the URL with the risk of leaving too many things unescaped, while the second encodes everything needed.With the first, you could copy the newly escaped URL into address bar (for example) and it would work.  However your unescaped \'&\'s would interfere with field delimiters, the \'=\'s would interfere with field names and values, and the \'+\'s would look like spaces.  But for simple data when you want to preserve the URL nature of what you are escaping, this works.The second is everything you need to do to make sure nothing in your string interfers with a URL.  It leaves various unimportant characters unescaped so that the URL remains as human readable as possible without interference.  A URL encoded this way will no longer work as a URL without unescaping it.So if you can take the time, you always want to use encodeURIComponent() -- before adding on name/value pairs encode both the name and the value using this function before adding it to the query string.I\'m having a tough time coming up with reasons to use the encodeURI() -- I\'ll leave that to the smarter people.Nothing worked for me. All I was seeing was the HTML of the login page, coming back to the client side with code 200. (302 at first but the same Ajax request loading login page inside another Ajax request, which was supposed to be a redirect rather than loading plain text of the login page).In the login controller, I added this line:And in the global Ajax handler, I did this:Now I don\'t have any issue, and it works like a charm.To prevent double encoding it\'s a good idea to decode the url before encoding (if you are dealing with user entered urls for example, which might be already encoded).Lets say we have abc%20xyz 123 as input (one space is already encoded):Encode URL String\n    You can use esapi library and encode your url using the below function. The function endures that \'/\' are not lost to encoding while the remainder of the text contents are encoded:https://www.owasp.org/index.php/ESAPI_JavaScript_Readme
