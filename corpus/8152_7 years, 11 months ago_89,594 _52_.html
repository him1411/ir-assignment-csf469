I currently have an app displaying the build number in its title window.  That\'s well and good except it means nothing to most of the users, who want to know if they have the latest build - they tend to refer to it as "last Thursday\'s" rather than build 1.0.8.4321.The plan is to put the build date there instead - So "App built on 21/10/2009" for example.I\'m struggling to find a programmatic way to pull the build date out as a text string for use like this.For the build number, I used:after defining how those came up.I\'d like something like that for the compile date (and time, for bonus points).Pointers here much appreciated (excuse pun if appropriate), or neater solutions...Jeff Atwood had a few things to say about this issue in Determining Build Date the hard way.The most reliable method turns out to be retrieving the linker timestamp from the PE header embedded in the executable file -- some C# code (by Joe Spivey) for that from the comments to Jeff\'s article:Usage example:UPDATE: The method was working for .Net Core 1.0, but stopped working after .Net Core 1.1 release(gives random years in 1900-2020 range) Caveat: It\'s been reported that this time may be unstable and changed by the JITerI changed my mind about this, and currently use this trick to get the correct build date.https://web.archive.org/web/20111007051401/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms680313Reading the time from COFF HeaderUsage example:Well, how do you generate build numbers? Visual Studio (or the C# compiler) actually provides automatic build and revision numbers if you change the AssemblyVersion attribute to e.g. 1.0.*What will happen is that is that the build will be equal to the number of days since January 1, 2000 local time, and for revision to be equal to the number of seconds since midnight local time, divided by 2.see Community Content, Automatic Build and Revision numberse.g. AssemblyInfo.csSampleCode.csAdd below to pre-build event command line:Add this file as resource,\nnow you have \'BuildDate\' string in your resources.To create resources, see How to create and use resources in .NET.Add below to pre-build event command line:Add this file as resource, now you have \'BuildDate\' string in your resources.After inserting the file into the Resource (as public text file), I accessed it viaTo create resources, see How to create and use resources in .NET.I am just C# newbie so maybe my answer sound silly - I display the build date from the date the executable file was last written to:I tried to use File.GetCreationTime method but got weird results: the date from the command was 2012-05-29, but the date from the Window Explorer showed 2012-05-23. After searching for this discrepancy I found that the file was probably created on 2012-05-23 (as shown by Windows Explorer), but copied to the current folder on 2012-05-29 (as shown by File.GetCreationTime command) - so to be on the safe side I am using File.GetLastWriteTime command.ZalekFor anyone that needs to get the compile time in Windows 8 / Windows Phone 8:For anyone that needs to get the compile time in Windows Phone 7:NOTE: In all cases you\'re running in a sandbox, so you\'ll only be able to get the compile time of assemblies that you deploy with your app. (i.e. this won\'t work on anything in the GAC).The option not discussed here is to insert your own data into AssemblyInfo.cs, the "AssemblyInformationalVersion" field seems appropriate - we have a couple of projects where we were doing something similar as a build step (however I\'m not entirely happy with the way that works so don\'t really want to reproduce what we\'ve got).There\'s an article on the subject on codeproject: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dotnet/Customizing_csproj_files.aspxYou could use a project post-build event to write a text file to your target directory with the current datetime.  You could then read the value at run-time.  It\'s a little hacky, but it should work.I\'m not sure, but maybe the Build Incrementer helps.A different, PCL-friendly approach would be to use an MSBuild inline task to substitute the build time into a string that is returned by a property on the app. We are using this approach successfully in an app that has Xamarin.Forms, Xamarin.Android, and Xamarin.iOS projects.EDIT:Simplified by moving all of the logic into the SetBuildDate.targets file, and using Regex instead of simple string replace so that the file can be modified by each build without a "reset".The MSBuild inline task definition (saved in a SetBuildDate.targets file local to the Xamarin.Forms project for this example):Invoking the above inline task in the Xamarin.Forms csproj file in target BeforeBuild:The FilePath property is set to a BuildMetadata.cs file in the Xamarin.Forms project that contains a simple class with a string property BuildDate, into which the build time will be substituted:Add this file BuildMetadata.cs to project. It will be modified by every build, but in a manner that allows repeated builds (repeated replacements), so you may include or omit it in source control as desired.One approach which I\'m amazed no-one has mentioned yet is to use T4 Text Templates for code generation.Pros:Cons:The above method can be tweaked for assemblies already loaded within the process by using the file\'s image in memory (as opposed to re-reading it from storage):You could launch an extra step in the build process that writes a date stamp to a file which can then be displayed.On the projects properties tab look at the build events tab. There is an option to execute a pre or post build command.If this is a windows app, you can just use the application executable path:\nnew System.IO.FileInfo(Application.ExecutablePath).LastWriteTime.ToString("yyyy.MM.dd")
