Using LocalStorage on iPhone with iOS 7 throws this error. I\'ve been looking around for a resolvant, but considering I\'m not even browsing in private, nothing is relevant.I don\'t understand why localStorage would be disabled by default in iOS 7, but it seems it is? I\'ve tested on other websites as well, but with no luck. I even tried testing it using this website: http://arty.name/localstorage.html, but it doesn\'t seem like it\'s saving anything at all for some weird reason.Has anyone had the same problem, only they\'ve had luck fixing it? Should I switch my storage method?I tried hard-debugging it by only storing a few lines of information, but to no avail. I used the standard localStorage.setItem() function to save.This can occur when Safari is in private mode browsing. While in private browsing, local storage is not available at all.One solution is to warn the user that the app needs non-private mode to work.UPDATE: This has been fixed in Safari 11, so the behaviour is now aligned with other browsers.As mentioned in other answers, you\'ll always get the QuotaExceededError in Safari Private Browser Mode on both iOS and OS X when localStorage.setItem (or sessionStorage.setItem) is called.One solution is to do a try/catch or Modernizr check in each instance of using setItem.However if you want a shim that simply globally stops this error being thrown, to prevent the rest of your JavaScript from breaking, you can use this:https://gist.github.com/philfreo/68ea3cd980d72383c951I use this simple function, which returns true or false, to test for localStorage availablity:Now you can test for localStorage.setItem() availability before using it. Example:I happened to run with the same issue in iOS 7 (with some devices no simulators).Looks like Safari in iOS 7 has a lower storage quota, which apparently is reached by having a long history log.I guess the best practice will be to catch the exception.The Modernizr project has an easy patch, you should try something similar: https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/blob/master/feature-detects/storage/localstorage.jsHere is an expanded solution based on DrewT\'s answer above that uses cookies if localStorage is not available. It uses Mozilla\'s docCookies library:In your source, just use:To add upon previous answers, one possible workaround would be to change the storage method. There are a few librairies such as AmplifyJS and PersistJS which can help. Both libs allow persistent client-side storage through several backends.For AmplifyJSlocalStoragesessionStorageglobalStorageuserDatamemoryFor PersistentJSThey offer an abstraction layer so you don\'t have to worry about choosing the storage type. Keep in mind there might be some limitations (such as size limits) depending on the storage type though. Right now, I am using AmplifyJS, but I still have to do some more testing on iOS 7/Safari/etc. to see if it actually solves the problem.As already explained in other answers, when in Private Browsing mode Safari will always throw this exception when trying to save data with localStorage.setItem() . To fix this I wrote a fake localStorage that mimics localStorage, both methods and events. Fake localStorage: https://gist.github.com/engelfrost/fd707819658f72b42f55This is probably not a good general solution to the problem. This was a good solution for my scenario, where the alternative would be major re-writes to an already existing application.In April 2017 a patch was merged into Safari, so it aligned with the other browsers. This was released with Safari 11.https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=157010This question and answer helped me solve a specific problem with signing up new users in Parse. Because the signUp( attrs, options ) function uses local storage to persist the session, if a user is in private browsing mode it throws the "QuotaExceededError: DOM Exception 22: An attempt was made to add something to storage that exceeded the quota." exception and the success/error functions are never called. In my case, because the error function is never called it initially appeared to be an issue with firing the click event on the submit or the redirect defined on success of sign up.Including a warning for users resolved the issue.Parse Javascript SDK Reference\nhttps://parse.com/docs/js/api/classes/Parse.User.html#methods_signUpSigns up a new user with a username (or email) and password. This will create a new Parse.User on the server, and also persist the session in localStorage so that you can access the user using {@link #current}.
