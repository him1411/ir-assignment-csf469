I am trying to print a text in the terminal using echo command. I want to print the text in a red color. How can I do it?You can use these ANSI escape codes:And then use them like this in your script:which prints love in red.From @james-lim\'s comment, if you are using the echo command, be sure to use the -e flag to allow backslash escapes.(don\'t add "\\n" when using echo unless you want to add additional empty line)You can use the awesome tput command (suggested in Ignacio\'s answer) to produce terminal control codes for all kinds of things.Specific tput sub-commands are discussed later.Call tput as part of a sequence of commands:Use ; instead of && so if tput errors the text still shows.Another option is to use shell variables:tput produces character sequences that are interpreted by the terminal as having a special meaning. They will not be shown themselves. Note that they can still be saved into files or processed as input by programs other than the terminal.It may be more convenient to insert tput\'s output directly into your echo strings using command substitution:The above command produces this on Ubuntu:Colours are as follows:There are also non-ANSI versions of the colour setting functions (setb instead of setab, and setf instead of setaf) which use different numbers, not given here.With compiz wobbly windows, the bel command makes the terminal wobble for a second to draw the user\'s attention.tput accepts scripts containing one command per line, which are executed in order before tput exits.Avoid temporary files by echoing a multiline string and piping it:also, you can use three methods:\nstart and resetPay attention to reset moods  [m or [0m or [0  shell:ASCII hex:ASCII oct:example_1 with \\e:example_2 with \\x1b:example_3 with \\033:show color by for structure:and more sample : samples_1\nsamples_2and more information :m-informationBe careful if you want to customize the bash prompt(.bashrc), for example if you use \\e[0;31m anything \\e[0 all things are good but whenever your use long command, the command loses in your terminal, or kosole. So for this point you can use \\[\\033[5;36m\\] your_text \\033[00m\\]for example my .bashrc :The important thing is 00m at the end of lineIf you want to use the blink code on your bash, you can use 5 number to do that my konsole, it does not work on gnome-terminal\nI am so sorry my English writing is not very well if you see any mistake\n\n\nIt may interest you to see my\nillustrated_Perl_one-linerIn a convenient way you can use this simple C code to see the output of each color-code:  here is the full code and more details on my github Use tput with the setaf capability and a parameter of 1.The [31m controls the text color:This is the color switch \\033[. See history.Color codes are like 1;32 (Light Green), 0;34 (Blue), 1;34 (Light Blue), etc.We terminate color sequences with a color switch \\033[ and 0m, the no-color code. Just like opening and closing tabs in a markup language.Simple color echo function solution:A neat way to change color only for one echo is to define such function:Usage:Or you could directly use color codes mentioned in Drew\'s answer:Use tput to calculate color codes. Avoid using the ANSI escape code (e.g. \\E[31;1m for red) because it\'s less portable. Bash on OS X, for example, does not support it.These codes work on my Ubuntu box:This prints the letters a b c d all in different colors:For loop:If you want to improve the readability of the code, you can echo the string first then add the color later by using sed:Thanks to @k-five for this answer Hope this image help you to pick your color for your bash :D To expand on this answer, for the lazy of us:My favourite answer so far is coloredEcho.Just to post another option, you can check out this little tool xcolhttps://ownyourbits.com/2017/01/23/colorize-your-stdout-with-xcol/you use it just like grep, and it will colorize its stdin with a different color for each argument, for instanceNote that it accepts any regular expression that sed will accept.This tool uses the following definitionsI use these variables in my scripts like soAnd this what I used to see all combination and decide which reads cool:I\'ve written swag to achieve just that.You can just do Now you can install all the the escape commands as txt files to a given destination via:Or even easier via:Which will install the colors to ~/.colors.Either you use them like this:Or this way, which I find actually more interesting:Check it out on asciinema!Just as something a little out there, passing it through grep will highlight it as red (but only red). You can also use named pipes so your string is nearer to the end of the line:Here is a simple little script, I put together recently, that will colorize \nany piped input instead of using "Toilet". File: color.bsh Then call it with color red (196): \n$> echo "text you want colored red" | color.bsh 196This question has been answered over and over again :-) but why not.First using tput is more portable in modern environments than manually injecting ASCII codes through echo -E Here\'s a quick bash function:Now you can use it:This answer correct, except that the call to colors should not be inside the quotes.Should do the trick.
