I was invited to the kindergarten group of my elder daughter to talk and answer the kids\' questions about my profession. There are 26 kids of age 4-6 in the group, plus 3 teachers who are fairly scared of anything related to programming and IT themselves, but bold enough to learn new tricks. I would have about 20-30 minutes, without projector or anything. They have an old computer though, which by its look may be a 486, and I am not even sure if it\'s functioning (Update: it isn\'t).My research turned up excellent earlier threads, with lots of good tips:My situation is different from each of the above though: the latter ones are concerned with older children, while the first one is about talking to a single kid (or elder person) â€” a group of 20 is a whole different challenge.How can I teach the kids and their teachers about programming in a fun way?Thanks for all the amazing answers, guys :-) I don\'t think it makes sense to accept a single answer, but I like Jim\'s the most, just as the majority of SOers apparently do. However, a lot of other answers contain useful hints and ideas (some of which I will surely use on future Career days in the school...).I put together a rough plan:This is my plan - I am pretty sure it will turn out very differently, so I will improvise according to the situation. The presentation is scheduled in about 2 weeks time - I will update the post afterwards and tell how it actually went...Finally the day of the presentation arrived today... in brief, all went fine and it was a huge success :-)The group turned out to be quite restless and energetic this time, so the conversation occasionally went a bit chaotic. I had to cut it short and get to the Big Sandwich Maker Show. Just as Jim described, the kids loved it.There was one unforeseen side effect though: after the first slice of bread finally got ready, everyone wanted to eat! So for a while - during which I tried to keep up the conversation and explain more about programming - we had to install a sort of emergency service line with the kindergarten teachers to produce immense amounts of marmalade bread and feed the hungry crowd (this was half an hour after breakfast, for the record :-). Then we ran out of bread, which clearly meant the end of the presentation. The biggest burst of laugh erupted when after cleaning up the mess, the kids noticed that the poor computer stepped on a patch of marmalade which ruined his sock :-)The teachers themselves were also very positively impressed - judging from the feedback, this was the best and funniest Career day in this group so far. Thanks again to all of you for the great ideas!Things that could be improved (next time):But overall, I am quite happy with the outcome. And I am sure the kids got the core message: as a programmer, if you avoid creating a mess, you can make your bread (even with marmalade :-)I\'ve done this before.I laid down a lot of paper towels on a table, and got out a loaf of (cheap) bread, a small tub of butter, a small jar of jelly, and a plastic butter knife.I said to the kids, "How many of you think computers are smart?"  Most of them raised their hands.  I said, "Computers are really dumb.  People are smart.  You have to tell a computer everything.  It doesn\'t know how to do anything.  I\'m going to show you what I mean.  I\'m going to pretend I\'m as dumb as a computer, and you guys tell me how to make a sandwich."And when the first kid said "open the bag of bread!" I ripped the bag apart and let bread fall randomly all over the table.  That got a lot of giggles.  I continued to take the kids literally at their words until they learned to give short, specific commands, and eventually we ended up with a butter and jelly sandwich.  There was a lot of laughter but they came away understanding, at least a little, what a programmer does for a living.(I should note, I\'ve also done this demonstration with adults in an "intro to programming" class, and it works just as well with them.)What about doing a kinesthetic version of Logo?Say you have two kids side by side.  Can they figure out how to switch places using only the commands Step Forward, Step Back, Turn Left 90 Degrees, and Turn Right 90 Degrees?  I\'m sure there are other games like going through a maze, etc.I\'d think you\'d keep their attention if you can keep them moving.  This will spark the interest.  They\'ll figure out later that the job is sedentary. ;)Don\'t try to show them anything on the computer. Watching someone else type is boring for adults. For 5-year-olds, it\'s a recipe for anarchy.Instead, make it interactive. Some form of "Simon Says," but have them be the programmer.I\'ve never tried this, but it might be fun.Physically demonstrate an algorithm by using some attribute of each kid as the input data.For example, get them to form a line (in whatever order they go to initially), side by side. This might work better in a semi-circle so they can see each other doing the exercise, but there has to be a break in the line somewhere. Then, starting at one end of the line, get them to take turns doing "if the classmate on your left is taller than you, switch places; otherwise, stay put." The game ends when you go through the line and no one switches places. Get them to observe the results. (Hint: bubble sort!)To turn the kids onto programming, you drive up to the kindergarten in your Rolls Royce and walk in with your gorgeous significant other. If you\'re not Bill Gates, then you\'ll just have to explain that you sit in boring meetings for 4 hours a day, print cover sheets for TPS reports for 2 hours, and stare at stupid stuff written by preceding clueless programmers for the other 6 hours. (No need to mention that then you field calls from people who are maintaining your last program and who think YOU are the preceding clueless guy).No, i\'m not bitter, why do you ask?Seriously, (I am sure I\'m plagiarizing from one of those 3 threads subconsciously), have them play "give instructions to me on how to do Y", with you doing things the Genie way - all wrong unless instructions are very precise and clear. Actually mention genie as good example assuming the kids saw Aladdin.;^)Make them write short programs for you to do simple things (like enter the room and take a seat) and then execute them literally to demonstrate the "bugs" -- where they were not specific enough or didn\'t take something into account, so that you will do things wrong.  Try not to hurt yourself in the process.  It should be funny and will get them a pretty good idea of what an algorithm is. I think you could do the following demonstration in 20 minutes.  Maybe it\'s more suited for older children.  I don\'t really know what kindergarteners are capable of.  I\'d personally avoid trying to explain programming, and instead describe a problem that we as programmers solve.  For example, if there are enough children, you can demonstrate the Internet to them interactively.Part I:  How it WorksFirst describe to them, preferably with props, how the Internet works.  Bring in a laptop connected by a cable (for visual effect) to a home router.  Tell how computer programmers make all sorts of devices, including the programs on the laptop, the program in the router, and applications in other devices connected to the Internet, like cell phones.Explain how computers aren\'t connected directly to each other because it\'s impossible to connect a cable from every computer in the world to every computer.  You\'d need a billion cables in your house.  So instead, computers connect to routers.  And routers give packets of data (for example, e-mails, pictures, or videos) to other routers until it finally gets to the other computer.Describe the rules for a computer to talk to another:A computer can only give a packet to its router.A router can give a packet to the computers connected to it, or to the nearest router.This explanation should be very short, but emphasize the rules.  You should probably equate packets with e-mail or pictures.Part II:  Interactive TimeThen have 3 children volunteer to be routers.  Everyone else is a computer and divide them up evenly.  It\'d help to have colored cards they can hold.  Like the person holding the dark blue card is router that can talk to all the people holding light blue cards.  Let\'s say you give out blue, red, and yellow cards.Arrange the "routers" in a line, blue, then red, then yellow.  The blue router will then have to give a packet to the red router to give it to the yellow router.  Group the other kids around their routers.Bring "packets" for each child.  Mix it up with photos, letters, a print-out of tic-tac-toe to symbolize a game, or whatever.  Start by having a single red computer send to a yellow computer.  "Ashley, pick a yellow computer that you want to send your picture to.  OK, to send the picture to Brian, you have to give it to your router, Kelly.  Tell Kelley who should get the picture.  Kelley, you are blue, so you can\'t give the picture to Brian.  You have to give it to Timmy.  Tell Timmy who should get the picture.  Timmy is red, so he can\'t give it to Brian.  He has to give it to Renee.  Renee, you can give the picture to Brian since he is a yellow computer and you are the yellow router."Then have everyone think of one person to send their "packet" to, and watch your impromptu network in action.Part III:  Relate back to computer programmingTo conclude, ask the routers whether it was easy to be a router, or hard because there was a lot of people trying to give you pictures at one time.  Point out where things went wrong and tie it into real problems that we solve."I could see that Timmy was overloaded with packets because everyone had to send their packet through him.  As computer programmers, we have to solve problems like this every day.  One way we could solve it is to give Timmy 4 arms.  Or maybe add another router so that if Timmy has too many packets to deliver, you could give it to a different router instead."  Or "Maybe we want pictures to be delievered faster, so we could ask the router to deliver the picture first before delivering any other packets."To kind of borrow from the other ideas already posted, a game of Simon Says may be the way to go.  However, you can stress how computers will do EXACTLY what you tell them to do.  So, if the kids are Simon, and they say, "Simon says sit down." then you just sit down on the floor (not in a nearby chair or anything).  Follow instructions to the letter and not to the spirit.  (Of course, this may be tricky getting the kids to give ambiguous instructions, but I\'m sure you can come up with something.)Other than that, you could also talk about video games or other computer "things" that the kids may have used and you can say that programmers, like yourself, create those.  And then maybe jump into the Simon Says to show how it works.  Of course, this could result in a bunch of kids growing up thinking that you spend your entire day at work playing Simon Says with a computer...I sometimes regard my job as playing with Lego bricks. You start with a set of bricks of different sizes, shapes and colors, and from that you build larger things. You can build castles or star wars robots using the same set of bricks.And, it\'s about the same amount of fun!One of the major perks of programming is the ability to create things. To make dreams come true. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this will appeal very much to small children who have no problem to let their imagination roam free anyway. What do computers bring to the table?Instead, you could probably interest them in problem-solving, puzzles. The kind of thinking that is needed for programming. I probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t use a computer at all; instead, let them solve an engaging mathematical puzzle. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be hard but it should involve creative thinking.When I try to explain programming in a short amount of time to people who aren\'t familiar with programming, I explain it using Legos. With Legos you have a bunch of simple pieces, this is like the programming language. Then you can piece them together however you want and make anything that you can imagine as long as you have the correct pieces. To adults and kid this is likely to be a very interesting analogy and it still demonstrates the concept of programming. Also, you could even build a Lego car poorly, then also display a Lego car with very nice design, and show them that programming is just like this. You can program cars or robots or whatever you can imagine, but there\'s not only one way to do it, there are many ways to do it. some better than others. I have gotten so many people to begin programming and even switch their majors with this analogy. :)I think I\'d begin by talking for 2-3 minutes about computers, and that they follow instructions about what to do.Then I\'d demonstrate with a prebuilt LEGO Mindstorms robot and program it a couple of times and run it, just to show them that it follows the program. Mindstorms programming is pretty visual and simple to grasp.Finally I\'d try to explain that there are computers running programs almost everywhere, even in traffic lights, microwave ovens and their favourite toys.Talk about how pervasive computer programming is - it guides airlines, phones, cars, how you buy your tickets online etc.Then teach them to write a simple program symbolically - \n1.Draw a grid on the blackboard.\n2.Draw cheese at one end, and a mouse at the other end.\n3.Have them "program" the moues to get the cheese!Walk them through their failed attempts as a class, maybe have the mouse fall in traps or something in the grid.  They would get a thrill out of it.How to teach kids what programming is?\nWell, the first step is likely to get some cows involved!\nDownload a simple programming game (like IQ Marathon) onto the laptop and hook that up to a projector.  While you\'re doing this you can talk about how being a programmer often means working with recent technology (and thereby giving a demonstration of you doing so).Once you\'ve got it set up (practice so you can make it work in 5 minutes or less), you can use the game to show very visually (and with cows!) how the computer only does exactly what you tell it to, and how you (the programmer) have to figure out what instructions are necessary to make it do what you want.  When you get it right, everybody is so happy about your success that there are dancing cows!\nFrom there you can answer any questions, or perhaps just let the kids try and figure out how to program cows themselves.  Wherever they want to go, really.Cows!Give each child a cut out shape; circles, squares, triangles, different colors etc.  Explain how programming is giving instructions in specific order.  Hold up a picture of a smiley face and walk the kids through how to construct it.  Yellow circle, black dot, black dot, arc.  Then show a more complicated picture, and have the kids come up in order based on your instructions.  You can even make a mistake (like putting the yellow circle over the black dots) to show how \'Bugs\' creep into a program.  Demonstrate a simple lego mindstorm robot and its corresponding flow chart. You wont have to show then any code and they can see the end result of your logic by watching the lego execute your program.Kids likes things that "do something" and flashing lights.For my sons birthday, I made a safe (box with electric lock and lots of leds) that  was connected with the PC. They had some questions to answer, and each response resulted in flashing leds (green for good answers and red for wrong answers). If they answered enough questions right, the leds started a simple animation which ended with a loud "clonk". The safe was now open and they could collect their rewards.It was fun to build and the kids loved it.Sell them on the value of unattended automation.  Have a kid walk to the front of the room and show the class what he does each night when he\'s brushing his teeth.  Then have that same kid show you what he\'d be doing during that time if he didn\'t have to brush his teeth.Then tell that kid that you know how to move that brush across his teeth while he\'s doing that other thing that he\'d rather be doing, and tell him he\'ll never even feel it.  His teeth will just magically be clean next time his mother goes to inspect them.Then maybe write some pseudocode on the chalk board that shows the Brush API accessing the Tooth resource in a background thread behind the Favorite activity.
