How do I calculate the distance between two points specified by latitude and longitude?For clarification, I\'d like the distance in kilometers; the points use the WGS84 system and I\'d like to understand the relative accuracies of the approaches available.This link might be helpful to you, as it details the use of the Haversine formula to calculate the distance.Excerpt:This script [in Javascript] calculates great-circle distances between the two points \xe2\x80\x93\n  that is, the shortest distance over the earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface \xe2\x80\x93 using the\n  \xe2\x80\x98Haversine\xe2\x80\x99 formula.I needed to calculate a lot of distances between the points for my project, so I went ahead and tried to optimize the code, I have found here. On average in different browsers my new implementation runs 2 times faster than the most upvoted answer.You can play with my jsPerf and see the results here.Recently I needed to do the same in python, so here is a python implementation:And for the sake of completeness: Haversine on wiki.Here is a C# Implementation:Here is a java implementation of the Haversine formula.Note that here we are rounding the answer to the nearest km.Thanks very much for all this. I used the following code in my Objective-C iPhone app:Latitude and Longitude are in decimal. I didn\'t use min() for the asin() call as the distances that I\'m using are so small that they don\'t require it.It gave incorrect answers until I passed in the values in Radians - now it\'s pretty much the same as the values obtained from Apple\'s Map app :-)Extra update:If you are using iOS4 or later then Apple provide some methods to do this so the same functionality would be achieved with:This is a simple PHP function that will give a very reasonable approximation (under +/-1% error margin).  As said before; the earth is NOT a sphere.  It is like an old, old baseball that Mark McGwire decided to practice with - it is full of dents and bumps.  The simpler calculations (like this) treat it like a sphere.Different methods may be more or less precise according to where you are on this irregular ovoid AND how far apart your points are (the closer they are the smaller the absolute error margin).  The more precise your expectation, the more complex the math.For more info: wikipedia geographic distanceI post here my working example.List all points in table having distance between a designated point (we use a random point - lat:45.20327, long:23.7806) less than 50 KM, with latitude & longitude, in MySQL (the table fields are coord_lat and coord_long):List all having DISTANCE<50, in Kilometres (considered Earth radius 6371 KM):The above example was tested in MySQL 5.0.95 and 5.5.16 (Linux). In the other answers an implementation in r is missing.Calculating the distance between two point is quite straightforward with the distm function from the geosphere package:where:As the earth is not perfectly spherical, the Vincenty formula for ellipsoids is probably the best way to calculate distances. Thus in the geosphere package you use then:Off course you don\'t necessarily have to use geosphere package, you can also calculate the distance in base R with a function:You can use the build in CLLocationDistance to calculate this:In your case if you want kilometers just divide by 1000.It rather depends how accurate you want to be and what datum the lat and long are defined on. Very, very approximately you do a little spherical trig, but correcting for the fact that the earth is not a sphere makes the formulae more complicated. The haversine is definitely a good formula for probably most cases, other answers already include it so I am not going to take the space. But it is important to note that no matter what formula is used (yes not just one). Because of the huge range of accuracy possible as well as the computation time required. The choice of formula requires a bit more thought than a simple no brainer answer. This posting from a person at nasa, is the best one I found at discussing the optionshttp://www.cs.nyu.edu/visual/home/proj/tiger/gisfaq.htmlFor example, if you are just sorting rows by distance in a 100 miles radius. The flat earth formula will be much faster than the haversine.Notice there is just one cosine and one square root. Vs 9 of them on the Haversine formula.I don\'t like adding yet another answer, but the Google maps API v.3 has spherical geometry (and more). After converting your WGS84 to decimal degrees you can do this:No word about how accurate Google\'s calculations are or even what model is used (though it does say "spherical" rather than "geoid".  By the way, the "straight line" distance will obviously be different from the distance if one travels on the surface of the earth which is what everyone seems to be presuming.To calculate the distance between two points on a sphere you need to do the Great Circle calculation. There are a number of C/C++ libraries to help with map projection at MapTools if you need to reproject your distances to a flat surface.  To do this you will need the projection string of the various coordinate systems.You may also find MapWindow a useful tool to visualise the points.  Also as its open source its a useful guide to how to use the proj.dll library, which appears to be the core open source projection library.There could be a simpler solution, and more correct: The perimeter of earth is 40,000Km at the equator, about 37,000 on Greenwich (or any longitude) cycle. Thus:I agree that it should be fine-tuned as, I myself said that it\'s an ellipsoid, so the radius to be multiplied by the cosine varies. But it\'s a bit more accurate. Compared with Google Maps and it did reduce the error significantly.This script [in PHP] calculates distances between the two points.I condensed the computation down by simplifying the formula.Here it is in Ruby:Here\'s the accepted answer implementation ported to Java in case anyone needs it.Here is a typescript implementation of the Haversine formulaGot Error- no Method \'toRad\' So modified the above procedure to call toRad method-and added the method-there is a good example in here to calculate distance with PHP http://www.geodatasource.com/developers/php :Here is the implementation VB.NET, this implementation will give you the result in KM or Miles based on an Enum value you pass.Here is my java implementation for calculation distance via decimal degrees after some search. I used mean radius of world (from wikipedia) in km. \xc4\xb0f you want result miles then use world radius in miles.Python implimentation\nOrigin is the center of the contiguous United States.To get the answer in kilometers simply set miles=false.All the above answers assumes the earth is a sphere. However, a more accurate approximation would be that of an oblate spheroid.Here\'s a simple javascript function that may be useful from this link.. somehow related but we\'re using google earth javascript plugin instead of mapsThe units tho are not in distance but in terms of a ratio relative to your coordinates.  There are other computations related you can substitute for the getApproximateDistanceUnits function link hereThen I use this function  to see if a latitude longitude is within the radiuspoint may be defined asthen you can do your thing to see if a point is within a region with a radius say:Chuck\'s solution, valid for miles also.In Mysql use the following function pass the parameters as using  POINT(LONG,LAT)I\'ve created this small Javascript LatLng object, might be useful for somebody.Code:
