I am confused by the usage of brackets, parentheses, curly braces in Bash, as well as the difference between their double or single forms. Is there a clear explanation?In Bash, test and [ are builtins.The double bracket enables additional functionality. For example, you can use && and || instead of -a and -o and there\'s a regular expression matching operator =~.The braces, in addition to delimiting a variable name are used for parameter expansion so you can do things like:Truncate the contents of a variable$ var="abcde"; echo ${var%d*}\nabcMake substitutions similar to sed$ var="abcde"; echo ${var/de/12}\nabc12Use a default value$ default="hello"; unset var; echo ${var:-$default}\nhelloand several moreAlso, brace expansions create lists of strings which are typically iterated over in loops:Note that the leading zero and increment features weren\'t available before Bash 4.Thanks to gboffi for reminding me about brace expansions.Double parentheses are used for arithmetic operations:and they enable you to omit the dollar signs on integer and array variables and include spaces around operators for readability.Single brackets are also used for array indices:Curly brace are required for (most/all?) array references on the right hand side.ephemient\'s comment reminded me that parentheses are also used for subshells. And that they are used to create arrays.A single bracket ([) usually actually calls a program named [; man test or man [ for more info.  Example:The double bracket ([[) does the same thing (basically) as a single bracket, but is a bash builtin.Parentheses (()) are used to create a subshell.  For example:As you can see, the subshell allowed you to perform operations without affecting the environment of the current shell.4a.  Braces ({}) are used to unambiguously identify variables.  Example:4b. Braces are also used to execute a sequence of commands in the current shell context, e.g.There is a subtle syntactic difference with ( ), though (see bash reference) ; essentially, a semicolon ; after the last command within braces is a must, and the braces {, } must be surrounded by spaces.Brackets [1] http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/scripting/obsoleteCurly Braces Parentheses Double Parentheses I just wanted to add these from TLDP:The difference between test, [ and [[ is explained in great details in the BashFAQ.To cut a long story short: test implements the old, portable syntax of\n  the command. In almost all shells (the oldest Bourne shells are the\n  exception), [ is a synonym for test (but requires a final argument of\n  ]). Although all modern shells have built-in implementations of [,\n  there usually still is an external executable of that name, e.g.\n  /bin/[.[[ is a new improved version of it, which is a keyword, not a program.\n  This has beneficial effects on the ease of use, as shown below. [[ is\n  understood by KornShell and BASH (e.g. 2.03), but not by the older\n  POSIX or BourneShell.And the conclusion:When should the new test command [[ be used, and when the old one [?\n  If portability to the BourneShell is a concern, the old syntax should\n  be used. If on the other hand the script requires BASH or KornShell,\n  the new syntax is much more flexible.\nParentheses () are being used in function definition:That is the reason you have to escape parentheses even in command parameters:
