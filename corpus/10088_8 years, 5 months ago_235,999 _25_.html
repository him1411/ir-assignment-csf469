I\'m trying to convert an ArrayList containing Integer objects to primitive int[] with the following piece of code, but it is throwing compile time error. Is it possible to convert in Java?You can convert, but I don\'t think there\'s anything built in to do it automatically:(Note that this will throw a NullPointerException if either integers or any element within it is null.)EDIT: As per comments, you may want to use the list iterator to avoid nasty costs with lists such as LinkedList:If you are using java-8 there\'s also another way to do this.What it does is:You could also explicitly call intValue via a method reference, i.e:It\'s also worth mentioning that you could get a NullPointerException if you have any null reference in the list. This could be easily avoided by adding a filtering condition to the stream pipeline like this:Example:Apache Commons has a ArrayUtils class, which has a method toPrimitive() that does exactly this.However, as Jon showed, it is pretty easy to do this by yourself instead of using external libraries.Google Guava provides a neat way to do this by calling Ints.toArray.I believe iterating using the List\'s iterator is a better idea, as list.get(i) can have poor performance depending on the List implementation:using Dollar should be quite simple:I\'m planning to improve the DSL in order to remove the intermediate toArray() callIf you\'re using Eclipse Collections, you can use the collectInt() method to switch from an object container to a primitive int container.If you can convert your ArrayList to a FastList, you can get rid of the adapter.Note: I am a committer for Eclipse collections.This code segment is working  for me, try thisInteger[] arr = x.toArray(new Integer[x.size()]);It bewilders me that we encourage one-off custom methods whenever a perfectly good, well used library like Apache Commons has solved the problem already.  Though the solution is trivial if not absurd, it is irresponsible to encourage such a behavior due to long term maintenance and accessibility.Just go with Apache CommonsYou can simply copy it to an array:Not too fancy; but, hey, it works...access arr like normal int[].
