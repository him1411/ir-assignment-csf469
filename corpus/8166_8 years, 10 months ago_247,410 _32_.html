I am using the jQuery validation plugin. Great stuff! I want to migrate my existing ASP.NET solution to use jQuery instead of the ASP.NET validators. I am missing a replacement for the regular expression validator. I want to be able to do something like this:How do I add a custom rule to achieve this?Thanks to the answer of redsquare I added a method like this:now all you need to do to validate against any regex is this:Additionally, it looks like there is a file called additional-methods.js that contains the method "pattern", which can be a RegExp when created using the method without quotes.http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/http://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.validate/1.9/additional-methods.jsYou can use the addMethod()e.g good article here https://web.archive.org/web/20130609222116/http://www.randallmorey.com/blog/2008/mar/16/extending-jquery-form-validation-plugin/I had some trouble putting together all the pieces for doing a jQuery regular expression validator, but I got it to work... Here is a complete working example. It uses the \'Validation\' plugin which can be found in jQuery Validation PluginAs mentioned on the addMethod documentation:Please note: While the temptation is great to add a regex method that checks it\'s parameter against the value, it is much cleaner to encapsulate those regular expressions inside their own method. If you need lots of slightly different expressions, try to extract a common parameter. A library of regular expressions: http://regexlib.com/DisplayPatterns.aspxSo yes, you have to add a method for each regular expression. The overhead is minimal, while it allows you to give the regex a name (not to be underestimated), a default message (handy) and the ability to reuse it a various places, without duplicating the regex itself over and over.No reason to define the regex as a string.andtis better this way, no?Extending PeterTheNiceGuy\'s answer a bit:This would allow you to pass a regex object to the rule.Resetting the lastIndex property is necessary when the g-flag is set on the RegExp object. Otherwise it would start validating from the position of the last match with that regex, even if the subject string is different.Some other ideas I had was be to enable you use arrays of regex\'s, and another rule for the negation of regex\'s:But implementing those would maybe be too much.I got it to work like this:Make sure that the regex is between / :-)This is working code.we mainly use the markup notation of jquery validation plugin and the posted samples did not work for us, when flags are present in the regex, e.g.therefore we use the following snippetOf course now one could combine this code, with one of the above to also allow passing RegExp objects into the plugin, but since we didn\'t needed it we left this exercise for the reader ;-).PS: there is also bundled plugin for that, https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/blob/master/src/additional/pattern.jsThis worked for me, being one of the validation rules:Hope it helps
