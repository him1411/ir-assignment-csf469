How can I pass an object of a custom type from one Activity to another using the putExtra() method of the class Intent?If you\'re just passing objects around then Parcelable was designed for this. It requires a little more effort to use than using Java\'s native serialization, but it\'s way faster (and I mean way, WAY faster).From the docs, a simple example for how to implement is:Observe that in the case you have more than one field to retrieve from a given Parcel, you must do this in the same order you put them in (that is, in a FIFO approach).Once you have your objects implement Parcelable it\'s just a matter of putting them into your Intents with putExtra():Then you can pull them back out with getParcelableExtra():If your Object Class implements Parcelable and Serializable then make sure you do cast to one of the following:You\'ll need to serialize your object into some kind of string representation. One possible string representation is JSON, and one of the easiest ways to serialize to/from JSON in android, if you ask me, is through Google GSON.In that case you juse put the string return value from (new Gson()).toJson(myObject); and retrieve the string value and use fromJson to turn it back into your object.If your object isn\'t very complex, however, it might not be worth the overhead, and you could consider passing the separate values of the object instead.You can send serializable object through intentFor situations where you know you will be passing data within an application, use "globals" (like static Classes)Here is what Dianne Hackborn (hackbod - a Google Android Software Engineer) had to say on the matter:For situations where you know the activities are running in the same\n  process, you can just share data through globals.  For example, you\n  could have a global HashMap<String, WeakReference<MyInterpreterState>>\n  and when you make a new MyInterpreterState come up with a unique name\n  for it and put it in the hash map; to send that state to another\n  activity, simply put the unique name into the hash map and when the\n  second activity is started it can retrieve the MyInterpreterState from\n  the hash map with the name it receives.Your class should implements Serializable or Parcelable.Once done you can send an object on putExtraTo get extras you only have to doIf your class implements Parcelable use nextI hope it helps :Dif your object class implements Serializable, you don\'t need to do anything else, you can pass a serializable object.  that\'s what i use.You can use android BUNDLE to do this.Create a Bundle from your class like:Then pass this bundle with INTENT.\nNow you can recreate your class object by passing bundle likeDeclare this in your Custom class and use.There are couple of ways by which you can  access variables or object in other classes or Activity.A. Database B. shared preferences.C. Object serialization.D. A class which can hold common data can be named as Common Utilities it depends on you.E. Passing data through Intents and Parcelable Interface.It depend upon your project needs.A. DatabaseSQLite is an Open Source Database which is embedded into Android. SQLite supports standard relational database features like SQL syntax, transactions and prepared statements. Tutorials -- http://www.vogella.com/articles/AndroidSQLite/article.htmlB. Shared PreferencesSuppose you want to store username. So there will be now two thing a Key Username, Value Value.How to storeUsing putString(),putBoolean(),putInt(),putFloat(),putLong() you can save your desired dtatype.How to fetchhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/SharedPreferences.htmlC. Object SerializationObject serlization is used if we want to save an object state to send it over network or you can use it for your purpose also.Use java beans and store in it as one of his fields and use getters and setter for thatJavaBeans are Java classes that have properties. Think of\nproperties as private instance variables. Since they\'re private, the only way\nthey can be accessed from outside of their class is through methods in the class. The\nmethods that change a property\'s value are called setter methods, and the methods\nthat retrieve a property\'s value are called getter methods. Set the variable in you mail method by usingThen use object Serialzation to serialize this object and in your other class deserialize this object.In serialization an object can be represented as a sequence of bytes that includes the object\'s data as well as information about the object\'s type and the types of data stored in the object.After a serialized object has been written into a file, it can be read from the file and deserialized that is, the type information and bytes that represent the object and its data can be used to recreate the object in memory.If you want tutorial for this refer this linkhttp://javawithswaranga.blogspot.in/2011/08/serialization-in-java.htmlGet variable in other classesD. CommonUtilitiesYou can make a class by your self which can contain common data which you frequently need in your project.SampleE. Passing Data through IntentsPlease refer this tutorial for this option of passing data.http://shri.blog.kraya.co.uk/2010/04/26/android-parcel-data-to-pass-between-activities-using-parcelable-classes/Thanks for parcelable help but i found one more optional solution In Activity OneGet Data In Activity 2implement serializable in your classThen you can pass this object in intentint the second activity you can get data like thisBut when the data become large,this method will be slow.I struggled with the same problem. I solved it by using a static class, storing any data I want in a HashMap. On top I use an extension of the standard Activity class where I have overriden the methods onCreate an onDestroy to do the data transport and data clearing hidden. Some ridiculous settings have to be changed e.g. orientation-handling.Annotation:\nNot providing general objects to be passed to another Activity is pain in the ass. It\'s like shooting oneself in the knee and hoping to win a 100 metres. "Parcable" is not a sufficient substitute. It makes me laugh... I don\'t want to implement this interface to my technology-free API, as less I want to introduce a new Layer... How could it be, that we are in mobile programming so far away from modern paradigm...In your first Activity:And in your second one:Don\'t forget to make your custom object Serializable: Another way to do this is to use the Application object (android.app.Application). You define this in you AndroidManifest.xml file as:You can then call this from any activity and save the object to the Application class.In the FirstActivity:In the SecondActivity, do :This is handy if you have objects that have application level scope i.e. they have to be used throughout the application. The Parcelable method is still better if you want explicit control over the object scope or if the scope is limited.This avoid the use of Intents altogether, though. I don\'t know if they suits you. Another way I used this is to have int identifiers of objects send through intents and retrieve objects that I have in Maps in the Application object.Passing the data:Retrieving the data:I use Gson with its so powerful and simple api to send objects between activities,Example2 functions you add them to the objects that you want to sendUsageSend Object From A to BReceive In BI use it almost in every project i do and I have no performance issues.in your class model (Object) implement Serializable, for\nExample:and your first Activity and your second Activity (NewActivity)good luck!!you can use putExtra(Serializable..) and getSerializableExtra() methods to pass and retrieve objects of your class type; you will have to mark your class Serializable and make sure that all your member variables are serializable too...

Notice that the class is implementing Serializable interface.Person.javaTwo Layouts for Two Activitiesactivity_main.xmlactivity_another.xmlTwo Activity Classes1)ActivityMain.java2)AnotherActivity.javaIf you have a singleton class (fx Service) acting as gateway to your model layer anyway, it can be solved by having a variable in that class with getters and setters for it.In Activity 1:In Activity 2:In Service:This solution does not require any serialization or other "packaging" of the object in question. But it will only be beneficial if you are using this kind of architecture anyway. By far the easiest way IMHO to parcel objects.  You just add an annotation tag above the object you wish to make parcelable.An example from the library is below https://github.com/johncarl81/parcelerI know this is late but it is very simple.All you have do is let your class implement Serializable likethen you can pass to an intent likeTo get it you simpley call Using google\'s Gson library you can pass object to another activities.Actually we will convert object in the form of json string and after passing to other activity we will again re-convert to object like thisConsider a bean class like thisWe need to pass object of Example classFor reading we need to do the reverse operation in NextActivityAdd this dependancy in gradleFirst implement  Parcelable in your class. Then pass object like this.SendActivity.javaReceiveActivity.javaThe package string isn\'t necessary, just the string needs to be the same in both Activities REFERENCEShort answer for fast need 1. Implement your Class to implements  Serializable. If you have any inner Classes    don\'t forget to implement that class to Serializable too!!2. Put your object to Intent 3. And receive take your object in the other Activity Classthe most easiest solution i found is..\nto create a class with static data members with getters setters.set from one activity and get from another activity that object.activity Aactivity bThe simplest would be to just use the following where the item is a string:For receiving:If you are not very particular about using the putExtra feature and just want to launch another activity with objects, you can check out the GNLauncher (https://github.com/noxiouswinter/gnlib_android/wiki#gnlauncher) library I wrote in an attempt to make this process more straight forward.GNLauncher makes sending objects/data to an Activity from another Activity etc as easy as calling a function in the Activity with the required data as parameters. It introduces type safety and removes all the hassles of having to serialize, attaching to the intent using string keys and undoing the same at the other end.Start another activity from this activity pass parameters via Bundle ObjectRetrieve on another activity (YourActivity)This is ok for simple kind data type.\nBut if u want to pass complex data in between activity u need to serialize it first.Here we have Employee ModelYou can use Gson lib provided by google to serialize the complex data \nlike thisPOJO class "Post" (Note that it is implemented Serializable)POJO class "Comment"(Since being a member of Post class,it is also needed to implement the Serializable)Then in your activity class, you can do as following to pass the object to another activity.In your recipient class "CommentsActivity" you can get the data as the following
