Particularly, where can I browse the source code for any android source application(e.g.the contact application) ? Is the only way to go to download all there is?Everything is mirrored on omapzoom.org. Some of the code is also mirrored on github.Contacts is here for example.Android official source browser (based on Gitiles) has a web view of many of the different parts that make up android. Some of the projects (such as Kernel) have been removed and it now only points you to clonable git repositories.To get all the code locally, you can use the repo helper program, or you can just clone individual repositories.And others:I usually refer this site for the android source code.http://grepcode.com/project/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/Just want to provide more options :-)You can view the source code through http://developer.android.com, when you\'re reading the API there will be a link to the matching source code on GitHub, you just need to add the Android SDK Reference Search Plugin on Chrome.I blogged about it here:\nhttp://blog.blundellapps.com/add-source-code-links-to-android-apis/I stumbled across Android XRef the other day and found it useful, especially since it is backed by OpenGrok which offers insanely awesome and blindingly fast search.I\'ve found a way to get only the Contacts application:which is good enough for me for now, but doesn\'t answer the question of browsing the code on the web.You can browse Android SDK samples from your smartphone using "Code Search":\nhttps://market.android.com/details?id=sqwady.codesearchThis eclipse plugin allows for inline source viewing and even stepping inside the Android source code:http://code.google.com/p/adt-addons/(edit: specifically the "Android Sources" plugin: http://adt-addons.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/source/com.android.ide.eclipse.source.update/)gitweb will allow you to browse through the code (and changes) via a browser.http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/Gitweb(Don\'t know if someone has already setup a public gitweb for Android, but it\'s probably not too hard.)
