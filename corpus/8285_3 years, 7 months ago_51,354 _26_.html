I\'m getting this error when I try to upload using paperclip with my rails blogging app.\nNot sure what it is referring to when it says "MissingRequiredValidatorError"\nI thought that by updating post_params and giving it :image it would be fine, as both create and update use post_paramsThis is my posts_controller.rb      and this is my posts helper Please let me know if I can supplement extra material to help you help me.Starting with Paperclip version 4.0,  all attachments are required to include a content_type validation, a file_name validation, or to explicitly state that they\'re not going to have either. Paperclip raises Paperclip::Errors::MissingRequiredValidatorError error if you do not do any of this.In your case, you can add any of the following line to your Post model, after specifying has_attached_file :image-OR- another way-OR- yet another wayis to use regex for validating content type. For example: To validate all image formats, regex expression can be specified as shown in@LucasCaton\'s answerIf for some crazy reason (can be valid but I cannot think of one right now), you do not wish to add any content_type validation and allow people to spoof Content-Types and receive data you weren\'t expecting onto your server then add the following:Note: Specify the MIME types as per your requirement within content_type/ matches options above. I have just given a few image MIME types for you to start with.Reference:Refer to Paperclip: Security Validations, if you still need to verify. :)You might also have to deal with the spoofing validation explained here https://stackoverflow.com/a/23846121Just put in your model:https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclipNeed to add validates_attachment_content_type in ModelRails 3Rails 4Make sure your post model looks like this...I couldn\'t get any of these solutions to work either. I tried Paperclip 3.1, but couldn\'t then my app kept telling me my image file extensions weren\'t approved, even though they were jpg.I finally found success with version 3.5.1.
