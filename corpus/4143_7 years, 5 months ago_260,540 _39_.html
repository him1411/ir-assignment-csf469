I am using a PreferenceActivity to show some settings for my application. I am inflating the settings via a xml file so that my onCreate (and complete class methods) looks like this: The javadoc of PreferenceActivity PreferenceFragment states that These preferences will automatically save to SharedPreferences as the user interacts with them. To retrieve an instance of SharedPreferences that the preference hierarchy in this activity will use, call getDefaultSharedPreferences(android.content.Context) with a context in the same package as this activity.But how I get the name of the SharedPreference in another Activity? I can only call in the other activity but I need the name of the SharedPreference which was used by the PreferenceActivity. What is the name or how can i retrieve it?UpdateAccording to Shared Preferences | Android Developer Tutorial (Part 13) by Sai Geetha M N,Many applications may provide a way to capture user preferences on the\n  settings of a specific application or an activity. For supporting\n  this, Android provides a simple set of APIs. Preferences are typically name value pairs. They can be stored as\n  \xe2\x80\x9cShared Preferences\xe2\x80\x9d across various activities in an application (note\n  currently it cannot be shared across processes). Or it can be\n  something that needs to be stored specific to an activity.Shared Preferences: The shared preferences can be used by all the components (activities, services etc) of the applications.Activity handled preferences: These preferences can only be used within the particular activity and can not be used by other components of the application.Shared Preferences:The shared preferences are managed with the help of getSharedPreferences method of the Context class. The preferences are stored in a default file (1) or you can specify a file name (2) to be used to refer to the preferences.(1) The recommended way is to use by the default mode, without specifying the file name(2) Here is how you get the instance when you specify the file nameMODE_PRIVATE is the operating mode for the preferences. It is the default mode and means the created file will be accessed by only the calling application.  Other two modes supported are MODE_WORLD_READABLE and MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLE. In MODE_WORLD_READABLE other application can read the created file but can not modify it. In case of MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLE other applications also have write permissions for the created file.Finally, once you have the preferences instance, here is how you can retrieve the stored values from the preferences:To store values in the preference file SharedPreference.Editor object has to be used. Editor is a nested interface in the SharedPreference class.Editor also supports methods like remove() and clear() to delete the preference values from the file.Activity Preferences:The shared preferences can be used by other application components. But if you do not need to share the preferences with other components and want to have activity private preferences you can do that with the help of getPreferences() method of the activity. The getPreference method uses the getSharedPreferences() method with the name of the activity class for the preference file name.Following is the code to get preferencesThe code to store values is also the same as in case of shared preferences.You can also use other methods like storing the activity state in database. Note Android  also contains a package called android.preference. The package defines classes to implement application preferences UI.To see some more examples check Android\'s Data Storage post on developers site.If you don\'t have access to getDefaultSharedPreferenes(), you can use getSharedPreferences(name, mode) instead, you just have to pass in the right name.Android creates this name (possibly based on the package name of your project?).  You can get it by putting the following code in a SettingsActivity onCreate(), and seeing what preferencesName is.The string should be something like com.example.projectname_preferences.  Hard code that somewhere in your project, and pass it in to getSharedPreferences() and you should be good to go.Declare these methods first..Then call this when you want to put a pref:call this when you want to get a pref:Or  you can use this object https://github.com/kcochibili/TinyDB--Android-Shared-Preferences-Turbo \nwhich simplifies everything even furtherExample:having to pass context around everywhere is really annoying me. the code becomes too verbose and unmanageable. I do this in every project instead...and set it in the main activity create also all preference keys should be language independent, I\'m shocked nobody has mentioned that.now call it very simply like this in one line of codeif you have a checkbox and you would like to fetch it\'s value ie true / false in any java file--Use--
