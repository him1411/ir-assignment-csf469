When I print a numpy array, I get a truncated representation, but I want the full array. Is there any way to do this?Examples:To clarify on Reed\'s replyNote that the reply as given above works with an initial \'from numpy import *\', which is not advisable. \nThis also works for meFor full documentation, see http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.set_printoptions.html. I suggest using np.inf instead of np.nan which is suggested by others. They both work for your purpose, but by setting the threshold to "infinity" it is obvious to everybody reading your code what you mean. Having a threshold of "not a number" seems a little vague to me.This sounds like you\'re using numpy.If that\'s the case, you can add:That will disable the corner printing.  For more information, see this NumPy Tutorial.Here is a one-off way to do this, which is useful if you don\'t want to change your default settings:The previous answers are the correct ones, but as a weeker alternative you can transform into a list:Using a context manager as Paul Price sugggestednumpy.savetxt is a good option for a one time usage:or if you need a string:Default output format is:and it can be configured with further arguments.Tested on Python 2.7.12, numpy 1.11.1.For these who like to import as np:Will also work This is a slight modification (removed the option to pass additional arguments to set_printoptions)of neoks answer. It shows how you can use contextlib.contextmanager to easily create such a contextmanager with fewer lines of code:In your code it can be used like this:If an array is too large to be printed, NumPy automatically skips the central part of the array and only prints the corners:\nTo disable this behaviour and force NumPy to print the entire array, you can change the printing options using set_printoptions.you can also reffer  numpy documentation numpy documentation for "or part" for more helpits just like python\'s range, use np.range(10001)\nwelcome!!
