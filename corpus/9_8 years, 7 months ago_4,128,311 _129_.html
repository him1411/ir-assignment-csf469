How can I redirect the user from one page to another using jQuery or pure JavaScript?jQuery is not necessary, and window.location.replace(...) will best simulate an HTTP redirect.  window.location.replace(...) is better than using window.location.href, because replace() does not keep the originating page in the session history, meaning the user won\'t get stuck in a never-ending back-button fiasco.If you want to simulate someone clicking on a link, use\n  location.hrefIf you want to simulate an HTTP redirect, use location.replaceFor example:WARNING: This answer has merely been provided as a possible solution; it is obviously not the best solution, as it requires jQuery. Instead, prefer the pure JavaScript solution.Standard "vanilla" JavaScript way to redirect a page:window.location.href = \'newPage.html\';If you are here because you are losing HTTP_REFERER when redirecting, keep reading:The following section is for those using HTTP_REFERER as one of many secure measures (although it isn\'t a great protective measure). If you\'re using Internet Explorer 8 or lower, these variables get lost when using any form of JavaScript page redirection (location.href,  etc.).Below we are going to implement an alternative for IE8 & lower so that we don\'t lose HTTP_REFERER. Otherwise you can almost always simply use window.location.href.Testing against HTTP_REFERER (URL pasting, session, etc.) can be helpful in telling whether a request is legitimate.\n(Note: there are also ways to work-around / spoof these referrers, as noted by droop\'s link in the comments)Simple cross-browser testing solution (fallback to window.location.href for Internet Explorer 9+ and all other browsers)Usage: redirect(\'anotherpage.aspx\');Use:This works for every browser:It would help if you were a little more descriptive in what you are trying to do.  If you are trying to generate paged data, there are some options in how you do this.  You can generate separate links for each page that you want to be able to get directly to.Note that the current page in the example is handled differently in the code and with CSS.If you want the paged data to be changed via AJAX, this is where jQuery would come in.  What you would do is add a click handler to each of the anchor tags corresponding to a different page.  This click handler would invoke some jQuery code that goes and fetches the next page via AJAX and updates the table with the new data.  The example below assumes that you have a web service that returns the new page data.I also think that location.replace(URL) is the best way, but if you want to notify the search engines about your redirection (they don\'t analyze JavaScript code to see the redirection) you should add the rel="canonical" meta tag to your website.Adding a noscript section with a HTML refresh meta tag in it, is also a good solution. I suggest you to use this JavaScript redirection tool to create redirections. It also has Internet Explorer support to pass the HTTP referrer.Sample code without delay looks like this:But if someone wants to redirect back to home page then he may use the following snippet.It would be helpful if you have three different environments as development, staging, and production.You can explore this window or window.location object by just putting these words in Chrome Console or Firebug\'s Console.JavaScript provides you many methods to retrieve and change the current URL which is displayed in browser\'s address bar. All these methods uses the Location object, which is  a property of the Window object. You can create a new Location object that has the current URL as follows..Basic Structure of a URLProtocol -- Specifies the protocol name be used to access the resource on the Internet. (HTTP (without SSL) or HTTPS (with SSL))hostname -- Host name specifies the host that owns the resource. For example, www.stackoverflow.com. A server provides services using the name of the host.port -- A port number used to recognize a specific process to which an Internet or other network message is to be forwarded when it arrives at a server.pathname -- The path gives info about the specific resource within the host that the Web client wants to access. For example, stackoverflow.com/index.html.query --  A query string follows the path component, and provides a string of information that the resource can utilize for some purpose (for example, as parameters for a search or as data to be processed). hash -- The anchor portion of a URL, includes the hash sign (#).With these Location object properties you can access all of these URL componentsNow If you want to change a page or redirect the user to some other page you can use the href property of the Location object like thisYou can use the href property of the Location object.Demo FiddleLocation Object also have these three methodsYou can use assign() and replace methods also to redirect to other pages like theseHow assign() and replace() differs -- The difference between replace() method and assign() method(), is that replace() removes the URL of the current document from the document history, means it is not possible to use the "back" button to navigate back to the original document. So Use the assign() method if you want to load a new document, andwant to give the option to navigate back to the original document.You can change the location object href property using jQuery also  like thisAnd hence you can redirect the user to some other url.Should just be able to set using window.location.Example:window.location = "http://www.stackoverflow.com";Here is a past post on the subject: How to redirect to another webpage in JavaScript/jQuery?Before I start, jQuery is a JavaScript library used for DOM manipulation. So you should not be using jQuery for a page redirect.A quote from Jquery.com:While jQuery might run without major issues in older browser versions,\n  we do not actively test jQuery in them and generally do not fix bugs\n  that may appear in them.It was found here:\nhttps://jquery.com/browser-support/So jQuery is not an end-all and be-all solution for backwards compatibility.The following solution using raw JavaScript works in all browsers and have been standard for a long time so you don\'t need any libraries for cross browser support.This page will redirect to Google after 3000 millisecondsDifferent options are as follows:When using replace, the back button will not go back to the redirect page, as if it was never in the history. If you want the user to be able to go back to the redirect page then use window.location.href or window.location.assign. If you do use an option that lets the user go back to the redirect page, remember that when you enter the redirect page it will redirect you back. So put that into consideration when picking an option for your redirect. Under conditions where the page is only redirecting when an action is done by the user then having the page in the back button history will be okay. But if the page auto redirects then you should use replace so that the user can use the back button without getting forced back to the page the redirect sends.You can also use meta data to run a page redirect as followed.META RefreshMETA LocationBASE HijackingMany more methods to redirect your unsuspecting client to a page they may not wish to go can be found on this page (not one of them is reliant on jQuery):https://code.google.com/p/html5security/wiki/RedirectionMethodsI would also like to point out, people don\'t like to be randomly redirected. Only redirect people when absolutely needed. If you start redirecting people randomly they will never go to your site again.The next part is hypothetical:You also may get reported as a malicious site. If that happens then when people click on a link to your site the users browser may warn them that your site is malicious. What may also happen is search engines may start dropping your rating if people are reporting a bad experience on your site.Please review Google Webmaster Guidelines about redirects:\nhttps://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2721217?hl=en&ref_topic=6001971Here is a fun little page that kicks you out of the page.If you combine the two page examples together you would have an infant loop of rerouting that will guarantee that your user will never want to use your site ever again.You can do that without jQuery as:And if you want only jQuery then you can do it like:This works with jQuery:# HTML Page Redirect Using jQuery/JavaScriptTry this example code:If you want to give a complete URL as window.location = "www.google.co.in";.So, the question is how to make a redirect page, and not how to redirect to a website?You only need to use JavaScript for this. Here is some tiny code that will create a dynamic redirect page.So say you just put this snippet into a redirect/index.html file on your website you can use it like so.http://www.mywebsite.com/redirect?url=http://stackoverflow.comAnd if you go to that link it will automatically redirect you to stackoverflow.com.Link to DocumentationAnd that\'s how you make a Simple redirect page with JavaScriptEdit:There is also one thing to note. I have added window.location.replace in my code because I think it suits a redirect page, but, you must know that when using window.location.replace and you get redirected, when you press the back button in your browser it will not got back to the redirect page, and it will go back to the page before it, take a look at this little demo thing.Example:The process: store home => redirect page to google => googleWhen at google: google => back button in browser => store homeSo, if this suits your needs then everything should be fine. If you want to include the redirect page in the browser history replace this with On your click function, just add:Try this:Code snippet of example.jQuery is not needed. You can do this:It is that easy!The best way to initiate an HTTP request is with document.loacation.href.replace(\'URL\').First write properly. You want to navigate within an application for another link from your application for another link. Here is the code:And if you want to navigate pages within your application then I also have code, if you want.You can redirect in jQuery like this:You need to put this line in your codeIf u are not having the Jquery, go with javascript withTo just redirect to a page:Or if you need a delay:jQuery allows you to select elements from a web page with ease. You can find anything you want in a page and then use jQuery to add special effects, react to user actions, or show and hide content inside or outside the element you have selected. All these tasks start with knowing how to select an element.Imagine someone wrote a script/plugin that is 10000 lines of code?!\nWell, with jQuery you can connect to this code with just a line or two.Basically jQuery is a JavaScript library and for doing some of the things like this, you can use pure javascript, so in that case you have 3 options using vanilla javascript:1) Using location replace, this will replace the current history of the page, means that it is not possible to use the back button to go back to the original page.2) Using location assign, this will keep the history for you and with using back button, you can go back to the original page:3) I recommend using one of those previous ways, but this could be the third option using pure javascript: You can also write a function in jQuery to handle it, but not recommended as it\'s only one line pure javascript function, also you can use all of above functions without window if you are already in the window scope, for example window.location.replace("http://stackoverflow.com"); could be location.replace("http://stackoverflow.com");Also I show them all on the image below:In JavaScript and jQuery we can use the following code to redirect the one page to another page:Please don\'t kill me, this is a joke. It\'s a joke. This is a joke.This did "provide an answer to the question", in the sense that it asked for a solution "using jQuery" which in this case entails forcing it into the equation somehow.Ferrybig apparently needs the joke explained (still joking, I\'m sure there are limited options on the review form), so without further ado:Other answers are using jQuery\'s attr() on the location or window objects unnecessarily.This answer also abuses it, but in a more ridiculous way. Instead of using it to set the location, this uses attr() to retrieve a function that sets the location.The function is named jQueryCode even though there\'s nothing jQuery about it, and calling a function somethingCode is just horrible, especially when the something is not even a language.The "85 bytes" is a reference to Code Golf. Golfing is obviously not something you should do outside of code golf, and furthermore this answer is clearly not actually golfed.Basically, cringe.Here is a time-delay redirection. You can set the delay time to whatever you want:I just had to update this ridiculousness with yet another newer jQuery method:Javascript:Jquery:There are three main ways to do this,and...The last one is best, for a traditional redirect, because it will not save the page you went to before being redirected in your search history. However, if you just want to open a tab with JavaScript, you can use any of the above.1EDIT: The window prefix is optional.
