What is the easiest way to convert a List to a Set in Java?I agree with sepp2k, but there are some other details that might matter:will give you an unsorted set which doesn\'t have duplicates. In this case, duplication is identified using the .equals() method on your objects. This is done in combination with the .hashCode() method. (For more on equality look here)An alternative that gives a sorted set is:This works if Foo implements Comparable. If it doesn\'t then you may want to use a comparator:This depends on either compareTo() (from the comparable interface) or compare() (from the comparator) to ensure uniqueness. So, if you just care about uniqueness, use the HashSet. If you\'re after sorting, then consider the TreeSet. (Remember: Optimize later!) If time efficiency matters use a HashSet if space efficiency matters, look at TreeSet. Note that more efficient implementations of Set and Map are available through Trove (and other locations).If you use the Guava library:or, better:Using java 8 you can use stream:or complete exampleI would perform a Null check before converting to set. You can convert List<> to Set<>For Java 8 it\'s very easy:There are various ways to get a Set as:When we use Collectors.toSet() it returns a set and as per the doc:There are no guarantees on the type, mutability, serializability, or thread-safety of the Set returned. If we want to get a HashSet then we can use the other alternative to get a set (check set3).            Let\'s not forget our relatively new friend, java-8 stream API.\nIf you need to preprocess list before converting it to a set, it\'s better to have something like:
