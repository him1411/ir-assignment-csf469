In this particular case, what options do I have to make these inputs call a function when I press Enter?Angular supports this out of the box. Have you tried ngSubmit on your form element?EDIT: Per the comment regarding the submit button, see Submitting a form by pressing enter without a submit button which gives the solution of:If you don\'t like the hidden submit button solution, you\'ll need to bind a controller function to the Enter keypress or keyup event.  This normally requires a custom directive, but the AngularUI library has a nice keypress solution set up already.  See http://angular-ui.github.com/ After adding the angularUI lib, your code would be something like: or you can bind the enter keypress to each individual field.Also, see this SO questions for creating a simple keypres directive:\nHow can I detect onKeyUp in AngularJS?EDIT (2014-08-28): At the time this answer was written, ng-keypress/ng-keyup/ng-keydown did not exist as native directives in AngularJS.  In the comments below @darlan-alves has a pretty good solution with: <input ng-keyup="$event.keyCode == 13 && myFunc()"... />If you want to call function without form you can use my ngEnter directive:Javascript:HTML: I submit others awesome directives on my twitter and my gist account.If you only have one input you can use the form tag.If you have more than one input, or don\'t want to use the form tag, or want to attach the enter-key functionality to a specific field, you can inline it to a specific input as follows:I wanted something a little more extensible/semantic than the given answers so I wrote a directive that takes a javascript object in a similar way to the built-in ngClass:The values of the object are evaluated in the context of the directive\'s scope - ensure they are encased in single quotes otherwise all of the functions will be executed when the directive is loaded(!)So for example:\nesc : \'clear()\' instead of esc : clear()Very good, clean  and simple directive with shift + enter support:Another approach would be using ng-keypress , Submit an input on pressing Enter with AngularJS - jsfiddleIf you want data validation tooThe important addition here is $loginForm.$valid which will validate the form before executing function.  You will have to add other attributes for validation which is beyond the scope of this question.Good Luck.Just wanted to point out that in the case of having a hidden submit button, you can just use the ngShow directive and set it to false like so:HTMLUse ng-submit and just wrap both inputs in separate form tags:Wrapping each input field in its own form tag allows ENTER to invoke submit on either form. If you use one form tag for both, you will have to include a submit button.Will be slightly neater using a CSS class instead of repeating inline styles.CSSHTMLFWIW - Here\'s a directive I\'ve used for a basic confirm/alert bootstrap modal, without the need for a <form>(just switch out the jQuery click action for whatever you like, and add data-easy-dismiss to your modal tag)
