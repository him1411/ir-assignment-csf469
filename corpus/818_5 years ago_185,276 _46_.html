In Windows 7, you could go into a programs compatibility settings and check off to always run as an Administrator. Is there a similar option in Windows 8? I\'ve always disabled UAC on my machines, and did the same after my Windows 8 upgrade, or so I thought. It turns out there is no off option, only turning off the notifications. This means nothing is run as an Administrator despite being in the Administrator group. I need to keep closing and reopening my consoles\\Visual Studio when I try to debug (attach to process, not F5), which is very frustrating. It\'s really annoying that I need to either remember to take extra steps to open it as an Administrator or tell it to close and re-open when I go to debug for the first time.In Windows 8 & 10, you have to right-click devenv.exe and select "Troubleshoot compatibility".  If, when you open Visual Studio it asks to save changes to devenv.sln, see this answer to disable it:Disable Visual Studio devenv solution save dialogAfter looking on Super User I found this question which explains how to do this with the shortcut on the start screen. Similarly you can do the same when Visual Studio is pinned to the task bar. In either location: Unlike in Windows 7 this only works if you launch the application from the shortcut you changed. After updating both Visual Studio shortcuts it seems to also work when you open a solution file from Explorer.Update Warning:\nIt looks like one of the major flaws in running Visual Studio with elevated permissions is since Explorer isn\'t running with them as well you can\'t drag and drop files into Visual Studio for editing. You need to open them through the file open dialog. Nor can you double click any file associated to Visual Studio and have it open in Visual Studio (aside from solutions it seems) because you\'ll get an error message saying There was a problem sending the command to the program. Once I uncheck to always start with elevated permissions (using VSCommands) then I\'m able to open files directly and drop them into an open instance of Visual Studio.Update For The Daring:\nDespite there being no UI to turn off UAC like in the past, that I saw at least, you can still do so through the registry. The key to edit is:After changing this Windows will prompt you to restart. Once restarted you\'ll be back to everything running with admin permissions if you\'re an admin. The issues I reported above are now gone as well.You can also download VSCommands for VS2012 by Squared Infinity which has a feature to change it to run as admin (as well as some other cool bits and pieces)UpdateOne can install the commands from the Visual Studio menu bar using Tools->Extensions and Updates selecting Online and searching for vscommands where then one selects VSCommands for Visual Studio 20XX depending on whether using 2012 or 2013 (or greater going forward) and download and install.VSCommands didn\'t work for me and caused a problem when I installed Visual Studio 2010 aside of Visual Studio 2012.After some experimentations I found the trick:Go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\AppCompatFlags\\Layers and add an entry with the name "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\MSEnv\\VSLauncher.exe" and the value "RUNASADMIN". This should solve your issue. I\'ve also blogged about that.This is a copy of my answer to a similar post on SuperUser:To have Visual Studio always run as admin when opening any .sln file:To have Visual Studio always run as an admin when just opening visual studio directly, do the same thing to the DevEnv.exe file(s).  These file are located at:C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\\Common7\\IDE\\devenv.exeC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\\Common7\\IDE\\devenv.exeC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\\Common7\\IDE\\devenv.exeC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\\Common7\\IDE\\devenv.exeC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\[VS SKU]\\Common7\\IDE\\devenv.exeInstall the free VSCommands extension for Visual Studio (it\'s in the Visual Studio Extensions Gallery) and then configure it to always have Visual Studio start with admin privileges by going to Tools -> VSCommands -> Options -> IDE Enhancements -> General and check off Always start Visual Studio with elevated permissions and click the Save button.Note: VSCommands is not currently available for VS 2015, but their site says they are working on updating it to support VS 2015.I prefer Option 2 because:If you using Total Commander as I do, you should do the same for Total Commander to be run as admin always. Then you will be able to open sql file on double click in same SQL Server management instance, or to open any Visual Studio file on double click and not have multiple instances open.This Troubleshoot program adds registry value to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\AppCompatFlags\\Layers for any program, so if you like to write it directly you can.I know this is a little late, but I just figured out how to do this by modifying (read, "hacking") the manifest of the devenv.exe file.  I should have come here first because the stated solutions seem a little easier, and probably more supported by Microsoft. :)Here\'s how I did it:You\'ve just saved the copy of the executable that was added to your project. Now you need to back up the original and copy your modified exe to your installation directory.As I said, this is probably not the right way to do it, but it seems to work. If anyone knows of any negative fallout or requisite wrist-slapping that needs to happen, please chime in!Just find the program in Program Files directory (or in other location). Right click on the EXE file, on the second tab at the bottom check the checkbox of forcing running that program with administration privileges.\nFrom now all shortcuts of the exe file will be fired with administration privileges :)I found a simple way to do this on EightForums (Option 8), create a string value under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\AppCompatFlags\\Layers. Set the name to the path to the program and the value to ~RUNASDMIN.\nNext time you open the program it will open as an administratorThis error occurs because of The current user didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a sufficient privilege to open Visual Studio.To overcome this issue by right-clicking on visual studio and select run as administrator at every time you intend to open itAlso, you can check the compatibility troubleshooting To find the detail steps with image for How to apply that check this link.Hope it helps youVisual Studio does elevate itself automatically if the project\'s application manifest specifies an administrative requestedExecutionLevel, so you just need to edit that. Visual Studio will detect that and relaunch itself as administrator when needed.
