What are the differences between JavaScript\'s window.onload and jQuery\'s $(document).ready() method?The ready event occurs after the HTML document has been loaded, while the onload event occurs later, when all content (e.g. images) also has been loaded.The onload event is a standard event in the DOM, while the ready event is specific to jQuery. The purpose of the ready event is that it should occur as early as possible after the document has loaded, so that code that adds functionality to the elements in the page doesn\'t have to wait for all content to load.window.onload is the built-in JavaScript event, but as its implementation had subtle quirks across browsers (Firefox, Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 8, and Opera), jQuery provides document.ready, which abstracts those away, and fires as soon as the page\'s DOM is ready (doesn\'t wait for images, etc.).$(document).ready (note that it\'s not document.ready, which is undefined) is a jQuery function, wrapping and providing consistency to the following events:$(document).ready() is a jQuery event.  JQuery\xe2\x80\x99s $(document).ready() method gets called as soon as the DOM is ready (which means that the browser has parsed the HTML and built the DOM tree). This allows you to run code as soon as the document is ready to be manipulated.  For example, if a browser supports the DOMContentLoaded event (as many non-IE browsers do), then it will fire on that event. (Note that the DOMContentLoaded event was only added to IE in IE9+.)Two syntaxes can be used for this: Or the shorthand version:Main points for $(document).ready():window.onload() is a native JavaScript function. The window.onload() event fires when all the content on your page has loaded, including the DOM (document object model), banner ads and images. Another difference between the two is that, while we can have more than one $(document).ready() function, we can only have one onload function.A Windows load event fires when all the content on your page is fully loaded including the DOM (document object model) content and asynchronous JavaScript, frames and images. You can also use body onload=. Both are the same; window.onload = function(){} and <body onload="func();"> are different ways of using the same event.jQuery $document.ready function event executes a bit earlier than window.onload and is called once the DOM(Document object model) is loaded on your page. It will not wait for the images, frames to get fully load.Taken from the following article:\nhow $document.ready() is different from window.onload()A word of caution on using $(document).ready() with Internet Explorer.  If an HTTP request is interrupted before the entire document is loaded (for example, while a page is streaming to the browser, another link is clicked) IE will trigger the $(document).ready event.  If any code within the $(document).ready() event references DOM objects, the potential exists for those objects to be not found, and Javascript errors can occur.  Either guard your references to those objects, or defer code which references those objects to the window.load event. I have not been able to reproduce this problem in other browsers (specifically, Chrome and Firefox)$(document).on(\'ready\', handler) binds to the ready event from jQuery. The handler is called when the DOM is loaded. Assets like images maybe still are missing. It will never be called if the document is ready at the time of binding. jQuery uses the DOMContentLoaded-Event for that, emulating it if not available.$(document).on(\'load\', handler) is an event that will be fired once all resources are loaded from the server. Images are loaded now. While onload is a raw HTML event, ready is built by jQuery.$(document).ready(handler) actually is a promise. The handler will be called immediately if document is ready at the time of calling. Otherwise it binds to the ready-Event.Before jQuery 1.8, $(document).load(handler) existed as an alias to $(document).on(\'load\',handler).window.onload: A normal JavaScript event.document.ready: A specific jQuery event when the entire HTML have been loaded.Document.ready (a jQuery event) will fire when all the elements are in place, and they can be referenced in the JavaScript code, but the content is not necessarily loaded. Document.ready executes when the HTML document is loaded.The window.load however will wait for the page to be fully loaded. This includes inner frames, images, etc.One thing to remember (or should I say recall) is that you cannot stack onloads like you can with ready.  In other words, jQuery magic allows multiple readys on the same page, but you can\'t do that with onload.The last onload will overrule any previous onloads.A nice way to deal with that is with a function apparently written by one Simon Willison and described in Using Multiple JavaScript Onload Functions.The document.ready event occurs when the HTML document has been loaded, and the window.onload event occurs always later, when all content (images, etc) has been loaded.\nYou can use the document.ready event if you want to intervene "early" in the rendering process, without waiting for the images to load.\nIf you need the images (or any other "content") ready before your script "does something", you need to wait until window.onload.For instance, if you are implementing a "Slide Show" pattern, and you need to perform calculations based on image sizes, you may want to wait until window.onlad. Otherwise, you might experience some random problems, depending on how fast the images will get loaded.  Your script would be running concurrently with the thread that loads images.  If your script is long enough, or the server is fast enough, you may not notice a problem, if images happen to arrive in time.  But the safest practice would be allowing for images to get loaded.\nDocument.ready could be a nice event for you to show some "loading..." sign to users, and upon window.onload, you can complete any scripting that needed resources loaded, and then finally remove the "Loading..." sign.Examples :-window.onload is a JavaScript inbuilt function. window.onload trigger when the HTML page loaded. window.onload can be written only once.document.ready is a function of the jQuery library. document.ready triggers when HTML and all JavaScript code, CSS, and images which are included in the HTML file are completely loaded.\ndocument.ready can be written multiple times according to requirements.
