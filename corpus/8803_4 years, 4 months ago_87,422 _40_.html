I\'m new at Go programming, and I\'m wondering: what is the preferred way to handle configuration parameters for a Go program (the kind of stuff one might use properties files or ini files for, in other contexts)?The JSON format worked for me quite well. The\nstandard library offers methods to write the data structure indented, so it is quite\nreadable.See also this golang-nuts thread.The benefits of JSON are that it is fairly simple to parse and human readable/editable\nwhile offering semantics for lists and mappings (which can become quite handy), which\nis not the case with many ini-type config parsers.Example usage:conf.json:Program to read the configurationAnother option is to use TOML, which is an INI-like format created by Tom Preston-Werner. I built a Go parser for it that is extensively tested. You can use it like other options proposed here. For example, if you have this TOML data in something.tomlThen you can load it into your Go program with something likeI usually use JSON for more complicated data structures. The downside is that you easily end up with a bunch of code to tell the user where the error was, various edge cases and what not.For base configuration (api keys, port numbers, ...) I\'ve had very good luck with the gcfg package. It is based on the git config format.From the documentation:Sample config:Go struct:And the code needed to read it:It also supports slice values, so you can allow specifying a key multiple times and other nice features like that.Just use standard go flags with iniflags.Standard go flags have the following benefits:The only drawback standard go flags have - is management problems when the number of flags used in your app becomes too large.Iniflags elegantly solves this problem: just modify two lines in your main package and it magically gains support for reading flag values from ini file. Flags from ini files can be overriden by passing new values in command-line.See also https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/TByzyPgoAQE for details.Viper is a golang configuration management system that works with JSON, YAML, and TOML. It looks pretty interesting.I have started using Gcfg which uses Ini-like files. It\'s simple - if you want something simple, this is a good choice.Here\'s the loading code I am using currently, which has default settings and allows command line flags (not shown) that override some of my config:have a look at gonfighttps://github.com/spf13/viper and https://github.com/zpatrick/go-config are a pretty good libraries for configuration files.I wrote a simple ini config library in golang.https://github.com/c4pt0r/cfggoroutine-safe, easy to use===================Update=======================Recently I need an INI parser with section support, and I write a simple package:u can parse INI like using "flag" package:Use toml like this article Reading config files the Go wayYou might also be interested in go-libucl, a set of Go bindings for UCL, the Universal Configuration Language. UCL is a bit like JSON, but with better support for humans: it supports comments and human-readable constructs like SI multipliers (10k, 40M, etc.) and has a little bit less boilerplate (e.g., quotes around keys). It\'s actually pretty close to the nginx configuration file format, if you\'re already familiar with that.I agree with nemo and I wrote a little tool to make it all real easy.bitbucket.org/gotamer/cfg is a json configuration package  See doc.go for an exampleI tried JSON.  It worked.  But I hate having to create the struct of the exact fields and types I might be setting.  To me that was a pain.  I noticed it was the method used by all the configuration options I could find.  Maybe my background in dynamic languages makes me blind to the benefits of such verboseness.  I made a new simple config file format, and a more dynamic-ish lib for reading it out.https://github.com/chrisftw/ezconfI am pretty new to the Go world, so it might not be the Go way.  But it works, it is pretty quick, and super simple to use.
