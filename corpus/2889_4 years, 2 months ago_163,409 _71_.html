I\'m using the PostgreSql app for mac (http://postgresapp.com/). I\'ve used it in the past on other machines but it\'s giving me some trouble when installing on my macbook. I\'ve installed the application and I ran:It returns:It seems I can\'t even run the console to create the database that it\'s attempting to find. The same thing happens when I just run:or if I launch psql from the application drop down menu:Machine stats:OSX 10.8.4psql (PostgreSQL) 9.2.4Any help is appreciated. I\'ve also attempted to install PostgreSql via homebrew and I\'m getting the same issue. I\'ve also read the applications documentation page that states: When Postgres.app first starts up, it creates the $USER database,\n  which is the default database for psql when none is specified. The\n  default user is $USER, with no password.So it would seem the application is not creating $USER however I\'ve installed->uninstalled-reinstalled several times now so it must be something with my machine.I found the answer but I\'m not sure exactly how it works as the user who answered on this thread -> Getting Postgresql Running In Mac: Database "postgres" does not exist didn\'t follow up. I used the following command to get psql to open: I\'ll leave this one unanswered until someone can provide an explanation for why this works.It appears that your package manager failed to create the database named $user for you.  The reason thatworks for you is that template1 is a database created by postgres itself, and is present on all installations.\nYou are apparently able to log in to template1, so you must have some rights assigned to you by the database.  Try this at a shell prompt:and then see if you can log in again with This will simply create a database for your login user, which I think is what you are looking for.  If createdb fails, then you don\'t have enough rights to make your own database, and you will have to figure out how to fix the homebrew package.By default, postgres tries to connect to a database with the same name as your user.  To prevent this default behaviour, just specify user and database:Just Run the command on your command prompt window. (Not inside psql). And then try to run postgres again.Login using default template1 database:Create a database with your userId:Quit and then login againThis error can also occur if the environment variable PGDATABASE is set to the name of a database that does not exist.On OSX, I saw the following error while trying to launch psql from the Postgress.app menu:psql: FATAL:  database "otherdb" does not existThe solution to the error was to remove export PGDATABASE=otherdb from ~/.bash_profile:Further, if PGUSER is set to something other than your username, the following error will occur:psql: FATAL:  role "note" does not existThe solution is to remove export PGUSER=notme from ~/.bash_profile.Since this question is the first in search results, I\'ll put a different solution for a different problem here anyway, in order not to have a duplicate title.The same error message can come up when running a query file in psql without specifying a database. Since there is no use statement in postgresql, we have to specify the database on the command line, for example:I faced the same error when I trying to open postgresql on macI found this simple command to solve it:method1and typeMethod 2:As the createdb documentation states:The first database is always created by the initdb command when the data storage area is initialized... This database is called postgres.So if certain OS/postgresql distributions do that differently, it is certainly not the default/standard (just verified that initdb on openSUSE 13.1 creates the DB "postgres", but not "<user>"). Long story short, psql -d postgres is expected to be used when using a user other than "postgres".Obviously the accepted answer, running createdb to create a DB named like the user, works as well, but creates a superfluous DB.I still had the issue above after installing postgresql using homebrew - I resolved it by putting /usr/local/bin in my path before /usr/bin had the problem with using the JDBC driver, so one just has to add the database (maybe redundantly depending on the tool you may use) after the host name in the URL, e.g.\njdbc:postgres://<host(:port)>/<db-name>further details are documented here: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.4/static/jdbc-use.html#JDBC-CONNECTFirst off, it\'s helpful to create a database named the same as your current use, to prevent the error when you just want to use the default database and create new tables without declaring the name of a db explicitly.Replace "skynotify" with your username:-d explicitly declares which database to use as the default for SQL statements that don\'t explicitly include a db name during this interactive session.BASICS FOR GETTING A CLEAR PICTURE OF WHAT YOUR PostgresQL SERVER has in it.You must connect to an existing database to use psql interactively.  Fortunately, you can ask psql for a list of databases:.This does NOT start the interactive console, it just outputs a text based table to the terminal.  As another answers says, postgres is always created, so you should use it as your failsafe database when you just want to get the console started to work on other databases.  If it isn\'t there, then list the databases and then use any one of them.In a similar fashion, select tables from a database:My "postgres" database has no tables, but any database that does will output a text based table to the terminal (standard out).And for completeness, we can select all rows from a table too:.Even if there are zero rows returned, you\'ll get the field names.If your tables have more than a dozen rows, or you\'re not sure, it\'ll be more useful to start with a count of rows to understand how much data is in your database:.And don\'t that that "1 row" confuse you, it just represents how many rows are returned by the query, but the 1 row contains the count you want, which is 0 in this example.NOTE: a db created without an owner defined will be owned by the current user.If you are getting this error when deploying a Rails project with Capistrano you may want to create a database on your remote server.Log in to your Ubuntu and run:Enter your postgres user password if prompted. Now create your database by entering:The name has to be the one you specified in shared/config/database.yml on your production server.Exit by entering \\qIn it\'s simplest explanation; it\'s noob issue. Just typing pgreswill result in this response.will succeed without error if the user has the permissions to access the db.One can go into the details of the exported environment variables but that\'s unnecessary .. this is too basic to fail for any other reason.
