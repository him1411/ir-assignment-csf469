I am generally familiar with the technique of flushing a footer using css and this following approach.But I am having some trouble getting this approach to work for Twitter bootstrap, most likely due to the fact that Twitter bootstrap is responsive in nature. Using Twitter bootstrap I am not able to get the footer to flush to the bottom of the page using the approach described in the above blog post.Found the snippets here works really well for bootstrap Html:CSS:Source: Demo and TutorialThis is now included with Bootstrap 2.2.1.Use the navbar component and add .navbar-fixed-bottom class:Don\'t forget to add body { padding-bottom: 70px; } or otherwise the page content may be covered.Docs: http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar-fixed-bottomA working example for Twitter bootstrap NOT STICKY FOOTERWhen not want the scrollbar if content would fit to screen just change the value of 10 to 0\nThe scrollbar will show up if content not fits to screen.Here\'s how to implement this from the official page:http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/examples/sticky-footer.htmlI just tested it right now and it WORKS GREAT! :)HTMLThe relevant CSS code is this:For Sticky Footer we use two DIV\'s in the HTML for basic sticky footer effect. Write like this:HTMLCSSMuch simpler official example: http://getbootstrap.com/examples/sticky-footer-navbar/Well I found mix of navbar-inner and   navbar-fixed-bottomIt seems good and works for meSee example in FiddleYou need to wrap your .container-fluid div in order for your sticky footer to work, you\'re also missing some properties on your .wrapper class. Try this:Remove the padding-top:70px from your body tag and include it in your .container-fluid instead, like so:We have to do this because pushing the body down to accommodate the navbar ends up pushing the footer a bit further (70px further) past the viewport so we get a scrollbar. We get better results pushing the .container-fluid div instead.Next we have to remove the .wrapper class outside your .container-fluid div and wrap your #main div with it, like so:Your footer of course has to be out of the .wrapper div so remove it from the `.wrapper div and place it outside, like so:After thats all done, properly push your footer closer to your .wrapper class by using a negative margin, like so:And that should work, though you\'re probably going to have to modify a few other things to make it work when the screen is resized, like resetting the height on the .wrapper class, like so:This is the right way to do it with Twitter Bootstrap and the new navbar-fixed-bottom class: (you have no idea how long I spent looking for this)CSS:HTML:This worked for me perfectly.Add this class navbar-fixed-bottom to your footer.I used it like this:And it sets to bottom over the the full width.Edit: This will set footer to always visible, it\'s something you need to take in consideration.HenryW\'s answer is good, though I needed a few tweaks to get it working how I wanted. In particular the following also handles:Here\'s what worked for me with those tweaks:HTML:CSS:JavaScript:Use the navbar component and add .navbar-fixed-bottom class:add body to handle width constraint layouts use the following so that you do not get rounded corners, and so that your nav bar will be flush to the sides of the applicationthen you can use css to override the bootstrap classes to adjust height, font, and colorYou can use jQuery to handle this:The simplest technique is probably to use Bootstrap navbar-static-bottom in conjunction with setting the main container div with height: 100vh (new CSS3 view port percentage). This will flush the footer to the bottom.The footer height matches the size of the bottom indent of the wrap element.Tested with Bootstrap 3.6.6.HTMLCSSIt looks like the height:100% \'chain\' is being broken at div#main.  Try adding height:100% to it and that may get you closer to your goal.Here you\'ll find the approach in HAML ( http://haml.info )  with navbar on top and footer at the bottom of the page: Keep it simple.You may need to also offset the height of the footer by adding a margin-bottom equivalent to the footer height to the body.Here is an example using css3:CSS:HTML:fiddleThis is how bootstrap does it:http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/examples/sticky-footer.htmlJust use page source and you should be able to see. Don\' forget the <div id="wrap"> an the top.The only one that worked for me!:another possible solution, just using media queriesIn the latest version of bootstrap 4-alpha, I was able to do it using .fixed-bottom class.  Here\'s how I use it with the footer: You can find more information in the placement documentation here.
