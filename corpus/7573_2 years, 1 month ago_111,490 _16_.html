I\'ve been using github from a relatively short period, and I\'ve always used the client to perform commits and pulls. I decided to try it from the git bash yesterday, and I successfully created a new repo and committed files.Today I did changes to the repository from another computer, I\'ve committed the changes and now I\'m back home and performed a git pull to update my local version and I get this:the only contributor to this repo is me and there are no branches (just a master). I\'m on windows and I\'ve performed the pull from git bash:git status:git branch:What am I doing wrong?You could specify what branch you want to pull:Or you could set it up so that your local master branch tracks github master branch as an upstream:This branch tracking is set up for you automatically when you clone a repository (for the default branch only), but if you add a remote to an existing repository you have to set up the tracking yourself. Thankfully, the advice given by git makes that pretty easy to remember how to do.See: git checkout tag, git pull fails in branchIf like me you need to do this all the time, you can set up an alias to do it automatically by adding the following to your .gitconfig file:When you see the message There is no tracking information..., just run git set-upstream, then git push again.Thanks to https://zarino.co.uk/post/git-set-upstream/I run into this exact message often because I create a local branches via git checkout -b <feature-branch-name> without first creating the remote branch. After all the work was finished and committed locally the fix was git push -u which created the remote branch, pushed all my work, and then the merge-request URL.
