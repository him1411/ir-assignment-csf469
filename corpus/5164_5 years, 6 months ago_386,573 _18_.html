In jQuery, there are .hide() and .show() methods which sets the CSS display: none setting. Is there an equivalent function which would set the visibility: hidden setting? I know I can use .css() but I prefer some function like .hide() or so. Thanks.You could make your own plugins.If you want to overload the original jQuery toggle(), which I don\'t recommend...jsFiddle.There isn\'t one built in but you could write your own quite easily:You can then call this like so:Here\'s a working example.An even simpler way to do this is to use jQuery\'s toggleClass() methodCSSHTMLJSIf you only need the standard functionality of hide only with visibility:hidden to keep the current layout you can use the callback function of hide to alter the css in the tag. Hide docs in jqueryAn example :This will use the normal cool animation to hide the div, but after the animation finish you set the visibility to hidden and display to block.An example : http://jsfiddle.net/bTkKG/1/I know you didnt want the $("#aa").css() solution, but you did not specify if it was because using only the css() method you lose the animation.
