Does anyone have successful experience reading binary Matlab .mat files in Python?(I\'ve seen that scipy has alleged support for reading .mat files, but I\'m unsuccessful with it. I installed scipy version 0.7.0, and I can\'t find the loadmat() method)Silly me. Forgot to import io...Neither scipy.io.savemat, nor scipy.io.loadmat work for matlab arrays --v7.3. But the good part is that matlab --v7.3 files are hdf5 datasets. So they can be read using a number of tools, including numpy.For python, you will need the h5py extension, which requires HDF5 on your system.I\'ve screwed half an hour even after reading the answers. Hope this answer helpsFirst save the mat file asAfter that in Python use the usual loadmatHaving Matlab 2014b or newer installed, the Matlab engine for Python could be used:There is also the MATLAB Engine for Python by MathWorks itself. If you have Matlab, this might be worth considered (I haven\'t tried it myself but it has a lot more functionality than just reading Matlab files). However, I don\'t know if it is allowed to distribute it to other users (probably no problem if those persons have Matlab, otherwise maybe NumPy is the right way to go?).Also, if you want to do all the basics yourself, MathWorks provides (if the link changes, try to google for matfile_format.pdf or its title MAT-FILE Format) a detailed documentation on the structure of the file format. It\'s not as complicated as I personally thought but obviously, this is not the easiest way to go. It also depends on, how many features of the .mat-files you want to support.I\'ve written a "small" (about 700 lines) Python script which can read some basic .mat-files. I\'m neither a Python expert nor a beginner and it took me about two days to write it (using the MathWorks documentation linked above). I\'ve learned a lot of new stuff and it was quite fun (most of the time). As I\'ve written the Python script at work, I\'m afraid I cannot publish it... But I can give a few advices here:hdf5 files can also be dealt with by means of PyTables. Their FAQ has an entry which compares with h5py: https://pytables.github.io/FAQ.html . PyTables also comes with the handy visualiser ViTables: http://vitables.org/galleries/Screenshots/
