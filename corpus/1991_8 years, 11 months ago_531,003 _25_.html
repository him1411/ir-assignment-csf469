How do I convert a hex string to an int in Python? I may have it as "0xffff" or just "ffff".Without the 0x prefix, you need to specify the base explicitly, otherwise there\'s no way to tell:With the 0x prefix, Python can distinguish hex and decimal automatically.(You must specify 0 as the base in order to invoke this prefix-guessing behavior; omitting the second parameter means to assume base-10.)int(hexString, 16) does the trick, and works with and without the 0x prefix:For any given string s:Adding to Dan\'s answer above: if you supply the int() function with a hex string, you will have to specify the base as 16 or it will not think you gave it a valid value. Specifying base 16 is unnecessary for hex numbers not contained in strings.I may have it as "0xffff" or just "ffff".To convert a string to an int, pass the string to int along with the base you are converting from. Both strings will suffice for conversion in this way:If you pass 0 as the base, int will infer the base from the prefix in the string. Without the hexadecimal prefix, 0x, int does not have enough information with which to guess:If you\'re typing into source code or an interpreter, Python will make the conversion for you:This won\'t work with ffff because Python will think you\'re trying to write a legitimate Python name instead:Python numbers start with a numeric character, while Python names cannot start with a numeric character.The worst way:Is using eval in Python a bad practice?In Python 2.7, int(\'deadbeef\',10) doesn\'t seem to work. The following works for me:The formatter option \'%x\' % seems to work in assignment statements as well for me. (Assuming Python 3.0 and later)Example To convert a DWORD from hex to a signed integer , implement two\'s complement like this:with \'0x\' prefix, you might also use eval functionFor example
