I accidentally enabled ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY mode like this:How do I disable it?Give this a try:Community Note: As pointed out in the answers below, this actually clears all the SQL modes currently enabled. That may not necessarily be what you want.The best way to go about it without emptying sql_mode outit worked for me and you can read more here If you want to disable permanently error sql_mode=only_full_group_by do those steps:Add this to the end of the filesudo service mysql restart to restart MySQLThis will disable ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY for ALL usersBe careful using This actually clears all the modes currently enabled. If you don\'t want to mess with other settings, you\'ll want to do a first, to get a comma-separated list of the modes enabled, then SET it to this list without the ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY option.Adding only one mode to sql_mode without removing existing ones:Removing only a specific mode from sql_mode without removing others:In your case, if you want to remove only ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY mode, then use below command:Reference: http://johnemb.blogspot.com/2014/09/adding-or-removing-individual-sql-modes.htmlThanks to @cwhisperer.\nI had the same issue with Doctrine in a Symfony app. I just added the option to my config.yml:This worked fine for me.The MySQL documentation also specifies the following methods:*Where <modes> is a list of different modes separated by commas.To clear the SQL mode explicitly, set it to an empty string using --sql-mode="" on the command line, or sql-mode="" in an option file.I added the sql-mode="" option to /etc/my.cnf and it worked.This SO solution discusses ways to find out which my.cnf file is being used by MySQL.Don\'t forget to restart MySQL after making changes.On:Do:Copy and paste:To the bottom of the fileIf you are using WAMP.\nLeft click on the WAMP icon then goto MySQL -> MySQL settings -> sql-mode\nand then select sql-mode->user modeOn my sql (version 5.7.11 running on Mac OS X) this work for me on mysql shell client:According to MySQL 5.6 Documentation, sql_mode is default isblank string in MySQL 5.6.5 and back\nNO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION,STRICT_TRANS_TABLES in 5.6.6 +mysql 5.6 referenceI\'m using doctrine and I have added the driverOptions in my doctrine.local.php :In phpmyadmin the user needs SUPER activated in the privileges.On MySQL 5.7 and Ubuntu 16.04, edit the file mysql.cnf.Include the sql_mode like the following and save the file.Observe that, in my case, I removed the mode STRICT_TRANS_TABLES and the ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY.Doing this, it will save the mode configuration permanently. Differently if you just update the @@sql_mode through MySQL, because it will reset on machine/service restart.After that, to the modified configuration take in action, restart the mysql service:Try to access the mysql:If you are able to login and access MySQL console, it is ok. Great!BUT, if like me, you face the error "unknown variable sql_mode", which indicates that sql_mode is an option for mysqld, you will have to go back, edit the file mysql.cnf again and change the [mysql] to [mysqld]. Restart the MySQL service and do a last test trying to login on MySQL console. Here it is!I have noticed that @Eyo Okon Eyo solution works as long as MySQL server is not restarted, then defaults settings are restored. Here is a permanent solution that worked for me:To remove particular SQL mode (in this case ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY), find you current SQL mode:copy the result and remove from it what you don\'t need (ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY)e.g.: tocreate and open this file:and write and past into it your new SQL mode:restart MySQL:Or you can use ANY_VALUE() to suppress ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY value rejection, you can read more about it here
