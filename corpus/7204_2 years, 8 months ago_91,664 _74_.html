I used Xcode 6.1.1 to upload a new version of a prerelease app to iTunes Connect so I could distribute it to my external beta testers. I\'ve done this with two versions of the same app previously and it worked fine.But this time, the upload was stuck in "Processing" state for over a week. I tried again (same version, new build number) and it\'s now been over 24 hours with no change.The app passed validation fine.What gives?Go to "Resources & Help" in iTunes Connect. Select "Contact Us" and follow the wizard. I don\'t think anyone other than Apple can answer this. And this is what we have done in a similar situation in the past.We had a similar issue. Uploaded builds were queueing up and it simply said "Processing" with the popup help, \xe2\x80\x9cAfter builds are uploaded they will go through a processing state before they can be used.\xe2\x80\x9d Days passed.Selecting "Internal Testers," making a change, and saving seemed to immediately clear the queue: The latest build was now active and available for testing. I\'ve done this twice with two different apps now.Update: At this point, all bets are off. It seems "processing" happens when Apple quietly upgrades iTunes Connect and there\'s nothing you can do about it.On September 23, 2015 iTunes Connect didn\'t accept any uploads for nearly 24 hours. The "Internal Testers" trick didn\'t work. Eventually bumping the version number (to avoid "duplicate binary" error) and re-submitting worked. The next day, Surprise! iTunes Connect was completely changed. I guess we were all looking at a dead site while they brought up the new version in the background :(In our case we can still see dozens of "failed" uploads still sitting in the "processing" state. Oh well.Some people report using Application Loader works better than Xcode for submitting builds to iTunes Connect. You can find it inside Xcode now, under the Xcode menu "Open Developer Tool" item.Sometimes this works. Sometimes it doesn\'t. Your milage may vary \xc2\xaf\\_(\xe3\x83\x84)_/\xc2\xaf The solution (as suggested by Apple Support in their response to a request for assistance) is to upload a new binary. I did this via XCode (same revision 1.4, but incremented the Build number from 1 to 2) and it processed almost immediately.If you get stuck in "Processing" purgatory, increment the Build number in XCode, Archive and Submit to the App Store again. If it doesn\'t process within 15 minutes, try again.Had the same problem using XCode 7 betta-5. Fixed by unchecking "Include bitcode" checkbox during archive uploading:I had the same issue. I tried making changes to "Internal Testers." No effect. I uploaded a new build using the Application Loader. Once the upload completed, the previous build changed from "Processing" to being available.I had a similar issue.Yesterday, I submitted an app build (1.03) using Xcode, it was around 6 PM and this morning it was still "Processing", in fact it is still "Processing".This morning around 10:30 AM I submitted a second build (1.04) using Xcode but that one also took too much time to change its status, so I submitted a third build (1.05) using Application Loader around noon, application loader gave me a warning about the app being too large to validate its API usage (the build is around 12.5 MB), it was just a warning so I submitted it and I\'m still waiting to for it to change status (2:16 PM).Of course, each time I bumped up the Build number. All the builds had Enable Bitcode set to NO.UPDATE (1:52 PM):The second build (1.0.4) just became available for TestFlight.UPDATE (4:43 PM):The third build (1.0.5), the one submitted with Application Loader just became available for TestFlight.My conclusion is that their servers are slower than before... maybe the volume of apps that are being processed has increased and the load of their systems is higher because there are new things to check for (bitcode, watch os stuff, etc).I got this message from App Store Developer Support (2016-01-02):Be aware that it can take up to 24 hours for a build to fully process\n  through our system and become available for use. If a build does not\n  finish processing in 24 hours, this can typically be resolved by\n  submitting the build again with a higher build number.Not much of an answer (nothing about why it takes so long time), but it\'s the answer Apple is giving us.I ran into this issue yesterday. I submitted multiple builds with a variety of different settings. What finally worked for me was submitting through Application Loader with no bitcode.I hope this helps someone avoid the headache I went through. Its been 24 hours and the apps submitted through Xcode are all still "processing", the one submitted through Application Loader was available within an hour or so.If you run into this issue now, it\'s an Apple issue. They are releasing a new version of iTunesConnect. A bunch of my builds had been getting stuck in Processing these past few days. Today, they were getting stuck on Uploaded. Multiple phone calls and different answers later, the new site was just released and my builds are showing as Processing or available for submission. Though, they all have a yellow warning icon next to them. Not sure what that is.I submitted a new version of my app via Xcode 7.1 successfully. Then noticed the build was stuck in "Processing" longer than usual.I followed Scotch\'s suggestion by increasing the build number, while keeping the same version, and submitted again from Xcode. This time the new build became available for testing within 5 minutes.I was then able to select that build and clicked on Start testing. My internal testers received the notification emails and were able to test the new version via the Testflight app.I know its a bit late for answer but this is the first link appearing in google, and none of the above solutions were working for me. I was having the same problem i.e after uploading build from application loader it stuck in processing. This happened many times, after hours of head banging I found that as soon as I close the application loader on my Mac, build status was changed :)I hope this answer will help many.There is another question which duplicates this one. I posted an answer how I solved this problem. Maybe it helps someone else too:Anyone else's build for iTunes Connect taking longer times to process?In a nutshell: Build and upload with XCode 6.4 instead of XCode 7.OSX: Disabling include app symbols to symbolicate crash report did the trick for me. I will store the dsym and symbolicate manually rather then waiting for them to solve their "NEW" itunesconnect release.I\'m using xcode, my app usually took 1 - 2 minutes to be processed but today I waited for 15 minutes. What I did was increase the build, keep the version same and archive it again. And it went thru within 2 minutes while the previous build still stuck after an hour. My advise is don\'t wait for Apple, just increase build and upload again. Apple is too noble to admit their system has bug or mistake. Time is money.I\'m loathe to add another answer to this already overcrowded question, but it might be of use to someone.I found that if a "release" already had a build assigned when I uploaded a new one, clearing the existing build and attempting to select the new one always showed it as "processing".However, if I removed the old build and saved then refreshed the page, the new build could be selected.I tried changing the Internal Testers option, tried changing other items on the app details page, and tried uploading several new binaries (with the same code, only changing the build number) over a 2-day period to no effect. I also contacted Apple through the iTunes Connect support link; they replied in less than 24 hours, but only to ask for more info (most of which I had already provided).Finally, the fifth build I uploaded, two days later, went through in the normal few minutes and I was finally able to submit my app for review.I faced same issue, I uploaded ipa via Xcode7 and it get stuck for 48hrs.\nNumber of times I mail to apple support but it won\'t work\nso I uploaded ipa multiple times, but no use\nthen I made change in version number e.g. 2.2(33) to 2.3(1)\nand it works for me. So try at your side may be this will help you.Same issue for me...\nUpload app archives from Xcode (7.3.1). Connect to iTunesCo with both Chrome and Safari...The way it works has no logic... So I agree with @teapen:...don\'t wait for Apple, just increase build and upload again...So I experienced this yesterday (22 feb \'17), I tried uploading the build via Xcode (8.2) multiple times, it showed (Processing). Then I tried it with the application loader, still the same. I just had to wait for ~12 hours to have it spam me with processing done emails. So yeah, it\'s not you, it\'s them.I have been having this same problem for a few days and many uploads, seemed to work when I logged out of apple developer portal on my PC (which I use instead of my Mac to view the portal) upload the new version via my Mac and log into the developer portal on the Mac I was using to upload the ipa, seemed to work straight away after that, guess apple just really hates Windows or being logged in from a different computer is a problem.I also had this issue - However it was for a completely different reason then any I have seen online. I realized that my app did not have the proper iOS Provisioning profile associated for app store release. I simply changed the build number, validated and resubmitted. Within 15 minutes, the new version was ready to be added as a current build. The previous two versions I tried to upload are both still processing.I am not sure why Apple does not tell you that there is an incorrect provisioning profile for the build to be uploaded, but this was my cure!Uploading the build with the Application Loader did the trick for me. If your current build is stuck in Processing, just create a new one with an incremented build number, and submit it via the Application Loader.Actually it is the issue related to the app store. I have upload many build some time it takes time depend upon the size of the ipa and at which time you are uploading it to the App Store. Please use Application Loader 3.0 or higher to upload the build.Solution is Wait for some hours Approximately 24 Hours. Your issue will be fixed at once.\nApple is having bad times now a days. I hope they will soon fix everythingI have a theory on this bug, which happened to me a few times as well.What I think happens: if you are logged into iTunesConnect, then the web page will query the database for available builds. This querying could possibly interfere with the creation of new builds.What I did was:\nLog off from iTunesConnect on all your web browsers.\nIncrease the build nr in Xcode, make an Archive, and upload it.Then: resist the temptations to log into iTunesConnect to check on the status. Wait at least an hr before logging on.When I did finally log on to iTunesConnect, I found my binaries sitting there, and waiting for me.I had the same problem with one of my apps, which is how I ended up finding this.  In my case, I uploaded two of my apps at the same time, using Xcode 7.1.  One of the apps passed through processing within an hour.  The other one was still in processing almost 24 hours later.  To get past this issue, I created a new archive with an incremented build number, and uploaded it using the application loader.  I did not turn off bitcode.  The version that I uploaded using the application loader took less than 20 minutes to get through processing, and I\'ve been able to submit my app for review.  The version I submitted prior to this is still stuck in processing.At least in the case of my app, using application loader appears to have solved the issue.The reason for that is that your build is missing something that apple servers is unable to determine.to solve this, make sure you have included all possible configuration needed for your app, and make sure you have added at least one of the launch images for every possible resolution, that was my case, I add an launch image for every device and did works.so, carefully check if you project is missing one of those settings or an image, and try.\nthanksI was facing this issue. It solved when I logged in into iTunes Connect in Chrome browser than Safari. My app was in processed state already.Cocoapods (0.39.0.beta.4) was the issue for me so I moved to Carthage.
