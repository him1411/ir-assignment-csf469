How can I create global variable keep remain values around the life cycle of the application regardless which activity running..You can extend the base android.app.Application class and add member variables like so:In your android manifest you must declare the class implementing android.app.Application (add the android:name=".MyApplication" attribute to the existing application tag):Then in your activities you can get and set the variable like so:You can use a Singleton Pattern. Like this:In your application you can access your singleton in this way:this global variable works for my project You could use application preferences. They are accessible from any activity or piece of code as long as you pass on the Context object, and they are private to the application that uses them, so you don\'t need to worry about exposing application specific values, unless you deal with routed devices. Even so, you could use hashing or encryption schemes to save the values. Also, these preferences are stored from an application run to the next.\nHere is some code examples that you can look at.There are a few different ways you can achieve what you are asking for.1.) Extend the application class and instantiate your controller and model objects there.Then you can call the your singleton from your custom Application object at any time:2.) You can have your controller just create a singleton instance of itself:Then you can just call the create method from any Activity or Fragment and it will create a new controller if one doesn\'t already exist, otherwise it will return the preexisting controller.3.) Finally, there is a slick framework created at Square which provides you dependency injection within Android. It is called Dagger. I won\'t go into how to use it here, but it is very slick if you need that sort of thing.I hope I gave enough detail in regards to how you can do what you are hoping for.Try Like This:Create a shared data class:SharedData.javaDeclared/Initiaze an instance of class globally in those classes where you want to set/get data (using this code before onCreate() method):-Set data:Get data:I checked for similar answer, but those given here don\'t fit my needs.\nI find something that, from my point of view, is what you\'re looking for. The only possible black point is a security matter (or maybe not) since I don\'t know about security.I suggest using Interface (no need to use Class with constructor and so...), since you only have to create something like :Then you can access everywhere within your classes by using the following:You can create a globle Class like thisThen define it in the manifest Now you can set values to glolble variable like thisYou can get those values like thisPlease find complete example from this blog-\nGloble Variables If possible, you should declare the variables that you need to keep alive that haven\'t been clear by Garbage Collector or Unload by OS in file .so\nTo do it, you must code by C/C++ and compile to .so lib file and load it in your MainActivity.Easy!!!!Those variable you wanna access as global variable, you can declare them as static variables. And now, you can access those variables by usingclassname.variablename;}MyProperites.someValueIWantToKeep;Thats It! ;)
