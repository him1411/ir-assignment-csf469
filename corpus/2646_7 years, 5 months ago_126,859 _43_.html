Is there any way to find out what branch a commit comes from given its sha1? Bonus points if you can tell me how to accomplish this using Ruby Grit.While Dav is correct that the information isn\'t directly stored, that doesn\'t mean you can\'t ever find out. Here are a few things you can do.This will tell you all branches which have the given commit in their history. Obviously this is less useful if the commit\'s already been merged.If you are working in the repository in which the commit was made, you can search the reflogs for the line for that commit. Reflogs older than 90 days are pruned by git-gc, so if the commit\'s too old, you won\'t find it. That said, you can do this:to find commit a871742. The output should be something like this:indicating that the commit was made on the branch "completion". The default output shows abbreviated commit hashes, so be sure not to search for the full hash or you won\'t find anything.git reflog show is actually just an alias for git log -g --abbrev-commit --pretty=oneline, so if you want to fiddle with the output format to make different things available to grep for, that\'s your starting point!If you\'re not working in the repository where the commit was made, the best you can do in this case is examine the reflogs and find when the commit was first introduced to your repo; with any luck, you fetched the branch it was committed to. This is a bit more complex, because you can\'t walk both the commit tree and reflogs simultaneously. You\'d want to parse the reflog output, examining each hash to see if it contains the desired commit or not.This is workflow-dependent, but with good workflows, commits are made on development branches which are then merged in. You could do this:to see merge commits that have the given commit as an ancestor. (If the commit was only merged once, the first one should be the merge you\'re after; otherwise you\'ll have to examine a few, I suppose.) The merge commit message should contain the branch name that was merged.If you want to be able to count on doing this, you may want to use the --no-ff option to git merge to force merge commit creation even in the fast-forward case. (Don\'t get too eager, though, that could become obfuscating if overused.) VonC\'s answer to a related question helpfully elaborates on this topic.Update December 2013:sschuberth commentsgit-what-branch (Perl script, see below) does not seem to be maintained anymore.\n  git-when-merged is an alternative written in Python that\'s working very well for me. It is based on "Find merge commit which include a specific commit".Find when a commit was merged into one or more branches.\n  Find the merge commit that brought COMMIT into the specified BRANCH(es).  Specificially, look for the oldest commit on the first-parent history of BRANCH that contains the COMMIT as an ancestor.Original answer September 2010:Sebastien Douche just twitted (16 minutes before this SO answer):git-what-branch: Discover what branch a commit is on, or how it got to a named branchThis is a Perl script from Seth Robertson that seems very interesting:SYNOPSISOVERVIEWTell us (by default) the earliest causal path of commits and merges to cause the requested commit got onto a named branch.\n  If a commit was made directly on a named branch, that obviously is the earliest path.By earliest causal path, we mean the path which merged into a named branch the earliest, by commit time (unless --topo-order is specified).PERFORMANCEIf many branches (e.g. hundreds) contain the commit, the system may take a long time (for a particular commit in the linux tree, it took 8 second to explore a branch, but there were over 200 candidate branches) to track down the path to each commit.\n  Selection of a particular --reference-branch --reference tag to examine will be hundreds of times faster (if you have hundreds of candidate branches).EXAMPLESThis program does not take into account the effects of cherry-picking the commit of interest, only merge operations.For example to find thatc0118fa commit came from redesign_interactionsYou should run:And scroll down to find last merge commit. Which is:UPD\nOr just one command:git branch --contains <ref> is the most obvious "porcelain" command to do this. If you want to do something similar with only "plumbing" commands:(crosspost from this SO answer)Poor man\'s option is to use the tool tig1 on HEAD, search for the commit, and then visually follow the line from that commit back up until a merge commit is seen. The default merge message should specify what branch is getting merged to where :)1 Tig is an ncurses-based text-mode interface for git. It functions\n  mainly as a Git repository browser, but can also assist in staging\n  changes for commit at chunk level and act as a pager for output from\n  various Git commands.As an experiment, I made a post-commit hook that stores information about the currently checked out branch in the commit metadata. I also slightly modified gitk to show that information.You can check it out here: https://github.com/pajp/branch-info-commitsTo find local branchTo find remote branchAside from searching through all of the tree until you find a matching hash, no.
