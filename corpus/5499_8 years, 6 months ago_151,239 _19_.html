I\'m writing a python application that will make heavy use of a graph data structure. Nothing horribly complex, but I\'m thinking some sort of graph/graph-algorithms library would help me out. I\'ve googled around, but I don\'t find anything that particularly leaps out at me.Anyone have any good recommendations?There are two excellent choices:NetworkXand igraphI like NetworkX, but I read good things about igraph as well.  I routinely use NetworkX with graphs with 1 million nodes with no problem (it\'s about double the overhead of a dict of size V + E)If you want a feature comparison, see this from the Networkx-discuss listFeature comparison threadI would like to plug my own graph python library: graph-tool.It is very fast, since it is implemented in C++ with the Boost Graph Library, and it contains lots of algorithms and extensive documentation.Have you looked at python-graph?  I haven\'t used it myself, but the project page looks promising.Also, you might want to take a look at NetworkXUse the Boost Graph Library - Python Bindings.Take a look at this page on implementing graphs in python.You could also take a look at pygraphlib on sourceforge.I\'m having the most luck with pydot. Some of the others are hard to install and configure on different platforms like Win 7.http://code.google.com/p/pydot/I second zweiterlinde\'s suggestion to use python-graph.  I\'ve used it as the basis of a graph-based research project that I\'m working on.  The library is well written, stable, and has a good interface.  The authors are also quick to respond to inquiries and reports.
