I have this two classes. My main Activity and the one that extends the AsyncTask, Now in my main Activity I need to get the result from the OnPostExecute() in the AsyncTask. How can I pass or get the result to my main Activity?Here is the sample codes.My main Activity.This is the AsyncTask classEasy:Create interface class, where String output is optional, or can be whatever variables you want to return. Go to your AsyncTask class, and declare interface AsyncResponse as a field :In your main Activity you need to implements interface AsyncResponse.UPDATEI didn\'t know this is such a favourite to many of you. So here\'s the simple and convenience way to use interface.still using same interface. FYI, you may combine this into AsyncTask class.in AsyncTask class :do this in your Activity classOr, implementing the interface on the Activity again As you can see 2 solutions above, the first and third one, it needs to create method processFinish, the other one, the method is inside the caller parameter. The third  is more neat because there is no nested anonymous class. Hope this helpsThere are a few options:Nest the AsyncTask class within your Activity class. Assuming you don\'t use the same task in multiple activities, this is the easiest way. All your code stays the same, you just move the existing task class to be a nested class inside your activity\'s class.Create a custom constructor for your AsyncTask that takes a reference to your Activity. You would instantiate the task with something like new MyAsyncTask(this).execute(param1, param2).I felt the below approach is very easy.I have declared an interface for callbackThen created asynchronous Task for responding all type of parallel requestsThen Called the asynchronous task when clicking a button in activity Class.ThanksYou can try this code in your Main class. \nThat worked for me, but i have implemented  methods in other wayYou can do it in a few lines, just override onPostExecute when you call your AsyncTask. Here is an example for you:I hope it helped you, happy codding :)in your Oncreate():`}`Hi you can make something like this:Create class which implements AsyncTask Add in Main ActivityYou can write your own listener. It\'s same as HelmiB\'s answer but looks more natural:Create listener interface:Then write your asynchronous task:Finally implement listener in activity:And this is how you can call asyncTask:Create a static member in your Activity class. Then assign the value during the onPostExecuteFor example, if the result of your AsyncTask is a String, create a public static string in your Activitypublic static String dataFromAsyncTask;Then, in the onPostExecute of the AsyncTask, simply make a static call to your main class and set the value.MainActivity.dataFromAsyncTask = "result blah";Why do people make it so hard. This should be sufficient.Do not implement the onPostExecute on the async task, rather implement it on the Activity:You can call the get() method of AsyncTask (or the overloaded get(long, TimeUnit)).  This method will block until the AsyncTask has completed its work, at which point it will return you the Result.I make it work by using threading and handler/message.\nSteps as follow:\nDeclare a progress DialogCreate a function to close dialog when operation is finished.Code your Execution details:This answer might be late but I would like to mention few things when your Activity dependent on AsyncTask. That would help you in prevent crashes and memory management. As already mentioned in above answers go with interface, we also say them callbacks. They will work as an informer, but never ever send strong reference of Activity or interface always use weak reference in those cases.Please refer to below screenshot to findout how that can cause issues.As you can see if we started AsyncTask with a strong reference then there is no guarantee that our Activity/Fragment will be alive till we get data, so it would be better to use WeakReference in those cases and that will also help in memory management as we will never hold the strong reference of our Activity then it will be eligible for garbage collection after its distortion.Check below code snippet to find out how to use awesome WeakReference - MyTaskInformer.java Interface which will work as an informer.MySmallAsyncTask.java AsyncTask to do long running task, which will use WeakReference.MainActivity.java This class is used to start my AsyncTask implement interface on this class and override this mandatory method.
