I have just downloaded and installed Visual Studio 2012 Ultimate RC, but I\'m having an issue with the intellisense: it does not work until I press Ctrl+Space. Code suggestions are disabled also (method parameters for example). I think the problem is with the VS installation, because at the end of the process the following message is shown: "The event log file is full". Why do I have this problem, and what can I do to fix it?Go to Tools->Options->Text Editor->C# (or All Languages)->Generaland enable Auto List Members and Parameter Information in right hand side pane.Restarting VS2012 should fix the problem.Look at this post here.This worked for me:Delete the files in this folder. vs2010:vs2012;VS Ultimate 2013;VS Professional 2015;Another possible solution is to completely reset the settings. This is what fixed it for me: Tools->Import and Export settings->Reset all settings.A. Save or export out your Import/Export settings:Tools->Import and Export settingsB. Do the Import/ Export reset:Tools->Import and Export settings->Reset all settings.C. Go back and reload your original settings again! Intellisense works and you have your original settings back!I use this to solve it, go to cmd line The basic idea here is to force a resync of the database Intellisense is using. If the reference is to a project within your solution. Remove the project. Then add the reference using browse option from the exact path of the project you just removed. Do a quick build and check to ensure reference is picked up correctly. Now add the old project back to the solution and remove the old reference and add it as part of the solution. This idea of forcing the resync of the database could also be done in other ways too. For example by using an absolute folder path.  Resharper->Options->IntelliSense->General \nSet to \'Visual Studio native IntelliSense...\'It got frustrating for me as well but I figured out my own answer.  Restarting did help but I found why I ran into trouble: I\'d copied and pasted an ASP Panel with controls I\'d need to re-use.  I only had those in the first Div tag working.  All others needed to be set up, so I said "Aha ... let me comment out the remaining Div Tags that aren\'t set up ..." and sure enough, intellisense came right back on.So not only will it fail to work if the cursor is below a code error but it can fail to work if you\'re a copy / paste type like me.Its very Simple,Reason why it happend\nIn my case i have changed the references of some project None of the solutions worked for me. I noticed that the problem was only occuring in one xaml file, and not in other xaml or c# files.I had an extension called QuickConverter that allows to create custom bindings with in-line converters. This was messing up with Intellisense and this was not detected as an error while building or running the app.My advice is:I occasionally encountered the same problem as the OP.Unfortunately, none of the above solutions works for me. -- I also searched from internet for other possible solutions, including Microsoft\'s VS/windows forum, and did not find an answer.But when I closed the VS solution, there was a message asking me to download and install "Microsoft SQL Server Compact 4.0"; per this hint I finally fixed the problem.I hope this finding is of any help to others who may get the same issue.One solution is to disable the resharper, or spell checker extension and restart. \nGranted this is not ideal.In my case .csproj file got corrupted and Visual Studio excluded some class files from the solution (But they were still visible in Visual Studio so the issue wasn\'t obvious at first sight). In these files intellisense was not available. So the fix was to add the files back to the solution.I had been facing this problems since 2 weeks, finally figured it out using a Sysinternal tool called Process monitor (ProcMon.exe). The problem has to do with the automatic updates settings. I applied the below solution and got it workingSolution: Tools -> Options -> Environment -> Extensions and Updates -> (uncheck) Automatically check for updates->OKMy solution (VS 2013) was to run as an administratorSometime your code syntax has error, like you use " in ", it must be " ...\'...."\nFor help you quickly detect problems, you click Design button, vs try to render, and it will show the line of errorI\'ve just had this happen to me - and (while it was not instantly obvious) it was due to Resharper (R#) being disabled during a licensing issue.Enabling Resharper fixed this for me!Generally I face the same problem when I copy some snippets from internet with some special chars that breaks the Intellisense.It happened a few times with me, I discovered the problem after deleting the file and creating a new one, now when I face the same problem, fist I restart the Visual Studio, if this doesn\'t resolve the problem, I remove the last snippet I copied from internet and do it by hand, them the problem is gone.My quick solution was to close all opened files in text editor area and then reopen them again from Solution Explorer.
