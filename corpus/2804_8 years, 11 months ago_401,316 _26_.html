How can I replace Line Breaks within a string in C#?Use replace with Environment.NewLineAs mentioned in other posts, if the string comes from another environment (OS) then you\'d need to replace that particular environments implementation of new line control characters.The solutions posted so far either only replace Environment.NewLine or they fail if the replacement string contains line breaks because they call string.Replace multiple times.Here\'s a solution that uses a regular expression to make all three replacements in just one pass over the string. This means that the replacement string can safely contain line breaks.To extend The.Anyi.9\'s answer, you should also be aware of the different types of line break in general use.  Dependent on where your file originated, you may want to look at making sure you catch all the alternatives...should get you going...I would use Environment.Newline when I wanted to insert a newline for a string, but not to remove all newlines from a string.Depending on your platform you can have different types of  newlines, but even inside the same platform often different types of newlines are used. In particular when dealing with file formats and protocols.If your code is supposed to run in different environments, I would consider using the Environment.NewLine constant, since it is specifically the newline used in the specific environment.However, if you get the text from a file originating on another system, this might not be the correct answer, and you should replace with whatever newline constant is used on the other system. It will typically be \\n or \\r\\n.Don\'t forget that replace doesn\'t do the replacement in the string, but returns a new string with the characters replaced.  The following will remove line breaks (not replace them). I\'d use @Brian R. Bondy\'s method if replacing them with something else, perhaps wrapped as an extension method.  Remember to check for null values first before calling Replace or the extension methods provided.As extension methods:I needed to replace the \\r\\n with an actual carriage return and line feed and replace \\t with an actual tab.  So I came up with the following:To make sure all possible ways of line breaks (Windows, Mac and Unix) are replaced you should use:and in this order, to not to make extra line breaks, when you find some combination of line ending chars.Use the .Replace() methodBest way to replace linebreaks safely isthat should produce a string with only \\n (eg linefeed) as linebreaks.\nthis code is usefull to fix mixed linebreaks too.Why not both?Note: Replace strin with the name of your input string.As new line can be delimited by \\n, \\r and \\r\\n, first we\xe2\x80\x99ll replace \\r and \\r\\n with \\n, and only then split data string. The following lines should go to the parseCSV method:ordepending on which way you want to go.Hopes it helps.
