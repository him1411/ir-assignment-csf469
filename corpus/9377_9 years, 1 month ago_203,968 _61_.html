What fonts do you use for programming, and for what language/IDE?  I use Consolas for all my Visual Studio work, any other recommendations?Either Consolas (download) or Andale Mono (download). I mostly use Andale Mono. I wrote an article about programming fonts a long time ago, I think Consolas wasn\'t even out yet.http://www.deadprogrammer.com/photos/fonts.gifI find that typing Illegal1 = O0 is a good test of suitability.I\'ve really fallen in love with Droid Sans Mono.I really really like DejaVu Sans Mono. It is very clean and easy on the eyes.+1 for Monacoalt text http://img.skitch.com/20080908-nmjji28uerreqpprs1h86gxna9.pngJust beautiful and I find I can read it for hours on end.I use Consolas for everything, including Notepad++, SQL Studio, Eclipse, etc. I wish there was a Mac version. Also, if you notice, the text area field on Stack Overflow uses Consolas, so we have some other fans out there as well :pI like Envy Code R.\n+1 for Monaco, although this blog post is making me think about switching to Inconsolata.I\'m curious as to what point size y\'all use, I use the TextMate default size of 12pt.I use Bitstream Vera Sans Mono, but you need to activate ClearType to get it readable .I like the \'Illegal1 = O0\' readablility test, mentioned earlier in this thread, thanks for that.Anarch, 32 points, ofcourse. Code with style!anarch http://img525.imageshack.us/img525/1584/ss42po1.jpgFor UltraEdit and anything for that matter, I use the good old Courier New.alt text http://www.identifont.com/samples/microsoft/CourierNew.gifI\'ve found Consolas to difficult to read with it\'s over anti-aliasing.I use Lucida Console for years and never find anything better. However I tried a few times Consolas fonts and simply -- I prefer Lucida Console.I like Terminus for some command line stuff, at least scrolling log files and irssi/irc (TTF versions available). Screenshot of the terminus.ttf in action below (PuTTY on Windows XP with ClearType enabled).Screenshot of the terminus.ttf in action below (PuTTY on Windows XP with ClearType enabled). http://misc.nybergh.net/pub/fonts/terminus/2008-09-08_terminus_ttf_in_gnu_nano_putty_windows_xp_cleartype_screenshot.pngI use Consolas on my mac, BTW; here\'s a link to download the consolas TTF files if you want to install this (Mac/Win/Linux)./mpI don\'t use Consolas, though it does look good on LCD, but sometimes I\'m not on LCD, like when I\'m giving presentations and then it looks crap.My current font of choice for programming is the Liberation Mono font.Oh man, just discovered why the text on Stack Overflow looks like crap, it forces Consolas which is a cleartype font, and on my current setup which didn\'t have cleartype enabled, it looks very bad.Going to make a bugreport on uservoice.I have been using the Dina - http://www.donationcoder.com/Software/Jibz/Dina/index.html - font for awhile now for text editing and it seems to be doing the job nicely. ProFont.  Am I the only one still using it?I like Fixedsys in Visual Studio.  It\'s a classic.  No anti-aliasing blur.A excellent CodeProject article that list 33 fonts for programming (With examples of each)http://www.codeproject.com/KB/work/FontSurvey.aspxI\'m amazed nobody has mentioned Pragmata. It\'s the BMW of programming fonts. Condensed, readable, and the pinnacle of simple elegance.alt text http://www.fsd.it/fonts/imm/pr_abc.gifThere is now a fundraising project going on for PragmataPro (which covers a larger portion of Unicode than Pragmata) to make it available for free under a Creative Commons license!I use Inconsolata with UltraEdit on Windows. With TextMate (on the Mac) I prefer Monaco (it\'s the default font).Inconsolata 14pt in TextMateI like Profont, I first came across it when Jeff blogged about programming fontsI like Consolas too, but I also like Anonymous:  http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/anonymous.htmlAdding a vote for Consolas. It feels very easy on my eyes.I never found a reason to stray from Courier New. I don\'t think I\'d have a problem with any font so long as it\'s sans-serif. Mono-spaced fonts are nice for coding, too.I use a proportional font too.  They seem good for the same reasons they work in books and magazines: the more variation between characters, the easier it is for the brain to distinguish them; and you can fit more on the screen.  Indentation still works fine: 6 leading spaces is still twice as wide as 3 leading spaces.I use a version of Georgia that I hacked to make the lower case "l" look less like the digit "1", and put a slash through the zero.I think the anti-aliasing blur on Consolas is caused by monitors which do not have ClearType enabled. Consolas was designed for ClearType.[Jeff A: indeed, you can see screenshots of this in a post I wrote on this topic.]Instead of just chiming in with another vote for a particular font, I\'d recommend reading these comparisons of programming fonts where you can learn a little more:Jeff Atwood\'s excellent "round-up":\n  http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000157.htmlAnother review of 5 fonts with nice screenshots:\n  http://blog.hamstu.com/2008/02/03/the-typography-of-code/Two pages where there\'s a long list of programming fonts are these pages on keithdevens.com and lowing.org (dead link, but it\'s in the internet archive)Some other discussions of programming fonts that may have more suggestions are the comments to this blog post on typographica and this topic on a text editor\'s forum.Personally I like Triskweline:alt text http://www.netalive.org/tinkering/triskweline/shot.gifDejaVu Sans Mono (sometimes known as Panic Sans), size 11, anti-alised. Previously I only used fonts that weren\'t anti-aliased, but it just seems to work for this font.
