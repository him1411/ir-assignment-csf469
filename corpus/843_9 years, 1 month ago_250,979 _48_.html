Is it possible to undo the changes caused by the following command? If so, how?Pat Notz is correct.  You can get the commit back so long as it\'s been within a few days.  git only garbage collects after about a month or so unless you explicitly tell it to remove newer blobs.You can see in the example that the file2 was removed as a result of the hard reset, but was put back in place when I reset via the reflog.What you want to do is to specify the sha1 of the commit you want to restore to.  You can get the sha1 by examining the reflog (git reflog) and then doing git reset --hard <sha1 of desired commit>But don\'t wait too long... after a few weeks git will eventually see that commit as unreferenced and delete all the blobs.The answer is hidden in the detailed response above, you can simply do:(See the output of git reflog show)It is possible to recover it if Git hasn\'t garbage collected yet.Get an overview of dangling commits with fsck:Recover the dangling commit with rebase:If you\'re really lucky, like I was, you can go back into your text editor and hit \'undo\'.I know that\'s not really a proper answer, but it saved me half a day\'s work so hopefully it\'ll do the same for someone else!If you have not yet garbage collected your repository (e.g. using git repack -d or git gc, but note that garbage collection can also happen automatically), then your commit is still there\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 it\'s just no longer reachable through the HEAD.You can try to find your commit by looking through the output of git fsck --lost-found.Newer versions of Git have something called the "reflog", which is a log of all changes that are made to the refs (as opposed to changes that are made to the repository contents). So, for example, every time you switch your HEAD (i.e. every time you do a git checkout to switch branches) that will be logged. And, of course, your git reset also manipulated the HEAD, so it was also logged. You can access older states of your refs in a similar way that you can access older states of your repository, by using an @ sign instead of a ~, like git reset HEAD@{1}.It took me a while to understand what the difference is between HEAD@{1} and HEAD~1, so here is a little explanation:So, HEAD~1 means "go to the commit before the commit that HEAD currently points at", while HEAD@{1} means "go to the commit that HEAD pointed at before it pointed at where it currently points at".That will easily allow you to find your lost commit and recover it.as far as i know, --hard will discards uncommitted changes. Since these aren\'t tracked by git. but you can undo the discarded commit.will lists:where 4bac331 is the discarded commit.Now just move the head to that commit::Depending on the state your repository was in when you ran the command, the effects of git reset --hard can range from trivial to undo, to basically impossible.Below I have listed a range of different possible scenarios, and how you might recover from them.This situation usually occurs when you run git reset with an argument, as in git reset --hard HEAD~. Don\'t worry, this is easy to recover from!If you just ran git reset and haven\'t done anything else since, you can get back to where you were with this one-liner:This resets your current branch whatever state it was in before the last time it was modified (in your case, the most recent modification to the branch would be the hard reset you are trying to undo).If, however, you have made other modifications to your branch since the reset, the one-liner above won\'t work. Instead, you should run git reflog <branchname> to see a list of all recent changes made to your branch (including resets). That list will look something like this:Find the operation in this list that you want to "undo". In the example above, it would be the first line, the one that says "reset: moving to HEAD~". Then copy the representation of the commit before (below) that operation. In our case, that would be master@{1} (or 3ae5027, they both represent the same commit), and run git reset --hard <commit> to reset your current branch back to that commit. This is a bit trickier to recover from. git does have copies of the files you added, but since these copies were never tied to any particular commit you can\'t restore the changes all at once. Instead, you have to locate the individual files in git\'s database and restore them manually. You can do this using git fsck.For details on this, see Undo git reset --hard with uncommitted files in the staging area.Uh oh. I hate to tell you this, but you\'re probably out of luck. git doesn\'t store changes that you don\'t add or commit to it, and according to the documentation for git reset:--hardResets the index and working tree. Any changes to tracked files in the working tree since <commit> are discarded.It\'s possible that you might be able to recover your changes with some sort of disk recovery utility or a professional data recovery service, but at this point that\'s probably more trouble than it\'s worth.I know this is an old thread... but as many people are searching for ways to undo stuff in Git, I still think it may be a good idea to continue giving tips here.When you do a "git add" or move anything from the top left to the bottom left in git gui the content of the file is stored in a blob and the file content is possible to recover from that blob.  So it is possible to recover a file even if it was not committed but it has to have been added.Now the blob is created but it is referenced by the index so it will no be listed with git fsck until we reset. So we reset... you will get a dangling blob ce013625030ba8dba906f756967f9e9ca394464a  will give you the file content "hello" backTo find unreferenced commits I found a tip somewhere suggesting this.  I have it as a tool in git gui and it is very handy.Made a tiny script to make it slightly easier to find the commit one is looking for:git fsck --lost-found | grep commit | cut -d \' \' -f 3 | xargs -i git show \\{\\} | egrep \'^commit |Date:\'Yes, it can be made considerably prettier with awk or something like it, but it\'s simple and I just needed it. Might save someone else 30 seconds.I\'ve just did a hard reset on wrong project. What saved my life was Eclipse\'s local history. IntelliJ Idea is said to have one, too, and so may your editor, it\'s worth checking:
