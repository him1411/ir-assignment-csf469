I have been a long time user of the standard Mac Terminal. Decided to experiment with iTerm2 after hearing good things about it from my colleagues.One of the more useful features I am seeing on iTerm2 is its split panes (much like vim split buffers).In vim, I can move between split buffers using Ctrl+W+arrowkeys. Is there a keyboard shortcut for iTerm2 to move between panes as well?From the documentation:Cmd] and Cmd[  navigates among split panes in order of use.Cmd-opt-arrow keys navigate similarly to vim\'s C-w hjkl.\xe2\x8c\x98+\xe2\x8c\xa5+\xe2\x86\x90/\xe2\x86\x91/\xe2\x86\x92/\xe2\x86\x93 will let you navigate split panes in the direction of the arrow, i.e. when using \xe2\x8c\x98+D to split panes vertically, \xe2\x8c\x98+\xe2\x8c\xa5+\xe2\x86\x90 and \xe2\x8c\x98+\xe2\x8c\xa5+\xe2\x86\x92 will let you switch between the panes.Spanish ISO:I was using Terminator before, so I found it convenient to re-map Alt + arrow-key to switch between the panes. This can be done in Preferences -> Keys -> Key Mappings - press the \'+\' button to add a mapping. Also, in my case such a mapping was already defined in Profiles, I simply removed it.
