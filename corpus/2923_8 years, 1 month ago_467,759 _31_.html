I have an action I call from an anchor thusly, Site/Controller/Action/ID where ID is an int.Later on I need to redirect to this same Action from a Controller.Is there a clever way to do this? Currently I\'m stashing ID in tempdata, but when you \nhit f5 to refresh the page again after going back, the tempdata is gone and the page crashes.You can pass the id as part of the routeValues parameter of the RedirectToAction() method.This will cause a redirect to Site/Controller/Action/99. No need for temp or any kind of view data.Kurt\'s answer should be right, from my research, but when I tried it I had to do this to get it to actually work for me:If I didn\'t specify the controller and the action in the RouteValueDictionary it didn\'t work.Also when coded like this, the first parameter (Action) seems to be ignored. So if you just specify the controller in the Dict, and expect the first parameter to specify the Action, it does not work either.If you are coming along later, try Kurt\'s answer first, and if you still have issues try this one.RedirectToAction with parameter:MVC 4 example...Note that you do not always have to pass parameter named IDAnd,Of course you can assign string to model fields instead of using ViewBag if that is your preference.If your parameter happens to be a complex object, this solves the problem. The key is the RouteValueDictionary constructor.If you happen to have collections, it makes it a bit trickier, but this other answer covers this very nicely.........I had this issue as well, and quite a nice way to do it if you are within the same controller is to use named parameters:It is also worth noting that you can pass through more than 1 parameter.  id will be used to make up part of the URL and any others will be passed through as parameters after a ? in the url and will be UrlEncoded as default.e.g.So the url would be:These can then be referenced by your controller:If one want to Show error message for [httppost] then he/she can try by passing an ID usingfor Details like thisHope it works fine.This might be years ago but anyways, this also depends on your Global.asax map route since you may add or edit parameters to fit what you want.eg.Global.asax then the parameters you\'ll need to pass will change to:If your need to redirect to an action outside the controller this will work.
