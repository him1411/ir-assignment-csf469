When I use any command with sudo the enviroment variables are not there. For example after setting HTTP_PROXY the command wget works fine without sudo. However if I type sudo wget it says it can\'t bypass the proxy setting.First you need to export HTTP_PROXY. Second, you need to read man sudo carefully, and pay attention to the -E flag. This works:Here is the quote from the man page:The trick is to add environment variables to sudoers file via sudo visudo command and add these lines:taken from ArchLinux wiki.For Ubuntu 14, you need to specify in separate lines as it returns the errors for multi-variable lines:  For individual variables you want to make available on a one off basis you can make it part of the command.You can also combine the two env_keep statements in Ahmed Aswani\'s answer into a single statement like this:Defaults env_keep += "http_proxy https_proxy"You should also consider specifying env_keep for only a single command like this:Defaults!/bin/[your_command] env_keep += "http_proxy https_proxy"
