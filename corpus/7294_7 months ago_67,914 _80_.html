After updating to android studio 2.3 I got this error message.\nI know it\'s just a hint as the app run normally but it\'s really strange.All com.android.support libraries must use the exact same version specification (mixing versions can lead to runtime crashes). Found versions 25.1.1, 24.0.0. Examples include com.android.support:animated-vector-drawable:25.1.1 and com.android.support:mediarouter-v7:24.0.0my gradle:You can solve this with one of the following solutions:inspired by CommonsWare answer:Run a Gradle dependency report to see what your full tree of\ndependencies is.From there, you will see which one of your libraries are asking for a different version of the Android Support libraries.\nFor whatever it is asking for, you can ask for it directly with the\n25.2.0 version or use Gradle\'s other conflict resolution approaches to get the same versions.Run:Example:For me, the error disappeared after removing com.google.android.gms:play-services:10.2.0And only include com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:10.2.0 and com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps:10.2.0 as they are the only two play services that I use.I think the gms:play-services depend on some old components of the support library, so we need to add them explicitly ourselves.As of gradle plugin version: 3.0 compile has been replaced by implementation or api see this answer for the difference.hence use instead:and search for the conflicted version.if someone knows a better way in the know gradle plugin please let me know.E.g.:Pay attention to the little information window that say something about the error, it says the examples that you have to change and add.In this case:Found versions 25.1.1, 24.0.0. Examples include com.android.support:animated-vector-drawable:25.1.1 and\n  com.android.support:mediarouter-v7:24.0.0Your com.android.support:animated-vector-drawable:25.1.1is version 25.1.1, and your com.android.support:mediarouter-v7:24.0.0is version 24.0.0, so you have to add the mediarouter with the same version:And do that for every example that the little information window says, in this case all the libraries that doesn\'t have the version 25.1.1.You have to sync the gradle after you fix the indicated library to see the next library and package that you have to change.IMPORTANT:You also can use another method to see the difference of the versions of all the libraries that you are actually compiling (like run a gradle dependency report or go to your libraries files), the real objetive is compile all the libraries that you are using with the same version.I had the exact same problem after updating to Android Studio 2.3Adding this line to dependencies solved my problem:I just add this :Updated for new SDK versionsA) Run gradle dependencies or ./gradlew dependenciesB) Look at your tree and figure out which of your dependencies is specifying a different support library version for a dependency you don\'t control.I didn\'t realize that this warning also displays if the dependency is completely unused directly by your own code. In my case, Facebook specifies some support libs I wasn\'t using, you can see below most of those dependencies were overridden by my own specification of 25.2.0, denoted by the -> X.X.X (*) symbols. The card view and custom tabs libs weren\'t overridden by anyone, so I need to ask for 25.2.0 for those ones myself even though I don\'t use them.Use variables: Doing something like the following will make it easier for you to ensure that you use the same version with all librariesUse support-v13 instead of support-v4My problem is similar to yours.\nHere exist an error!compile \'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:25.3.0\'All com.android.support libraries must use the exact same version specification (mixing versions can lead to runtime crashes). Found versions 25.3.0, 24.0.0. Examples include \'com.android.support:animated-vector-drawable:25.3.0\' and \'com.android.support:mediarouter-v7:24.0.0\'Seeing this \nExamples include \'com.android.support:animated-vector-drawable:25.3.0\' and \'com.android.support:mediarouter-v7:24.0.0\'the just add these codes in dependencies, make sure that versions are same.I got the same error after adding compile \'com.google.android.gms:play-services:10.2.4\' with compile \'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:25.3.1\'.Adding animated-vector-drawable and mediarouter libs fixed the issue.I used these two to solve my problem after upgrading to android studio 2.3I had the same problem before and I got the solution for it.I just added the libraries that had the another version but with the same version of my support:appcompat.For your error for example :All com.android.support libraries must use the exact same version\n  specification (mixing versions can lead to runtime crashes). Found\n  versions 25.1.1, 24.0.0. Examples include\n  com.android.support:animated-vector-drawable:25.1.1 and\n  com.android.support:mediarouter-v7:24.0.0*The solution is to compile the versions of these libraries like that :compile \'com.android.support:mediarouter-v7:25.1.1\'-if another library had the same issue and had another version just compile it with your support:appcompat versionThis resolved my problem and I hope it resolves yours.Best wishes :)You have defined any other dependency to compile with version 24.0.0 instead of 25.1.1. Please set all dependencies version the same as 25.1.1.Open the external library of your project you will see that some library still using previous version although you didn\'t mention those library so my suggestion is just use the particular library version for those it will solve your problem.I just update my Android Support Repository to (revision: 44.0.0);\nthen Android SDK tools and Emulator to latest version 25.3.1 from sdk manager> SDK tools\nAnd it solved my problem.I got this problem after updating to Android Studio 2.3Adding these lines in dependencies solved my problemI had to add the following lines in gradle to remove the errorremplace this by this rebuild and good codingI managed to compile (not very clean) by addingFor me, the error was a result of a third-party library that I imported that used older Google Support Library modules. I simply updated them to the latest version (checking on Github for example), and the error was gone. I suggest checking all the non-Google libraries that you included in your build.gradle are up to date.Try To make the build tools exactly the same version of support libraryexample Had the same issue after updating to Android Studio 2.3, the fix was to add the following package in the build.gradle:compile \'com.android.support:support-v13:25.3.1\'Note: Change the version to match other support library packages used in your projectI ran ./gradlew tasks --all and checked for dependencies that were a different version from the targeted version (25.3.1). You\'ll get something like this:In this case, I was targeting 25.3.1, and had some dependencies targeting different versions when I ran this command. The trick is to identify the dependencies in this list that are targeting previous versions, and overriding that by importing the most recent version of the dependency in Gradle.Make sure all Facebook SDK dependencies use the same support library version of your project:Another thing that could cause this issue, is if you got declarations like this:That + means taking the latest version which might be a later version than the 25.3.1. Replace the + with the specific version like 25.3.1 like this:and it will solve the issueThere\'s only one way...and you have to manually do it...\ngo to build.gradle check assign all dependencies to same versions..\nand it should work..
