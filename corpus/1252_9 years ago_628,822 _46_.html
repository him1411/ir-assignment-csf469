Is there a command or an existing script that will let me view all of a *NIX system\'s scheduled cron jobs at once? I\'d like it to include all of the user crontabs, as well as /etc/crontab, and whatever\'s in /etc/cron.d. It would also be nice to see the specific commands run by run-parts in /etc/crontab.Ideally, I\'d like the output in a nice column form and ordered in some meaningful way.I could then merge these listings from multiple servers to view the overall "schedule of events."I was about to write such a script myself, but if someone\'s already gone to the trouble...You would have to run this as root, but:will loop over each user name listing out their crontab.  The crontabs are owned by the respective users so you won\'t be able to see another user\'s crontab w/o being them or root.Edit\nif you want to know which user a crontab belongs to, use echo $userI ended up writing a script (I\'m trying to teach myself the finer points of bash scripting, so that\'s why you don\'t see something like Perl here). It\'s not exactly a simple affair, but it does most of what I need. It uses Kyle\'s suggestion for looking up individual users\' crontabs, but also deals with /etc/crontab (including the scripts launched by run-parts in /etc/cron.hourly, /etc/cron.daily, etc.) and the jobs in the /etc/cron.d directory. It takes all of those and merges them into a display something like the following:Note that it shows the user, and more-or-less sorts by hour and minute so that I can see the daily schedule.So far, I\'ve tested it on Ubuntu, Debian, and Red Hat AS.Under Ubuntu or debian, you can view crontab by /var/spool/cron/crontabs/ and then a file for each user is in there. That\'s only for user-specific crontab\'s of course.This will show all crontab entries from all users.Depends on your linux version but I use: as root. Very simple and very short.Gives me output like:A small refinement of Kyle Burton\'s answer with improved output formatting:This avoids messing with passwd directly, skips users that have no cron entries and for those who have them it prints out the username as well as their crontab.Mostly dropping this here though so i can find it later in case i ever need to search for it again.If you check a cluster using NIS, the only way to see if a user has a crontab entry ist according to Matt\'s answer /var/spool/cron/tabs.I like the simple one-liner answer above:for user in $(cut -f1 -d: /etc/passwd); do crontab -u $user -l; doneBut Solaris which does not have the -u flag and does not print the user it\'s checking, you can modify it like so:You will get a list of users without the errors thrown by crontab when an account is not allowed to use cron etc.  Be aware that in Solaris, roles can be in /etc/passwd too (see /etc/user_attr).Depends on your version of cron.  Using Vixie cron on FreeBSD, I can do something like this:if I want it more tab deliminated, I might do something like this:Where that\'s a literal tab in the sed replacement portion.It may be more system independent to loop through the users in /etc/passwd and do crontab -l -u $user for each of them.The following strips away comments, empty lines, and errors from users with no crontab. All you\'re left with is a clear list of users and their jobs. Note the use of sudo in the 2nd line. If you\'re already root, remove that.Example output: I use this on Ubuntu (12 thru 16) and Red Hat (5 thru 7).Thanks for this very useful script. I had some tiny problems running it on old systems (Red Hat Enterprise 3, which handle differently egrep and tabs in strings), and other systems with nothing in /etc/cron.d/ (the script then ended with an error). So here is a patch to make it work in such cases :I\'m not really sure the changes in the first egrep are a good idea, but well, this script has been tested on RHEL3,4,5 and Debian5 without any problem. Hope this helps!Building on top of @Kyle    to avoid the comments usually at the top of /etc/passwd,And on macosx    I think a better one liner would be below. For example if you have users in NIS or LDAP they wouldnt be in /etc/passwd.  This will give you the crontabs of every user that has logged in.you can write for all user list :You can also go to this file will list the schedulesSince it is a matter of looping through a file (/etc/passwd) and performing an action, I am missing the proper approach on How can I read a file (data stream, variable) line-by-line (and/or field-by-field)?:This reads /etc/passwd line by line using : as field delimiter. By saying read -r user _, we make $user hold the first field and _ the rest (it is just a junk variable to ignore fields).This way, we can then call crontab -u using the variable $user, which we quote for safety (what if it contains spaces? It is unlikely in such file, but you can never know).This script worked for me in CentOS to list all crons in the environment:For me look at /var/spool/cron/crontabs is the best wayThis script outputs the Crontab to a file and also lists all users confirming those which have no crontab entry:
