I have an array of elements in RubyI need to remove  elements with value 3 for exampleHow do I do that?I think I\'ve figured it out:Borrowing from Travis in the comments, this is a better answer:I personally like [1, 2, 7, 4, 5] - [7] which results in => [1, 2, 4, 5] from irbI modified his answer seeing that 3 was the third element in his example array. This could lead to some confusion for those who don\'t realize that 3 is in position 2 in the array. Another option:which results inI like the -=[4] way mentioned in other answers  to delete the elements whose value are 4.But there is this way:mentioned somewhere in "Basic Array Operations", after it mentions the map function.A .delete_at(3) 3 here being the position.You can simply run:Assuming you want to delete 3 by value at multiple places in an array,\nI think the ruby way to do this task would be to use the delete_if method:You can also use delete_if in removing elements in the scenario of \'array of arrays\'.Hope this resolves your queryHere are some benchmarks:And again with a bigger array containing lots of duplicates:And even bigger with more duplicates:I\'m not sure if anyone has stated this, but Array.delete() and -= value will delete every instance of the value passed to it within the Array. In order to delete the first instance of the particular element you could do something likeThere could be a simpler way. I\'m not saying this is best practice, but it is something that should be recognized.I improved Niels\'s solutionNow you can useYou can also monkey patch it. I never understood why Ruby has an except method for Hash but not for Array:Now you can do:Or:So when you have multiple occurrences of 3 and you want only to delete the first occurrence of 3, you can simply do some thing as below.
