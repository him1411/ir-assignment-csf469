I\'m adding UTC time strings to Bitbucket API responses that currently only contain Amsterdam (!) time strings. For consistency with the UTC time strings returned elsewhere, the desired format is 2011-11-03 11:07:04 (followed by +00:00, but that\'s not germane).What\'s the best way to create such a string (without a microsecond component) from a datetime instance with a microsecond component?I\'ll add the best option that\'s occurred to me as a possible answer, but there may well be a more elegant solution.Edit: I should mention that I\'m not actually printing the current time \xe2\x80\x93 I used datetime.now to provide a quick example. So the solution should not assume that any datetime instances it receives will include microsecond components.Yet another option:By default this uses local time, if you need UTC you can use the following:Keep the first 19 characters that you wanted via slicing:This is the way I do it. ISO format:You can replace the \'T\' if you don\'t want ISO format:In Python 3.6:https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.isoformatSince not all datetime.datetime instances have a microsecond component (i.e. when it is zero), you can partition the string on a "." and take only the first item, which will always work:from datetime import datetime\n  now = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S.%f")
