When I use a select2 (input) in bootstrap modal, I can\'t type anything into it. It\'s like disabled? Outside he modal select2 works fine.working example: http://jsfiddle.net/byJy8/1/\ncode:adn jsanswers:here you can find a quick fixand here is \'the right way\': Select2 doesn't work when embedded in a bootstrap modalOk, I\'ve got it to work.changeto(remove  tabindex="-1" from modal)I found a solution to this on github for select2https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2/issues/1436The solution is:Explanation copied from link above:Bootstrap registers a listener to the focusin event which checks whether the focused element is either the overlay itself or a descendent of it - if not it just refocuses on the overlay. With the select2 dropdown being attached to the body this effectively prevents you from entering anything into the the textfield.You can quickfix this by overwriting the enforceFocus function which registers the event on the modalFor Select2 v4:Use \'dropdownParent\' to attach the dropdown to the modal dialog, rather than the HTML body. This will attach the Select2 dropdown so it falls within the DOM of the modal rather than to the HTML body (the default). See https://select2.github.io/options-old.html#dropdownParentThis is my solution with select2 4.0.0. Just override the css right below the select2.css import. \nPlease make sure the z-index is greater than your dialog or modal. I just add 2000 on the default ones. Cause my dialogs\' z-index are about 1000.Just remove tabindex="-1" and add styles="overflow:hidden"change select2.css filetoJust to understand better how tabindex elements works to complete accepted answer :The tabindex global attribute is an integer indicating if the element can take input focus (is focusable), if it should participate to sequential keyboard navigation, and if so, at what position. It can take several values:\n    -a negative value means that the element should be focusable, but should not be reachable via sequential keyboard navigation;\n  \n    -0 means that the element should be focusable and reachable via sequential keyboard navigation, but its relative order is defined by the platform convention;\n  \n    -a positive value means should be focusable and reachable via sequential keyboard navigation; its relative order is defined by the value of the attribute: the sequential follow the increasing number of the tabindex. If several elements share the same tabindex, their relative order follows their relative position in the document.from : Mozilla Devlopper NetworkI had the same issue, updating z-index for .select2-container should do the trick. Make sure your modal\'s z-index is lower than select2\'s.Updated:\nIn case above code doesn\'t work properly, also remove tabindexes from your modal as  @breq suggestedJus use this code on Document.read()If you use jquery mobile popup you must rewrite _handleDocumentFocusIn function:I have the same problem with the select2 in bootstrap modal, and the solution was to remove the overflow-y: auto; and overflow: hidden; from .modal-open and .modal classesHere is the example of using jQuery to remove the overflow-y:i had this problem before , i am using yii2 and i solved it this way Just FYI, you can also try to load select2 late to make it work too:
