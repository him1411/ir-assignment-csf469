I\'m trying to split text in a JTextArea using a regex to split the String by \\n However, this does not work and I also tried by \\r\\n|\\r|n and many other combination of regexes.\nCode:This should cover you:There\'s only really two newlines (UNIX and Windows) that you need to worry about.If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want empty lines:split method is using regex (regular expressions). Since Java 8 regex supports \\R which represents (from documentation of Pattern class):Linebreak matcher\n  \\R         Any Unicode linebreak sequence, is equivalent to\n  \\u000D\\u000A|[\\u000A\\u000B\\u000C\\u000D\\u0085\\u2028\\u2029]So we can use it to match:As you see \\r\\n is placed at start of regex which ensures that regex will try to first match this pair, and only if it fails it will try to match single character line separators.So if you want to split on line separator use split("\\\\R"). If you don\'t want to remove from resulting array trailing empty strings "" use split(regex, limit) with negative limit parameter like split("\\\\R", -1).If you want to treat one or more continues empty lines as single delimiter use split("\\\\R+").This should be system independentYou don\'t have to double escape characters in character groups.For all non empty lines use:Maybe this would work:Remove the double backslashes from the parameter of the split method:The above code doesnt actually do anything visible - it just calcualtes then dumps the calculation. Is it the code you used, or just an example for this question? try doing textAreaDoc.insertString(int, String, AttributeSet) at the end?For preserving empty lines from getting squashed use:All answers given here actually do not respect Javas definition of new lines as given in e.g. BufferedReader#readline. Java is accepting \\n, \\r and \\r\\n as new line. Some of the answers match multiple empty lines or malformed files. E..g. <sometext>\\n\\r\\n<someothertext> when using [\\r\\n]+would result in two lines. In contrast, the answer above has the following properties:String lines[] =String.split( System.lineSeparator())After failed attempts on the basis of all given solutions. I replace \\n with some special word and then split. For me following did the trick:I couldn\'t replicate the example given in the question. But, I guess this logic can be applied.As an alternative to the previous answers, guava\'s Splitter API can be used if other operations are to be applied to the resulting lines, like trimming lines or filtering empty lines :Note that the result is an Iterable and not an array.
