I\'ve taken a look at the list of surveys taken on scala-lang.org and noticed a curious question: "Can you name all the uses of \xe2\x80\x9c_\xe2\x80\x9d?". Can you? If yes, please do so here. Explanatory examples are appreciated.The ones I can think of areThere may be others I have forgotten!Example showing why foo(_) and foo _ are different:This example comes from 0__:In the first case, process _ represents a method; Scala takes the polymorphic method and attempts to make it monomorphic by filling in the type parameter, but realizes that there is no type that can be filled in for A that will give the type (_ => Unit) => ? (Existential _ is not a type).In the second case, process(_) is a lambda; when writing a lambda with no explicit argument type, Scala infers the type from the argument that foreach expects, and _ => Unit is a type (whereas just plain _ isn\'t), so it can be substituted and inferred.This may well be the trickiest gotcha in Scala I have ever encountered.From (my entry) in the FAQ, which I certainly do not guarantee to be complete (I added two entries just two days ago):This is also part of this question.An excellent explanation of the uses of the underscore is Scala _ [underscore] magic.Examples:In Scala, _ acts similar to * in Java while importing packages.In Scala, a getter and setter will be implicitly defined for all non-private vars in a object. The getter name is same as the variable name and _= is added for the setter name.Usage:If you try to assign a function to a new variable, the function will be invoked and the result will be assigned to the variable. This confusion occurs due to the optional braces for method invocation. We should use _ after the function name to assign it to another variable.There is one usage I can see everyone here seems to have forgotten to list...Rather than doing this:You could can simply do this:Here are some more examples where _ is used:In all above examples one underscore represents an element in the list (for reduce the first underscore represents the accumulator) Besides the usages that JAiro mentioned, I like this one:If someone needs all connection properties, he can do:If you need just a host and a port, you can do:
