This question already has an answer here:When I give an image a percent width or height only it will grow/shrink keeping its aspect ratio, but if I want the same effect with another element, is it possible at all to tie the width and the height together using percentage?You can do this using pure CSS; no JavaScript needed. This utilizes the (somewhat counterintuitive) fact that padding-top percentages are relative to the containing block\'s width. Here\'s an example:Bumming off Chris\'s idea, another option is to use pseudo elements so you don\'t need to use an absolutely positioned internal element.I\'ve put together a demo here: http://codepen.io/tcmulder/pen/iqnDrThe key thing to note here is vw = viewport width, and vh = viewport heightThat\'s my solutionhttp://jsfiddle.net/aG4Fs/3/Working example: http://jsfiddle.net/QtftX/1/
