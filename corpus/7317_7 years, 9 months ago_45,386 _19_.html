I like to use Eclipse\'s shortcut Ctrl + O which outlines the current source. Is there an equivalent shortcut in IntelliJ IDEA?It opens a dialog which allows for quick search of methods and fields in a class.I haven\'t used Eclipse for years, so I\'m not that familiar with the behaviour you\'re after - but I believe Ctrl + F12 may do what you want: it is the shortcut for the File structure Popup in the default mapping.For IntelliJ 14 or 15 or 2016:Ctrl + F3 in Idea is the equivalent of Ctrl + O in Eclipse.The thread is old. Just thought might be useful for someone lookin for the same answer...For Intellij 13 on ubuntu the shortcut is Alt+7 you can make the window floating to simulate the Eclipse behavior using the top-right setting icon, also unselect the pinned mode option for Esc to work. On MacOSX 10.8.5, CmdF12 did not work for me. I had to use FnCmdF12Ctrl + F12 or search "File Structure" in keymapPress SHIFT TWO times and you can search anything, both class and method in the whole project.Ctrl + F12 works for me. I\'m using intellij IDEA CE 12 with default keymap.All these answers are subjective, because they depend on your platform, keymap and IntelliJ version.I believe the \'Structure\' tool is what you\'re looking for. In Idea 13, View \xe2\x86\x92 Tool Windows \xe2\x86\x92 Structure will open the view, and along the way, the menu will show you the applicable keyboard shortcut for your setup.Ctrl+F12 mimics the same functionality. \nYou can also use this link which gives Eclipse and corresponding IntelliJ IDEA shortcuts.It is possible to use eclipse keymap in intellij by clicking Alt+\' -> keymap. Then select eclipse keymap.I think here you can found out the most useful shortcuts for Idea as an Eclipse user... \nEclipse "Quick outline" Ctrl+O (Windows) is an equivalent Idea "File Structure" Ctrl+F12!Ctrl+F12 works, because it is for file structure popup, which is similar to showing code in Eclipse.The shortcuts are:\nCtrl+Shift+N for files\nCtrl+N for classesCtrl + Alt + L is the one you\'re looking for.
