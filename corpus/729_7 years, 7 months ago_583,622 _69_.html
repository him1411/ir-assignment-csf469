How to open an URL from code in the built-in web browser rather than within my application?I tried this: but I got an Exception:Try this:That works fine for me.As for the missing "http://" I\'d just do something like this:I would also probably pre-populate your EditText that the user is typing a URL in with "http://".happy coding!In 2.3, I had better luck withThe difference being the use of Intent.ACTION_VIEW rather than the String "android.intent.action.VIEW"You can see the official sample from Android Developer.Please have a look at the constructor of Intent:You can pass android.net.Uri instance to the 2nd parameter, and a new Intent is created based on the given data url. And then, simply call startActivity(Intent intent) to start a new Activity, which is bundled with the Intent with the given URL.Yes. The docs says:If there are no apps on the device that can receive the implicit intent, your app will crash when it calls startActivity(). To first verify that an app exists to receive the intent, call resolveActivity() on your Intent object. If the result is non-null, there is at least one app that can handle the intent and it\'s safe to call startActivity(). If the result is null, you should not use the intent and, if possible, you should disable the feature that invokes the intent.You can write in one line when creating the Intent instance like below:Try this:or if you want then web browser open in your activity then do like this:and if you want to use zoom control in your browser then you can use:If you want to show user a dialogue with all browser list, so he can choose preferred, here is sample code: other option In Load Url in Same Application using WebviewJust like the solutions other have written (that work fine), I would like to answer the same thing, but with a tip that I think most would prefer to use.In case you wish the app you start to open in a new task, indepandant of your own, instead of staying on the same stack, you can use this code:You can also go this wayIn xml :In java code :In Manifest dont forget to add internet permission...  A short code version...Within in your try block,paste the following code,Android Intent uses directly the link within the URI(Uniform Resource Identifier) braces in order to identify the location of your link.You can try this:Webview can be used to load Url in your applicaion.\nURL can be provided from user in text view or you can hardcode it.Also don\'t forget internet permissions in AndroidManifest.  Chrome custom tabs are now available:The first step is adding the Custom Tabs Support Library to your build.gradle file:And then, to open a chrome custom tab:For more info:\nhttps://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/android/customtabs Simple, website view via intent,use this simple code toview your website in android app.Add internet permission in manifest file,Check whether your url is correct.\nFor me there was an unwanted space before url.Basic Introduction: https:// is using that one into the "code" so that no one in between can read them. This keeps your information safe from hackers.    http:// is using just sharing purpose, it\'s not secured.     About Your Problem:\nXML designing: Activity Designing: Android Manifest.Xml permissions:    1.getting The Manifest permissions\n2.excess space\'s between url\n3.Check your url\'s correct or not  I think this is the bestPut below code into global classThe response of MarkB is right. In my case I\'m using Xamarin, and the code to use with C# and Xamarin is:This information is taked from: https://developer.xamarin.com/recipes/android/fundamentals/intent/open_a_webpage_in_the_browser_application/Based on the answer by Mark B and the comments bellow:If you want to do this with XML not programmatically you can use on your TextView:This way uses a method, to allow you to input any String instead of having a fixed input. This does save some lines of code if used a repeated amount of times, as you only need three lines to call the method.Using this method makes it universally usable. IT doesn\'t have to be placed in a specific activity, as you can use it like this:Or if you want to start it outside an activity, you simply call startActivity on the activity instance:As seen in both of these code blocks there is a null-check. This is as it returns null if there is no app to handle the intent. This method defaults to HTTP if there is no protocol defined, as there are websites who don\'t have an SSL certificate(what you need for an HTTPS connection) and those will stop working if you attempt to use HTTPS and it isn\'t there. Any website can still force over to HTTPS, so those sides lands you at HTTPS either wayBecause this method uses outside resources to display the page, there is no need for you to declare the INternet permission. The app that displays the webpage has to do thatandroid.webkit.URLUtil has the method guessUrl(String) working perfectly fine (even with file:// or data://) since Api level 1 (Android 1.0). Use as:In the Activity call:Check the complete guessUrl code for more info.Try this..Worked for me! xml code :- --------- OR------------------
