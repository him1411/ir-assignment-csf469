I\'ve made an Android application that is available on Google Play. Now I want to add some more formatting to my app description (eg. indent, links, lists..). But I cannot find any website where possible formatting is listed. Google Help pages cannot help me either on this subject. There exists a lot of different formats and I don\'t really know which one to use (eg. HTML or wiki formatting..)I could test it with trial and error, but that would take some time, because Google Play only refreshes after 2-3 hours. And while I\'m testing, my app description would be rather ugly if the wrong format was used.tl;dr Is there a list of all possible formatting I could use in the app description for Google Play? Experimentally, I\'ve discovered that you can provide:Special notes concerning only Google Play app:Special notes concerning only Google Play website:As a matter of fact, HTML character entites also work : http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/sgml/entities.html.It lets you insert special characters like bullets \'•\' (&bull;), \'™\' (&trade;), ... the HTML way.Note that you can also (and probably should) type special characters directly in the form fields if you can enter international characters.=> one consideration here is whether or not you care about third-party sites that collect data on your app from Google Play : some might simply take it as HTML content, others might insert it in a native application that just understand plain Unicode...Currently (July 2015), HTML escape sequences (&bull; &#8226;) do not work in browser version of Play Store, they\'re displayed as text. Though, Play Store app handles them as expected.So, if you\'re after the unicode bullet point in your app/update description [that\'s what\'s got you here, most likely], just copy-paste the bullet character  PS You can also use unicode input combo to get the characterLinux: CtrlShiftu 2022 Enter or SpaceMac: Hold \xe2\x8c\xa5 2022 release \xe2\x8c\xa5Windows: Hold Alt 2022 release AltMac and Windows require some setup, read on WikipediaPPS If you\'re feeling creative, here\'s a good link with more copypastable symbols, but don\'t go too crazy, nobody likes clutter in what they read.Currently (June 2016) typing in the link as http://www.example.com will only produce plain text. You can now however put in an html anchor :Include emojis; copy and paste them to the description:http://getemoji.com<br> seems to be the best and only way that currently works on the app version to create a new line break. I have tried it successfully in a review, as well as unsuccessfully tried all other Unicode/HTML newline-related characters that the Wikipedia page for newlines would tell me.\nI used <br> with | immediately on either side, using no closing tag, and it magically created a single line break without revealing the source or screwing anything up.TLDR: <br> lets you successfully utilize single line breaks in Google Play app -- unlike everything else I tried (a lot).P.S. I have no clue how to make the thing show source instead of being used as source. !^( Now I do, and I know it works on both the desktop and mobile sites. !!Additionally, upon searching for how to make it show the source, I stumbled upon this. <del></del>This is not bullet but you can consider it. As there is nothing like big dot.I used below symbol in the description and its working fine. \xe2\x9a\xab Black Circle\xf0\x9f\x8c\x91 New Moon\xf0\x9f\x8c\x95 Full Moon\xf0\x9f\x92\xa0 Diamond With a Dot\xf0\x9f\x94\xb8 Small Orange Diamond\xe2\x9a\x99 Gear\xf0\x9f\x8f\xb4 Black Flag\xf0\x9f\x8f\xb3 White Flag\xe2\x96\xb6 Play Button\xe2\x8f\xa9 Fast-Forward Button\xe2\xad\x95 Heavy Large Circle\xe2\x9c\xb4 Eight-Pointed Star\xe2\x97\xbc Black Medium Square\xe2\x97\xbd White Medium-Small Square\xe2\x97\xbe Black Medium-Small Square\xe2\xac\x9b Black Large SquareYou just need to copy and paste it over description.
