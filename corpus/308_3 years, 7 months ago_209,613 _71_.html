So apparently because of the recent scams, the developer tools is exploited by people to post spam and even used to "hack" accounts. Facebook has blocked the developer tools, and I can\'t even use the console.How did they do that?? One Stack Overflow post claimed that it is not possible, but Facebook has proven them wrong.Just go to Facebook and open up the developer tools, type one character into the console, and this warning pops up. No matter what you put in, it will not get executed.How is this possible?They even blocked auto-complete in the console:I\'m a security engineer at Facebook and this is my fault. We\'re testing this for some users to see if it can slow down some attacks where users are tricked into pasting (malicious) JavaScript code into the browser console.Just to be clear: trying to block hackers client-side is a bad idea in general;\nthis is to protect against a specific social engineering attack.If you ended up in the test group and are annoyed by this, sorry.\nI tried to make the old opt-out page (now help page)  as simple as possible while still being scary enough to stop at least some of the victims.The actual code is pretty similar to @joeldixon66\'s link; ours is a little more complicated for no good reason.Chrome wraps all console code in... so the site redefines console._commandLineAPI to throw:This is not quite enough (try it!), but that\'s the\nmain trick.Epilogue: The Chrome team decided that defeating the console from user-side JS was a bug and fixed the issue, rendering this technique invalid. Afterwards, additional protection was added to protect users from self-xss. I located the Facebook\'s console buster script using Chrome developer tools. Here is the script with minor changes for readability. I have removed the bits that I could not understand:With this, the console auto-complete fails silently while statements typed in console will fail to execute (the exception will be logged).References:I couldn\'t get it to trigger that on any page. A more robust version of this would do it:To style the output: Colors in JavaScript consoleEdit Thinking @joeldixon66 has the right idea: Disable JavaScript execution from console Â«  ::: KSpace :::Besides redefining console._commandLineAPI,\nthere are some other ways to break into InjectedScriptHost on webkit browsers, to prevent or alter the evaluation of expressions entered into the developers console.Edit:Chrome has fixed this in a past release. - which must have been before February 2015, as i created the gist at that time So here\'s another possibilty. This time we hook in, a level above, directly into InjectedScript rather than InjectedScriptHost as opposed to the prior version. Which is kind of nice, as you can directly monkey patch InjectedScript._evaluateAndWrap instead of having to rely on InjectedScriptHost.evaluate as that gives you more finegrained control about what should happen. Another pretty intersting thing is, that we can intercept the internal result when an expression is evaluated and return that to the user instead of the normal behaviour. Here is the code, that does exactly that, return the internal result when a user evaluates something in the console.It\'s a bit verbose, but i thought i put some comments into itSo normally, if a user for example evaluates [1,2,3,4] you\'d expect the following output: After monkeypatching InjectedScript._evaluateAndWrap evaluating the very same expression, gives the following output: As you see the little left arrow, indicating output, is still there, but this time we get an object. Where the result of the expression, the array [1,2,3,4] is represented as an object with all its properties described.I recommend trying to evaluate this and that expression, including those that generate errors. It\'s quite interesting. Additionally, take a look at the is - InjectedScriptHost - object. It provides some methods to play with and get a bit of insight at the internals of the inspector. Of course you could intercept all that information and still return the original result to the user. Just replace the return statement in the else path by a console.log (res) following a return res. Then you\'d end up with the following.  End of Edit This is the prior version which was fixed by google. Henve not a possible way anymore.One of it is hooking into Function.prototype.callChrome evaluates the entered expression by calling its eval function with InjectedScriptHost as thisArgvar result = evalFunction.call(object, expression);Given this, you can listen for the thisArg of call being evaluate and get a reference to the first argument (InjectedScriptHost)You could e.g. throw an error, that the evaluation was rejected.\nHere is an example where the entered expression gets passed to a CoffeScript compiler before passing it to the evaluate function.Netflix also implements this featureThey just override console._commandLineAPI to throw security error.This is actually possible since Facebook was able to do it.\nWell, not the actual web developer tools but the execution of Javascript in console.See this: How does Facebook disable the browser's integrated Developer Tools?This really wont do much though since there are other ways to bypass this type of client-side security.When you say it is client-side, it happens outside the control of the server, so there is not much you can do about it. If you are asking why Facebook still does this, this is not really for security but to protect normal users that do not know javascript from running code (that they don\'t know how to read) into the console. This is common for sites that promise auto-liker service or other Facebook functionality bots after you do what they ask you to do, where in most cases, they give you a snip of javascript to run in console.If you don\'t have as much users as Facebook, then I don\'t think there\'s any need to do what Facebook is doing.Even if you disable Javascript in console, running javascript via address bar is still possible.and if the browser disables javascript at address bar, (When you paste code to the address bar in Google Chrome, it deletes the phrase \'javascript:\') pasting javascript into one of the links via inspect element is still possible.Inspect the anchor:Paste code in href:Bottom line is server-side validation and security should be first, then do client-side after.My simple way, but it can help for further variations on this subject.\nList all methods and alter them to useless.Chrome changed a lot since the times facebook could disable console... As per March 2017 this doesn\'t work anymore. Best you can do is disable some of the console functions, example:
