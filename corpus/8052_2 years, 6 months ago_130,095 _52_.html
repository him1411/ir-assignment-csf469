Im using Python 2.7.3 and Requests. I installed Requests via pip. I believe it\'s the latest version. I\'m running on Debian Wheezy.I\'ve used Requests lots of times in the past and never faced this issue, but it seems that when making https requests with Requests I get an InsecurePlatform exception.The error mentions urllib3, but I don\'t have that installed. I did install it to check if it resolved the error, but it didn\'t.Any ideas as to why I\'m getting this? I\'ve checked the docs, as specified in the error message, but the docs are saying to import urllib3 and either disable the warning, or provide a certificate.Use the somewhat hidden security feature:pip install \'requests[security]\'\nor\npip install pyOpenSSL ndg-httpsclient pyasn1 Both commands install following extra packages:Please note that this is not required for python-2.7.9+.If pip install fails with errors, check whether you have required development packages for libffi, libssl and python installed in your system using distribution\'s package manager:Debian/Ubuntu - python-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev packages.Fedora - openssl-devel python-devel libffi-devel packages.Distro list above is incomplete.Workaround (see the original answer by @TomDotTom):In case you cannot install some of the required development packages, there\'s also an option to disable that warning:Requests 2.6 introduced this warning for users of python prior to 2.7.9 with only stock SSL modules available.Assuming you can\'t upgrade to a newer version of python, this will install more up-to-date python SSL libraries:HOWEVER, this may fail on some systems without the build-dependencies for pyOpenSSL. On debian systems, running this before the pip command above should be enough for pyOpenSSL to build:I don\'t use this in production, just some test runners. And to reiterate the urllib3 documentation If you know what you are doing and would like to disable this and\n  other warningsEdit / Update:The following should also work:If you are not able to upgrade your Python version to 2.7.9, and want to suppress warnings, you can downgrade your \'requests\' version to 2.5.3:About version:\nhttp://fossies.org/diffs/requests/2.5.3_vs_2.6.0/requests/packages/urllib3/util/ssl_.py-diff.htmlIn fact, you can try this.requests.post("https://www.google.com", verify=False)you can read the code for requests. "C:\\Python27\\Lib\\site-packages\\requests\\sessions.py"All of the solutions given here haven\'t helped (I\'m constrained to python 2.6.6). I\'ve found the answer in a simple switch to pass to pip:This tells pip that it\'s OK to grab the module from pypi.python.org.For me, the issue is my company\'s proxy behind it\'s firewall that makes it look like a malicious client to some servers.  Hooray security. This answer is unrelated, but if you  wanted to get rid of warning and get following warning from requests:InsecurePlatformWarning\n/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/packages/urllib3/util/ssl_.py:79: InsecurePlatformWarning: A true SSLContext object is not available. This prevents urllib3 from configuring SSL appropriately and may cause certain SSL connections to fail. For more information, see https://urllib3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/security.html#insecureplatformwarning.You can disable it by adding the following line to your python code:requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings()I had to go to bash (from ZSH) first. Thenfixed the problem.For me no work i need upgrade pip....Debian/Ubuntuinstall dependenciesupgrade pip and install packagesIf you want remove dependenciesI just had a similar issue on a CentOS 5 server where I installed python 2.7.12 in /usr/local on top of a much older version of python2.7.  Upgrading to CentOS 6 or 7 isn\'t an option on this server right now.Some of the python 2.7 modules were still existing from the older version of python, but pip was failing to upgrade because the newer cryptography package is not supported by the CentOS 5 packages.Specifically, \'pip install requests[security]\' was failing because the openssl version on the CentOS 5 was 0.9.8e which is no longer supported by cryptography > 1.4.0.To solve the OPs original issue I did:This installed cryptography 1.3.4 which works with openssl-0.9.8e.      cryptograpy 1.3.4 is also sufficient to satisfy the requirement for the     following command.This command now installs because it doesn\'t try to install cryptography > 1.4.0.Note that on Centos 5 I also needed to:To allow cryptography to buildBelow is how it\'s working for me on Python 3.6:Dont install pyOpenSSL as it shall soon be deprecated. Current best approach is-
