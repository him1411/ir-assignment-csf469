I have an angular foreach loop and i want to break from loop if i match a value. The following code does not work.How can i get this? There\'s no way to do this. See https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/263. Depending on what you\'re doing you can use a boolean to just not going into the body of the loop. Something like:The angular.forEach loop can\'t break on a condition match.My personal advice is to use a NATIVE FOR loop instead of angular.forEach.The NATIVE FOR loop is around 90% faster then other for loops.USE FOR loop IN ANGULAR:please use some or every instances of ForEach, Example for some:Example for every:Find more information \nhttp://www.jsnoob.com/2013/11/26/how-to-break-the-foreach/Use the Array Some Methodexists will return true, and you can use this as a variable in your functionArray Some Method - JavascriptConcretely, you can exit of a forEach loop, and of any place, throw an exception.However, it is better if you use other library or implement your own function, a find function in this case, so your code is most high-level.As far as I know, Angular doesn\'t provide such a function. You may want to use underscore\'s find() function for this (it\'s basically a forEach which breaks out of the loop once the function returns true).http://underscorejs.org/#findIf you use jQuery (hence not jqLite) in conjunction with AngularJS you can iterate with $.each - which allows breaking and continuing based on boolean return value expression.JSFiddle:http://jsfiddle.net/JEcD2/1/Javascript:Note:Though using jQuery is not bad, both native Array.some or Array.every functions are recommended by MDN as you can read at native forEach documentation:"There is no way to stop or break a forEach loop. The solution is to use Array.every or Array.some"Following examples are provided by MDN:Array.some:Array.every:As the other answers state, Angular doesn\'t provide this functionality. jQuery does however, and if you have loaded jQuery as well as Angular, you can use  See http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/break isn\'t possible to achieve in angular forEach, we need to modify forEach to do that.Normally there is no way to break an "each" loop in javascript. \nWhat can be done usually is to use "short circuit" method.You can use this:This example works. Try it.Try this as break; I would prefer to do this by return. Put the looping part in private function and return when you want to break the loop. I realise this is old, but an array filter may do what you need:You can then run arr.forEach and other array functions.I realise that if you intend to cut down on loop operations altogether, this will probably not do what you want. For that you best use while.Just add $index and do the following:
