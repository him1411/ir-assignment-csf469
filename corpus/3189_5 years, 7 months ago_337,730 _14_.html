Possible Duplicate:\n  What is the difference between display: inline and display: inline-block? In CSS, display can have values of inline and inline-block. Can anyone explain in detail the difference between inline and inline-block?I searched everywhere, the most detailed explanation tells me inline-block is placed as inline, but behaves like block.
