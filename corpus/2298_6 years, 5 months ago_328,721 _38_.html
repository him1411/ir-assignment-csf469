How can one get the dimensions of the screen in iOS?Currently, I use:in viewWillAppear: and willAnimateRotationToInterfaceOrientation:duration:The first time I get the entire screen size. The second time i get the screen minus the nav bar.How can one get the dimensions of the screen in iOS?The problem with the code that you posted is that you\'re counting on the view size to match that of the screen, and as you\'ve seen that\'s not always the case. If you need the screen size, you should look at the object that represents the screen itself, like this:Update for split view: In comments, Dmitry asked:How can I get the size of the screen in the split view?The code given above reports the size of the screen, even in split screen mode. When you use split screen mode, your app\'s window changes. If the code above doesn\'t give you the information you expect, then like the OP, you\'re looking at the wrong object. In this case, though, you should look at the window instead of the screen, like this:Careful, [UIScreen mainScreen] contains status bar as well, if you want to retrieve the frame for your application (excluding status bar) you should useI have used these convenience methods before:I\'ve translated some of the above Objective-C answers into Swift code. Each translation is proceeded with a reference to the original answer.I realize that this is an old post, but sometimes I find it useful to #define constants like these so I do not have to worry about it:The above constant should return the correct size no matter the device orientation. Then getting the dimensions is as simple as:It\'s very, very easy to get your device size as well as take into account the orientation:We have to consider the orientation of device too:   Here i have updated for swift 3applicationFrame  deprecated from iOS 9In swift three they have removed () and they have changed few naming convention, you can refer here LinkIf you want screen width/height regardless of device orientation (good for sizing portrait only view controllers being launched from landscape orientations):[UIScreen mainScreen].nativeBounds <-- From the docs --> The bounding rectangle of the physical screen, measured in pixels. This rectangle is based on the device in a portrait-up orientation. This value does not change as the device rotates.Here is a Swift way to get screen sizes:These are included as a standard function in:https://github.com/goktugyil/EZSwiftExtensionsCGFloat width = [[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds].size.width;\nCGFloat height = [[UIScreen mainScreen]bounds ].size.height;Make use of these Structs to know useful info about the current device in Swift 3.0swift 3.0for widthfor heightThe modern answer:if your app support split view on iPad, this problem becomes a little complicated. You need window\'s size, not the screen\'s, which may contain 2 apps. Window\'s size may also vary while running.Use app\'s main window\'s size:Note: The method above may get wrong value before window becoming key window when starting up. if you only need width, method below is very recommended:The old solution using UIScreen.main.bounds will return the device\'s bounds. If your app running in split view mode, it get the wrong dimensions. self.view.window in the hottest answer may get wrong size when app contains 2 or more windows and the window have small size.You can place these macros in your pch file and used at anywhere in project by using "SCREEN_WIDTH" and "SCREEN_HEIGHT"Example of using:
