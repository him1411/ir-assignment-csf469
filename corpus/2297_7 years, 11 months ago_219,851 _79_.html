How can I create a UIColor from a hexadecimal string format, such as #00FF00?I\'ve found the simplest way to do this is with a macro.  Just include it in your header and it\'s available throughout your project.uicolor macro with hex valuesAlso formatted version of this code:Usage:A concise solution:I\'ve got a solution that is 100% compatible with the hex format strings used by Android, which I found very helpful when doing cross-platform mobile development.  It lets me use one color palate for both platforms.  Feel free to reuse without attribution, or under the Apache license if you prefer. There\'s a nice post on how to  tackle the OP\'s question of extracting a UIColor from a hex string. The solution presented below is different from others because it supports string values that may include \'0x\' or \'#\' prefixed to the hex string representation... (see usage)Here\'s the main bit..Helper method..Usage:Complete Reference ArticleI\'ve ported this solution to Swift 2.2. Note that I\'ve changed the alpha parameter to an optional value with a default set to 1.0. I\'ve also updated the int type to UInt32 as required by the NSScanner class in Swift 2.2.Color Hex ReferencesHTML Color Names and CodesColor Hex Color CodesUse this Category :in the file UIColor+Hexadecimal.hin the file UIColor+Hexadecimal.mIn Class you want use it :and:This is a function that takes a hex string and returns a UIColor.\n(You can enter hex strings with either format: #ffffff or ffffff)Swift 3:Swift 2:Usage:Source: arshad/gist:de147c42d7b3063ef7bcA great Swift implementation (updated for Xcode 7) using extensions, pulled together from a variety of different answers and places. You will also need the string extensions at the end.Use:NOTE: I added an option for 2 additional digits to the end of the standard 6 digit hex value for an alpha channel (pass in value of 00-99). If this offends you, just remove it. You could implement it to pass in an optional alpha parameter.Extension:String extensions:\nFloat source\nSubscript sourceThere is no builtin conversion from a hexadecimal string to a UIColor (or CGColor) that I\'m aware of. However, you can easily write a couple of functions for this purpose - for example, see iphone development accessing uicolor componentsYou can make a extension like thisAnd use it anywhere like this I found a good UIColor category for this, UIColor+PXExtensions.Usage: UIColor *mycolor = [UIColor pxColorWithHexValue:@"#BADA55"];And, just in case the link to my gist fails, here is the actual implementation code:This is another alternative.You could use various online tools to convert a HEX string to an actual UIColor. Check out uicolor.org or UI Color Picker. The output would be converted into Objective-C code, like:Which you could embed in your application. Hope this helps!swift version. Use as a Function or an Extension.This is nice with cocoapod supporthttps://github.com/mRs-/HexColorsAnother version with alpha Swift equivalent of @Tom\'s answer, although receiving RGBA Int value to support transparency:And if you want to be able to use it from string you could use strtoul:Another implementation allowing strings like "FFF" or "FFFFFF" and using alpha:Here\'s a Swift 1.2 version written as an extension to UIColor. This allows you to doWhich I feel is the most natural way of doing it.updated for swift 1.2Usage:I ended up creating a category for UIColor that I can just reuse in my other projects. Github: https://github.com/mattquiros/UIColorHexColorThe usage goes like:This is far faster than passing on a string and converting it to a number then shifting the bits.You can also import the category from inside your .pch file so you can easily use colorFromHex everywhere in your app like it\'s built-in to UIColor:I like to ensure the alpha besides the color, so i write my own categoryeasy to use like thisI created a convenience init for that:then you can create an UIColor anywhere in your project just like this:hope this helps...You can create extension class of UIColor as:-extension UIColor {// MARK: -  getColorFromHex\n    /**\n    This function will convert the color Hex code to RGB.}For swift 2.0+. \nThis code works fine to me.This code includes string format checking.\ne.g.And as far as I know, my code is of no disadvantage for its maintaining the semantic of failible condition and returning an optional value. And this should be the best answer.You can use this libraryhttps://github.com/burhanuddin353/TFTColorSwiftObjective-CCreate elegant extension for UIColor:Create red color:There is a nice UIColor category with many features in it.Usage: Where textColorHex has a form of @"FFFFFF" without # symbol.Swift version:
