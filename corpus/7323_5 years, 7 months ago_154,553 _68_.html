I just installed RVM, but can\'t make it work. I have such line at the end of my .profile file:I tried to run source .profile and restarting terminal, but still, when I run rvm use 1.9.2 I\'m getting:My system is Ubuntu 11.10.You are not using an login shell.The process of enabling the login flag is described here, also some details on what a login shell is can be found here.Thus, you need to check the option "Run as login shell" in the Gnome terminal\'s settings. It is required to open new terminal after this setting the flag.Sometimes it is required to set the command to /bin/bash --login.For remote connections it is important to understand the differene between running interactive ssh session and executing single commands.While running ssh server and then working with the server interactively you are using login shell by default and it\'s all fine, but for ssh server "command" you are not using login shell and it would be required to run it with ssh server \'bash -lc "command"\'.Any remote invocation can have the same problem as executing single command with ssh. You need to run the followthen run thisand if you getthe problem is solved.You also need to run user$ rvm requirements to see dependency requirements for your operating systemSource: https://rvm.io/rvm/install/I forget mention that you need to put this code into you ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc file and you will not need to write this code again. Cheers!To permanently resolve this just cut/paste following line:[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"From: ~/.bash_profile fileTo:   ~/.bashrc fileReason this works is that .bashrc is executed each time you enter terminal, and .bash_profile each time you login. That is why solution /bin/bash --login works, but you have to do that each time you enter terminal. This way you are set until your next format, and you will forget all this by then :)I too faced this problem. Finally i executed this line on terminal.Problem is fixed. Because this line will make the RVM instance a function for a particular time.The latest RVM (rvm 1.11.6 (stable)) stopped working on Ubuntu (10.10 - 64 bit - nerdy gnat or whatever) - I kept getting"RVM is not a function, selecting rubies with \'rvm use ...\' will not work."Before, I got the message, but \'rvm 1.9.3-p0@rails321\' would work. Now, it wouldn\'t work - you couldn\'t change gemsets at all.Nothing worked, until I found this - make this the LAST line in /home/your-name/.bashrc[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"As you said, the error shown could be the following one.As said above, just type \'/bin/bash --login\' in your terminal (after restarting your terminal), then type the comand \'rvm use 1.9.3\' (for e.g.) and it will start using the same version.Just execute the command \'ruby -v\' to confirm that the RVM is using the updated version of Ruby.I had this problem too on a fresh rvm installation, and non of the answers here fixed it. Going into the official rvm site, on the basics section, they have this command:# from http://rvm.io/rvm/basicssource $(rvm 1.9.3 do rvm env --path)You should change 1.9.3 for the ruby version that you actually want, and it\'ll make rvm a function regardless of the shell type.Maybe you can try belows:even though you accepted an answer, i\'d like to suggest another way .. ~/.bashrc is loaded before any shell is opened. Add that line at the end of that, and you don\'t need any of that login shell thing Open Up the Terminal and then Go to Edit > Profile Preferences and then go to the Tab "Title and Command" and Check "Run Command as Login Shell".Boot Up a Bash and Now you can install Gems directly from the terminal without the use of sudo and the error "RVM is not a function, selecting rubies with \'rvm use ...\' will not work." will be eliminated.Cheers.All the above answers are valid. But when i faced the same issue, the solution was the following:Ensure that the following code is at the bottom of your .zshrc after you have installed the latest RVM probably using CURL from official RVM siteMOST IMPORTANT POINT: Ensure that in your .zshrc file every export to PATH is appended with :$PATH. Which i believe was the root of my problems even after following the above steps.post this all my problems of RVM Not being a function went away. If it still does not work, give some error trace over here. After a few hours of struggle to solve this issue, i\'m sure i must have seen all related errors.Hope it helps. Cheers!Run  bash --login and then  run rvm use 2.0.0.Procedure for installing Ruby 1.9.3-p125 on Mac OSX 10.8 Mountain Lionhttp://www.frederico-araujo.com/2011/07/30/installing-rails-on-os-x-lion-with-homebrew-rvm-and-mysql/Notes:To install ruby, you may need to specify the clang compiler:$ rvm install 1.9.3p125 --with-gcc=clangIf RVM gripes about /usr/local/rvm not found, you need to create a link:$ ln -s /Users/[your user name]/.rvm /usr/local/rvm... should do the trick ..., probably need to logout and login again.How to reload .bash_profile from the command line?\xc2\xab Official \xc2\xbb instructions are there: https://rvm.io/integration/gnome-terminal/I\'d got the same error because I\'d ever installed the old rvm version ruby-rvm with the apt-get command. I solved the problem by remove the script line to config the old rvm in .bashrc file. Check the old rvm config script and then run source .profile I had the same error, but none of the solutions on this page seemed to work. For me it was enough to add the rvm executable to my path:Et voila!I had the same issue and I did this in my .bash_profile and it worked.\nsource "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm". For those who comes with same issue and they are using lubuntu like me I followed this link : You start your terminal with lxterminal -e "bash -il"Thank to @mpapsis who pointed me to the right directionI fixed it by adding this line to .bash_profile:
