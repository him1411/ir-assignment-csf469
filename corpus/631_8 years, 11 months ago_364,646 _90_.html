When you tap a row in a UITableView, the row is highlighted and selected. Is it possible to disable this so tapping a row does nothing?For me, the following worked fine:tableView.allowsSelection = NO;This means didSelectRowAt# simply won\'t work. That is to say, touching a row of the table, as such, will do absolutely nothing. (And hence, obviously, there will never be a selected-animation.)(Note that if, on the cells, you have UIButton or any other controls, of course those controls will still work. Any controls you happen to have on the table cell, are totally unrelated to UITableView\'s ability to allow you to "select a row" using didSelectRowAt#.)All you have to do is set the selection style on the UITableViewCell instance using either:Objective-C:orSwift 2:Swift 3:Further, make sure you either don\'t implement -tableView:didSelectRowAtIndexPath: in your table view delegate or explicitly exclude the cells you want to have no action if you do implement it.More info here and hereBecause I\'ve read this post recently and it has helped me, I wanted to post another answer to consolidate all of the answers (for posterity).\nSo, there are actually 5 different answers depending on your desired logic and/or result:1.To disable the blue highlighting without changing any other interaction of the cell:I use this when I have a UIButton - or some other control(s) - hosted in a UITableViewCell and I want the user to be able to interact with the controls but not the cell itself.NOTE: As Tony Million noted above, this does NOT prevent tableView:didSelectRowAtIndexPath:. I get around this by simple "if" statements, most often testing for the section and avoiding action for a particular section. Another way I thought of to test for the tapping of a cell like this is:\n2.To do this for an entire table, you can apply the above solution to each cell in the table, but you can also do this:In my testing, this still allows controls inside the UITableViewCell to be interactive.\n\n3.To make a cell "read-only", you can simply do this:\n4.To make an entire table "read-only"\n5.To determine on-the-fly whether to highlight a cell (which according to this answer implicitly includes selection), you can implement the following UITableViewDelegate protocol method:To sum up what I believe are the correct answers based on my own experience in implementing this:If you want to disable selection for just some of the cells, use:As well as preventing selection, this also stops tableView:didSelectRowAtIndexPath: being called for the cells that have it set. (Credit goes to Tony Million for this answer, thanks!)If you have buttons in your cells that need to be clicked, you need to instead:and you also need to ignore any clicks on the cell in - (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath.If you want to disable selection for the whole table, use:(Credit to Paulo De Barros, thanks!)As of iOS 6.0, UITableViewDelegate has tableView:shouldHighlightRowAtIndexPath:. (Read about it in the iOS Documentation.)This method lets you mark specific rows as unhighlightable (and implicitly, unselectable) without having to change a cell\'s selection style, messing with the cell\'s event handling with userInteractionEnabled = NO, or any other techniques documented here.You can also disable selection of row from interface builder itself by choosing NoSelection from the selection option(of UITableView Properties) in inspector pane as shown in the below imageIn case anyone needs answer for Swift:FIXED SOLUTION FOR SWIFT 3 If you want selection to only flash, not remain in the selected state, you can call, inthe followingso it will flash the selected state and revert.From the UITableViewDelegate Protocol you can use the method willSelectRowAtIndexPath \nand return nil if you don\'t want the row selected.In the same way the you can use the willDeselectRowAtIndexPath method and return nil if you don\'t want the row to deselect.This is what I use :in cellForRowAtIndexPath write this code.In your UITableViewCell\'s XIB in Attribute Inspector set value of Selection to None.Try to type: It will deselect your row when needed. In Swift3 ...I\'ve been battling with this quite profusely too, having a control in my UITableViewCell prohibited the use of userInteractionEnabled property. I have a 3 cell static table for settings, 2 with dates, 1 with an on/off switch. After playing about in Storyboard/IB i\'ve managed to make the bottom one non-selectable, but when you tap it the selection from one of the top rows disappears. Here is a WIP image of my settings UITableView:If you tap the 3rd row nothing at all happens, the selection will stay on the second row. The functionality is practically a copy of Apple\'s Calendar app\'s add event time selection screen.The code is surprisingly compatible, all the way down to IOS2 =/:This works in conjunction with setting the selection style to none, so the cell doesn\'t flicker on touch down eventsfor swift deselectionObjective C:Below snippet disable highlighting but it also disable the call to didSelectRowAtIndexPath. So if you are not implementing didSelectRowAtIndexPath then use below method. This should be added when you are creating the table. This will work on buttons and TextField inside the cell though.Below snippet disable highlighting and it doesn\'t disable the call to didSelectRowAtIndexPath. Set the selection style of cell to None in cellForRowAtIndexPath Below snippet disable everything on the cell. This will disable the interaction to buttons, textfields:SwiftBelow are the Swift equivalent of above Objective-C solutions:Replacement of First SolutionReplacement of Second SolutionReplacement of Third SolutionYou just have to put this code into cellForRowAtIndexPathTo disable the cell\'s selection property:(While tapping the cell).We can write code likebut when we have custom cell xib above line give warning at that time forcustom cell xibwe need to set selection style None from the interface builder I am using this, which works for me.try thisandand you can also set selection style using interfacebuilder.While this is the best and easiest solution to prevent a row from showing the highlight during selectionI\'d like to also suggest that it\'s occasionally useful to briefly show that the row has been selected and then turning it off. This alerts the users with a confirmation of what they intended to select:You Can also set the background color to Clear to achieve the same effect as UITableViewCellSelectionStyleNone, in case you don\'t want to/ can\'t use UITableViewCellSelectionStyleNone. You would use code like the following:This may degrade your performance as your adding an extra colored view to each cell.You can use ....Happy coding !!!You can also do it from the storyboard. Click the table view cell and in the attributes inspector under Table View Cell, change the drop down next to Selection to None.Swift Solution w/ Custom Cell:You can use selectionStyle property of UITableViewCellOr    Also, do not implement below delegateIf you have created Xib/Storyboard file then you can change setUserInteractionEnabled \nproperty of tableview to No by unchecking it.\nThis will make your tableview to Read-Only.To disable the highlighting of the UItableviewcellAnd should not allow the user to interact with the cell. You can use thisThe best solution would be Making The selection Style None However, Here we are considering the fact that there are no custom images used for selected state.
