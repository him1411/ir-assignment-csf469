How can I transform a String value into an InputStreamReader?ByteArrayInputStream also does the trick:I also found the apache commons IOUtils class , so : Does it have to be specifically an InputStreamReader?  How about using StringReader?Otherwise, you could use StringBufferInputStream, but it\'s deprecated because of character conversion issues (which is why you should prefer StringReader).Same question as @Dan - why not StringReader ?If it has to be InputStreamReader, then:Are you trying to get a) Reader functionality out of InputStreamReader, or b) InputStream functionality out of InputStreamReader?  You won\'t get b).  InputStreamReader is not an InputStream.The purpose of InputStreamReader is to take an InputStream - a source of bytes - and decode the bytes to chars in the form of a Reader.  You already have your data as chars (your original String).  Encoding your String into bytes and decoding the bytes back to chars would be a redundant operation.If you are trying to get a Reader out of your source, use StringReader.If you are trying to get an InputStream (which only gives you bytes), use apache commons IOUtils.toInputStream(..) as suggested by other answers here.You can try Cactoos:Then, if you need a Reader:
