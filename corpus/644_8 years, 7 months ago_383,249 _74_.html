I have a Git repo that I have deleted four files from using rm (not git rm), and my Git status looks like this:How do I remove these files from Git without having to manually go through and add each file like this:Ideally, I\'m looking for something that works in the same way that git add . does, if that\'s possible.might be what you are looking for.. it works for me.. This tells git to automatically stage tracked files -- including deleting the previously tracked files. To stage your whole working tree:To stage just the current path:You can use To add the deleted files to the staging area, then commit themIf you simply run:git will update its index to know that the files that you\'ve deleted should actually be part of the next commit.  Then you can run "git commit" to check in that change.Or, if you run:It will automatically take these changes (and any others) and commit them.Update: If you only want to add deleted files, try:You\'re probably looking for -A:this is similar to git add -u, but also adds new files.  This is roughly the equivalent of hg\'s addremove command (although the move detection is automatic).To stage only the deleted files:Or (the xargs way):You can alias your preferred command set for convenient later use.Before or after you deleted the actual file.By using git-add with \'--all\' or \'--update\' options you may get more than you wanted. New and/or modified files will also be added to the index. I have a bash alias setup for when I want to remove deleted files from git without touching other files:All files that have been removed from the file system are added to the index as deleted.Not that it really matters, but I disagree with the chose answer:... will remove files from the index if the corresponding files in the working tree have been removed, but it will also stage the modified new contents of tracked files. ... on the other hand will only rm the deleted files that were tracked.So the latter in my view is the better option. If those are the only changes, you can simply doto commit all changes. That will include deleted files.is the best option to add only deleted files.Here is some other options.git add -u-u\n--update\nOnly match  against already tracked files in the index rather than the working tree. That means that it will never stage new files, but that it will stage modified new contents of tracked files and that it will remove files from the index if the corresponding files in the working tree have been removed.If no  is given, default to "."; in other words, update all tracked files in the current directory and its subdirectories.That simple solution works fine for me:If you want to add it to your .gitconfig do this:Then all you have to do is run:This will remove all deleted files that were previous tracked by git, as well as handle the case where your filenames have spaces in them. Depending on your POSIX variant, you may need to use xargs -0 -r: this will cause xargs to gracefully exit when piped null content.EDIT: --cached and --deleted flags are used in tandem to safeguard against accidentally deleting files that have not already been deleted.Try it.or None of the flags to git-add will only stage removed files; if all you have modified are deleted files, then you\'re fine, but otherwise, you need to run git-status and parse the output.Working off of Jeremy\'s answer, this is what I got:Sticking this in a shell alias now...As mentionedstages the removed files for deletion, BUT ALSO modified files for update.To unstage the modified files you can doif you like to keep your commits organized and clean.NOTE: This could also unstage the deleted files, so careful with those wildcards.The following will work, even if you have a lot of files to process:You\'ll probably also want to commit with a comment.For details, see:  Useful Git ScriptsPlease use -t to see which command is actually being ranI just tweaked Virender answer to do same:I needed the same \nand used git gui "stage changed" button.\nit also adds all.And after "stage changed" I made "commit" ...so my working directory is clean again.This worked for me after I had already deleted the files.  You can use git add -u <filenames> to stage the deleted files only.For example, if you deleted the files templates/*.tpl, then use git add -u templates/*.tpl.The -u is required in order to refer to files that exist in the repository but no longer exist in the working directory.  Otherwise, the default of git add is to look for the files in the working directory, and if you specify files you\'ve deleted there, it won\'t find them.something like may do it.For visual studio projectwhich is useful when the deleted file path has spaceAdding system alias for staging deleted files as command rm-allUNIX\nalias rm-all=\'git rm $(git ls-files --deleted)\'WINDOWS\ndoskey rm-all=bash -c "git rm $(git ls-files --deleted)"NoteWindows needs to have bash installed.(Yet another variation)I wanted to delete all the already deleted from the disk files but from one specific folder, leaving the other folders untouched. The following worked for me:The most flexible solution I have found to date is toAnd select all deleted files I want to stage. (Note I usually do everything commandline in git, but git handles removed files a bit awkward).
