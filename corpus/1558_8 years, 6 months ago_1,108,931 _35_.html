I need to select each distinct home holding the maximum value of datetime. I have tried:Doesn\'t work. Result-set has 130 rows although database holds 187. \nResult includes some duplicates of home.Nope. Gives all the records.With various results.You are so close!  All you need to do is select BOTH the home and it\'s max date time, then join back to the topten table on BOTH fields:Here goes T-SQL version:EDIT\nUnfortunately, there are no RANK() OVER function in MySQL.\nBut it can be emulated, see Emulating Analytic (AKA Ranking) Functions with MySQL.\nSo this is MySQL version:The fastest MySQL solution, without inner queries and without GROUP BY:Explanation:Join the table with itself using the home column. The use of LEFT JOIN ensures all the rows from table m appear in the result set. Those that don\'t have a match in table b will have NULLs for the columns of b.The other condition on the JOIN asks to match only the rows from b that have bigger value on the datetime column than the row from m.Using the data posted in the question, the LEFT JOIN will produce this pairs:Finally, the WHERE clause keeps only the pairs that have NULLs in the columns of b (they are marked with * in the table above); this means, due to the second condition from the JOIN clause, the row selected from m has the biggest value in column datetime.Read the SQL Antipatterns: Avoiding the Pitfalls of Database Programming book for other SQL tips.This will work even if you have two or more rows for each home with equal DATETIME\'s:I think this will give you the desired result:BUT if you need other columns as well, just make a join with the original table (check Michael La Voie answer)Best regards.Since people seem to keep running into this thread (comment date ranges from 1.5 year) isn\'t this much simpler:SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM topten ORDER BY datetime DESC) tmp GROUP BY homeNo aggregation functions needed... Cheers.You can also try this one and for large tables query performance will be better. It works when there no more than two records for each home and their dates are different.  Better general MySQL query is one from Michael La Voie above. Or in case of Postgres or those dbs that provide analytic functions tryThis works on Oracle:Try this for SQL Server:Try thisRegards\nKHere is MySQL version which prints only one entry where there are duplicates MAX(datetime) in a group.You could test here http://www.sqlfiddle.com/#!2/0a4ae/1Why not using:\nSELECT home, MAX(datetime) AS MaxDateTime,player,resource FROM topten GROUP BY home\nDid I miss something?this is the query you need:@Michae The accepted answer will working fine in most of the cases but it fail for one for as below.In case if there were 2 rows having HomeID and Datetime same the query will return both rows, not distinct HomeID as required, for that add Distinct in query as below.
