How do I increase scrollback buffer size in tmux?  If I enter copy mode, the number of available scrollback lines (visible in upper right corner) is always below 2000. I tried to find a list of all tmux commands, but I can\'t find anything about scrollback size. For all I see the screen command for setting that option doesn\'t work with tmux.Using tmux 1.8, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, either konsole or gnome-terminal.The history limit is a pane attribute that is fixed at the time of pane creation and cannot be changed for existing panes. The value is taken from the history-limit session option (the default value is 2000).To create a pane with a different value you will need to set the appropriate history-limit option before creating the pane.To establish a different default, you can put a line like the following in your .tmux.conf file:Note: Be careful setting a very large default value, it can easily consume lots of RAM if you create many panes.For a new pane (or the initial pane in a new window) in an existing session, you can set that session\xe2\x80\x99s history-limit. You might use a command like this (from a shell):For (the initial pane of the initial window in) a new session you will need to set the \xe2\x80\x9cglobal\xe2\x80\x9d history-limit before creating the session:Note: If you do not re-set the history-limit value, then the new value will be also used for other panes/windows/sessions created in the future; there is currently no direct way to create a single new pane/window/session with its own specific limit without (at least temporarily) changing history-limit (though show-option (especially in 1.7 and later) can help with retrieving the current value so that you restore it later).
