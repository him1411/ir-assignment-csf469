Is there a keyboard shortcut for pasting the content of the clipboard into a command prompt window on Windows XP (instead of using the right mouse button)?The typical Shift+Insert does not seem to work here.I personally use a little AutoHotkey script to remap certain keyboard functions, for the console window (CMD) I use:Yes.. but awkward. Linkalt + Space, e, k <-- for copy and\nalt + Space, e, p <-- for paste. Not really programming related, but I found this on Google, there is not a direct keyboard shortcut, but makes it a little quicker.Thanks Pablo, just what I was looking for!  However, if I can take the liberty of improving your script slightly, I suggest replacing your ^V macro with the following:The advantage of using SendInput is thatNote, it\'s important to include the "{Raw}" in the SendInput command, in case the clipboard happens to contain "!", "+", "^" or "#".Note, it uses StringReplace to remove excess Windows carriage return characters.  Thanks hugov for that suggestion!There is also a great open source tool called clink, which extends cmd by many features. One of them is being able to use ctrl+v to insert text.On Windows 10, you can enable Ctrl +  C and Ctrl +  V to work in the command prompt:Here\'s a free tool that will do it on Windows. I prefer it to a script as it\'s easy to set up. It runs as a fast native app, works on XP and up, has configuration settings that allow to remap copy/paste/selection keys for command windows:Plus I know the developers.simplest method is just the copy the text that you want to paste it in cmd and open cmd goto "properties"---> "option" tab----> check the (give tick mark) "quickEdit mode" and click "ok" .....now you can paste any text from clipboard by doing right click from ur mouse.Thank you..This is not really a shortcut but just a quick access to the control menu: Alt-space E PIf you can use your mouse, right click on the cmd window works as paste when I tried it.Thanks, Pablo, for referring to AutoHotkey utility. \nSince I have Launchy installed which uses Alt+Space I had to modify it a but to add Shift key as shown:It took me a small while to figure out why your AutoHotkey script does not work with me:In fact, it relies on keystrokes and consequently on keyboard layout!\nSo when you are, as I am, unfortunate to have only an AZERTY keyboard, your suggestion just does not work. And worse, I found no easy way to replace SendInput method or twist its environment to fix this. For example SendInput "1" just does not send digit 1.I had to turn every character into its unicode to make it work on my computer:Not very simple...Theoretically, the application in DOS Prompt has its own clipboard and shortcuts. To import text from Windows clipboard is "extra". However you can use Alt-Space to open system menu of Prompt window, then press E, P to select Edit, Paste menu. However, MS could provide shortcut using Win-key. There is no chance to be used in DOS application.If you use the clipboard manager Ditto (open source, gratis), you can simply use the shortcut to paste from Ditto, and it will paste the clipboard in CMD for you.You could try using Texter and create something unlikely like:./p , triggered by space and replacing the text with %cI just tested it and it works fine. The only gotcha is to use a rare sequence, as Texter cannot restrict this to just cmd.There are probably other utilities of this kind which could work, and even AutoHotKey, upon which Texter is built could do it better, but Texter is easy :-)A simpler way is to use windows powershell instead of cmd. itworks fine with texter.I\'ve recently found that command prompt has support for context menu via the right mouse click. You can find more details here: http://www.askdavetaylor.com/copy_paste_within_microsoft_windows_command_prompt.htmlPretty simple solution may be Console 2, redefine keys and you go.I followed @PabloG\'s steps as followsIf you\'re a Cygwin user, you can append the following to your ~/.bashrc file:stty lnext ^q stop undef start undefAnd the following to your ~/.inputrc file:Restart your Cygwin terminal.(Note, I\'ve used an uppercase C for copy, since CTRL+c is assigned to the break function on most consoles.  Season to taste.)SourceInstead of "right click"....start your session (once you\'re in the command prompt window) by keying Alt/SpaceBar. That will open the Command Prompt window menu and you\'ll see your familiar, underlined keyboard command shortcuts, just like in Windows GUI.Good luck!Under VISTA Command prompt:\nClick on the System Icon\nSelect Defaults from the Menu\nOn the Options tab in the Options group I have\n"Quick Edit Mode", "Insert Mode", and "Auto Complete" selected\nI think that "Quick Edit Mode" is what makes it work.To paste whatever is in the Clipboard at the insertion point: Right Click.\nTo copy from the Command Window\n  Select by holding down the left mouse button and dragging the pointer across what you want to copy\n  Once selected, right click\n  To paste at the insertion point, right click again.
