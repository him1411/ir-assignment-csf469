What exactly is the difference between the inline and inline-block values of CSS display?Imagine a <span> element inside a <div>. If you give the <span> element a height of 100px and a red border for example, it will look like this withdisplay: inlinedisplay: inline-blockdisplay: blockCode: http://jsfiddle.net/Mta2b/Elements with display:inline-block are like display:inline elements, but they can have a width and a height. That means that you can use an inline-block element as a block while flowing it within text or other elements.Difference of supported styles as summary:display: inline; is a display mode to use in a sentence. For instance, if you have a paragraph and want to highlight a single word you do:The <em> element has a display: inline; by default, because this tag is always used in a sentence.\nThe <p> element has a display: block; by default, because it\'s neither a sentence nor in a sentence, it\'s a block of sentences.An element with display: inline; cannot have a height or a width or a vertical margin. An element with display: block; can have a width, height and margin.\nIf you want to add a height to the <em> element, you need to set this element to display: inline-block;. Now you can add a height to the element and every other block style (the block part of inline-block), but it is placed in a sentence (the inline part of inline-block).One thing not mentioned in answers is inline element can break among lines while inline-block can\'t (and obviously block)! So inline elements can be useful to style sentences of text and blocks inside them, but as they can\'t be padded you can use line-height instead.All answers above contribute important info on the original question.However there is a generalization that seems wrong.It is possible to set width and height to at least one (I can think of) inline element. Both accepted answers here and on this duplicate state that this is not possible but this seems not like a valid general rule.Example?
