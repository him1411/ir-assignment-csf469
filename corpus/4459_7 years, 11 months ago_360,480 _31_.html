I am learning the ropes in Python. When I try to print an object of class Foobar using the print() function, I get an output like this:Is there a way I can set the printing behaviour (or the string representation) of a class and its objects? For instance, when I call print() on a class object, I would like to print its data members in a certain format. How to achieve this in Python?If you are familiar with C++ classes, the above can be achieved for the standard ostream by adding a friend ostream& operator << (ostream&, const Foobar&) method for the class.The __str__ method is what happens when you print it, and the __repr__ method is what happens when you use the repr() function (or when you look at it with the interactive prompt). If this isn\'t the most Pythonic method, I apologize, because I\'m still learning too - but it works.If no __str__ method is given, Python will print the result of __repr__ instead. If you define __str__ but not __repr__, Python will use what you see above as the __repr__, but still use __str__ for printing.As Chris Lutz mentioned, this is defined by the __repr__ method in your class.From the documentation of repr():For many types, this function makes an attempt to return a string that would yield an object with the same value when passed to eval(), otherwise the representation is a string enclosed in angle brackets that contains the name of the type of the object together with additional information often including the name and address of the object. A class can control what this function returns for its instances by defining a __repr__() method.Given the following class Test:..it will act the following way in the Python shell:If no __str__ method is defined, print t (or print str(t)) will use the result of __repr__ insteadIf no __repr__ method is defined then the default is used, which is pretty much equivalent to..You need to use __repr__. This is a standard function like __init__.\nFor example:Just to add my two cents to @dbr\'s answer, following is an example of how to implement this sentence from the official documentation he\'s cited:"[...] to return a string that would yield an object with the same value when passed to eval(), [...]"Given this class definition:Now, is easy to serialize instance of Test class:So, running last piece of code, we\'ll get:But, as I said in my last comment: more info is just here!A generic way that can be applied to any class without specific formatting could be done as follows:And then,producesFor Python 3:If the specific format isn\'t important (e.g. for debugging) just inherit from the Printable class below.  No need to write code for every object.  Inspired by this answerThere are already a lot of answers in this thread but none of them particularly helped me, I had to work it out myself, so I hope this one is a little more informative.You just have to make sure you have parentheses at the end of your class, e.g:Here\'s an example of code from a project I was working on:To print my Hydrogen class, I used the following:Please note, this will not work without the parentheses at the end of Hydrogen. They are necessary.Hope this helps, let me know if you have anymore questions.
