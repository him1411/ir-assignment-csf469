How can I disable the Java editor breadcrumb in Eclipse?If you are referring to the breadcrumbs in the help file of a RCP application, there is only  a manual way to do it.Since Ganymede 3.4M5:Original answer (manual way, through key mapping)Find the file org.eclipse.help.webapp\\advanced\\breadcrumbs.css and replace its contents with.For the Java Editor breadcrumb, you need to assign a shortcut to the "Toggle Java Editor Breadcrumb" command (I have tested Alt+B, for instance)That shortcut will make the breadcrumb bar appear/disappear at will.With the editor window focussed, look for this icon in your toolbar: And click on it. That\'s all. The icon is present by default, but can be deactivated, in which case you have to activated as in MvanGeest\'s answer.Another way which works for me at Eclipse Indigo (3.7): press Ctrl+3 and type bread, after that click on item Toggle Java Editor Breadcrumb.Look for this icon in the toolbar:\nThis button toggles the Breadcrumb view on/off.(I\'m using Eclipse 3.7, and it\'s there by default)Here it is : In the toolbar, toggle bread crumb option.Something like http://loadcontext.blogspot.com/2008/08/eclipse-34-breadcrumbs-hide-and-show.html?Customize Perspective, choose the\n  Commands tab. In the Available command\n  group, choose Java Editor\n  Presentation. The Toolbar details\n  shows the button for Toggle\n  Breadcrumbs, which looks like a folder\n  with a C in a circle with a black\n  triangle on top of it.Despite my absolute lack of experience with Eclipse, I suppose this setting must appear in other Presentation items too. After the button\'s enabled, all you have to do is click it. Or not?Change property breadcrumb.org.eclipse.jdt.ui.JavaPerspective from true to false\nin your org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs file.In Juno: type \'Bread\' and select \'Toggle Java Editor Breadcrumb\'
