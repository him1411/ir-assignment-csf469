I am originally a C programmer. I have seen numerous tricks and "hacks" to read many different arguments. What are some of the ways Python programmers can do this?http://docs.python.org/2/library/optparse.html.  argparse is the replacement: http://docs.python.org/2/library/argparse.html#module-argparseThere are the following modules in the standard library:Here is an example that uses the latter from the docs:optparse supports (among other things):sys.argv is a list that contains all the arguments passed to the script on the command line.Basically,Just going around evangelizing for argparse which is better for these reasons.. essentially:(copied from the link)argparse module can handle positional\nand optional arguments, while\noptparse can handle only optional\nargumentsargparse isn\xe2\x80\x99t dogmatic about\nwhat your command line interface\nshould look like - options like -file\nor /file are supported, as are\nrequired options. Optparse refuses to\nsupport these features, preferring\npurity over practicalityargparse produces more\ninformative usage messages, including\ncommand-line usage determined from\nyour arguments, and help messages for\nboth positional and optional\narguments. The optparse module\nrequires you to write your own usage\nstring, and has no way to display\nhelp for positional arguments.argparse supports action that\nconsume a variable number of\ncommand-line args, while optparse\nrequires that the exact number of\narguments (e.g. 1, 2, or 3) be known\nin advanceargparse supports parsers that\ndispatch to sub-commands, while\noptparse requires setting\nallow_interspersed_args and doing the\nparser dispatch manuallyAnd my personal favorite:There is also argparse stdlib module (an "impovement" on stdlib\'s optparse module). Example from the introduction to argparse:Usage:One way to do it is using sys.argv. This will print the script name as the first argument and all the other parameters that you pass to it.The docopt library is really slick.  It builds an argument dict from the usage string for your app.Eg from the docopt readme:I use optparse myself, but really like the direction Simon Willison is taking with his recently introduced optfunc library.  It works by:"introspecting a function\n  definition (including its arguments\n  and their default values) and using\n  that to construct a command line\n  argument parser."So, for example, this function definition:is turned into this optparse help text:If you need something fast and not very flexiblemain.py:Then run python main.py James Smithto produce the following output:Hello James SmithI like getopt from stdlib, eg:Lately I have been wrapping something similiar to this to make things less verbose (eg; making "-h" implicit).As you can see optparse "The optparse module is deprecated with and will not be developed further; development will continue with the argparse module." You may be interested in a little Python module I wrote to make handling of command line arguments even easier (open source and free to use) - CommandoI recommend looking at docopt as a simple alternative to these others.docopt is a new project that works by parsing your --help usage message rather than requiring you to implement everything yourself. You just have to put your usage message in the POSIX format.Pocoo\'s click is more intuitive, requires less boilerplate, and is at least as powerful as argparse.The only weakness I\'ve encountered so far is that you can\'t do much customization to help pages, but that usually isn\'t a requirement and docopt seems like the clear choice when it is.Yet another option is argh. It builds on argparse, and lets you write things like:It will automatically generate help and so on, and you can use decorators to provide extra guidance on how the arg-parsing should work.My solution is entrypoint2. Example:help text:
