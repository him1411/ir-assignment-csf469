I committed and pushed some directory to github. After that, I altered the .gitignore file adding a directory that should be ignored. Everything works fine, but the (now ignored) directory stays on github.How do I delete that directory from github and the repository history?The rules in your .gitignore file only apply to untracked files.

However it showed me the right way. I have done the same thing like this:I advise you to check the files to be deleted first by running the below statement:I was using a default .gitignore file for visual studio and I noticed that it was removing all log and bin folders in the project which was not my intended action.If you\'re working from PowerShell, try the following as a single command.Then, git push --force --all. Documentation: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-filter-branchNote: This solution works only with Github Desktop GUI.By using Github Desktop GUI it is very simple.Move the folder onto another location (to out of the project folder) temporarily.Edit your .gitignore file and remove the folder entry which would be remove master repository on the github page.Commit and Sync the project folder.Re-move the folder into the project folderRe-edit .gitignore file.That\'s all.
