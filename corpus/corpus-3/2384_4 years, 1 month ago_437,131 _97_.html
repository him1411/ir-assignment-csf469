I tried this: ...but it didn\'t work. So, how do I do this on windows?This is the new best way to upgrade npm on Windows.Run PowerShell as AdministratorNote: Do not run npm i -g npm. Instead use npm-windows-upgrade to update npm going forward. Also if you run the NodeJS installer, it will replace the node version.Download and run the latest MSI.  The MSI will update your installed node and npm.To update NPM, this worked for me:You can use Chocolatey which is a package manager for windows (like apt-get for Debian Linux).Install fresh (you might need to uninstall previously installed versions)Update to the latest versionand for npmLike some people, I NEEDED to COMBINE multiple answers and I also needed to set a Proxy.This SHOULD work for anyone, I have zero desire to run exe or msi .. uninstall/ reinstall, or manually delete files and folers that is so 1999 :PRun this to update NPM:Run PowerShell as AdministratorI am NOT thinking this code actually upgrades your npm version below Run this to update NODE:IF you get  `wget : Could not find a part of the path ....

This command doesn\'t need windows administrator privileges and you can verify the result with npm -vThe answer above will work, installing a new version of node (probably the best option) but if you have a dependency on a specific node version then the following will work: "npm install npm -g".

Click the Start menu, type "Change or Remove a Program", click on the item shown, find Node.js in the list and uninstall it.Delete directories both C:\\Program Files (x86)\\nodejs\\ and C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\ if they existinstall latest https://nodejs.org/en/download    The uninstall/delete/install seems unnecessary but it often is and this will save your time.\n    These instructions come from Microsoft.    https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-windows-upgrade    This is the official documentation for upgrading npm on windows.All tested and working on Windows 10 (2017).I followed @josh3737 and installed the latest MSI from the node.js homepage. But I had the additional problem that I still had the old node and npm on the command line. The problem was caused by the new installation, that it was installed into instead of the previous installation inThe new installation added the new directory into my path variable after the old one. So the old installation was still the active one in the path. After removing C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\ from system path and C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm from user path and restarting the command line the new installation was active.Maybe the least path was a local problem that has nothing to do with the new installation, I had two links to AppData\\Roaming\\npm in it. And maybe this can also be fixed by first uninstalling node.js and installing the new version afterwards.I was also facing similar issues. I followed below mentioned steps and it worked for me:go to Windows > Start > Node.jsping registry.npmjs.orgnpm view npm versioncd %ProgramFiles%\\nodejsnpm install npm@latestand npm updated successfully. Earlier I was trying for CMD and that was throwing error. may be some path issue that got resolved by running NodeJs Command Prompt. hope it\'ll work for you. try this.this is best tool to maintain version of NODE.Js i NVMNode Version Manager (nvm) for Windows\nbut for Windows, with an installer. Download Now! This has always been a node version manager, not an io.js manager, so there is no back-support for io.js.

U dont need remove any old files.Then update npm typing in cmd: npm install --save latest-versionTo install the updates, just download the installer from the Nodejs.org site and run it again. The new version of Node and NPM will replace the older versions.This works fine for meRun   Command Prompt as AdministratorRun   Powershell -ExecutionPolicy UnrestrictedRun   npm-windows-upgradeRun   npm --versionCommand Prompt ScreenshotYou can use these commands:If you are upgrading from a previous version of node, then you will want to update all existing global packages.\nYou can also specify the package name to be updated.This might help someone. Neither "npm-windows-upgrade" nor the installer alone did it for me. Powershell was still using an older version of node and npm. So this is what I did (worked for me):\n1. Download the latest installer from nodejs.org. Install node. It will update your node; everywhere (Powershell, cmd etc.).\n2. Install the npm-windows-upgrade package (npm install -g npm-windows-upgrade) and run npm-windows-upgrade.I didn\'t uninstall anything and didn\'t set any paths.In my case, I discovered that I had two copies of node installed.  One under "c:\\Program Files\\nodejs" and another under "c:\\Program Files (x86)\\nodejs"The easiest way I found so far to update NodeJs is Using Chocolatey(https://chocolatey.org/)\nUse Chocolatey to install or update the latest version of Node.js on WINDOWS: -Step 1: First, ensure that you already have Chocolatey installed. If not, use an administrative shell to Install chocolatey through cmd.exe or PowerShell.exe. For more information, visit: https://chocolatey.org/docs/installationStep 2: Install with cmd.exe. Run the following command: @"%SystemRoot%\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe" -NoProfile -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString(\'https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1\'))" && SET "PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\chocolatey\\bin"To install with PowerShell.exe, visit: https://chocolatey.org/docs/installationStep 3: Install or Update with following commands on cmd.exe (on administrative mode)To Install Node : cinst nodejs.installTo Update Node : cup nodejs.installThis is what worked for me.Note: I tried installing npm directly in "C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node_modules" but it created errors.
