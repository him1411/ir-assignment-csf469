I\'ve looked on wikipedia and Googled it and read the official documentation, but I still haven\'t got to the point where I really understand what JSON is, and why I\'d use it. I have been building applications using PHP, MySQL and Javascript / HTML for a while, and if JSON can do something to make my life easier or my code better or my user interface better, then I\'d like to know about it. Can someone give me a succinct explanation?JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format that is used for data interchanging.  It is based on a subset of JavaScript language (the way objects are built in JavaScript). As stated in the MDN, some JavaScript is not JSON, and some JSON is not JavaScript.An example of  where this is used is web services responses.  In the \'old\' days, web services used XML as their primary data format for transmitting back data, but since JSON appeared (The JSON format is specified in RFC 4627 by Douglas Crockford), it has been the preferred format because it is much more lightweightYou can find a lot more info on the official JSON web site.JSON is built on two structures:\n\n\n\nHere is an example of JSON data:When working with JSON and JavaScript, you may be tempted to use the eval function to evaluate the result returned in the callback, but this is not suggested since there are two characters (U+2028 & U+2029) valid in JSON but not in JavaScript (read more of this here).Therefore, one must always try to use Crockford\'s script that checks for a valid JSON before evaluating it.  Link to the script explanation is found here and here is a direct link to the js file. Every major browser nowadays has its own implementation for this.Example on how to use the JSON Parser (with the json from the above code snippet):The JSON Parser also offers another very useful method, stringify.  This method accepts a JavaScript object as a parameter, and outputs back a string with JSON format.  This is useful for when you want to send data back to the server:The above two methods (parse and stringify) also take a second parameter, which is a function that will be called for every key and value at every level of the final result, and each value will be replaced by result of your inputted function.  (More on this here)Btw, for all of you out there who think JSON is just for JavaScript, check out this post that explains and confirms otherwise.In short - JSON is a way of serializing in such a way, that it becomes JavaScript code. When executed (with eval or otherwise), this code creates and returns a JavaScript object which contains the data you serialized. This is available because JavaScript allows the following syntax:You can use this for several purposes. For one, it\'s a comfortable way to pass data from your server backend to your JavaScript code. Thus, this is often used in AJAX.You can also use it as a standalone serialization mechanism, which is simpler and takes up less space than XML. Many libraries exists that allow you to serialize and deserialize objects in JSON for various programming languages.In short, it is a scripting notation for passing data about. In some ways an alternative to XML, natively supporting basic data types, arrays and associative arrays (name-value pairs, called Objects because that is what they represent).The syntax is that used in JavaScript and JSON itself stands for "JavaScript Object Notation". However it has become portable and is used in other languages too.A useful link for detail is here:http://secretgeek.net/json_3mins.aspJSON is JavaScript Object Notation. It is a much-more compact way of transmitting sets of data across network connections as compared to XML.\nI suggest JSON be used in any AJAX-like applications where XML would otherwise be the "recommended" option. The verbosity of XML will add to download time and increased bandwidth consumption ($$$). You can accomplish the same effect with JSON and its mark-up is almost exclusively dedicated to the data itself and not the underlying structure.The JSON format is often used for serializing and transmitting structured data over a network connection. It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, serving as an alternative to XML.All of the above answers focus on specifics. So i\'ll try and explain the concept so you\'ll be in a position to understand the above.What is JSON? \xe2\x80\x93 How I explained it to my wifeMe: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s basically a way of communicating with someone. \xe2\x80\x9cWife: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by that?\xe2\x80\x9dMe: \xe2\x80\x9cWell imagine if I wanted to communicate with your mother \xe2\x80\x93 via writing mind you. How do you suppose I would do it?Wife: Well you\xe2\x80\x99d write out a letter in English I suppose.Me: Bingo! Exactly. I\xe2\x80\x99d write something in English. And your mother presumably understands English. So she would be able to understand what I wrote down and respond accordingly.Wife: So JSON is basically writing to someone in English?ME: Well sort of, but not quite: You see in English there are rules: we have full stops, commas, brackets, hyphens, apostrophes and they all mean different things. Basically we all have a common agreement what a full stop means and your mother would obey those rules when understanding my letter.Wife: So are you saying that JSON is a way of writing English to someone, but it has rules which both parties agree upon?Me: Exactly! Except these rules are very specific. In prosaic English, the rules are pretty loose. The rules when writing in English are sort of like cage fighting: you can do whatever you want, except a few basics: no biting, or eye gouging. For example, if I wanted to tell your mother: about our family I can do it in a few different ways.  Note the differences in each way.Wife: okMe: \xe2\x80\xa2   Example 1: Our family has 4 people: You, me and 2 kids.\xe2\x80\xa2   Example 2: Our family: you, me, kid1 and kid2.\xe2\x80\xa2   Example 3: Family: [ you, me, kid1, kid2]\xe2\x80\xa2   Example 4: we got 4 people in our family: mum, dad, kid1 and kid2.Wife:  Ok I get the picture. You can say the same thing many different ways in English. You can add a few words here and there. You can add a comma here and there and everyone will still understand.Me: Exactly. Except in JSON, the rules are very restrictive. You can only communicate in a certain way. And you must follow those rules for someone else to understand it.Wife: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t they just use plain English instead?Me: They would but remember we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with computers. A computer is stupid and is not going to be able to understand sentences. So we gotta be really specific when computers are involved otherwise they get confused. Also JSON is a fairly efficient way of communicating, so most of the irrelevant stuff is cut out, which is pretty hand. If you wanted to communicate our family, one way you could do so is like this:\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6and that is basically JSON. But remember, you MUST obey the JSON grammar rules. The grammar police will be on you if you slip up with JSON. You can\xe2\x80\x99t do that here because things simply will not work if you make mistakes.Wife: So how do I write in Json?Me: Well you basically are forced to communicate things using key-value pairs and using arrays.Wife: What does that mean?Me: Well now we are going into specific implementation details. And you\'d best be served by reading some of the above answers. I needn\'t repeat what they say, they do a pretty good job of explaining that stuff.Summaryto sum up, JSON is basically a way of communicating data to someone, with very, very specific rules. Break those rules and nobody will understand what you are talking about.I hope this helps you. If you have any questions, post a comment and I\'ll try to explain again.the common short answer is: if you are using AJAX to make data requests, you can easily send and return objects as JSON strings. Available extensions for Javascript support toJSON() calls on all javascript types for sending data to the server in an AJAX request. AJAX responses can return objects as JSON strings which can be converted into Javascript objects by a simple eval call, e.g. if the AJAX function someAjaxFunctionCallReturningJson returned you could write in JavascriptJSON can also be used for web service payloads et al, but it is really convenient for AJAX results.I like JSON mainly because it\'s so terse.  For web content that can be gzipped, this isn\'t necessarily a big deal (hence why xhtml is so popular).  But there are occasions where  this can be beneficial.For example, for one project I was transmitting information that needed to be serialized and transmitted via XMPP.  Since most servers will limit the amount of data you can transmit in a single message, I found it helpful to use JSON over the obvious alternative, XML.As an added bonus, if you\'re familiar with Python or Javascript, you already pretty much know JSON and can interpret it without much training at all.What is JSON?JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight data-interchange format inspired by the object literals of JavaScript. JSON values can consist of:objects (collections of name-value pairs)\n  arrays (ordered lists of values)\n  strings (in double quotes)\n  numbers\n  true, false, or nullJSON is language independent.JSON with PHP?After PHP Version 5.2.0, JSON extension is decodes and encodes functionalities as default.Json_encode     - returns the JSON representation of values\nJson_decode     - Decodes the JSON String\nJson_last_error - Returns the last error occured.JSON Syntax and Rules?JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax:Data is in name/value pairs\nData is separated by commas\nCurly braces hold objects\nSquare brackets hold arrayshttp://www.codingslover.com/2015/05/json-with-php-javascript-and-ajax.htmlJSON ExampleThe difference between JSON and conventional syntax would be as follows (in Javascript)ConventionalWith JSON if we use JSON we can define in different way asThe important thing we have to remember is that,  if we have to build the "Employee" class or modal with 100 elements without JSON method we have to parse everything when creating class. But with JSON we can define the objects inline only when a new object for the class is defined.so this line below is the way of doing things with JSON(just a simple way to define things)We have to do a project on college and we faced a very big problem, it is called Same Origin Policy. Amog other things, it makes that your XMLHttpRequest method from Javascript can\'t make requests to domains other than the domain that your site is on. For example you can\'t make request to www.otherexample.com if your site is on www.example.com. JSONRequest allows that, but you will get result in JSON format if that site allows that(for example it has a web service that returns messages in JSON).\nThat is one problem where you could use JSON perhaps.Here is something practical: Yahoo JSONIt\'s very simple. JSON stands for Java Script Object Notation. Think of it as an alternative to using XML for transferring data between software components. For example, I recently wrote a bunch of web services that returned JSON, and some Javascript developers then wrote code which called the services and consumed the information returned in that format. JSON(Javascript object notation) is a light weight data format for data exchange/transfer. Its in key value pair as the JavaScript is.\nFor REST API its widely used for data transfer from server to client. Nowadays many of the social media sites are using this. Although I don\'t see this as robust as XML with respect of data types. XML has very rich datatypes and XSD. JSON is bit lacking in this.For same amount of string data JSON will be lighter compare to XML as XML has all that opening and closing tags, etc...Try the following code to parse your php json response:\nread.phpserver.php
