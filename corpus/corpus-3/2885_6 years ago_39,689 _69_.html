Several times I\'ve been criticized for having suggested the use of the following methods:on Swing components. I don\'t see any alternative to their use when I want to define proportions between displayed components. I have been told this:With layouts the answer is always the same: use a suitable\n  LayoutManagerI have searched the web a little bit, but I haven\'t found any comprehensive analysis of the subject. So I have the following questions:I hope to have been clear.Should I completely avoid the use of those methods?Yes for application code.The methods have been defined for a reason. So when should I use them? In which context? For what purposes?I don\'t know, personally I think of it as an API design accident. Slightly forced by compound components having special ideas about child sizes. "Slightly", because they should have implemented their needs with a custom LayoutManager.What exactly are the negative consequences of using those methods? (I can only think adding portability between systems with different screen resolution.)Some (incomplete, and unfortunately the links are broken due to migration of SwingLabs to java.net) technical reasons are for instance mentioned in the Rules (hehe) or in the link @bendicott found in his/her comment to my answer. Socially, posing tons of work onto your unfortunate fellow who has to maintain the code and has to track down a broken layout.I don\'t think any LayoutManager can exactly satisfy all desired layout needs. Do I really need to implement a new LayoutManager for every little variation on my layout?Yes, there are LayoutManagers powerful enough to satisfy a very good approximation to "all layout needs". The big three are JGoodies FormLayout, MigLayout, DesignGridLayout. So no, in practice, you rarely write LayoutManagers except for simple highly specialized environments.If the answer to 4 is "yes", won\'t this lead to a proliferation of LayoutManager classes which will become difficult to maintain? (The answer to 4 is "no".)In a situation where I need to define proportions between children of a Component (for example, child 1 should use 10% of space, child 2 40%, child 3 50%), is it possible to achieve that without implementing a custom LayoutManager?Any of the Big-Three can, can\'t even GridBag (never bothered to really master, too much trouble for too little power).A few heuristics:Don\'t use set[Preferred|Maximum|Minimum]Size() when you really mean to override get[Preferred|Maximum|Minimum]Size(), as might be done in creating your own component, shown here.Don\'t use set[Preferred|Maximum|Minimum]Size() when you could rely on a component\'s carefully overridden getPreferred|Maximum|Minimum]Size, as shown here and below.Do use set[Preferred|Maximum|Minimum]Size() to derive post-validate() geometry, as shown below and here.If a component has no preferred size, e.g. JDesktopPane, you may have to size the container, but any such choice is arbitrary. A comment may help clarify the intent.Consider alternate or custom layouts when you find that you would have to loop through many components to obtain derived sizes, as mentioned in these comments.Should I completely avoid the use of those methods?No, there is no formal evidence to suggest calling or overriding these methods is not allowed. In fact Oracle says these methods are used for giving size hints: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/using.html#sizealignment.They may also be overriden (which is the best practice for Swing) when extending a Swing component (rather then calling the method on the custom component instance)Most importatly no matter how you specify your component\'s size, be sure that your component\'s container uses a layout manager that respects the requested size of the component. The methods have been defined for a reason. So when should I use them?\n  In which context? For what purposes?When you need to provide customized size hints to the containers Layout manager, so that the component will be laid out wellWhat exactly are the negative consequences of using those methods? (I\n  can only think adding portability between systems with different\n  screen resolution).Many layout managers do not pay attention to a component\'s requested maximum size. However, BoxLayout and SpringLayout do. Furthermore, GroupLayout provides the ability to set the minimum, preferred or maximum size explicitly, without touching the component.Make sure that you really need to set the component\'s exact size. Each Swing component has a different preferred size, depending on the font it uses and the look and feel. Thus having a set size might produce varied looks of the UI on different Systemssometimes problems can be encountered with GridBagLayout and text fields, wherein if the size of the container is smaller than the preferred size, the minimum size gets used, which can cause text fields to shrink quite substantially.JFrame does not enforce overriden getMinimumSize() only calling setMinimumSize(..) on its worksI don\'t think any LayoutManager can exactly satisfy all desired layout\n  needs. Do I really need to implement a new LayoutManager for every\n  little variation on my layout ?If by implementing you mean using then yes. Not one LayoutManger can handle everything, each LayoutManager has its pros and cons thus each can be used together to produce the final layout.Reference:There are a lot of good answers here but I want to add a little more about the reasons why you should normally avoid these (the question just came up again in a duplicate topic):With few exceptions, if you are using these methods you are probably fine-tuning your GUI to look good on a specific look-and-feel (and with your system-specific settings, e.g. your preferred desktop font, etc.). The methods themselves aren\'t inherently evil, but the typical reasons for using them are. As soon as you start tuning pixel positions and sizes in a layout you run the risk of your GUI breaking (or at minimum, looking bad), on other platforms.As an example of this, try changing your application\'s default look-and-feel. Even just with the options available on your platform, you may be surprised at how poorly the results can be rendered.So, in the name of keeping your GUI functional and nice-looking on all platforms (remember, one of the major benefits of Java is its cross-platformness), you should rely on layout managers, etc., to automatically adjust the sizes of your components so that it renders correctly outside of your specific development environment.All that said, you can certainly conceive of situations where these methods are justified. Again, they aren\'t inherently evil, but their usage is normally a big red flag indicating potential GUI issues. Just make sure you are aware of the high potential for complications if/when you use them, and always try and think if there is another look-and-feel-independent solution to your problems -- more often than not you will find that these methods are not necessary.By the way, if you find yourself getting frustrated with standard layout managers, there are a lot of good free, open-source third-party ones, for example JGoodies\' FormLayout, or MigLayout. Some GUI builders even have built-in support for third-party layout managers -- Eclipse\'s WindowBuilder GUI editor, for example, ships with support for FormLayout and MigLayout.If you are having trouble with layouts in Java Swing, then I can highly recommend the JGoodies FormLayout provided freely as part of the Forms freeware library by Karsten Lentzsch here.This very popular layout manager is extremely flexible, allowing for very polished Java UIs to be developed.You\'ll find Karsten\'s documentation in this pdf, and some rather good documentation from google here.In a situation where I need to define proportions between children of a Component (child 1 should use 10% of space, child2 40% ,child3 50%), is it possible to achieve that without implementing a custom layout manager?Maybe GridBagLayout would satisfy your needs. Besides that, there\'s a ton of layout managers on the web, and I bet there\'s one that fits your requirements.These methods are poorly understood by most people. You should absolutely not ignore these methods. It is up to the layout manager if they honor these methods. This page has a table that shows which layout managers honor which of those methods:http://thebadprogrammer.com/swing-layout-manager-sizing/I have been writing Swing code for 8+ years and the layout managers included in the JDK have always served my needs. I have never needed a 3rd party layout manager to achieve my layouts.I will say that you shouldn\'t try to give the layout manager hints with these methods until you are sure you need them. Do your layout without giving any sizing hints (i.e. let the layout manager do its job) and then you can make minor corrections if you need to.I am seeing it differenty than the accepted answer.Never avoid! They\'re there to express the size constraints of your components to the layout manager. You can avoid using them if you\'re not using any layout manager and try to manage the visual layout on your own.Unfortunately, Swing is not coming with reasonable default dimensions. However, instead of setting the dimensions of a component, it is better OOP to descend your own component with reasonable defaults. (In that case you call setXXX in your descendant class.) Alternatively, you can override the getXXX methods for the same effect.Always. When you create a component, set its realistic min/preferred/max size according to the use of that component. For example, if you have a JTextField for entering country symbols such as UK, its preferred size shall be as wide to fit two chars (with the current font, etc.) but probably it is meaningless to let it grow any bigger. After all, country symbols are two chars. \nAs opposite, if you have a JTextField for entering e.g. a customer name, it can have a preferred size for like the pixel size for 20 chars, but can grow to bigger if the layout is resized, so set the maximum size to more. At the same time, having a 0px wide JTextField is pointless, so set a realistic minimum size (I would say the pixel size of 2 chars).(I can only think adding portability between systems with different screen resolution).No negative consequences. These are hints for the layout manager.Do I really need to implement a new LayoutManager for every little variation on my layout ?No, definitely not. The usual approach is to cascade different basic layoutmanagers such as horizontal and vertical layout.For example, the layout below:is having two parts. The left and right parts are a horizontal layout. The right part is a JPanel added to the horizontal layout, and this JPanel is having a vertical layout which lays out the buttons vertically.Of course, this can grow tricky with a real life layout. Therefore grid-based layout managers such as MigLayout are much better if you\'re about to develop anything serious.No, you definitely shall not develop layout managers, unless you need something very special.between children of a Component (eg, child1 should use 10% of space, child2 40% ,child3 50%), is it possible to achieve that without implementing a custom LayoutManager?Basically, once the preferred sizes are set right, you may not want to do anything in percentage. Simply, because percentages are pointless (e.g. it is pointless to have a JTextField 10% of the window size - since one can shrink the window so that JTextField becomes 0px wide, or can expand the window so that the JTextField is across two displays on a multi-display setup).But, may times you may use the percentages to control sizes of bigger building blocks of your gui (panels, for example).You can use JSplitPane where you can pre-set the ratio of the two sides. Or, you can use MigLayout which allows you to set such constraints in percentage, pixels, and other units.
