In an Android application, how do you start a new activity (GUI) when a button in another activity is clicked, and how do you pass data between these two activities?Easy.Extras are retrieved on the other side via:Don\'t forget to add your new activity in the AndroidManifest.xml:Create an intent to a ViewPerson activity and pass the PersonID (for a database lookup, for example).Then in ViewPerson Activity, you can get the bundle of extra data, make sure it isn\'t null (in case if you sometimes don\'t pass data), then get the data.Now if you need to share data between two Activities, you can also have a Global Singleton.Then call it in any activity by:When user clicks on the button, directly inside the XML like that: Using the attribute android:onClick we declare the method name that has to be present on the parent activity. So I have to create this method inside our activity like that:Current responses are great but a more comprehensive answer is needed for beginners. There are 3 different ways to start a new activity in Android, and they all use the Intent class; Intent | Android Developers. Here\'s the link to my example if you want to follow along: https://github.com/martinsing/ToNewActivityButtonsButtons have an onClick attribute that is found within the .xml file: In Java class:Advantage: Easy to make on the fly, modular, and can easily set multiple onClicks to the same intent easily. Disadvantage: Difficult readability when reviewing.This is when you set a separate setOnClickListener() to each button and override each onClick() with its own intent.    In Java class: Advantage: Easy to make on the fly. Disadvantage: there will be a lot of anonymous classes which will make readability difficult when reviewing.This is when you use a switch statement for your buttons within the onClick() method to manage all the Activity\'s buttons. In Java class:Advantage: Easy button management because all button intents are registered in a single onClick() methodFor the second part of the question, passing data, please see How do I pass data between Activities in Android application?Emmanuel, I think the extra info should be put before starting the activity otherwise the data won\'t be available yet if you\'re accessing it in the onCreate method of NextActivity.    From the sending Activity try the following codeFrom the receiving Activity try the following code:Then just add the following code to the AndroidManifest.xml fileThe way to start new activities is to broadcast an intent, and there is a specific kind of intent that you can use to pass data from one activity to another. My recommendation is that you check out the Android developer docs related to intents; it\'s a wealth of info on the subject, and has examples too. You can try this code:Try this simple method.Implement the View.OnClickListener interface and override the onClick method.Start another activity from this activity and u can pass parameters via Bundle Object also.Retrive data in another activity (YourActivity)Starting an activity from another activity is very common scenario in android application development. To start an you need an Intent object.An intent object takes two parameter in its constructorSo for example,if you have two activities, say HomeActivity and DetailActivity and you want to start DetailActivity from HomeActivity\n(HomeActivity-->DetailActivity). Here is the code snippet to start DetailActivity from HomeActivity.      And you are done.Coming back to button click part.
