I\'m using JQuery to select some elements on a page and then move them around in the DOM. The problem I\'m having is I need to select all the elements in the reverse order that JQuery naturally wants to select them. For example:I want to select all the li items and use the .each() command on them but I want to start with Item 5, then Item 4 etc. Is this possible?I present you with the cleanest way ever, in the form of the world\'s smallest jquery plugin:Usage:-All credit to Michael Geary in his post here: http://www.mail-archive.com/discuss@jquery.com/msg04261.htmlYou can dofollowed byHere are different options for this:First: without jQuery:... and with jQuery:You can use this:Demo hereAnother way, using also jQuery with reverse is:This demo here.One more alternative is to use the length (count of elements matching that selector) and go down from there using the index of each iteration. Then you can use this:This demo hereOne more, kind of related to the one above:Demo hereI prefer creating a reverse plug-in egUsage eg:Needed to do a reverse on $.each so i used Vinay idea:worked nicely, thanksIf you don\'t want to save method into jQuery.fn you can useYou cannot iterate backwards with the jQuery each function, but you can still leverage jQuery syntax.Try the following:I found Array.prototype.reverse unsuccessful with objects, so I made a new jQuery function to use as an alternative: jQuery.eachBack(). It iterates through as the normal jQuery.each() would, and stores each key into an array. It then reverses that array and performs the callback on the original array/object in the order of the reversed keys.I recognize that jQuery supports and encourages plugins. That said, you may find this article relevant: Don\xe2\x80\x99t modify objects you don\xe2\x80\x99t own. In this case at least, I opted not to extend jQuery on the off chance that another plugin defines reverse differently.Here\'s a simple solution that doesn\'t extend the jQuery object.You can also tryI think u need
