Is there a good way to adjust the size of a UITextView to conform to its content? Say for instance I have a UITextView that contains one line of text:I then add another line of text:Is there a good way in Cocoa Touch to get the rect that will hold all of the lines in the text view so that I can adjust the parent view accordingly?As another example, look at the notes\' field for events in the Calendar application - note how the cell (and the UITextView it contains) expands to hold all lines of text in the notes\' string.This works for both iOS 6.1 and iOS 7:Or in Swift If you want support for iOS 6.1 then you should also:There is actually a very easy way to do resizing of the UITextView to its correct height of the content. It can be done using the UITextView contentSize. One thing to note is that the correct contentSize is only available after the UITextView has been added to the view with addSubview. Prior to that it is equal to frame.sizeThis will not work if auto layout is ON. With auto layout, the general approach is to use the sizeThatFits method and update the constant value on a height constraint.heightConstraint is a layout constraint that you typically setup via a IBOutlet by linking the property to the height constraint created in a storyboard.Just to add to this amazing answer, 2014, if you:there is a difference in behaviour with the iPhone6+ only:With the 6+ only (not the 5s or 6) it does add "one more blank line" to the UITextView. The "RL solution" fixes this perfectly:It fixes the "extra line" problem on 6+.To make a dynamically sizing UITextView inside a UITableViewCell, I found the following combination works in Xcode 6 with the iOS 8 SDK:If your table is using the original default row height of 44 then it will automatically calculate row heights, but if you changed the default row height to something else, you may need to manually switch on auto-calculation of row heights in viewDidLoad:For read-only dynamically sizing UITextViews, that\xe2\x80\x99s it. If you\xe2\x80\x99re allowing users to edit the text in your UITextView, you also need to: Implement the textViewDidChange: method of the UITextViewDelegate protocol, and tell the tableView to repaint itself every time the text is edited:And don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to set the UITextView delegate somewhere, either in Storyboard or in tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:Swift   :In my (limited) experience, does not respect newline characters, so you can end up with a lot shorter CGSize than is actually required.does seem to respect the newlines.Also, the text isn\'t actually rendered at the top of the UITextView.  In my code, I set the new height of the UITextView to be 24 pixels larger than the height returned by the sizeOfFont methods.In iOS6, you can check the contentSize property of UITextView right after you set the text. In iOS7, this will no longer work. If you want to restore this behavior for iOS7, place the following code in a subclass of UITextView.I will post right solution at the bottom of the page in case someone is brave (or despaired enough) to read to this point.Here is gitHub repo for those, who don\'t want to read all that text: resizableTextViewThis works with iOs7 (and I do believe it will work with iOs8) and with autolayout. You don\'t need magic numbers, disable layout and stuff like that. Short and elegant solution.I think, that all constraint-related code should go to updateConstraints method. So, let\'s make our own ResizableTextView.The first problem we meet here is that don\'t know real content size before viewDidLoad method. We can take long and buggy road and calculate it based on font size, line breaks, etc. But we need robust solution, so we\'ll do:CGSize contentSize = [self sizeThatFits:CGSizeMake(self.frame.size.width, FLT_MAX)];So now we know real contentSize no matter where we are: before or after viewDidLoad. Now add height constraint on textView (via storyboard or code, no matter how). We\'ll adjust that value with our contentSize.height:The last thing to do is to tell superclass to updateConstraints.Now our class looks like:ResizableTextView.mPretty and clean, right? And you don\'t have to deal with that code in your controllers!But wait!\nY NO ANIMATION!You can easily animate changes to make textView stretch smoothly. Here is an example:Just set No need to do anything apart of this.Did you try [textView sizeThatFits:textView.bounds] ?Edit: sizeThatFits returns the size but does not actually resize the component. I\'m not sure if that\'s what you want, or if [textView sizeToFit] is more what you were looking for. In either case, I do not know if it will perfectly fit the content like you want, but it\'s the first thing to try.Another method is the find the size a particular string will take up using the NSString method:-(CGSize)sizeWithFont:(UIFont *)font constrainedToSize:(CGSize)size This returns the size of the rectangle that fits the given string with the given font. Pass in a size with the desired width and a maximum height, and then you can look at the height returned to fit the text. There is a version that lets you specify line break mode also.You can then use the returned size to change the size of your view to fit.If you don\'t have the UITextView handy (for example, you\'re sizing table view cells), you\'ll have to calculate the size by measuring the string, then accounting for the 8 pt of padding on each side of a UITextView. For example, if you know the desired width of your text view and want to figure out the corresponding height:Here, each 8 is accounting for one of the four padded edges, and 100000 just serves as a very large maximum size.In practice, you may want to add an extra font.leading to the height; this adds a blank line below your text, which may look better if there are visually heavy controls directly beneath the text view.The following things are enough:You may even use UITableViewAutomaticDimension.We can do it by constraints .2.Create IBOutlet for that height constraint.3.don\'t forget to set delegate for your textview.4.then update your constraint like this :)Combined with Mike McMaster\'s answer, you might want to do something like:I found out a way to resize the height of a text field according to the text inside it and also arrange a label below it based on the height of the text field! Here is the code. Guys using autolayout and your sizetofit isn\'t working, then please check your width constraint once. If you had missed the width constraint then the height will be accurate.No need to use any other API. just one line would fix all the issue.Here, I was only concerned with height, keeping the width fixed and had missed the width constraint of my TextView in storyboard.And this was to show up the dynamic content from the services.Hope this might help..Starting with iOS 8, it is possible to use the auto layout features of a UITableView to automatically resize a UITextView with no custom code at all. I have put a project in github that demonstrates this in action, but here is the key:here is the swift version of @jhibberdThis worked nicely when I needed to make text in a UITextView fit a specific area:For iOS 7.0, instead of setting the frame.size.height to the contentSize.height (which currently does nothing) use [textView sizeToFit].See this question.Hope this helps:if any other get here, this solution work for me, 1"Ronnie Liew"+4"user63934" (My text arrive from web service):\n  note the 1000 (nothing can be so big "in my case")And that is... CheersThe Best way which I found out to re-size the height of the UITextView according to the size of the text.or You can USEFor those who want the textview to actually move up and maintain the bottom line positionThe only code that will work is the one that uses \'SizeToFit\' as in jhibberd answer above but actually it won\'t pick up unless you call it in ViewDidAppear or wire it to UITextView text changed event.Based on Nikita Took\'s answer I came to the following solution in Swift which works on iOS 8 with autolayout:Swift answer:\nThe following code computes the height of your textView.  Now you can set the height of your textView to myTextHeightI reviewed all the answers and all are keeping fixed width and adjust only height. If you wish to adjust also width you can very easily use this method:so when configuring your text view, set scroll disabledand then in delegate method func textViewDidChange(_ textView: UITextView) add this code:Outputs:Here is the answer if you need resize textView and tableViewCell dynamically in staticTableView[https://stackoverflow.com/a/43137182/5360675][1]this method seems to work for ios7
