I am getting my feet wet on git and have the following issue:My project source tree:I have code (currently MEF) in my vendor branch that I will compile there and then move the references into /src/refs which is where the project picks them up from.My issue is that I have my .gitignore set to ignore *.dll and *.pdb.  I can do a git add -f bar.dll to force the addition of the ignored file which is ok, the problem is I can not figure out to list what files exist that are ignored.I want to list the ignored files to make sure that I don\'t forget to add them.I have read the man page on git ls-files and can not make it work.  It seems to me that git ls-files --exclude-standard -i should do what I want.  What am I missing?UPDATE:git ls-files -i will not work, you get the error: git ls-files --others -i --exclude-from=.git/info/exclude as VonC suggested below is indeed the answer.  The --exclude-standard option also works instead of --exclude-from.Summary of what works:Notes: Also interesting (mentioned in qwertymk\'s answer), you can also use the git check-ignore -v command, at least on Unix (doesn\'t work well in a CMD Windows session)The second one displays the actual rule of the .gitignore which makes a file to be ignored in your git repo.\nOn Unix, using "What expands to all files in current directory recursively?" and a bash4+:(or a find -exec command)Original answer 42009)should work, except its source code indicates:exc_given ?It turns out it need one more parameter after the -i to actually list anything:Try:(but that would only list your cached (non-ignored) object, with a filter, so that is not quite what you want)Example:Actually, in my \'gitignore\' file (called \'exclude\'), I find a command line that could help you:So....should do the trick.As mentioned in the ls-files man page, --others is the important part, in order to show you non-cached, non-committed, normally-ignored files.--exclude_standard is not just a shortcut, but a way to include all standard "ignored  patterns" settings.exclude-standard\n  Add the standard git exclusions: .git/info/exclude, .gitignore in each directory, and the user\'s global exclusion file.Another option that\'s pretty clean (No pun intended.):Explanation:Note: This solution will not show ignored files that have already been "cleaned."EDIT:It is possible for this method to not catch all files which are ignored by git status. See here for examples.There is a much simpler way to do it (git 1.7.6+):git status --ignored See Is there a way to tell git-status to ignore the effects of .gitignore files?While generally correct your solution does not work in all circumstances.\nAssume a repo dir like this:and a .gitignore like this:This ignores the doc directory and all files below tmp.\nGit works as expected, but the given command for listing the ignored files does not.\nLets have a look at what git has to say:Notice that doc is missing from the listing.\nYou can get it with:Notice the additional --directory option.From my knowledge there is no one command to list all ignored files at once.\nBut I don\'t know why tmp/dir0 does not show up at all.Git now has this functionality built inOf course you can change the glob to something like **/*.dll in your caseGit ReferenceIt should be sufficient to use as that covers everything covered bytherefore the latter is redundant.Now you can just type git ignored to see the list.  Much easier to remember, and faster to type.If you prefer the more succinct display of Jason Geng\'s solution, you can add an alias for that like this:However the more verbose output is more useful for troubleshooting problems with your .gitignore files, as it lists every single cotton-pickin\' file that is ignored.  You would normally pipe the results through grep to see if a file you expect to be ignored is in there, or if a file you don\'t want to be ignore is in there.Then, when you just want to see a short display, it\'s easy enough to remember and type(The -s can normally be left off.)Here\'s how to print the complete list of files in the working tree which match patterns located anywhere in Git\'s multiple gitignore sources (if you\'re using GNU find):It will check all the files in the current branch of the repository (unless you\'ve deleted them locally).And it identifies the particular gitignore source lines, as well.Git continues to track changes in some files which match gitignore patterns, simply because those files were added already. Usefully, the above command displays those files, too.If you\'re using Windows, Git Bash includes GNU find (as revealed by find --version).If the list is long (and you have rev), you can display them by extension (somewhat), too:For more details, see man find, man git-check-ignore, man rev, and man sort.Assuming there are a few ignore directories, why not use "git status node/logs/" which will tell you what files are to be added? In the directory I have a text file that is not part of status output, e.g.:On branch master\n  Your branch is up-to-date with \'origin/master\'.\n  Untracked files:\n  (use "git add ..." to include in what will be committed).gitignore is:*\n!.gitignore
