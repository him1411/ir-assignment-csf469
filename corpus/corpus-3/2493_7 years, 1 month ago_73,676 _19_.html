I recently discovered Ctrl+E and Ctrl+Y shortcuts for Vim that respectively move the screen up and down with a one line step, without moving the cursor.Do you know any command that leaves the cursor where it is but moves the screen so that the line which has the cursor becomes the first line? (having a command for the last line would be a nice bonus).I can achieve this by manually pressing Ctrl+E (or Ctrl+Y) the proper number of times, but having a command that somehow does this directly would be nice.Any ideas?Additionally:Ctrl-y and Ctrl-e only change the cursor position if it would be moved off screen.Courtesy of http://www.lagmonster.org/docs/vi2.html Vim requires the cursor to be in the current screen at all times, however, you could bookmark the current position scroll around and then return to where you were.To leave the cursor in the same column when you use Ctrl+D, Ctrl+F, Ctrl+B, Ctrl+U, G, H, M, L, ggyou should define the following option:You can prefix your cursor move commands with a number and that will repeat that command that many times10Ctrl+E will do Ctrl+E 10 times instead of one.You may find aswers to this question useful: Scrolling Vim relative to cursor, custom mapping: you can use ScrollToPercent(0) from that question to do this.Sometimes it is useful to scroll text with K and J keys.\nSo I have this "scroll mode" function in my .vimrc (also binded on zs)scroll_mode.vimHere\'s my solution in vimrc:So that the cursor will stay in the middle of the screen, and the screen will moves up or down.zEnter does exactly what this question asks for.It works where strangely zz would not work (vim 7.4.1689 on Ubuntu 2016.04 LTS with no special .vimrc)
