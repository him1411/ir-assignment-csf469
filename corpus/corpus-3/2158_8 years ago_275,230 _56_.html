I\'d like to change the color of the placeholder text I set in my UITextField controls, to make it black.I\'d prefer to do this without using normal text as the placeholder and having to override all the methods to imitate the behaviour of a placeholder.I believe if I override this method:then I should be able to do this. But I\'m unsure how to access the actual placeholder object from within this method.Since the introduction of attributed strings in UIViews in iOS 6, it\'s possible to assign a color to the placeholder text like this:Easy and pain-free, could be an easy alternative for some.Not suggested for production, Apple may reject your submission.You can override drawPlaceholderInRect:(CGRect)rect as such to manually render the placeholder text:Maybe you want to try this way, but Apple might warn you about accessing private ivar:NOTE\nThis is not working on iOS 7 anymore, according to Martin All\xc3\xa9us.You can Change the Placeholder textcolor to any color which you want by using the below code.This works in Swift <3.0: Tested in iOS 8.2 and iOS 8.3 beta 4.Swift 3:In Swift :The following only with iOS6+  (as indicated in Alexander W\'s comment):With this we  can change the color of textfield\'s placeholder text in iOS I had already faced this issue. In mycase below code is correct. Hope, this may help you. It is working for 7.0 and above.Why don\'t you just use UIAppearance method:Also in your storyboard, without single line of codeHope it helps.Note: Apple may reject (0.01% chances) your app as we are accessing private API. I am using this in all my projects since two years, but Apple didn\'t ask for this.For Xamarin.iOS developers, I found it from this document\nhttps://developer.xamarin.com/api/type/Foundation.NSAttributedString/In order to change placeholder color in storyboard, create an extension with next code. (feel free to update this code, if you think, it can be clearer and safer).Swift version. Probably it would help someone.To handle both vertical and horizontal alignment as well as color of placeholder in iOS7. drawInRect and drawAtPoint no longer use current context fillColor.https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/StringsTextFonts/Conceptual/TextAndWebiPhoneOS/CustomTextProcessing/CustomTextProcessing.htmlObj-C Categories FTW. Could be optimized to check for effective color change.Overriding drawPlaceholderInRect: would be the correct way, but it does not work due to a bug in the API (or the documentation).The method never gets called on an UITextField.See also drawTextInRect on UITextField not calledYou might use digdog\'s solution. As I am not sure if that gets past Apples review, I chose a different solution: Overlay the text field with my own label which imitates the placeholder behaviour.This is a bit messy though.\nThe code looks like this (Note I am doing this inside a subclass of TextField):iOS 6 and later offers "attributedPlaceholder" on UITextField. \niOS 3.2 and later offers "setAttributes:range:" on NSMutableAttributedString.You can do the following: Iam new to xcode and i found a way around to the same effect.I placed a uilabel in place of place holder with the desired format and hide it in I agree its a work around and not a real solution but the effect was same got it from this linkNOTE: Still works on iOS 7 :|The best i can do for both iOS7 and less is:For those using Monotouch (Xamarin.iOS), here\'s Adam\'s answer, translated to C#:I needed to keep the placeholder alignment so adam\'s answer was not enough for me.To solve this I used a small variation that I hope will help some of you too:Another option that doesn\'t require subclassing - leave placeholder blank, and put a label on top of edit button. Manage the label just like you would manage the placeholder (clearing once user inputs anything..)For set Attributed Textfield Placeholder with Multiple color , Just specify the Text ,Output :- I would suggest another solution. Since the placeholder text uses the default font settings of the textfield, just set the initial font color to the placeholder font color you want. Then set the delegate of your UITextField and implement the following methods:So, if a user starts typing in the textfield the color of the text changes to black and after the textfield gets cleared again the placeholder text will appear in red color again.
