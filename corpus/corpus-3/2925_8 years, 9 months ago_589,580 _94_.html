Best way to center a <div> element on a page both vertically and horizontally?I know that margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; will center on the horizontal, but what is the best way to do it vertically, too?My demo on dabblet.comThe main trick in this demo is that in the normal flow of elements going from top to bottom, so the margin-top: auto is set to zero. However, an absolutely positioned element acts the same for distribution of free space, and similarly can be centered vertically at the specified top and bottom (does not work in IE7).Even though this did not work when the OP asked this question, I think, for modern browsers at least, the best solution is to use display: flex or pseudo classes.You can see an example in the following fiddle.\nHere is the updated fiddle.For pseudo classes an example could be:The usage of display: flex, according to css-tricks and MDN is as follows:There are other attributes available for flex, which are explained in above mentioned links, with further examples.If you have to support older browsers, which don\'t support css3, then you should probably use javascript or the fixed width/height solution shown in the other answers.Simplicity of this technique is stunning:\n(This method has its implications though, but if you only need to center element regardless of flow of the rest of the content, it\'s just fine. Use with care)  Markup:    And CSS:   This will center element horizontally and vertically too. No negative margins, just power of transforms. Also we should already forget about IE8 shouldn\'t we?translate may be better than translate3d in some scenarios due to it being supported by a greater number of browsers. http://caniuse.com/#search=translateTo sum it up, this method is supported on all versions of Chrome, Firefox 3.5+, Opera 11.5+, all versions of Safari, IE 9+, and Edge.What this does is first position the div\'s top left corner at the center of the page (using position: fixed; top: 50%; left: 50%). Then, translate moves it up by 50% of the div\'s height to center it vertically on the page. Finally, translate also moves the div to the right by 50% of it\'s width to center it horizontally.\n\n\nThis is an edited copy of an answer by someone else that was just deleted while I was editing it, so now I am re-posting the answer.I think there are two ways to make a div center align through CSS.This is the simple and best way. for the demo please visit below link:http://w3webpro.blogspot.in/2013/07/how-to-make-div-horizontally-and.htmlHere is a script i wrote a while back (it is written using the jQuery library):If you are looking at the new browsers(IE10+),then you can make use of transform property to align a div at the center.And css for this should be:The catch here is that you don\'t even have to specify the height and width of the div as it takes care by itself. Also, if you want to position a div at the center of another div, then you can just specify the position of outer div as relative and then this CSS starts working for your div.How it works:When you specify left and top at 50%, the div goes at the the bottom right quarter of the page with its top-left end pinned at the center of the page. \nThis is because, the left/top properties(when given in %) are calculated based on height of the outer div(in your case, window). But transform uses height/width of the element to determine translation, so you div will move left(50% width) and top(50% its height) since they are given in negatives, thus aligning it to the center of the page.If you have to support  older browsers(and sorry including IE9 as well) then the table cell is most popular method to use.Simple solution taking advantage of Flex DisplayCSSHTMLCheck out http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/The first div takes up the whole screen and has a display:flex set for every browser. The second div (centered div) takes advantage of the display:flex div where margin:auto works brilliantly.Note IE11+ compatibility. (IE10 w/ prefix).Additionally: Here are some cross browser compatible classes for FlexBox\'s that I use in my projects so things wont break. Maybe it\'ll save you some headaches.CSSI also have classes flexcolnowrap and flexrownowrap (in which the word wrap is replaced with nowrap), as well as flex2, flex3, and up to 6 for convenience. My prefered way to center a box both vertically and horizontally, is the following technique :The elegance of this technique, is that you can add your content to the content box without worrying about its height or width!See also this Fiddle!Yes, I know you can achieve more or less the same flexibility with transform: translate(-50%, -50%); or transform: translate3d(-50%,-50%, 0);, the technique I\'m proposing has far better browser support. Even with browsers prefixes like -webkit, -ms or -moz, transform doesn\'t offer quite the same browser support.So if you care about older browsers (eg. IE9 and below), you should not use transform for positioning.Explanation:Give it an absolute positioning (the parent should have relative positioning). Then, the upper left corner is moved to the center. Because you don\'t know the width/height yet, you use css transform to translate the position relatively to the middle. translate(-50%, -50%) does reduce the x and y position of the upper left corner by 50% of width and height.I know I am late to the party but here is a way to center a div with unknown dimension inside a parent of unknown dimension.style:HTML:DEMO:Check out this demo.There is actually a solution, using css3, which can vertically center a div of unknown height. The trick is to move the div down by 50%, then use transformY to get it back up to the middle. The only prerequisite is that the to-be-centered element has a parent. Example:Supported by all major browsers, and IE 9 and up (don\'t bother about IE 8, as it died together with win xp this autumn. Thank god.)JS Fiddle DemoThis is the best code to centre the div bot horizontally and vertically This solution worked for me(or height : 70% / bottom : 15% height : 40% / bottom :30% ...) Adjust left and top with respect to width and height, that is (100% - 80%) / 2 = 10% One more method (bulletproof) taken from here utilizing \'display:table\' rule:MarkupCSS:I was looking at Laravel\'s view file and noticed that they centered text perfectly in the middle. I remembered about this question immediately. \nThis is how they did it: Result looks so:Using display:grid on parent  and setting margin:auto  to the centrerd elemnt will do the trick : See below snippet :if you Guys are using jquery ui, you can do this by using .position();CSSJqueryI hope this Helps.jsfiddle : http://jsfiddle.net/vx9gV/An alternative answer would be this.and the css:SolutionUsing only two lines of CSS, utilizing the magical power of FlexboxIs the browser supports it, using translate is powerful.In case you know a defined sized for your div you could use calc.Live example: https://jsfiddle.net/o8416eq3/Notes: This works only if you hard coded the width and height of your ``div` in the CSS.Sorry for late reply\nbest way is margin-top and margin-left should be according to your div box size position: absolute div in body documentAn element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport (body tag), like fixed).However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.source: CSS position
