Is the property text-align: center; a good way to center an image using CSS?That will not work as the text-align property applies to block containers, not inline elements, and img is an inline element. See the W3C spec.Use this instead:That doesn\'t always work... if it doesn\'t, try:Came across this post and it worked for me:(Vertical and horizontal alignment)Another way of doing would be centering an enclosing paragraph:You can do:<center><img src="..." /></center>Actually, the only problem with your code is that the text-align attribute applies to text (yes, images count as text) inside of the tag.  You would want to put a span tag around the image and set its style to text-align: center, as so:  The image will be centered.  In response to your question, it is the easiest and most foolproof way to center images, as long as you remember to apply the rule to the image\'s containing span (or div).  Only if you need to support ancient IE browsers.The modern approach is to do margin: 0 auto in your CSS.Example here: http://jsfiddle.net/bKRMY/HTML:CSS:Only issue ihere is that the width of the paragraph must be the same as the width of the image.  If you don\'t put a width on the paragraph, it will not work, because it will assume 100% and your image will be aligned left, unless of course you use text-align:center.Try out the fiddle and experiment with it if you like.if you are using a class with image then the following will doif it is only an image in a specific calss that you want to center align then following will doThere are three methods for centering an element that I can suggest.using text-align propertyusing margin propertyusing position propertyThe first and second methods only work if the parent is at least as wide as the  image. When the image is wider than its parent, the image will not stay centered!!!But:\nThird method is a good way for that!Here\'s an example:simply change parent align :)Try this one on parent properties text-align:centeryou can use text-align: center on the parent and change the img to display: inline-block ->it therefore behaves like a text-element and is will be centered if the parent has a width!On the container holding image You can use css3 flex box to perfectly center the image inside, both vertically and horizontally.\nLet assume You have  as image holder:\nthen as css You have to use And this will make all your content inside this div perfectly centered.I would use a div to center align an image.
