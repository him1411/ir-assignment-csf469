I have used the code for my modal straight from the Bootstrap example, and have included only the bootstrap.js (and not bootstrap-modal.js). However, my modal is appearing underneath the grey fade (backdrop) and is non editable.Here\'s what it looks like:See this fiddle for one way  to reproduce this problem. The basic structure of that code is like this:Any ideas why this is or what I can do to fix this?If the modal container has a fixed or relative position or is within an element with fixed or relative position this behavior will occur.Make sure the modal container and all of its parent elements are positioned the default way to fix the problem.Here are a couple ways to do this:The problem has to do with the positioning of the parent containers. You can easily "move" your modal out from these containers before displaying it. Here\'s how to do it if you were showing your modal using js:Or, if you launch modal using buttons, drop the .modal(\'show\'); and just do:This will keep all normal functionality, allowing you to show the modal using a button.Also, make sure that version of BootStrap css and js are the same ones. Different versions can also make modal appearing under background:For example:Bad:Good:I tried all options supplied above but didn\'t get it to work using those.What did work: setting the z-index of the .modal-backdrop to -1.I have also encountered this problem and none of the solutions worked for me until i figured out i actually don\'t need a backdrop. You can easily remove the backdrop with the folowing code.Note the data-backdrop attribute has been set to falseI got it to work by giving a high z-index value to the modal window AFTER opening it. E.g.:Solution provided by @Muhd is the best way to do it. But if you are stuck in a situation where changing structure of the page is not an option, use this trick: The trick in here is data-backdrop="false" style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"  by removing the default backdrop and create a dummy one by setting background color of the dialog itself with some alpha.Update 1:\nAs pointed out by @Gustyn that clicking on the background does not close the dialog as is expected. So to achieve that you have to add some java script code. Here is some example how you can achieve this.  A but late on this but here is a generic solution -Visit this link - Bootstrap 3 - modal disappearing below backdrop when using a fixed sidebar for details.An other way to approach this is to remove the z-index from the .modal-backdrop in bootstrap.css. This will cause the backdrop to be on the same level as the rest of your body (it will still fade) and your modal to be on top..modal-backdrop looks like thisI\'ve simply set:and it works.... For the original question: This problem can often be experienced when using things like gradients in CSS for things like backgrounds or even accordion headers.Unfortunately, modifying or overriding core Bootstrap CSS is undesirable, and can lead to unwanted side effects. The least intrusive approach is to add data-backdrop="false" but you may notice that the fade effect no longer works as expected.After following recent releases of Bootstrap, version 3.3.5 seems to resolve this issue with no unwanted side effects.Download: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/download/v3.3.5/bootstrap-3.3.5-dist.zipBe sure to include the CSS files and JavaScript files from 3.3.5.Just add two lines of CSS:The .modal-backdrop should have 1050 value to set it over the navbar.none of the suggested solutions above worked for me but this technique solved the issue:I had this issue and the easiest way to fix it was addind z-index greater than 1040 on the modal-dialog div:I believe bootstrap create a div modal-backdrop fade in which in my case has the z-index 1040, so if You put the modal-dialog on top of this, it should not be grey out anymore.set the z-index .modal to a highest valueFor example,\n.sidebarwrapper has z-index of 1100, so set the z-index of .modal to 1101in your navbar navbar-fixed-top need z-index = 1041\nand also if u use bootstarp-combined.min.css the also change  .navbar-fixed-top, .navbar-fixed-bottom z-index to 1041Hi I had the same issue then I realize that when you using bootsrap 3.1 \nUnlike in older versions of bootsrap (2.3.2)\nthe html structure of the modal was changed!you must wrap your modal header body and footer with modal-dialog and modal-content Change the absolute position to relative.You can also remove the z-index from .modal-backdrop. Resulting css would look like this. Use this in your modal: what i find is that:in bootstrap 3.3.0  it\'s not right,but when in bootstrap 3.3.5  it\'s right.let\'s see the code.\n3.3.0: 3.3.5In my case, I had a wrapper with the following:Only removed the z-index:1 and have no idea why fixed the problem. also for sure removing the relative position did but I needed it.I was fixed this by adding style below to DIV tagAnd add custom cssI have a lighter and better solution..It could be easily solve through some additional CSS styles..hide the class .modal-backdrop (auto generated from Bootstrap.js)set the background of .modal to a translucent black backdrop image.This will works best if you have a requirement that needs the modal to be inside an element and not near the </body> tag..try overwrite class .modal-open overflow value from hidden to visible.Try this out https://github.com/nakupanda/bootstrap3-dialog/releases/tag/v1.34.0Bootstrap Modal 3.3.0 generates the modal-backdrop inside the main element, while previously it\'s appended to body element.Hope this helps.This behaviour sometimes occurs when there is an unclosed tag, most especially an unclosed </div>. You can review where your modal is located and ensure all tags are properly closed or better yet move the div modal closer to the bottom of the page, imediately before </body> tag enclosureIn my case, the cause was boostrap.min.css :) once I excluded it form my html file as a reference, the dialog showed in forn of the modal shade :)Like Davide Lorigliola, I fixed it by cranking up the z-index:\n    .modal-backdrop { z-index: -999999; }Unfortunately S.O. forbids me from commenting or up-voting on his, so I\'m forced to say so down here in yet another solution.
