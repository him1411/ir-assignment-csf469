Trying to get the highest and lowest value from a array that I know will contain only integers seems to be harder than I thought?I\'d expect this to show "99, 140000". Instead it shows "104, 99". So it seems the sort is handling the values as strings?Any way to get the sort function to actually sort on integer value?By default the sort method sorts elements alphabetically. To sort numerically just add a new method which handles numeric sorts (sortNumber, shown below) - Just building on all of the above answers, they can also be done in one line like this:array.sort does a lexicographic sort by default, for a numeric sort, provide your own function. Here\'s a simple example:Also note that sort works "in place", there\'s no need for the assignment.This answer is equivalent to some of the existing answers, but ECMAScript 6 arrow functions provide a much more compact syntax that allows us to define an inline sort function without sacrificing readability:Edit: supported in most browsers todayI agree with aks, however instead of using    You should useIn Javascript the sort() method\'s default behaviour is to sort values in an array alphabetically.To sort by number you have to define a numeric sort function (which is very easy):Array.prototype.sort() is the go to method for sorting arrays, but there are a couple of issues we need to be aware of.The sorting order is by default lexicographic and not numeric regardless of the types of values in the array. Even if the array is all numbers, all values will be converted to string and sorted lexicographically.so should we need to customize the sort() and reverse() method like below.\nReferred URL\n\n\nFor Sorting number inside the arrayFor reverse number inside the arrayReferred URLUpdate! Scroll to bottom of answer for smartSort prop additive that gives even more fun!Sorts arrays of anything!My personal favorite form of this function allows for a param for Ascending, or Descending:Usage as simple as:jsFiddleNow have even more fun with a sorting method that sorts an array full of multiple items! Doesn\'t currently cover "associative" (aka, string keys), but it does cover about every type of value! Not only will it sort the multiple values asc or desc accordingly, but it will also maintain constant "position" of "groups" of values. In other words; ints are always first, then come strings, then arrays (yes, i\'m making this multidimensional!), then Objects (unfiltered, element, date), & finally undefineds and nulls! "Why?" you ask. Why not!Now comes in 2 flavors! The first of which requires newer browsers as it uses Object.defineProperty to add the method to the Array.protoype Object. This allows for ease of natural use, such as: myArray.smartSort(\'a\'). If you need to implement for older browsers, or you simply don\'t like modifying native Objects, scroll down to Method Only version.jsFiddle Array.prototype.smartSort(\'asc|desc\')Use is simple! First make some crazy array like:Then simply sort it!Same as the preceding, except as just a simple method!Use:jsFiddle Method smartSort(Array, "asc|desc")The question has already been answered, the shortest way is to use sort() method.
