Is there an easy way to take a string of html in JavaScript and strip out the html? If you\'re running in a browser, then the easiest way is just to let the browser do it for you...Simplest way:That retrieves all the text from a string of html. As an extension to the jQuery method, if your string might not contian HTML (eg if you are trying to remove HTML from a form field) jQuery(html).text(); will return an empty string if there is no htmlUse:jQuery(\'<p>\' + html + \'</p>\').text(); instead.Update:\nAs has been pointed out in the comments, in some circumstances this solution will execute javascript contained within html if the value of html could be influenced by an attacker, use a different solution.The above function posted by hypoxide works fine, but I was after something that would basically convert HTML created in a Web RichText editor (for example FCKEditor) and clear out all HTML but leave all the Links due the fact that I wanted both the HTML and the plain text version to aid creating the correct parts to an STMP email (both HTML and plain text).After a long time of searching Google myself and my collegues came up with this using the regex engine in Javascript:the str variable starts out like this:and then after the code has run it looks like this:-As you can see the all the HTML has been removed and the Link have been persevered with the hyperlinked text is still intact. Also I have replaced the <p> and <br> tags with \\n (newline char) so that some sort of visual formatting has been retained.To change the link format (eg. BBC (Link->http://www.bbc.co.uk) ) just edit the $2 (Link->$1), where $1 is the href URL/URI and the $2 is the hyperlinked text. With the links directly in body of the plain text most SMTP Mail Clients convert these so the user has the ability to click on them.Hope you find this useful.An improvement to an earlier answer.This way something running like this will do no harm:Firefox, Chromium and Explorer 9+ are safe.\nOpera Presto is still vulnerable.\nAlso images mentioned in the strings are not downloaded in Chromium and Firefox saving http requests.I altered Jibberboy2000\'s answer to include several <BR /> tag formats, remove everything inside <SCRIPT> and <STYLE> tags, format the resulting HTML by removing multiple line breaks and spaces and convert some HTML-encoded code into normal. After some testing it appears that you can convert most of full web pages into simple text where page title and content are retained.In the simple example,becomesThis is my titleThis string has html code i want to removeIn this line BBC (http://www.bbc.co.uk) with link is mentioned.Now back to "normal text" and stuff using  The JavaScript function and test page look this:It was used with this HTML:This should do the work on any Javascript environment (NodeJS included).\ntext.replace(/<[^>]+>/g, \'\');Another, admittedly less elegant solution than nickf\'s or Shog9\'s, would be to recursively walk the DOM starting at the <body> tag and append each text node.If you want to keep the links and the structure of the content (h1, h2, etc) then you should check out TextVersionJS You can use it with any HTML, although it was created to convert an HTML email to plain text.The usage is very simple. For example in node.js:Or in the browser with pure js:It also works with require.js:After trying all of the answers mentioned most if not all of them had edge cases and couldn\'t completely support my needs.I started exploring how php does it and came across the php.js lib which replicates the strip_tags method here: http://phpjs.org/functions/strip_tags/I made some modifications to original Jibberboy2000 script\nHope it\'ll be usefull for someoneHere\'s a version which sorta addresses @MikeSamuel\'s security concern: Note, it will return an empty string if the HTML markup isn\'t valid XML (aka, tags must be closed and attributes must be quoted). This isn\'t ideal, but does avoid the issue of having the security exploit potential.If not having valid XML markup is a requirement for you, you could try using:but that isn\'t a perfect solution either for other reasons.A lot of people have answered this already, but I thought it might be useful to share the function I wrote that strips HTML tags from a string but allows you to include an array of tags that you do not want stripped. It\'s pretty short and has been working nicely for me.I think the easiest way is to just use Regular Expressions as someone mentioned above. Although there\'s no reason to use a bunch of them. Try:With jQuery you can simply retrieving it by using Below code allows you to retain some html tags  while stripping all others It is also possible to use the fantastic htmlparser2 pure JS HTML parser. Here is a working demo:The output will be This is a simple example.See it in action here: https://tonicdev.com/jfahrenkrug/extract-text-from-htmlThis works in both node and the browser if you pack you web application using a tool like webpack.I just needed to strip out the <a> tags and replace them with the text of the link.This seems to work great.Accounts for > inside attributes and <img onerror="javascript"> in newly created dom elements.usage:demo:https://jsfiddle.net/gaby_de_wilde/pqayphzd/demo of top answer doing the terrible things:https://jsfiddle.net/gaby_de_wilde/6f0jymL6/1/I have created a working regular expression myself:simple 2 line jquery to strip the html.The accepted answer works fine mostly, however in IE if the html string is null you get the "null" (instead of \'\'). Fixed: input element support only one line text:The text state represents a one line plain text edit control for the element\'s value.Define this as a jquery plugin and use it like as follows:For escape characters also this will work using pattern matching:Using Jquery: In my case $(".someClass").prop("innerText") was sufficient.
