This should be dead simple, but I cannot get it to work for the life of me.\nI\'m just trying to connect remotely to my MySQL server.connecting asworks fine, but trying  fails with the errorIn the mysql.user table, there is exactly the same entry for user \'root\' with host \'localhost\' as another with host \'%\'.I\'m at my wits\' end, and have no idea how to proceed.\nAny ideas are welcome.Possibly a security precaution. You could try adding a new administrator account:Although as Pascal and others have noted it\'s not a great idea to have a user with this kind of access open to any IP. If you need an administrative user, use root, and leave it on localhost. For any other action specify exactly the privileges you need and limit the accessibility of the user as Pascal has suggest below.Edit:From the MySQL FAQ:If you cannot figure out why you get\n  Access denied, remove from the user \n  table all entries that have Host\n  values containing wildcards (entries\n  that contain \'%\' or \'_\' characters). A\n  very common error is to insert a new\n  entry with Host=\'%\' and\n  User=\'some_user\', thinking that this\n  allows you to specify localhost to\n  connect from the same machine. The\n  reason that this does not work is that\n  the default privileges include an\n  entry with Host=\'localhost\' and\n  User=\'\'. Because that entry has a Host\n  value \'localhost\' that is more\n  specific than \'%\', it is used in\n  preference to the new entry when\n  connecting from localhost! The correct\n  procedure is to insert a second entry\n  with Host=\'localhost\' and\n  User=\'some_user\', or to delete the\n  entry with Host=\'localhost\' and\n  User=\'\'. After deleting the entry,\n  remember to issue a FLUSH PRIVILEGES\n  statement to reload the grant tables.\n  See also Section 5.4.4, \xe2\x80\x9cAccess\n  Control, Stage 1: Connection\n  Verification\xe2\x80\x9d.One has to create a new MySQL User and assign privileges as below in Query prompt via phpMyAdmin or command prompt:Once done with all four queries, it should connect with username / passwordMy error message was similar and said \'Host XXX is not allowed to connect to this MySQL server\' even though I was using root.  Here\'s how to make sure that root has the correct permissions.My setup:SolutionCheck for:Now access the MySQL Database on your actual server (say your remote address is 123.123.123.123 at port 3306 as user \'root\' and I want to change permissions on database \'dataentry\'.  Remember to change the IP Address, Port, and database name to your settings)sudo service mysql restartYou need to grant access to the user from any hostname.This is how you add new privilege from phpmyadminGoto Privileges > Add a new UserSelect Any Host for the desired usernameJust perform the following steps:1) Connect to mysql2) Create user3) Grant permissions4) Flush priviledgesThe message *Host \'\'xxx.xx.xxx.xxx\'\' is not allowed to connect to this MySQL server is a reply from the MySQL server to the MySQL client. Notice how its returning the IP address and not the hostname. If you\'re trying to connect with mysql -h<hostname> -u<somebody> -p and it returns this message with the IP address, then the MySQL server isn\'t able to do a reverse lookup on the client. This is critical because thats how it maps the MySQL client to the grants. Make sure you can do an nslookup <mysqlclient> FROM the MySQL server. If that doesn\'t work, then there\'s no entry in the DNS server. Alternatively, you can put an entry in the MySQL server\'s HOSTS file (<ipaddress>  <fullyqualifiedhostname>   <hostname> <- The order here might matter).An entry in my server\'s host file allowing a reverse lookup of the MySQL client solved this very problem. If you modify the grant tables manually (using INSERT, UPDATE, etc.), you should execute \na FLUSH PRIVILEGES statement to tell the server to reload the grant tables. PS: I wouldn\'t recommend to allow any host to connect for any user (especially not the root use). If you are using mysql for a client/server application, prefer a subnet address. If you are using mysql with a web server or application server, use specific IPs.simple way is to login to phpmyadmin with root account , there goto mysql database and select user table , there edit root account and in host field add % wild card . and then through ssh flush privilegesIf you happen to be running on Windows; A simple solution is to run the MySQL server instance configuration wizard.  It is in your MYSQL group in the start menu.  On the second from last screen click the box that says "allow root access from remote machines".Well what you can do is just open mysql.cfg file and you have to change Bind-address to thisbind-address      = 127.0.0.1and then Restart mysql and you will able to connect that server to this.Look this you can have idea form that.this is real solAll of the answers here didn\'t work in my case so I guest this may help other users in the future. This can also be a problem in our code, not just in MySQL alone.If you are using VB.NETInstead of this code:You need to move MysqlConn = New MySqlConnection() on the first line. So it would be like thisI was also facing the same issue. I resolved it in 2 min for me I just white list ip through cpanelSuppose you are trying to connect database of server B from server A.\nGo to Server B Cpanel->Remote MySQL-> enter Server A IP Address and That\'s it.On the off chance that someone facing this issue is experiencing it from within SQLyog, this happened:I had connected to the remote database (from within SQLyog) and worked for some hours. Afterwards I left the system for some minutes, then came back to continue my work - ERROR 1130 ! Nothing I tried worked; Restarting SQLyog didn\'t fix it. Then I restarted the system - it still didn\'t work.So I tried connecting from the terminal - it worked. Then retried it on SQLyog ... and it worked. I can\'t explain it other than \'random computer quirkiness\', but I think it might help someone.if you are trying to execute mysql query withouth defining connectionstring, you will get this error.Probably you forgat to define connection string before execution. have you check this out?\n(sorry for bad english)
