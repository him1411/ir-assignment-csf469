I want to create a function that performs a function passed by parameter on a set of data. How do you pass a function as a parameter in C?DeclarationA prototype for a function which takes a function parameter looks like the following:This states that the parameter f will be a pointer to a function which has a void return type and which takes a single int parameter. The following function (print) is an example of a function which could be passed to func as a parameter because it is the proper type:Function CallWhen calling a function with a function parameter, the value passed must be a pointer to a function. Use the function\'s name (without parentheses) for this:would call func, passing the print function to it.Function BodyAs with any parameter, func can now use the parameter\'s name in the function body to access the value of the parameter. Let\'s say that func will apply the function it is passed to the numbers 0-4. Consider, first, what the loop would look like to call print directly:Since func\'s parameter declaration says that f is the name for a pointer to the desired function, we recall first that if f is a pointer then *f is the thing that f points to (i.e. the function print in this case). As a result, just replace every occurrence of print in the loop above with *f:From http://math.hws.edu/bridgeman/courses/331/f05/handouts/c-c++-notes.htmlThis question already has the answer for defining function pointers, however they can get very messy, especially if you are going to be passing them around your application. To avoid this unpleasantness I would recommend that you typedef the function pointer into something more readable. For example.Declares a function that returns void and takes no arguments. To create a function pointer to this type you can now do:For a function that returns an int and takes a char you would doand to use itThere are libraries that can help with turning function pointers into nice readable types. The boost function library is great and is well worth the effort!is so much nicer than the above.Since C++11 you can use the functional library to do this in a succinct and generic fashion. The syntax is, e.g.,where bool is the return type here of a one-argument function whose first argument is of type int.I have included an example program below:Sometimes, though, it is more convenient to use a template function:Pass address of a function as parameter to another function as shown belowAlso we can pass function as parameter using function pointerYou need to pass a function pointer.  The syntax is a little cumbersome, but it\'s really powerful once you get familiar with it.
