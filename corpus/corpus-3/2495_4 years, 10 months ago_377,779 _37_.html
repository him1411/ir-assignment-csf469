How do I pass a function as a parameter without the function executing in the "parent" function or using eval()? (Since I\'ve read that it\'s insecure.)I have this:It works, but the problem is that refreshContactList fires when the function is called, rather than when it\'s used in the function.I could get around it using eval(), but it\'s not the best practice, according to what I\'ve read. How can I pass a function as a parameter in JavaScript?You just need to remove the parenthesis:This then passes the function without executing it first.Here is an example:If you want to pass a function, just reference it by name without the parentheses:But sometimes you might want to pass a function with arguments included, but not have it called until the callback is invoked. To do this, when calling it, just wrap it in an anonymous function, like this:If you prefer, you could also use the apply function and have a third parameter that is an array of the arguments, like such:Example 1:Example 2:look at thisTo pass the function as parameter, simply remove the brackets!The idea behind this is that a function is quite similar to a variable. Instead of writing you might as well writeThere are minor differences between the two, but anyway - both of them are valid ways to define a function.\nNow, if you define a function and explicitly assign it to a variable, it seems quite logical, that you can pass it as parameter to another function, and you don\'t need brackets: There is a phrase amongst JavaScript programmers: "Eval is Evil" so try to avoid it at all costs!In addition to Steve Fenton\'s answer, you can also pass functions directly.I suggest to put the parameters in an array, and then split them up using the .apply() function. So now we can easily pass a function with lots of parameters and execute it in a simple way.I chopped all my hair off with that issue. I couldn\'t make the examples above working, so I ended like :And that\'s working like a charm ... for what I needed at least. Hope it might help some.You can also use eval() to do the same thing.That\'s it. I was also looking for this solution and tried solutions provided in other answers but finally got it work from above example.Here it\'s another approach :   In fact, seems like a bit complicated, is not. get method as a parameter:   You can give as a parameter method:The other answers do an excellent job describing what\'s going on, but one important "gotcha" is to make sure that whatever you pass through is indeed a reference to a function. For instance, if you pass through a string instead of a function you\'ll get an error:See JsFiddleYou can use a JSON as well to store and send JS functions. Check the following:This will print \'a\'.The following has the same effect with the above:Which is also has the same effect with the following:And a object paradigm using Class as object prototype:
