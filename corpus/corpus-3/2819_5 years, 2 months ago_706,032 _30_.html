I\'m trying to update the column visited to give it the value 1. I use MySQL workbench, and I\'m writing the statement in the SQL editor from inside the workbench. I\'m writing the following command:It gives me the following error:You are using safe update mode and you tried to update a table without\n  a WHERE that uses a KEY column To disable safe mode, toggle the option\n  ....I followed the instructions, and I unchecked the safe update option from the Edit menu then Preferences then SQL Editor. The same error still appear & I\'m not able to update this value. Please, tell me what is wrong?It looks like your MySql session has the safe-updates option set. This means that you can\'t update or delete records without specifying a key (ex. primary key) in the where clause.Try:Or you can modify your query to follow the rule (use primary key in where clause).Follow the following steps before executing the UPDATE command:\nIn MySQL Workbenchp.s., No need to restart the MySQL daemon!All that\'s needed is: Start a new query and run: Then: Run the query that you were trying to run that wasn\'t previously working.OR Go to Edit --> PreferencesClick SQL Queries tab and uncheck Safe Updates check boxQuery --> Reconnect to ServerNow execute your sql query\nNo need to set SQL_SAFE_UPDATES to 0, I would really discourage it to do it that way.\nJust add in the WHERE clause a KEY-value that matches everything like a primary-key comparing to 0, so instead of writing:Now you can be assured every record is updated like you expect.If you are in a safe mode, you need to provide id in where clause. So something like this should work!I found the answer. The problem was that I have to precede the table name with the schema name. i.e, the command should be:Thanks all.In the MySQL Workbech version 6.2 don\'t exits the PreferenceSQLQueriesoptions.Since the question was answered and had nothing to do with safe updates, this might be the wrong place; I\'ll post just to add information.I tried to be a good citizen and modified the query to use a temp table of ids that would get updated:Failure.  Modified the update to:That worked.  Well golly -- if I am always adding where key <> 0 to get around the safe update check, or even set SQL_SAFE_UPDATE=0, then I\'ve lost the \'check\' on my query.  I might as well just turn off the option permanently.  I suppose it makes deleting and updating a two step process instead of one..  but if you type fast enough and stop thinking about the key being special but rather as just a nuisance..True, this is pointless for the most examples. But finally, I came to the following statement and it works fine:The simplest solution is to define the row limit and execute. This is done for safety purposes.
