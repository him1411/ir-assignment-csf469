To move the branch pointer of a checked out branch, one can use the git reset --hard command. But how to move the branch pointer of a not-checked out branch to point at a different commit (keeping all other stuff like tracked remote branch)?N.B. If you simply want to move a branch to another commit, the\n  easiest way isgit branch -f branch-name new-tip-commit as detailed by Chris Johnsen.You can do it for arbitrary refs. This is how to move a branch pointer: The general form:You can pick nits about the reflog message if you like - I believe the branch -f one is different from the reset --hard one, and this isn\'t exactly either of them.You can also pass git reset --hard a commit reference.For example:I find I do something like this semi-frequently:Assuming this historyIn gitk --all:Beware that re-creating instead of modifying the existing branch will lose tracking-branch information.  (This is generally not a problem for simple use-cases where there\'s only one remote and your local branch has the same name as the corresponding branch in the remote.  See comments for more details, thanks @mbdevpl for pointing out this downside.)It would be cool if gitk had a feature where the dialog box had 3 options: overwrite, modify existing, or cancel.Even if you\'re normally a command-line junkie like myself, git gui and gitk are quite nicely designed for the subset of git usage they allow.  I highly recommend using them for what they\'re good at (i.e. selectively staging hunks into/out of the index in git gui, and also just committing.  (ctrl-s to add a signed-off: line, ctrl-enter to commit.)gitk is great for keeping track of a few branches while you sort out your changes into a nice patch series to submit upstream, or anything else where you need to keep track of what you\'re in the middle of with multiple branches.I don\'t even have a graphical file browser open, but I love gitk/git gui.The recommended solution git branch -f branch-pointer-to-move new-pointer in TortoiseGit:Just to enrich the discussion, if you want to move myBranch branch to your current commit, just omit the second argument after -fExample:git branch -f myBranchI generally do this when I rebase while in a Detached HEAD state :)
