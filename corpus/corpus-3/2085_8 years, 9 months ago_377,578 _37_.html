Suppose I have this code:  Now if I wanted to remove "lastname"?....is there some equivalent of\nmyArray["lastname"].remove()?(I need the element gone because the number of elements is important and I want to keep things clean.)Use the "delete" keyword in Javascript.EDIT:In some JavaScript engine, the delete keyword might hurt performance as it will undo compile / JIT optimization.http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/v8/\nhttp://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/11/writing-fast-memory-efficient-javascript/All objects in JavaScript are implemented as hashtables/associative arrays. So, the following are the equivalent:And, as already indicated, you "remove" a property from an object via the delete keyword, which you can use in two ways:Hope the extra info helps...None of the previous answers address the fact that Javascript does not have associative arrays to begin with - there is no array type as such, see typeof.What Javascript has, are object instances with dynamic properties. When properties are confused with elements of an Array object instance then Bad Things\xe2\x84\xa2 are bound to happen:To have a universal removal function that does not blow up on you, use:That only removes deletes the object but still keeps the array length same. To remove you need to do something like:While the accepted answer is correct, it is missing the explanation why it works. First of all, your code should reflect the fact that this is NOT an array:Note that all objects (including Arrays) can be used this way. However, do not expect for standard JS array functions (pop, push,...) to work on objects!As said in accepted answer, you can then use delete to remove the entries from objects:You should decide which route you wish to take - either use objects (associative arrays / dictionaries) or use arrays (maps). Never mix the two of them.You are using Object, you are not having an associative array to begin with.\nWith an associative array, adding and removing items goes like this:Use method splice to completely remove item from an object array:As other answers have noted, what you are using is not a Javascript array, but a Javascript object, which works almost like an associative array in other languages except that all keys are converted to strings. The new Map stores keys as their original type.If you had an array and not an object, you could use the array\'s .filter function, to return a new array without the item you want removed:If you have an older browser and jQuery, jQuery has a $.grep method that works similarly:If for whatever reason the delete key is not working (like it wasnt working for \nme ) You can splice it out and then filter the undefined valuesDont try and chain them since splice returns removed elements;Its very straight forward if you have underscore.js dependency in your project -You can remove an entry from your map by explicitly assigning it to \'undefined\'. As in your case:myArray["lastname"] = undefined;By using the "delete" keyword, it will delete the array element from array in javascript.For example, Consider following statements.Last line of the code will remove the array element who\'s key is "status" from the array.We can use it as a function too. Angular throws some error if used as a prototype. Thanks @HarpyWar. It helped me solve a problem.Without looping/iterates we get the same result
