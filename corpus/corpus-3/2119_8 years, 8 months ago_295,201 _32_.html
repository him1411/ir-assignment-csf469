I am wondering how to differentiate all these different joins ...Simple Example: Lets say you have a Students table, and a Lockers table.Each student can be assigned to a locker, so there is a LockerNumber column in the Student table. More than one student could potentially be in a single locker, but especially at the beginning of the school year, you may have some incoming students without lockers and some lockers that have no students assigned.For the sake of this example, lets say you have 100 students, 70 of which have lockers. You have a total of 50 lockers, 40 of which have at least 1 student and 10 lockers have no student.INNER JOIN is equivalent to "show me all students with lockers".\nAny students without lockers, or any lockers without students are missing.\nReturns 70 rowsLEFT OUTER JOIN would be "show me all students, with their corresponding locker if they have one". \nThis might be a general student list, or could be used to identify students with no locker. Returns 100 rowsRIGHT OUTER JOIN would be "show me all lockers, and the students assigned to them if there are any". \nThis could be used to identify lockers that have no students assigned, or lockers that have too many students. Returns 80 rows (list of 70 students in the 40 lockers, plus the 10 lockers with no student)FULL OUTER JOIN would be silly and probably not much use. \nSomething like "show me all students and all lockers, and match them up where you can" Returns 110 rows (all 100 students, including those without lockers. Plus the 10 lockers with no student)CROSS JOIN is also fairly silly in this scenario. It doesn\'t use the linked lockernumber field in the students table, so you basically end up with a big giant list of every possible student-to-locker pairing, whether or not it actually exists.\nReturns 5000 rows (100 students x 50 lockers). Could be useful (with filtering) as a starting point to match up the new students with the empty lockers.Here is a graphic view of all joins that gives clear visual explanations. and here Visual-Representation-of-SQL-Joins explained in detail by C.L. MoffattThere are three basic types of join:Often you see will the OUTER keyword omitted from the syntax.  Instead it will just be "LEFT JOIN", "RIGHT JOIN", or "FULL JOIN".  This is done because INNER and CROSS joins have no meaning with respect to LEFT, RIGHT, or FULL, and so these are sufficient by themselves to unambiguously indicate an OUTER join.Here is an example of when you might want to use each type:There are only 4 kinds:A "cross join" or "cartesian join" is simply an inner join for which no join conditions have been specified, resulting in all pairs of rows being output.Thanks to RusselH for pointing out FULL joins, which I\'d omitted.Check out Join (SQL) on Wikipedialeft / right (outer) join - Given two tables returns all rows that exist in either the left or right table of your join, plus the rows from the other side will be returned when the join clause is a match or null will be returned for those columnsFull Outer - Given two tables returns all rows, and will return nulls when either the left or right column is not thereCross Joins - Cartesian join and can be dangerous if not used carefullyLEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN are types of OUTER JOINs. INNER JOIN is the default -- rows from both tables must match the join condition.Inner join: Only show rows, when has it data from both of the tables.Outer join: (left/right): Show the all result from the left / right table with the paired row(s), if it exists or not.Making it more visible might help. One example:Table 1:ID_STUDENT      STUDENT_NAME    Table 2:ID_STUDENT        LOCKERWhat I get when I do:
