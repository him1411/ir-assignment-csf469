I have a small app on heroku.  Whenever I want to see the logs I go to the command line and do That only shows me about 100 lines.  Is there not a way to see complete logs for our application on heroku?  Update (thanks to dawmail333):or, to tail the logs live Heroku log documentationIf you need more than a few thousand lines you can Use heroku\'s Syslog DrainsAlternatively (old method):Logging has greatly improved in heroku!Better!references: http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/loggingUPDATEDThese are no longer add-ons, but part of the default functionality :)Heroku treats logs as time-ordered streams of events. Accessing *.log files on the filesystem is not recommended in such an environment for a variety of reasons.First, if your app has more than one dyno then each log file only represents a partial view into the events of your app. You would have to manually aggregate all the files to get the full view.Second, the filesystem on Heroku is ephemeral meaning whenever your dyno is restarted or moved (which happens about once a day)the log files are lost. So you only get at most a day\'s view into that single dyno\'s logs.Finally, on the Cedar stack running heroku console or even heroku run bash does not connect you to a currently running dyno. It spawns a new one specifically for the bash command. This is called a one-off process. As such, you won\'t find the log files for your other dynos that are running the actual http processes on the one spawned for heroku run.Logging, and visibility in general, is a first-class citizen on Heroku and there are several tools  that address these issues. First, to see a real-time stream of application events across all dynos and all layers of the application/stack use the heroku logs -t command to tail output to your terminal.This works great for observing the behavior of your application right now. If you want to store the logs for longer periods of time you can use one of the many logging add-ons that provide log retention, alerting and triggers.Lastly, if you want to store the log files yourself you can setup your own syslog drain to receive the stream of events from Heroku and post-process/analyze yourself.Summary: Don\'t use heroku console or heroku run bash to view static log files. Pipe into Heroku\'s stream of log events for your app using heroku logs or a logging add-on.Also see individual streams/filters. E.g tail only your application logsOr see only the router logsOr chain them together So good..heroku logs -t shows us the live logs.Well the above answers are very helpful it will help you to view from command line. Whereas if you want to do from your GUI so you have to logged into your heroku account and then select your application and finally click on view logsMight be worth it to add something like the free Papertrail plan to your app. Zero configuration, and you get 7 days worth of logging data up to 10MB/day, and can search back through 2 days of logs.Follow on heroku loggingTo view your logs we have:heroku logsheroku logs -n 200heroku logs --tailheroku logs --app your_app_nameYou can access your log files using Heroku\'s Command Line\nInterface (CLI Usage). If Heroku\'s CLI is installed and you know your application name (like https://myapp.herokuapp.com/), then you can run the following command:You can also access the logs in a real-time stream using:If the logs tell you something like this:npm ERR! A complete log of this run can be found in: npm ERR! /app/.npm/_logs/2017-07-11T08_29_45_291Z-debug.logThen you can also access them using the bash terminal via Heroku CLI:To see the detailed log you need to put two lines in the production.rb file:and then by runningyou can see the detailed logs.I prefer to do it this wayYou can leave the script running in background and you can simply filter the logs from the text file the way you want anytime.My solution is to get complete log the first time the application start, like:heroku logs -n 1500 > logthen add fgrep -vf to keep it up to date, like:heroku logs -n 1500 > newlog ; fgrep -vf log newlog >> logfor continuous logging, just iterate it using watch for every x minutes (or seconds).
