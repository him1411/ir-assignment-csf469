When I try to download Java from Oracle I instead end up downloading a page telling me that I need agree to the OTN license terms.In order to download products from Oracle Technology Network you must agree to the OTN license terms.Be sure that...How can I download and install Java?** UPDATED FOR JDK 9**\nit looks like you can download it now directly from java.net without sending a header UPDATED FOR JDK 8u131RPM:TAR GZ: RPM using curl:In all cases above, subst \'i586\' for \'x64\' to download the 32-bit build.curl can be used in place of wget.UPDATE FOR JDK 7u79TAR GZ:  RPM using curl:Once again, make sure you specify the correct URL for the version you are downloading. You can find the URL here: Oracle JDK download siteORIGINAL ANSWER FROM 9th June 2012If you are looking to download the Oracle JDK from the command line using wget, there is a workaround. Run the wget command as follows:Be sure to replace the download link with the correct one for the version you are downloading.(Irani updated to my answer, but here\'s to clarify it all.)JRE (no cookie flags):\n- 32-bit JRE: http://javadl.oracle.com/webapps/download/AutoDL?BundleId=225343_090f390dda5b47b9b721c7dfaa008135\n- 64-bit JRE: http://javadl.oracle.com/webapps/download/AutoDL?BundleId=225345_090f390dda5b47b9b721c7dfaa008135\nSee the downloads in oracle.com and java.com for more.-c / --continueAllows continuing an unfinished download.--header "Cookie: oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie"Since 15th March 2014 this cookie is provided to the user after accepting the License Agreement and is necessary for accessing the Java packages in download.oracle.com. The previous (and first) implementation in 27th March 2012 made use of the cookie gpw_e24=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oracle.com[...]. Both cases remain unannounced to the public.The value doesn\'t have to be "accept-securebackup-cookie".--no-check-certificateOnly required with wget 1.12 and earlier, which do not support Subject Alternative Name (SAN) certificates (mainly Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.x and friends, such as CentOS). 1.13 was released in August 2011.To see the current version, use: wget --version | head -1--no-cookiesThe combination --no-cookies --header "Cookie: name=value" is mentioned as the "official" cookie support, but not strictly required here.-L / --locationRequired for cURL to redirect through all the mirrors.-C / --continue-at -See above. cURL requires the dash (-) in the end.-b / --cookie "oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie"Same as -H / --header "Cookie: ...", but accepts files too.-ORequired for cURL to save files (see author\'s comparison for more differences).Downloading Java from the command line has always been troublesome. What I have been doing reciently is to use FireFox (other browsers might work) to get a download started on my laptop, pause it (within the Downloads windows), use the "Copy Download Link" menu item of the context menu displayed for the downloading file. This URL can then be used on the Linux box to download the same file. I expect the URL has a short time to live. Ugly, but generally successful.I know that Oracle made everything possible to make their Java Runtime and Java SDK as hard as possible.Here are some guides for command line lovers.For Debian like systems (tested on Debian squeeze and Ubuntu 12.x+)Note: if you know a better or easier way add a comment, I will update the guide.Updated for JDK 8u131 RPMUpdated for JDK 8u121 RPMlatest tested,wget --no-cookies --no-check-certificate --header "Cookie: gpw_e24=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oracle.com" "https://edelivery.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/7u25-b15/jdk-7u25-linux-x64.tar.gz"Be aware that certificate check is disabled if you care about absolute security. : )This works for the JDK 6, you just need to replace the download url with the latest version.Oracle has put a prevention cookie on the download link to force you to agree to the terms even though the license agreement to use Java clearly states that merely by using Java you \'agree\' to the license..The method that Oracle wants is you to download it with an agreement. After that, this script cn be modified for your  specific LinuxFor those needing JCE8 as well, you can download that also.OrAll of the above seem to assume you know the URL for the latest Java RPM...Oracle provide persistent links to the latest updates of each Java version as documented at\nhttps://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=397248601136938&id=1414485.1 - though you need to create/log in to an Oracle Support account. *Otherwise you can only access the last "public" update of each Java version, e.g. 1.6_u45 (Mar 2013; Latest update is u65, Oct 2013)*Once you know the persistent link, you should be able to resolve it to the real download;\nThe following works for me, though I don\'t yet know if the "aru" reference changes.I solve this (for Debian based Linux distros) by making packages using java-package a few times (for various architectures), then distributing them internally.The big plus side is that this method always works; no matter how crazy Oracle\'s web pages become.  Oracle can no longer break my build!The downside is that it\'s a bit more work to set up initially.For distribution over the Internet, I suggest using a password protected apt repository or provide raw packages using symmetric encryption:Of course providing (unencrypted) .deb packages on the internet is probably a violation of your license agreement with Oracle, which states:... Oracle grants you a ... license ... to reproduce and use internally the Software complete and unmodified for the sole purpose of running Programs"On the receiving end, if you have a password protected apt repo, all you need to do is apt-get install it. If you have raw packages, download, decrypt and dpkg -i them.  Works like a charm!As already posted here:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/41718895/4370196Since Oracle inserted some md5hash in their download links, one cannot automatically assemble a download link for command line.So I tinkered some nasty bash command line to get the latest jdk download link, download it and directly install via rpm.\nFor all who are interested:wget -q http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html -O ./index.html && grep -Eoi \']+>\' index.html | grep -Eoi \'/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-[0-9]+.html\' | (head -n 1) | awk \'{print "http://www.oracle.com"$1}\' | xargs wget --no-cookies --header "Cookie: gpw_e24=xxx; oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie;" -O index.html -q && grep -Eoi \'"filepath":"[^"]+jdk-8u[0-9]+-linux-x64.rpm"\' index.html | grep -Eoi \'http:[^"]+\' | xargs wget --no-cookies --header "Cookie: gpw_e24=xxx; oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie;" -q -O ./jdk8.rpm && sudo rpm -i ./jdk8.rpmThe bold part should be replaced by the package of your liking.The accepted answer was not working for me, as of 2017-04-25.  However, the simple solution was using the -b flag instead of the --header option.For example, to get jdk-1.8_131:That will execute in the background, writing output to wget-log.Try if you are like me trying to get Oracle JDK 6. source: Oracle JVM download using curl/wgetI\'ve made a jdk-download script (specific for the tar.gz) for my gentoo boxes. Doesn\'t need to be updated like other similar scripts, trying to "brute-force" download the latest build for whatever version you want.USAGEBlog postSource on bitbucketWhy not click to download from your browser then copy & paste the exact link where it was downloaded, for example: You can find out the link by looking at the network tab of your browser after accepting terms in oracle and clicking to download. F12 in Chrome. Firebug in Firefox.
