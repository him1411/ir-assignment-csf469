I have these divs that I\'m styling with .tocolor, but I also need the unique identifier 1,2,3,4 etc. so I\'m adding that it as another class tocolor-1. Is there a way to have just 1 class tocolor-*. I tried using a wildcard * as in this css, but it didn\'t work.What you need is called attribute selector. An example, using your html structure, is the following: In the place of div you can add any element or remove it altogether, and in the place of class you can add any attribute of the specified element.[class^="tocolor-"] \xe2\x80\x94 starts with "tocolor-".\n[class*=" tocolor-"] \xe2\x80\x94 contains the substring "tocolor-" occurring directly after a space character.Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/K3693/1/More information on CSS attribute selectors, you can find here and here.Yes you can this.This will select all ids that start with \'term-\'.As for the reason for not doing this, I see where it would be preferable to select this way; as for style, I wouldn\'t do it myself, but it\'s possible.An alternative solution:div[class|=\'tocolor\'] will match for values of the "class" attribute that begin with "tocolor-", including "tocolor-1", "tocolor-2", etc.Beware that this won\'t match `Reference:\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#attribute-representation[att|=val]Represents an element with the att attribute, its value either being exactly "val" or beginning with "val" immediately followed by "-" (U+002D)If you don\'t need the unique identifier for further styling of the divs and are using HTML5 you could try and go with custom Data Attributes.
