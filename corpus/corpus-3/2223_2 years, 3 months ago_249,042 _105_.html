With react-router I can use the Link element to create links that are natively handled by react router. I see internally it calls this.context.transitionTo(...).I want to do a navigation, but not from a link, from a dropdown selection for example. How can I do this in code? What is this.context? I saw the Navigation mixin, but can I do this without mixins?React Router v4With v4 of React Router, there are three approaches that you can take to programmatic routing within components.React Router is mostly a wrapper around the history library. history handles interaction with the browser\'s window.history for you with its browser and hash histories. It also provides a memory history which is useful for environments that don\'t have a global history. This is particularly useful in mobile app development (react-native) and unit testing with Node.A history instance has two methods for navigating: push and replace. If you think of the history as an array of visited locations, push will add a new location to the array and replace will replace the current location in the array with the new one. Typically you will want to use the push method when you are navigating.In earlier versions of React Router, you had to create your own history instance, but in v4 the <BrowserRouter>, <HashRouter>, and <MemoryRouter> components will created browser, hash, and memory instances for you. React Router makes the properties and methods of the history instance associated with your router available through the context, under the router object.The withRouter higher-order component will inject the history object as a prop of the component. This allows you to access the push and replace methods without having to deal with the context.The <Route> component isn\'t just for matching locations. You can render a pathless route and it will always match the current location. The <Route> component passes the same props as withRouter, so you will be able to access the history methods through the history prop.*But you probably should notThe last option is one that you should only use if you feel comfortable working with React\'s context model. Although context is an option, it should be stressed that context is an unstable API and React has a section Why Not To Use Context in their documentation. So use at your own risk!1 and 2 are the simplest choices to implement, so for most use cases they are your best bets.React-Router 3.0.0+ AnswerIn 3.0 and above, use the router as a prop of your component.React-Router 2.4.0+ AnswerIn 2.4 and above, use a higher order component to get the router as a prop of your component.React-Router 2.0.0+ AnswerThis version is backwards compatible with 1.x so there\'s no need to an Upgrade Guide. Just going through the examples should be good enough.That said, if you wish to switch to the new pattern, there\'s a browserHistory module inside the router that you can access withimport { browserHistory } from \'react-router\'Now you have access to your browser history, so you can do things like push, replace, etc... Like:browserHistory.push(\'/some/path\')Further reading:\nHistories and\nNavigationReact-Router 1.x.x AnswerI will not go into upgrading details. You can read about that in the Upgrade GuideThe main change about the question here is the change from Navigation mixin to History. Now it\'s using the browser historyAPI to change route so we will use pushState() from now on.Here\'s an exemple using Mixin:Note that this History comes from rackt/history project. Not from React-Router itself.If you dont want to use Mixin for some reasonn (maybe because of ES6 class), then you can access the history that you get from the router from this.props.history. It will be only accessible for the components rendered by your Router. So, if you want to use it in any child components it needs to be passed down as an attribute via props.You can read more about the new release at their 1.0.x documentationHere is a help page specifically about navigating outside your componentIt recommends grabbing a reference history = createHistory() and calling replaceState on that.React-Router 0.13.x AnswerI got into the same problem and could only find the solution with the Navigation mixin that comes with react-router.Here\'s how I did itI was able to call transitionTo() without the need to access .contextOr you could try the fancy ES6 classNote that if you\'re using Redux there is another project called\n  React-Router-Redux that gives you\n  redux bindings for ReactRouter. Somewhat the same approach that\n  React-Redux doesReact-Router v2For the most recent release (v2.0.0-rc5), the recommended navigation method is by directly pushing onto the history singleton. You can see that in action in the Navigating outside of Components doc. Relevant excerpt:If using the newer react-router API, you need to make use of the history from this.props when inside of components so:It also offers pushState but that is deprecated per logged warnings.If using react-router-redux, it offers a push function you can dispatch like so:However this may be only used to change the URL, not to actually navigate to the page.Here\'s how you do this with react-router v2.0.0 with ES6. react-router has moved away from mixins.For this one, who does not control the server side and because of this is using hash router v2:Place your history into separate file (e.g. app_history.js ES6):And use it everywhere!Your entry point for react-router (app.js ES6):Your navigation inside any component (ES6):Warning: this answer covers only ReactRouter versions before 1.0I will update this answer with 1.0.0-rc1 use cases after!You can do this without mixins too.The gotcha with contexts is that it is not accessible unless you define the contextTypes on the class.As for what is context, it is an object, like props, that are passed down from parent to child, but it is passed down implicitly, without having to redeclare props each time. See https://www.tildedave.com/2014/11/15/introduction-to-contexts-in-react-js.htmlI tried at least 10 ways of doing this before something worked right!@Felipe Skinner\'s withRouter answer was a bit overwhelming to me, and I wasn\'t sure I wanted to make new "ExportedWithRouter" class names.Here\'s the simplest and cleanest way to do it, circa current React-Router 3.0.0 and ES6:React-Router 3.x.x with ES6:or, if it\'s not your default class, export like:Note that in 3.x.x, the <Link> component itself is using router.push, so you can pass it anything you would pass the <Link to= tag, like:For ES6 + React components, the following solution worked for me.I followed Felippe skinner, but added an end to end solution to help beginners like me.Below are the versions I used:"react-router": "^2.7.0""react": "^15.3.1"Below is my react component where I used programmatic navigation using react-router:Below is the configuration for my router:May not be the best approach but... Using react-router v4, the following Typescript could give an idea for some. In the rendered component below, e.g. LoginPage, router object is accessible and just call router.transitionTo(\'/homepage\') to navigate.Navigation code was taken from https://react-router.now.sh/Match.  "react-router": "^4.0.0-2",\n"react": "^15.3.1",React-Router 4.x Answer :On my end, I like to have a single history object that I can carry even outside components. What I like to do is to have a single history.js file that I import on demand, and just manipulate it.You just have to change BrowserRouter to Router, and specify the history prop. This doesn\'t change anything for you except that you have your own history object that you can manipulate as you want.You need to install history, the library used by react-router.Example usage, ES6 notation :history.jsBasicComponent.jsTo do the navigation programmatically, you need to push a new history to the props.history in your component, so something like this can work for you:with React-Router v4 on the horizon, there is now a new way of doing this.react-lego is an example app that shows how to use/update react-router and it includes example functional tests which navigate the app.based on the previous answer\nfrom Jos\xc3\xa9 Antonio Postigo and Ben Wheeler\nthe novelty? is to be written in Typescript\nand the use of decorators\nOR static property/field  with whatever npm installed today.\n"react-router": "^3.0.0" and\n"@types/react-router": "^2.0.41"With the current React version (15.3), this.props.history.push(\'/location\'); worked for me, but it showed the following warning:browser.js:49 Warning: [react-router] props.history and\n  context.history are deprecated. Please use context.router.and I solved it using context.router like this:React-Router V4if you\'re using version 4 then you can use my library (Shameless plug) where you simply dispatch an action and everything just works!https://www.npmjs.com/package/tripplerIn React-Router v4 and ES6You can use withRouter.If you are using hash or browser history then you can doSimply just use this.props.history.push(\'/where/to/go\');You can route to other component by this method.and add an onClick functionhope it is useful for you.It depends on where to you want to redirect. If it\'s inside a component, then @Paul S answer is the best way to do it.But if you want to redirect from anywhere else inside the app, I recommend to use react-router-reduxYou can use Notes:
