Is there any easy way to calculate the number of lines changed between two commits in git? I know I can do a git diff, and count the lines, but this seems tedious. I\'d also like to know how I can do this, including only my own commits in the linecounts.You want the --stat option of git diff, or if you\'re looking to parse this in a script, the --numstat option.--stat produces the human-readable output you\'re used to seeing after merges; --numstat produces a nice table layout that scripts can easily interpret.I somehow missed that you were looking to do this on multiple commits at the same time - that\'s a task for git log. Ron DeVera touches on this, but you can actually do a lot more than what he mentions. Since git log internally calls the diff machinery in order to print requested information, you can give it any of the diff stat options - not just --shortstat. What you likely want to use is:but you can use --numstat or --shortstat as well. git log can also select commits in a variety other ways - have a look at the documentation. You might be interested in things like --since (rather than specifying commit ranges, just select commits since last week) and --no-merges (merge commits don\'t actually introduce changes), as well as the pretty output options (--pretty=oneline, short, medium, full...).Here\'s a one-liner to get total changes instead of per-commit changes from git log (change the commit selection options as desired - this is commits by you, from commit1 to commit2):(you have to let git log print some identifying information about the commit; I arbitrarily chose the hash, then used awk to only pick out the lines with three fields, which are the ones with the stat information)for the lazy, git log --stat ;)EDIT: You have to specify the commits as well (without parameters it compares the working directory against the index).  E.g.to compare the parent of HEAD with HEAD.git diff --shortstatgives you just the number of lines changed and added.Assuming that you want to compare all of your commits between abcd123 (the first commit) and wxyz789 (the last commit), inclusive:This gives succinct output like:Another way to get all change log in a specified period of timeOutput:With a long output content, you can export to file for more readable
