I am new to Apache and I wanted to ask, where is my httpd.conf file located? I am running a server from the amazon ec2 (elastic compute cloud) and I can\'t find my apache config. Can someone please tell me where it is located? Thanks!Get the path of running ApacheAppend -V argument to the path Reference:\nhttp://commanigy.com/blog/2011/6/8/finding-apache-configuration-file-httpd-conf-locationSee http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/DistrosDefaultLayout for discussion of where you might find Apache httpd configuration files on various platforms, since this can vary from release to release and platform to platform. The most common answer, however, is either /etc/apache/conf or /etc/httpd/confGenerically, you can determine the answer by running the command:httpd -V(That\'s a capital V). Or, on systems where httpd is renamed, perhaps apache2ctl -VThis will return various details about how httpd is built and configured, including the default location of the main configuration file.One of the lines of output should look like:-D SERVER_CONFIG_FILE="conf/httpd.conf"which, combined with the line:-D HTTPD_ROOT="/etc/httpd"will give you a full path to the default location of the configuration file
