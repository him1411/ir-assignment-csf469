How can I write a stored procedure that imports data from a CSV file and populates the table?Take a look at this short article.Solution paraphrased here:Create your table:Copy data from your CSV file to the table:If you don\'t have permission to use COPY (which work on the db server), you can use \\copy instead (which works in the db client). Using the same example as Bozhidar Batsov:Create your table:Copy data from your CSV file to the table:You can also specify the columns to read:One quick way of doing this is with the Python pandas library (version 0.15 or above works best).  This will handle creating the columns for you - although obviously the choices it makes for data types might not be what you want.  If it doesn\'t quite do what you want you can always use the \'create table\' code generated as a template.Here\'s a simple example:And here\'s some code that shows you how to set various options:You could also use pgAdmin, which offers a GUI to do the import. That\'s shown in this SO thread. The advantage of using pgAdmin is that it also works for remote databases.Much like the previous solutions though, you would need to have your table on the database already. Each person has his own solution but what I usually do is open the CSV in Excel, copy the headers, paste special with transposition on a different worksheet, place the corresponding data type on the next column then just copy and paste that to a text editor together with the appropriate SQL table creation query like so:As Paul mentioned, import works in pgAdmin:right click on table -> importselect local file, format and codinghere is a german pgAdmin GUI screenshot:similar thing you can do with DbVisualizer (I have a license, not sure about free version)right click on a table -> Import Table Data...Most other solutions here require that you create the table in advance/manually. This may not be practical in some cases (e.g., if you have a lot of columns in the destination table). So, the approach below may come handy. Providing the path and column count of your csv file, you can use the following function to load your table to a temp table that will be named as target_table:The top row is assumed to have the column names.  Use this SQL codethe header keyword lets the DBMS know that the csv file have a header with attributesfor more visit http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/import-csv-file-into-posgresql-table/IMHO, the most convenient way is to follow "Import CSV data into postgresql, the comfortable way ;-)", using csvsql from csvkit, which is a python package installable via pip.Create table skeleton first if the file is stored locally:When the \\path\\xxx.csv is on the server, postgreSQL doesn\'t have the permission to access the server, you will have to import the .csv file through the pgAdmin built in functionality.Right click the table name choose import.If you still have problem, please refer this tutorial. \nhttp://www.postgresqltutorial.com/import-csv-file-into-posgresql-table/Create table and have required columns that are used for creating table in csv file.  Open postgres and right click on target table which you want to load & select import and Update the following steps in file options sectionNow browse your file in filename Select csv in formatEncoding as ISO_8859_5Now goto Misc. options and check header and click on import.
