I\'m looking for the coolest thing you can do in a few lines of simple code.  I\'m sure you can write a Mandelbrot set in Haskell in 15 lines but it\'s difficult to follow. My goal is to inspire students that programming is cool. We know that programming is cool because you can create anything you imagine - it\'s the ultimate creative outlet.  I want to inspire these beginners and get them over as many early-learning humps as I can.Now, my reasons are selfish.  I\'m teaching an Intro to Computing course to a group of 60 half-engineering, half business majors; all freshmen.  They are the students who came from underprivileged High schools.  From my past experience, the group is generally split as follows: a few rock-stars, some who try very hard and kind of get it, the few who try very hard and barely get it, and the few who don\'t care.  I want to reach as many of these groups as effectively as I can. Here\'s an example of how I\'d use a computer program to teach:Here\'s an example of what I\'m looking\n  for:  a 1-line VBS script to get your\n  computer to talk to you:I could use this to demonstrate order\n  of operations.  I\'d show the code, let\n  them play with it, then explain that\n  There\'s a lot going on in that line,\n  but the computer can make sense of it,\n  because it knows the rules.  Then I\'d\n  show them something like this:And you can see that first I need to\n  do is (5*5).  Then I can multiply for\n  4.  And now I\'ve created the Object.  Dividing by 10 is the same as calling\n  Speak - I can\'t Speak before I have an\n  object, and I can\'t divide before I\n  have 100.  Then on the other side I\n  first create an InputBox with some\n  instructions for how to display it. \n  When I hit enter on the input box it\n  evaluates or "returns" whatever I\n  entered.  (Hint: \'oooooo\' makes a\n  funny sound)  So when I say Speak, the\n  right side is what to Speak.  And I\n  get that from the InputBox.So when you do several things on a\n  line, like:You need to be aware of the order of\n  things.  First we add 14 and y.  Then\n  we put the result (what it evaluates\n  to, or returns) into x.That\'s my goal, to have a bunch of these cool examples to demonstrate and teach the class while they have fun.  I tried this example on my roommate and while I may not use this as the first lesson, she liked it and learned something.Some cool mathematica programs that make beautiful graphs or shapes that are easy to understand would be good ideas and I\'m going to look into those.  Here are some complicated actionscript examples but that\'s a bit too advanced and I can\'t teach flash.  What other ideas do you have?I got a great response from my kids with a quick VB script to manipulate a Microsoft Agent character. For those that aren\'t familiar with MS Agent, it\'s a series of animated onscreen characters that can be manipulated via a COM interface. You can download the code and characters at the Microsoft Agent download page.The folllowing few lines will make the Merlin character appear on screen, fly around, knock on the screen to get your attention, and say hello.There are a great many other commands you can use. Check http://www.microsoft.com/technet/scriptcenter/funzone/agent.mspx for more information.EDIT 2011-09-02\nI recently discovered that Microsoft Agent is not natively installed on Windows 7. However it is offered as a separate download here. I have not tested this so cannot verify whether it operates.Enter this code in your address bar (in your browser) and press enter. Then you can edit all the content of the webpage!That is the coolest "one-liner" I know =)When I first wrote this.It blew people away! The computer remembered their name!EDIT: Just to add to this. If you can convince a new programmer this is the coolest thing they can do, they will become the good programmers. These days, you can do almost anything you want with one line of code to run a library somebody else wrote. I personally get absolutely no satisfaction from doing that and see little benefit in teaching it.OK, it\'s 15 lines of code but the result is awesome! That\'s the kind of stuff that made me freak out when I was a child. This is from the PHP manual:Microsoft has Small Basic, an IDE for "kids".It is specifically designed to show how cool programming is.I tend to think that people are impressed with stuff that they can relate to or is relevant to their lives. I\'d try and base my 10 lines of code around something that they know and understand. Take, for example, Twitter and its API. Why not use this API to build something that\'s cool. The following 10 lines of code will return the "public timeline" from Twitter and display it in a console application...My code sample might not be the best for your students. It\'s written in C# and uses .NET 3.5. So if you\'re going to teach them PHP, Java, or C++ this won\'t be useful. However, my point is that by associating your 10 lines of code with something "cool, interesting, and relevant to the students your sample also becomes cool, interesting, and relevant.Good luck![Yes, I know that I\'ve missed out a few lines of using statements and the Main method, but I\'m guessing that the 10 lines didn\'t need to be literally 10 lines]This is a Python telnet server that will ask for the users name and say hello to them.  This looks cool because you are communicating with your program from a different computer over the network.I think it\'s tough to be a computer educator these days. I am. We face an increasingly steep uphill battle. Our students are incredibly sophisticated users and it takes a lot to impress them. They have so many tools accessible to them that do amazing things.A simple calculator in 10 lines of code? Why? I\'ve got a TI-86 for that.A script that applies special effects to an image? That\'s what Photoshop is for. And Photoshop blows away anything you can do in 10 lines.How about ripping a CD and converting the file to MP3? Uhh, I already have 50,000 songs I got from BitTorrent. They\'re already in MP3 format. I play them on my iPhone. Who buys CDs anyway?To introduce savvy users to programming, you\'re going to have to find something that\'s:a) applicable to something they find interesting and cool, and\nb) does something they can\'t already do.Assume your students already have access to the most expensive software. Many of them do have the full version of Adobe CS5.5 (retail price: $2,600; actual price: free) and can easily get any application that would normally break your department\'s budget.But the vast majority of them have no idea how any of this "computer stuff" actually works.They are an incredibly creative bunch: they like to create things. They just want to be able to do or make something that their friends can\'t. They want something to brag about.Here are some things that I\'ve found to resonate with my students:None of these involve any programming in the traditional sense. But they do leverage powerful libraries. I think of them as a different kind of programming.I\'ve found a big favorite (in GWBASIC) is:I\'ve found beginning students have a few conceptions that need to be fixed.Good luck with your class. I\'m sure you\'ll do well.P.S. I\'m sure you understand that, along with material and skill, you\'re also teaching an attitude, and that is just as important.This C-code is maybe be obfuscated, but I found it very powerfulAnd here is the result... In only 3 lines...\nA kind of fractal Hello World...How about showing that you can take any web browser and enter JavaScript into the address bar and get code to execute?EDIT: Go to a page with lots of images and try this in the address bar:You could make an application that picks a random number. And you have to guess it. If you are wrong it says: higher or lower. And if you guessed it, a nice message. It\'s cool to play for the students.Simple Python version without proper error checking:Erik suggests that the computer should guess the number. This can be done within 10 lines of code as well (though now the lack of proper error checking is even more serious: valid numbers outside the range cause an infinite loop):Back in computer class in high school, myself and a couple of friends taught the class how to program with Delphi.  The class was mostly focused on programming with Pascal, so Delphi was a good next step.  We demonstrated the event driven nature of Delphi and its RAD capabilities.  At the end of the lesson we showed the class a sample application and asked them to reproduce it.  The application asked "Are you drunk?" with two buttons Yes and No.  ...I think you know what is coming next...the No button changed locations on mouse over and was almost impossible to click.The students and teacher got a good kick out of it.The program only required a few lines of user-written code with a simple equation to calculate where to move the button.  I don\'t think any of the other students figured it out, but a few were close.When I first figured out the bash forkbomb, I thought it was really sweet.  So simple, yet neat in what it can do:This is cheating, and not even remotely simple, but I once wrote a shoot\'em up in 20 lines of C++, using the Allegro graphics library. No real criteria for what a line was, but it was a bit ago, and it was made purely for fun. It even had crude sound effects.Here\'s what it looked like:20 Lines http://img227.imageshack.us/img227/8770/20linesxx0.pngAnd here\'s the code (should compile):In this day and age, JavaScript is an excellent way to show how you can program using some really basic tools e.g. notepad.jQuery effects are great starting point for anyone wanting to wow their friends!In this one, just click the white space of the page.One thing you might consider is something like Robocode, in which a lot of coding is abstracted away and you basically just tell a robot what to do. A simple 10-line function can make the robot do a great deal, and has a very visual and easy-to-follow result.Perhaps Robocode itself isn\'t suited to the task, but this kind of thing is a good way to relate written code to visual actions on the computer, plus it\'s fun to watch for when you need to give examples.So one day, I decided that I\'d had enough. I would learn piano. Seeing people like Elton John command such mastery of the keyboard assured me that this was what I wanted to do.Actually learning piano was a huge letdown. Even after completing eight grades of piano lessons, I was still not impressed with how my mental image of playing piano was so different from my original vision of enjoying the activity.However, what I thoroughly enjoyed was my mere three grades of rudiments of music theory. I learned about the construction of music. I was finally able to step from the world of performing written music to writing my own music. Subsequently, I was able to start playing what I wanted to play.Don\'t try to dazzle new programmers, especially young programmers. The whole notion of "less than ten lines of simple code" seems to elicit a mood of "Show me something clever".You can show a new programmer something clever. You can then teach that same programmer how to replicate this "performance". But this is not what gets them hooked on programming. Teach them the rudiments, and let them synthesize their own clever ten lines of code.I would show a new programmer the following Python code:I realize that I don\'t need to assign line to edited_line. However, that\'s just to keep things clear, and to show that I\'m not editing the original document.In less than ten lines, I\'ve verbosified a document. Of course, also be sure to show the new programmer all the string methods that are available. More importantly, I\'ve showed three fundamentally interesting things I can do: variable assignment, a loop, file IO, and use of the standard library.I think you\'ll agree that this code doesn\'t dazzle. In fact, it\'s a little boring. No - actually, it\'s very boring. But show that code to a new programmer and see if that programmer can\'t repurpose every part of that script to something much more interesting within the week, if not the day. Sure, it\'ll be distasteful to you (maybe using this script to make a simple HTML parser), but everything else just takes time and experience.Like most of the other commenters, I started out writing code to solve math problems (or to create graphics for really terrible games that I would design -- things like Indiana Jones versus Zombies).What really started me (on both math and programming) was going from text based, choose your own adventure style games...to more graphics-based games.  I started out coloring graph paper and plotting pixels, until I got into geometry...and discovered how to use equations to plot curves and lines, boxes, etc.My point is, I could have really gotten into something like processing ( http://processing.org/ ) where a typical program looks something like this:To me, this is the "Logo" of the future.There are easy "hello world" examples that can quickly get someone drawing and changing code and seeing how things break and what weird "accidents" can be created...all the way to more advanced interaction and fractal creation...You could use a script written with AutoIt, which blurs the line between using a traditional application and programming.E.g. a script which opens notepad and makes their own computer insult them in it and via a message box, and then leaves no trace of its actions:I remember when I first started coding loops always impressed me. You write 5 - 10 lines of code (or less) and hundreds (or however many you specify) lines print out. (I learned first in PHP and Java).I think a good place for a student to get started could be Greasemonkey.  There are thousands of example scripts on userscripts.org, very good reading material, some of which are very small.  Greasemonkey scripts affect web-pages, which the students will already be familiar with using, if not manipulating.  Greasemonkey itself offers a very easy way to edit and enable/disable scripts while testing.As an example, here is the "Google Two Columns" script:This is a very rudimentary text-based c# program that simulates the spinning action of a slot machine. It doesn\'t include different odds of winning or cash payouts, but that could be a nice exercise for the students.Sorry that it is more than 10 lines.With Tcl you have a simple text editor with a save button in about 12 lines of code (but no open, that would take another 8 lines). It works across all standard platforms:I realize the goal was 10 lines, so if you want the to stick to 10 lines or less, a simple text editor without load or save is only two lines. That\'s not too shabby.Execute either of the above blocks of code with "wish filename" on the platform of your choice. Wish comes with most *nix\'s and the mac but you\'ll have to install it manually for windows. To go a step further, that two line script can also be written in python, though it takes eight lines, still under the 10 line goal:How about a bookmarklet? It would show them how to manipulate something that they use every day (the Internet) without requiring any development tools.If you can afford the hardware, using an Arduino board + processing will produce some pretty cool things, though it may be a little advanced for people that may not be interested at all in programming.I wrote about this recently in an article "The Shortest, most useful program I have ever written." Summary: I wrote a 3 line VB6 app back in 1996 that I still use every single day. Once the exe is dropped in the "Send-to" folder. It lets you right click on a file in explorer and send the full path of that file to the clipboard.It\'s interesting that you mention the Mandelbrot set, as creating fractals with GW-BASIC is what sparked my love of programming back in high school (around 1993). Before we started learning about fractals, we wrote boring standard deviation applications and I still planned to go into journalism.But once I saw that long, difficult-to-write BASIC program generate "fractal terrain," I was hooked and I never looked back. It changed the way I thought about math, science, computers, and the way I learn.I hope you find the program that has the same affect on your students.simple.py frame http://zetcode.com/wxpython/images/simple.jpgI\'m sure it\'d turn into more than 10 lines of code, but have you considered a form based app where pressing the buttons does things like changing the colour of the background or changes the size of the text? This would show them how interactive programs work. It would also show them that they, as programmer, are in complete control of what the computer (program) does.Hopefully it would lead them to make suggestions for other things they could change and then onto other things they might want to do.
