There is enough information about HTML5 on the web (and also on stackoverflow), but now I\'m curious about the "best practices". Tags like section/headers/article are new, and everyone has different opinions about when/where you should use these tags. So what do you guys think of the following layout and code?line 7. section around the whole website? Or only a div?line 8. Each section start with a header?line 23. Is this div right? or must this be a section?line 24. Split left/right column with a div.line 25. Right place for the article tag?line 26. Is it required to put your h1-tag in the header-tag?line 43. The content is not related to the main article, so I decided this is a section and not a aside.line 44. H2 without headerline 53. section without headerline 63. Div with all (non-related) news itemsline 64. header with h2line 65. Hmm, div or section? Or remove this div and only use the article-tagline 105. Footer :-)Actually, you are quite right when it comes to header/footer.  Here is some basic information on how each of the major HTML5 tags can/should be used (I suggest reading the full source linked at the bottom): section \xe2\x80\x93 Used for grouping together thematically-related content. Sounds like a div element, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not. The div has no semantic meaning. Before replacing all your div\xe2\x80\x99s with section elements, always ask yourself: \xe2\x80\x9cIs all of the content related?\xe2\x80\x9daside \xe2\x80\x93 Used for tangentially related content. Just because some content appears to the left or right of the main content isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough reason to use the aside element. Ask yourself if the content within the aside can be removed without reducing the meaning of the main content. Pullquotes are an example of tangentially related content.header \xe2\x80\x93 There is a crucial difference between the header element and the general accepted usage of header (or masthead). There\xe2\x80\x99s usually only one header or \xe2\x80\x98masthead\xe2\x80\x99 in a page. In HTML5 you can have as many as you want. The spec defines it as \xe2\x80\x9ca group of introductory or navigational aids\xe2\x80\x9d. You can use a header in any section on your site. In fact, you probably should use a header within most of your sections. The spec describes the section element as \xe2\x80\x9ca thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.\xe2\x80\x9dnav \xe2\x80\x93 Intended for major navigation information. A group of links grouped together isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough reason to use the nav element. Site-wide navigation, on the other hand belongs in a nav element.footer \xe2\x80\x93 Sounds like its a description of the position, but its not. Footer elements contain informations about its containing element: who wrote it, copyright, links to related content, etc. Whereas we usually have one footer for an entire document, HTML5 allows us to also have footer within sections.Source: http://www.anthonycalzadilla.com/2010/08/html5-section-aside-header-nav-footer-elements-not-as-obvious-as-they-sound/Additionally, here\'s a description on article, not found in the source above:article \xe2\x80\x93 Used for element that specifies independent, self-contained content. An article should make sense on its own. Before replacing all your div\xe2\x80\x99s with section elements, always ask yourself: \xe2\x80\x9cIs  it possible to read it independently from the rest of the web site?\xe2\x80\x9dUnfortunately the answers given so far (including the most voted) are either "just" common sense, plain wrong or confusing at best. None of crucial keywords1 pop up!I wrote 3 answers:To understand the role of the html elements discussed here you have to know that some of them section the document. Each and every html document can be sectioned according to the HTML5 outline algorithm for the purpose of creating an outline\xe2\x80\x94⁠or⁠\xe2\x80\x94table of contents (TOC). The outline is not generally visible (these days), but authors should use html in such a way that the resulting outline reflects their intentions.You can create sections with exactly these elements and nothing else:Sections can be named:There is one more thing to sections: the following contexts (i.e. elements) create "outline boundaries". Whatever sections they contain is private to them:\nexample HTML\n<body>\n   <h1>page title</h1>\n   <nav>\n     <h1>navigation</h1>\n   </nav>\n   <aside>\n     <h1>tangentially related\n         to the topic at hand</h1>\n   </aside>\n   <article></article>\n   <article>\n     <h1>this one has a name again</h1>\n   </article>\n   <h2>untyped section, sibling \n       of the last article</h2>\n</body>\n\nhas this outline\n1. page title\n  1.1. navigation\n  1.2. tangentially related\n       to the topic at hand\n  1.3. (unnamed article)\n  1.4. this one has a name again\n  1.5. untyped section, sibling\n       of the last article\n\n\n\nexample HTML\n<body>\n   <h3>if you want siblings\n       at top level...</h3>\n   <h3>...you have to use untyped\n       sections with <h*>...</h3>\n   <article>\n     <h1>...as any other section\n         will descent</h1>\n   </article>\n   <nav>\n     <ul>\n       <li><a href=...>...</a></li>\n     </ul>\n   </nav>\n</body>\n\nhas this outline\n1. if you want siblings\n    at top level...\n 2. ...you have to use untyped\n    sections with <h*>...\n   2.1. ...as any other section\n        will descent\n   2.2. (unnamed navigation)\n\n\nThis raises two questions:What is the difference between <article> and <section>?How do <header>, <footer> and <main> fit in?1 to mind comes: outline, algorithm, implicit sectioning\n2 I use <h*> as shorthand for <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5> and <h6> \n3 neither is <main> allowed in <aside> or <nav>, but that is of no surprise. \xe2\x80\x93 In effect: <main> can only hide in (nested) descending <section> sections or appear at top level, namely <body>\nThe markup for that document could look like the following:You may find more information in this article on A List Apart. I\'d suggest reading the W3 wiki page about structuring HTML5: <header> Used to contain the header content of a site.    <footer>\n  Contains the footer content of a site.    <nav> Contains the\n  navigation menu, or other navigation functionality for the page.<article> Contains a standalone piece of content that would make\n  sense if syndicated as an RSS item, for example a news item.<section> Used to either group different articles into different\n  purposes or subjects, or to define the different sections of a single \n  article. <aside> Defines a block of content that is related to the    main\n  content around it, but not central to the flow of it.They include an image that I\'ve cleaned up here:In code, this looks like so:Let\'s explore some of the HTML5 elements in more detail. <section>The <section> element is for containing distinct different areas of\n  functionality or subjects area, or breaking an article or story up\n  into different sections. So in this case: "sidebar1" contains various\n  useful links that will persist on every page of the site, such as\n  "subscribe to RSS" and "Buy music from store". "main" contains the\n  main content of this page, which is blog posts. On other pages of the\n  site, this content will change. It is a fairly generic element, but\n  still has way more semantic meaning than the plain old <div>.<article><article> is related to <section>, but is distinctly different.\n  Whereas <section> is for grouping distinct sections of content or\n  functionality, <article> is for containing related individual\n  standalone pieces of content, such as individual blog posts, videos,\n  images or news items. Think of it this way - if you have a number of\n  items of content, each of which would be suitable for reading on their\n  own, and would make sense to syndicate as separate items in an RSS\n  feed, then <article> is suitable for marking them up. In our\n  example, <section id="main"> contains blog entries. Each blog entry\n  would be suitable for syndicating as an item in an RSS feed, and would\n  make sense when read on its own, out of context, therefore <article>\n  is perfect for them:Simple huh? Be aware though that you can also nest sections inside\n  articles, where it makes sense to do so. For example, if each one of\n  these blog posts has a consistent structure of distinct sections, then\n  you could put sections inside your articles as well. It could look\n  something like this:<header> and <footer>as we already mentioned above, the purpose of the <header> and\n  <footer> elements is to wrap header and footer content,\n  respectively. In our particular example the <header> element\n  contains a logo image, and the <footer> element contains a copyright\n  notice, but you could add more elaborate content if you wished. Also\n  note that you can have more than one header and footer on each page -\n  as well as the top level header and footer we have just discussed, you\n  could also have a <header> and <footer> element nested inside each\n  <article>, in which case they would just apply to that particular\n  article. Adding to our above example:<nav>The <nav> element is for marking up the navigation links or other\n  constructs (eg a search form) that will take you to different pages of\n  the current site, or different areas of the current page. Other links,\n  such as sponsored links, do not count. You can of course include\n  headings and other structuring elements inside the <nav>, but it\'s\n  not compulsory.<aside>you may have noticed that we used an <aside> element to markup the\n  2nd sidebar: the one containing latest gigs and contact details. This\n  is perfectly appropriate, as <aside> is for marking up pieces of\n  information that are related to the main flow, but don\'t fit in to it\n  directly. And the main content in this case is all about the band!\n  Other good choices for an <aside> would be information about the\n  author of the blog post(s), a band biography, or a band discography\n  with links to buy their albums.Where does that leave <div>?So, with all these great new elements to use on our pages, the days of\n  the humble <div> are numbered, surely? NO. In fact, the <div>\n  still has a perfectly valid use. You should use it when there is no\n  other more suitable element available for grouping an area of content,\n  which will often be when you are purely using an element to group\n  content together for styling/visual purposes. A common example is\n  using a <div> to wrap all of the content on the page, and then using\n  CSS to centre all the content in the browser window, or apply a\n  specific background image to the whole content.The main mistake: You have "divitis" in the whole document.Why this?Instead of:To stylize this header, use CSS hierarchy: body > section > header > h1, body > section > header > h2More, ...line 63: why header wraps h2?? If you do not include any more element inside header, just use a single h2.Keep in mind, your structure is not to stylize document, but construct a document self-explained.Apply this to the rest of document;\nGood luck ;)[explanations in my \xe2\x80\x9cmain answer\xe2\x80\x9d]line 7. section around the whole website? Or only a div?Neither. For styling: use the <body>, it\xe2\x80\x99s already there. For sectioning/semantics: as detailed in my example HTML its effect is contrary to usefulness. Extra wrappers to already wrapped content is no improvement, but noise.\nline 8. Each section start with a header?No, it is the author\xe2\x80\x99s choice where to put content typically summarized as \xe2\x80\x9cheader\xe2\x80\x9d. And if that header-content is clearly recognizable without extra marking, it may perfectly stay without <header>. This is also the author\xe2\x80\x99s choice.\nline 23. Is this div right? or must this be a section?The <div> is probably wrong. It depends on the intentions: is it for styling only it could be right. If it\xe2\x80\x99s for semantic purposes it is wrong: it should be an <article> instead as shown in my other answer. <article> is also right if it is for both styling and sectioning combined.<section> looks wrong here, as there are no similar sections before or after this one, like chapters in a book. (This is the purpose of <section>).\nline 24. Split left/right column with a div.No. Why?\nline 25. Right place for the article tag?Yes, makes sense.\nline 26. Is it required to put your h1-tag in the header-tag?No. A lone <h*> element probably never needs to go in a <header> (but it can if you want to) as it is already clear that it\xe2\x80\x99s the heading of what is about to come. \xe2\x80\x93 It would make sense if that <header> also encompassed a tagline (marked with <p>), for example.\nline 43. The content is not related to the main article, so I decided this is a section and not an aside.It is a misunderstanding that an <aside> has to be \xe2\x80\x9ctangentially related\xe2\x80\x9d to the content around. The point is: use an <aside> if the content is only \xe2\x80\x9ctangentially related\xe2\x80\x9d or not at all!Nevertheless, apart from <aside> being a decent choice, <article> might still be better than a <section> as \xe2\x80\x9chot items\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnew items\xe2\x80\x9d are not to be read like two chapters in a book. You can perfectly go for one of them and not the other like an alternative sorting of something, not like two parts of a whole.\nline 44. H2 without headerIs great.\nline 53. section without headerWell, there is no <header>, but the <h2>-heading leaves pretty clear which part in this section is the header.\nline 63. Div with all (non-related) news items<article> or <aside> might be better.\nline 64. header with h2Discussed already.\nline 65. Hmm, div or section? Or remove this div and only use the article-tagExactly! Remove the <div>.\nline 105. Footer :-)Very reasonable.According to the explanation in my \xe2\x80\x9cmain\xe2\x80\x9d answer the document in question should be marked up according to an outline.In the following two tables I show:\noriginal html (shortened)\n\n<body>\n   <section>\n     <header>\n        <div id=logo></div>\n        <div id=language></div>\n     </header>\n     <nav>\n       ...\n     </nav>\n     <div id=main>\n        <div id=main-left>\n           <article>\n              <header>\n                <h1>The real thing</h1>\n              </header>\n           </article>\n        </div>\n        <div id=main-right>\n           <section id=main-right-hot>\n             <h2>Hot items</h2>\n           </section>\n           <section id=main-right-new>\n             <h2>New items</h2>\n           </section>\n        </div>\n     </div>\n     <div id=news-items>\n        <header>\n          <h2>The latest news</h2>\n        </header>\n        <div id=item_1>\n           <article>\n              <header>\n                <h3>...</h3>\n              </header>\n              <a>read more</a>\n           </article>\n        </div>\n        <div id=item_2>\n           <article>\n              <header>\n                <h3>...</h3>\n              </header>\n              <a>read more</a>\n           </article>\n        </div>\n        <div id=item_3>\n           <article>\n              <header>\n                <h3>...</h3>\n              </header>\n              <a>read more</a>\n           </article>\n        </div>\n     </div>\n     <footer>\n       <ul><li>...</ul>\n     </footer>\n   </section>\n\n\noriginal html relevant for outline\n\n<body>\n   <section>\n     // logo and language\n     <nav>\n      ...\n     </nav>\n     <article>\n        <h1>The real thing</h1>\n     </article>\n     <section>\n        <h2>Hot items</h2>\n     </section>\n     <section>\n        <h2>New items</h2>\n     </section>\n     <h2>The latest news</h2>\n     <article>\n        <h3>...</h3>\n     </article>\n     <article>\n        <h3>...</h3>\n     </article>\n     <article>\n        <h3>...</h3>\n     </article>\n     // footer links\n   </section>\n\n\nresulting outline\n1.

Like this:It seems unnecessary to add the wrapper divs. ID values have no semantic meaning in HTML, so I think it would be perfectly valid to do this - you\'re not saying that the first article is always item_1, just item_1 within the context of the current page. IDs are not required to have any meaning that is independent of context.Also, as to your question on line 26, I don\'t think the <header> tag is required there, and I think you could omit it since it\'s on its own in the "main-left" div. If it were in the main list of articles you might want to include the <header> tag just for the sake of consistency.The  tag defines external content.\n  The external content could be a news-article from an external provider, or a text from a web log (blog), or a text from a forum, or any other content from an external source.I didn\'t answer other ones because it\'s kind of hard to guess what you were referring to. If there are more questions, please let me know.Here\'s my example in which I workI dont think you should use the  tag on the news item summary (lines 67, 80, 93).\nYou could use section or just have the enclosing div.An article needs to be able to stand on its own & still make sense or be complete. As its incomplete or just an extract it cannot be an article, its more a section.When you click \'read more\' the subsequent page can EDIT: Unfortunately I have to correct myself. Refer below https://stackoverflow.com/a/17935666/2488942 for a link to the w3 specs which include an example (unlike the ones I looked at earlier on).But then....\nHere is a nice article about it thanks to @Fez.My original response was:The way the w3 specs are structured:4.3.4 Sections4.3.4.1 The body element4.3.4.2 The section element4.3.4.3 The nav element4.3.4.4 The article element....suggests to me that section is higher level than article. As mentioned in this answer section groups thematically related content. Content within an article is in my opinion thematically related anyway, hence this, to me at least, then also suggests that section groups at a higher level compared to article.I think it\'s meant to be used like this:or for a news website:\xe2\x80\x9eline 23. Is this div right? or must this be a section?\xe2\x80\x9cNeither \xe2\x80\x93 there is a main tag for that purpose, which is only allowed once per page and should be used as a wrapper for the main content (in contrast to a sidebar or a site-wide header).http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/grouping-content.html#the-main-elementI want to clarify this question more precisely,correct me if I am wrong\nLets take an example of Facebook Wall 1.Wall comes under "section" tag,which denotes it is separate from page.2.All posts come under "article" tag.3.Then we have single post,which comes under "section" tag.3.We have heading "X user post this" for this we can use "heading" tag.4.Then inside post we have three section one is Images/text,like-share-comment button and comment box.5.For comment box we can use article tag.According to Nathan\'s answer, this makes perfect sense (for red and orange parts, maybe you could use div\'s and/or header and footer respectively):
