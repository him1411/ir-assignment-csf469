How would I go about removing all of the child elements of a DOM node in JavaScript?Say I have the following (ugly) HTML:And I grab the node I want like so:How could I remove the children of foo so that just <p id="foo"></p> is left?Could I just do:or should I be using some combination of removeElement?I\'d like the answer to be straight up DOM; though extra points if you also provide an answer in jQuery along with the DOM-only answer.Option 1 (much slower, see comments below):Option 2 (much faster):The currently accepted answer is wrong about innerHTML being slower (atleast in IE and Chrome), as m93a correctly mentioned.Chrome and FF are dramatically faster using this method (which will destroy attached jquery data):in a distant second for FF and Chrome, and fastest in IE:InnerHTML won\'t destroy your event handlers or break jquery references, it\'s also recommended as a solution here: \nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element.innerHTMLThe fastest DOM manipulation method (still slower than the previous two) is the Range removal, but ranges aren\'t supported until IE9.The other methods mentioned seem to be comparable, but a lot slower than innerHTML, except for the outlier, jquery (1.1.1 and 3.1.1), which is considerably slower than anything else:Evidence here:http://jsperf.com/innerhtml-vs-removechild/167 http://jsperf.com/innerhtml-vs-removechild/300 \nhttps://jsperf.com/remove-all-child-elements-of-a-dom-node-in-javascript\n(New url for jsperf reboot because editing the old url isn\'t working)Jsperf\'s "per-test-loop" often gets understood as "per-iteration", and only the first iteration has nodes to remove so the results are meaningless, at time of posting there were tests in this thread set up incorrectly.If there\'s any chance that you have jQuery affected descendants, then you must use some method that will clean up jQuery data.The jQuery .empty() method will ensure that any data that jQuery associated with elements being removed will be cleaned up.If you simply use DOM methods of removing the children, that data will remain.If you use jQuery:If you don\'t:The fastest...Thanks to Andrey Lushnikov for his link to jsperf.com (cool site!).If you only want to have the node without its children you could also make a copy of it like this:Depends on what you\'re trying to achieve.It\'s like innerText, except standard. It\'s a bit slower than removeChild(), but it\'s easier to use and won\'t make much of a performance difference if you don\'t have too much stuff to delete.This is a newer way to write node removal in ES5. It is vanilla JS and reads much nicer than previous versions.Most users should have modern browsers or you can transpile down if needed.This will remove all nodes within the element.Here\'s another approach:innerText is the winner! http://jsperf.com/innerhtml-vs-removechild/133. At all previous tests inner dom of parent node were deleted at first iteration and then innerHTML or removeChild where applied to empty div.Simplest way of removing the child nodes of a node via JavascriptThere are couple of options to achieve that:The fastest ():Alternatives (slower):Benchmark with the suggested optionsi saw people doing:then someone said using el.lastNode is fasterhowever I would think that this is the fastest:what do you think?ps:\nthis topic was a life saver for me. my firefox addon got rejected cuz i used innerHTML. Its been a habit for a long time. then i foudn this. and i actually noticed a speed difference. on load the innerhtml took awhile to update, however going by addElement its instant!In response to DanMan, Maarten and Matt. Cloning a node, to set the text is indeed a viable way in my results.Also this works for nodes not in the dom which return null when trying to access the parentNode. In addition, if you need to be safe a node is empty before adding content this is really helpful. Consider the use case underneath.I find this method very useful when replacing a string inside an element, if you are not sure what the node will contain, instead of worrying how to clean up the mess, start out fresh.Generally, JavaScript uses arrays to reference lists of DOM nodes. So, this will work nicely if you have an interest in doing it through the HTMLElements array. Also, worth noting, because I am using an array reference instead of JavaScript proto\'s this should work in any browser, including IE.This is a pure javascript i am using not jQuery but works in all browser even IEor you may simpli do this Other ways in jQueryin jQuery you just use this :example code:simply only IE:true - means to do deep removal - which means that all child are also removedOption 2 from the winning answer. with jQuery :
