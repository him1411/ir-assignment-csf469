I\'m doing a presentation on debugging in Xcode and would like to get more information on using NSLog efficiently.In particular, I have two questions:Here are some useful macros around NSLog I use a lot:The DLog macro is used to only output when the DEBUG variable is set (-DDEBUG in the projects\'s C flags for the debug confirguration).ALog will always output text (like the regular NSLog).The output (e.g. ALog(@"Hello world") ) will look like this:I\'ve taken DLog and ALog from above, and added ULog which raises a UIAlertView message.To summarize:This is what it looks like:+1 DiederikOutputs file name, line number, and function name:__FUNCTION__ in C++ shows mangled name __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ shows nice function name, in cocoa they look the same.I\'m not sure what is the proper way of disabling NSLog, I did:And no logging output showed up, however I don\'t know if this has any side effects.Here one big collection of debug constants that we use. Enjoy.There are a new trick that no answer give. You can use printf instead NSLog. This will give you a clean log:With NSLog you get things like this: But with printf you get only:Use this codeMy answer to this question might help, looks like it\'s similar to the one Diederik cooked up. You may also want to replace the call to NSLog() with a static instance of your own custom logging class, that way you can add a priority flag for debug/warning/error messages, send messages to a file or database as well as the console, or pretty much whatever else you can think of.Disabling all NSLogs, for somebody allergic to MACROS, here is something that you can compile too:And, use it almost like NSLog:From this blog: http://whackylabs.com/rants/?p=134To complement the answers above, it can be quite useful to use a replacement for NSLog in certain situations, especially when debugging. For example, getting rid of all the date and process name/id information on each line can make output more readable and faster to boot.The following link provides quite a bit of useful ammo for making simple logging much nicer.http://cocoaheads.byu.edu/wiki/a-different-nslogIt\'s easy to change your existing NSLogs to display line number and class from which they are called. Add one line of code to your prefix file:building on top of above answers, here is what I plagiarized and came up with. Also added memory logging.It is simple,for Example-(void)applicationWillEnterForeground:(UIApplication *)application {}Output:\n-[AppDelegate applicationWillEnterForeground:]New addition to DLog. Instead of totally removing debug from released application, only disable it. When user has problems, which would require debugging, just tell how to enable debug in released application and request log data via email.Short version: create global variable (yes, lazy and simple solution) and modify DLog like this:Longer answer at Jomnius iLessons iLearned: How to Do Dynamic Debug Logging in Released ApplicationFor some time I\'ve been using a site of macros adopted from several above. Mine focus on logging in the Console, with the emphasis on controlled & filtered verbosity; if you don\'t mind a lot of log lines but want to easily switch batches of them on & off, then you might find this useful. First, I optionally replace NSLog with printf as described by @Rodrigo aboveNext, I switch logging on or off.In the main block, define various categories corresponding to modules in your app. Also define a logging level  above which logging calls won\'t be called. Then define various flavours of NSLog outputThus, with current settings for kLOGIFcategory and kLOGIFdetailLTEQ, a call like will print but this won\'tnor willIf you want to override the settings for an individual log call, use a negative level:I find the few extra characters of typing each line are worth as I can thenI\'m sure many will find this a bit of an overkill, but just in case someone finds it suits their purposes..
