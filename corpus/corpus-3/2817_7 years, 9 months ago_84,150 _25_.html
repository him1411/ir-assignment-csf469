What\'s the point of the Sign Off feature in Git?When should I use it, if at all? Sign-off is a requirement for getting patches into the Linux kernel and a few other projects, but most projects don\'t actually use it.It was introduced in the wake of the SCO lawsuit, (and other accusations of copyright infringement from SCO, most of which they never actually took to court), as a Developers Certificate of Origin. It is used to say that you certify that you have created the patch in question, or that you certify that to the best of your knowledge, it was created under an appropriate open-source license, or that it has been provided to you by someone else under those terms. This can help establish a chain of people who take responsibility for the copyright status of the code in question, to help ensure that copyrighted code not released under an appropriate free software (open source) license is not included in the kernel.Sign-off is a line at the end of the commit message which certifies who is the author of the commit. \nIts main purpose is to improve tracking of who did what, especially with patches.Example:It should contain the user real name if used for an open-source project.If branch maintainer need to slightly modify patches in order to merge them, he could ask the submitter to rediff, but it would be counter-productive. \nHe can adjust the code and put his sign-off at the end so the author still gets credit for the patch and not the introduced bugs.Source: http://gerrit.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/2.0/user-signedoffby.htmlgit 2.7.1 (February 2016) clarifies that in commit b2c150d (05 Jan 2016) by David A. Wheeler (david-a-wheeler).\n(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit 7aae9ba, 05 Feb 2016) git commit man page now includes:Add Signed-off-by line by the committer at the end of the commit log message.\n  The meaning of a signoff depends on the project, but it typically certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under the same license and agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin (see http://developercertificate.org/ for more information).Modify various document (man page) files to explain in more detail what --signoff means.This was inspired by "lwn article \'Bottomley: A modest proposal on the DCO\'" (Developer Certificate of Origin) where paulj noted:The issue I have with DCO is that there adding a "-s" argument to git commit doesn\'t really mean you have even heard of the DCO (the git commit man page makes no mention of the DCO anywhere), never mind actually seen it. So how can the presence of "signed-off-by" in any way imply the sender is agreeing to and committing to the DCO? Combined with fact I\'ve seen replies on lists to patches without SOBs that say nothing more than "Resend this with signed-off-by so I can commit it".Extending git\'s documentation will make it easier to argue that developers understood --signoff when they use it.There are some nice answers on this question. I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to add a more\nbroad answer, namely about what these kinds of lines/headers/trailers\nare about in current practice. Not so much about the sign-off header in\nparticular (it\xe2\x80\x99s not the only one).Headers or trailers (\xe2\x86\x911) like \xe2\x80\x9csign-off\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x86\x912) is, in current\npractice in projects like Git and Linux, effectively structured metadata\nfor the commit. These are all appended to the end of the commit message,\nafter the \xe2\x80\x9cfree form\xe2\x80\x9d (unstructured) part of the body of the message.\nThese are token\xe2\x80\x93value (or key\xe2\x80\x93value) pairs typically delimited by a\ncolon and a space (:\xe2\x90\xa3).Like I mentioned, \xe2\x80\x9csign-off\xe2\x80\x9d is not the only trailer in current practice. See\nfor example this commit,\nwhich has to do with \xe2\x80\x9cDirty Cow\xe2\x80\x9d:In addition to the \xe2\x80\x9csign-off\xe2\x80\x9d trailer in the above, there is:Other projects, like for example Gerrit, have their own headers and\nassociated meaning for them.See: https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/CommitMessageConventionsIt is my impression that, although the initial motivation for this\nparticular metadata was some legal issues (judging by the other\nanswers), the practice of such metadata has progressed beyond just\ndealing with the case of forming a chain of authorship.[\xe2\x86\x911]: man git-interpret-trailers\n[\xe2\x86\x912]: These are also sometimes called \xe2\x80\x9cs-o-b\xe2\x80\x9d (initials), it seems.
