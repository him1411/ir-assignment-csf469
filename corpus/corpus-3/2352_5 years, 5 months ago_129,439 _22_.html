The tools are opened on the bottom of the chrome window per default. This is a rather bad choice for a wide screen display since there is plenty of empty space to the right but not much vertical space to spare. Unfortunately, I have found no way to reposition the tools. I would like to have them on the side, similar to firebug. The only option similar to what I want is to detach the dev tools and place chrome and the tools window side-by-side. This is not very convenient for quickly alt-tabbing from the IDE to the browser and back though, so an "integrated" solution would be nice.Thank you.Click the vertical ellipsis button ( \xe2\x8b\xae ) then choose the desired docking option.Long-hold the dock icon in the top right.
