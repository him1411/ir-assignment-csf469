How do I compare a variable to a string (and do something if they match)?Try this:If you want to do something when they don\'t match, replace == with !=. You want the quotes around $x, because if $x is empty, you\'ll get if [ == "valid" ]... which is a syntax error.Note that bash allows == to be used with [, but this is not standard. Either use [[ "$x" == "valid" ]] (in which case, the quotes around $x are optional) or [ "$x" = "valid" ].Or, if you don\'t need else clause:To compare strings with wildcards useNotes:you can also use use case/esacI have to disagree one of the comments in one point:It\'s just it looks like one to, hmm, the uninitiated...It uses common patterns as a language, in a way;And fter you learned the language.It is a simple logical expression, with one special part: lazy evaluation of the logic operators.Each part is a logical expression; the first may be true or false, the other two are always true.Now, when it is evaluated, the first is checked. If it is false, than the second operand of the logic and && after it is not relevant. The first is not true, so it can not be the first and the second be true, anyway.\nNow, in this case is the the first side of the logic  or || false, but it could be true if the other side - the third part - is true.  So the third part will be evaluated - mainly writing the message as a side effect. (It has the result 0 for true, which we do not use here)The other cases are similar, but simpler - and - I promise! are - can be - easy to read!\n (I don\'t have one, but I think being a UNIX veteran with grey beard helps a lot with this.)following script reads from a file named "testonthis" line by line then compares each line with a simple string, a string with special characters and a regular expression if it doesn\'t match then script will print the line o/w not.space in bash is so much important. so following will workbut following won\'t:so please use as is:I would probably use regexp matches if the input has only a few valid entries. E.g. only the "start" and "stop" are valid actions. Note that I lowercase the variable $ACTION by using the double comma\'s. Also note that this won\'t work on too aged bash versions out there.
