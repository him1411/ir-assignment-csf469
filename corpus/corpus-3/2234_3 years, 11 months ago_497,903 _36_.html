I am trying to use IPython notebook on MacOS X with Python 2.7.2 and IPython 1.1.0.I cannot get matplotlib graphics to show up inline.I have also tried %pylab inline and the ipython command line arguments --pylab=inline but this makes no difference.Instead of inline graphics, I get this:And matplotlib.get_backend() shows that I have the \'module://IPython.kernel.zmq.pylab.backend_inline\' backend.I used %matplotlib inline in the first cell of the notebook and it works. I think you should try:You can also always start all your IPython kernels in inline mode by default by setting the following config options in your config files:If your matplotlib version is above 1.4, it is also possible to useIPython 3.x and aboveolder versionsBoth will activate the nbagg backend, which enables interactivity.Ctrl + Enter%matplotlib inlineMagic Line :DSee: Plotting with Matplotlib.I\'m not sure why joaquin posted his answer as a comment, but it is the correct answer:start ipython with ipython notebook --pylab inlineEdit: Ok, this is now deprecated as per comment below. Use the %pylab magic.I have to agree with foobarbecue (I don\'t have enough recs to be able to simply insert a comment under his post):It\'s now recommended that python notebook isn\'t started wit the argument --pylab, and according to Fernando Perez (creator of ipythonnb) %matplotlib inline should be the initial notebook command.See here: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/1.x/examples/notebooks/Part%203%20-%20Plotting%20with%20Matplotlib.ipynbTo make matplotlib inline by default in Jupyter (IPython 3):Edit file ~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.pyAdd line c.InteractiveShellApp.matplotlib = \'inline\'Please note that adding this line to ipython_notebook_config.py would not work.\nOtherwise it works well with Jupyter and IPython 3.1.0I found a workaround that is quite satisfactory.  I installed Anaconda Python and this now works out of the box for me.I did the anaconda install but matplotlib is not plottingIt starts plotting when i did thisOn Ubuntu you can remove %matplotlib inline as long as you have  plt.show() after creation of graph.You can simulate this problem with a syntax mistake, however, %matplotlib inline won\'t resolve the issue. First an example of the right way to create a plot. Everything works as expected with the imports and magic that eNord9 supplied. However, by leaving the () off the end of the plot type you receive a somewhat ambiguous non-error.Erronious code:Example error:Other than this one line message, there is no stack trace or other obvious reason to think you made a syntax error. The plot doesn\'t print.
