Right now, i stores every xml layout file inside the layout folder, so it is feasible and simple to manage small projects, but when there is a case of large and heavy projects, then there should be a hierarchy and sub-folders needed inside the layout folder.for e.g. Like the same way, we would like to have sub-folders for the large application, so is there any way to do so inside the android project?I am able to create layout-personal and layout_address sub-folders inside the layout folder, but when the time comes to access the xml layout file using R.layout._ , at that time there is no any xml layout pop-up inside the menu.You CAN do this with gradle.  I\'ve made a demo project showing how.The trick is to use gradle\'s ability to merge multiple resource folders, and set the res folder as well as the nested subfolders in the sourceSets block.  The quirk is that you can\'t declare a container resource folder before you declare that folder\'s child resource folders.Below is the sourceSets block from the build.gradle file from the demo.  Notice that the subfolders are declared first.Also, the direct parent of your actual resource files (pngs, xml layouts, etc..) does still need to correspond with the specification.The answer is no.I would like to draw your attention towards this book Pro Android 2 that states:It is also worth noting a few\n  constraints regarding resources.\n  First, Android supports only a linear\n  list of files within the predefined\n  folders under res. For example, it\n  does not support nested folders under\n  the layout folder (or the other\n  folders under res).Second, there are some similarities\n  between the assets folder and the raw\n  folder under res. Both folders can\n  contain raw files, but the files\n  within raw are considered resources\n  and the files within assets are not.Note that because the contents of the\n  assets folder are not considered\n  resources, you can put an arbitrary\n  hierarchy of folders and files within\n  it.I just wanted to add onto eskis\' fantastic answer for people having trouble. (Note: This will only work and look like separate directories inside the \'project\' view, not the \'android\' view unfortunately.)Tested with the following.\nBuildToolsVersion = 23.0.0\ngradle 1.2.3 & 1.3.0This is how I got mine to work with an already built project.Once this is complete, go into your modules gradle.build file and create a sourceSets definition like this...(Make sure \'src/main/res/layouts\' & \'src/main/res\' are always the bottom two!!!! Like I am showing below).Profit $$$$But seriously.. this is how I got it to work. Let me know if anyone has any questions.. I can try to help.Pictures are worth more than words.Not possible, but the layout folder is sorted by name. So, I prepend the layout file names with my package names. E.g. for the two packages "buying" and "playing":Now with Android Studio and Gradle, you can have multiple resource folders in your project. Allowing to organize not only your layout files but any kind of resources.It\'s not exactly a sub-folder, but may separte parts of your application.The configuration is like this:Check the documentation.I use Android File Grouping plugin for Android Studio.It doesn\'t really allows you to create sub-folders, but it can DISPLAY your files and resources AS they are in different folders. And this is exactly what I wanted.You can install "Android File Grouping" plugin by Windows: Android Studio -> File -> Settings -> Plugins.Mac:Android Studio -> Android Studio Tab (Top Left) -> Preferences -> Plugins -> Install JetBrains Plugin..For Mac, I was able to test it and was not able to search for the plugin. So I downloaded the plugin from here and used the Install plugin from disk option from the above setting.I think the most elegant solution to this problem (given that subfolders are not allowed) is to prepend the file names with the name of the folder you would have placed it inside of. For example, if you have a bunch of layouts for an Activity, Fragment, or just general view called "places" then you should just prepend it with places_my_layout_name. At least this solves the problem of organizing them in a way that they are easier to find within the IDE. It\'s not the most awesome solution, but it\'s better than nothing.I am able to achieve subfolders by following the top answer to this question.However, as the project grows bigger, you will have many sub-folders:Not a big problem, but:So I wrote a simple Groovy method to grab all nested folders:Paste this method outside of the android {...} block in your app/build.gradle.For a structure like this:Use it like this:If you have a structure like this:You will use it like this:getLayoutList() takes a relative path as an argument. The relative path is relative to the root of the project. So when we input "app/src/main/res/layouts/", it will return all the subfolders\' name as an array, which will be exactly the same as:Here\'s the script with comments for understanding:Hope it helps!Check Bash Flatten Folder script that converts folder hierarchy to a single folderIf you are developing on a linux or a mac box, a workaround would be, to create subfolders  which include symbolic links to your layoutfiles. Just use the ln command with -sln -s PATH_TO_YOUR_FILEThe Problem with this is, that your Layout folder still contains all the .xml files. But you could although select them by using the sub-folders. It\'s the closest thing, to what you would like to have.I just read, that this might work with Windows, too if you are using Vista or later. There is this mklink command. Just google it, have never used it myself.Another problem is, if you have the file opened and try to open it again out the plugin throws a NULL Pointer Exception. But it does not hang up.While all the proposals for multiple resource sets may work, the problem is that the current logic for the Android Studio Gradle plug-in will not update the resource files after they have changed for nested resource sets.  The current implementation attempts to check the resource directories using startsWith(), so a directory structure that is nested (i.e. src/main/res/layout/layouts and src/main/res/layout/layouts_category2) will choose src/main/res/layout/layouts consistently and never actually update the changes.  The end result is that you have to rebuild/clean the project each time.I submitted a patch at https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/157971/ to try to help resolve things.  The top answer by @eski is good, but the code is not elegant to use, so I wrote a groovy script in gradle for general use. It\'s applied to all build type and product flavor and not only can be use for layout, you can also add subfolder for any other resources type such as drawable. Here is the code(put it in android block of project-level gradle file)\xef\xbc\x9aHow to do in practice?For example, I want to create subfolder named activity for layout, add a string by any name in resDirs variable such as layouts, then the layout xml file should be put in res\\layouts\\activity\\layout\\xxx.xml.If I want to create subfolder named selectors for drawable, add a string by any name in resDirs variable such as drawables, then the drawable xml file should be put in res\\drawables\\selectors\\drawable\\xxx.xml.The folder name such as layouts and drawables is defined in resDirs variable, it can be any string.\nAll subfolder created by you such as activity or selectors are regarded as the same as res folder. So in selectors folder, we must create drawable folder additionally and put xml files in drawable folder, after that gradle can recognize the xml files as drawable normally.Well, the short answer is no. But you definitely can have multiple res folders. That, I think, is as close as you can get to having subfolders for the layout folder. Here\'s how you do it.A way i did it was to create a separate res folder at the same level as the actual res folder in your project, then you can use this in your apps build.gradlethen each subfolder of your new res folder can be something relating to each particular screen or something in your app, and each folder will have their own layout / drawable / values etc keeping things organized and you dont have to update the gradle file manually like some of these other answers require.
