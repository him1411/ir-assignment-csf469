I need to remove a highly referenced table in a SQL Server database.  How can I get a list of all the foreign key constraints I will need to remove in order to drop the table?(SQL answers preferable over clicking about in the GUI of the management studio.)Not sure why no one suggested but I use sp_fkeys to query foreign keys for a given table:I\'d use the Database Diagramming feature in SQL Server Management Studio, but since you ruled that out - this worked for me in SQL Server 2008 (don\'t have 2005).To get list of referring table and column names...To get names of foreign key constraintsTry this :This gives you:Code below:You should also mind the references to other objects. If the table was highly referenced by other tables than it\xe2\x80\x99s probably also highly referenced by other objects such as views, stored procedures, functions and more.I\xe2\x80\x99d really recommend GUI tool such as \xe2\x80\x98view dependencies\xe2\x80\x99 dialog in SSMS or free tool like ApexSQL Search for this because searching for dependencies in other objects can be error prone if you want to do it only with SQL.If SQL is the only option you could try doing it like this.The original question asked to get a list of all foreign keys into a highly referenced table so that the table can be removed.This little query returns all the \'drop foreign key\' commands needed to drop all foreign keys into a particular table:Example output:Omit the WHERE-clause to get the drop commands for all foreign keys in the current database.See How to Script Out all The Foreign Keys of a Table for help.Update: Link no longer available but the relevant SQL was copied as an answer to a related question.You can also view dependencies through the GUI.I am using this script to find all details related to foreign key. \nI am using INFORMATION.SCHEMA.\nBelow is a SQL Script:Some good answers above. But I prefer to have the answer with one query.\nThis piece of code is taken from sys.sp_helpconstraint (sys proc) That\'s the way Microsoft looks up if there are foreign keys associated to the tbl. The answer will look like this: test_db_name.dbo.Account: FK_Account_CustomerHere\'s the SQL code I would use.It\'s not particularly clear SQL, so let\'s look at an example.So, supposing I wanted to drop the Employees table in Microsoft\'s beloved Northwind database, but SQL Server told me that one or more Foreign Keys were preventing me from doing this.The SQL command above would return these results...It shows me that there are 3 Foreign Keys which reference the Employees table.  In other words, I wouldn\'t be allowed to delete (drop) this table until these three Foreign Keys are first deleted.In the results, the first row is how the following Foreign Key constraint would be shown in the results.The second-to-last column shows the SQL command I would need to use to delete one of these Foreign Keys, eg:...and the right-hand column shows the SQL to create it...With all of these commands, you have everything you need to delete the relevant Foreign Keys to allow you to delete a table, then recreate them later.Phew.  Hope this helps.This only shows the relationship if the are foreign key constraints. My database apparently predates the FK constraint.Some table use triggers to enforce referential integrity, and sometimes there\'s nothing but a similarly named column to indicate the relationship (and no referential integrity at all).Fortunately, we do have a consistent naming scene so I am able to find referencing tables \nand views like this:I used this select as the basis for generating a script the does what I need to do on\nthe related tables.If you want to get the foreign key relation of all the tables exclude the where clause else write your tablename instead of tablenameWorking off of what @Gishu did I was able to produce and use the following SQL in SQL Server 2005  Which Displays the tables, columns and Foreign Key names all in 1 query.  Determine primary keys and unique keys for all tables in a database...This should list all the constraints and at the end you can put your filtersFor reference please read thru - http://blogs.msdn.com/b/sqltips/archive/2005/09/16/469136.aspx I have been using this on 2008 and up.  It\'s similar to some other solutions listed but, the field names are proper cased to handle case specific (LatBin) collations.  Additionally, you can feed it a single table name and retrieve just the info for that table. There is how to get count of all responsibilities for selected Id. Just change @dbTableName value, @dbRowId value and its type (if int you need to remove \'\' in line no 82 (..SET @SQL = ..)). Enjoy.This gets any foreign key that involves the chosen table.  *Assumes a _FIRSTABLENAME_SECONDTABLENAME format.This is a more general form:
