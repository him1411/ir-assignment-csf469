When I\'m building my Xcode 4 apps I\'m getting this warning: But I do not have Google Analytics in my app, I deleted all of it how can I remove the error?\nAnd archiving an app gives me the error:I\'ve tried so many things but I\'m still getting this error when I\'m trying to make an .IPA fileYou need to do this:And regarding the second error, sorry i can\'t help you out with that one. Hope someone else can help you out.Good luck,\nNathanThere are two errors that people seem to be confusing.If it is a "directory not found for option \'-L/..." error, that means it\'s a Library Error, and you should try to:If it is a "directory not found for option \'-F/...", that means it\'s a Framework Error, and you should try to:This might happen when you move the referenced file around.I had to remove the references at:Then the build was broken (expected). So I removed the Framework (FB SDK), re-added it and voila. No more errors or warnings. :)My problem was that I opened the original .xcodeproj instead of the .xcworkspace that was generated by CocoaPods.For me the problem was a missing escape "\\" character.My search paths were broken up on several lines in the Library Search Paths. Conveniently, they were breaking at spaces in my path. Adding the escape "\\" fixed it for me.In my case the problem was Framework Search paths that had incomplete, dead, old links or multiple frameworks of same type. Remove them and your project will compile without any problem.be sure to do Build -> clean I ran into the same problem (the first one) after an Xcode crash and none of the solutions proposed worked.\nTo suppress the warning I have done:\xe2\x80\xa2 manage schemes...\xe2\x80\xa2 deleted the current scheme\xe2\x80\xa2 Autocrate Schemes NowI found the reference which I had to remove at:I got bit by what appears to be the same issue too (this time in XCode 5.0.2).  In my case, what happened was XCode decided to escape the quotes already in the "Build Settings".  So for example:becamewhich caused the build to fail...Once I removed the escapes on the quotes everything worked fine again.  In addition, it would probably be best to remove the quotes altogether unless you need them.Follow this step-by-step solution:Supplemental answerAll the answers said to either delete the Framework or Library search paths from the target. I had two problems:I use cocoa pods so for me, I quit Xcode and ranagain and reopened the project. This fixed everything!If you\'re having trouble with the basics of Nathan\'s tip visit this site for edification.For me the problem seemed to be that I hadn\'t included the appropriate frameworks (when copying addons from another project I didn\'t copy the frameworks files as well)The key for this type of error is to go into build settings and look at each of the search paths sections such as Library Search Paths, Framework Search Paths and possibly even Header Search Paths and clear out any of the paths that no longer apply that your app is having a hard time trying to find. Remove them and carry on good sirgo check out which framework is missing , then go to => Build Phases\n=> Link Binary With Libraries remove the library  and then add back I had a similar problem that went away when I created a new scheme and used it to rebuild???For me I have also Tests enabled. The search path for tests was also filled incorrect.Clear the Framework Search Path for both the regular code and the test code!you should check option for this:Build Settings-> Framework Search Paths-> {input Your Project Path}I\'ve looked into all [Library Search Paths - Framework Search Paths - Header Search Paths]. but there are no paths to remove, so I was able to make this alert go away by going into the Xcode bundle and creating an empty directory at the path location that the alert was complaining about.Make sure only 1 "libFlurry.a" selected in targetworked for me.If this happens after you\'ve added a Podfile to your project and run pod install, go to your project folder, you\'ll see a new file that has been created "{ProjectName}.xcworkspace" -- open that file in xcodeThe pods that have been installed will be properly linked to your project in this file Do not forget to create the same configuration for Pod project in your workspace, If you change into MainApps new configuration.In my case, to resolve this issue I had to create ReleaseOfficial configuration as well for Pod projects when I created ReleaseOfficial configuration for my MainApp.
