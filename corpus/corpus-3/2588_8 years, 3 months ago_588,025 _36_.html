How can I create a PEM file from an SSL certificate? These are the files I have available: \n.crt, server.csr and server.key.Your keys may already be in PEM format, but just named with .crt or .key.If they begin with -----BEGIN and you can read them in a text editor (they use base64, which is readable in ASCII, not binary format), they are in PEM format.If the file is in binary, for the server.crt, you would use For server.key, use openssl rsa in place of openssl x509.The server.key is likely your private key, and the .crt file is the returned, signed, x509 certificate.If this is for a Web server, and you cannot specify loading a separate private and public key, you may need to concatenate the two files. For this use:I would recommend naming files with "includesprivatekey" to help you manage the permissions you keep with this file.I needed to do this for an AWS ELB.  After getting beaten up by the dialog many times, finally this is what worked for me:Thanks NCZ Edit: As @floatingrock saysWith AWS, don\'t forget to prepend the filename with file://. So it\'ll look like:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/upload-server-certificate.htmlA pem file contains the certificate and the private key. It depends on the format your certificate/key are in, but probably it\'s as simple as this:Additionally, if you don\'t want it to ask for a passphrase, then need to run the following command:this is the best option to create .pem fileWhat I have observed is: if you use openssl to generate certificates, it captures both the text part and the base64 certificate part in the crt file. The strict pem format says (wiki definition) that the file should start and end with BEGIN and END..pem \xe2\x80\x93 (Privacy Enhanced Mail) Base64 encoded DER certificate,\n  enclosed between "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" and "-----END\n  CERTIFICATE-----"So for some libraries (I encountered this in java) that expect strict pem format, the generated crt would fail the validation as an \'invalid pem format\'.Even if you copy or grep the lines with BEGIN/END CERTIFICATE, and paste it in a cert.pem file, it should work.Here is what I do, not very clean, but works for me, basically it filters the text starting from BEGIN line:grep -A 1000 BEGIN cert.crt > cert.pemI was trying to go from godaddy to app engine. What did the trick was using this line:Exactly as is, but replacing name with my domain name (not that it really even mattered) And I answered all the questions pertaining to common name / organization as www.name.comThen I opened the csr, copied it, pasted it in go daddy, then downloaded it, unzipped it, navigated to the unzipped folder with the terminal and entered:Then I used these instructions from Trouble with Google Apps Custom Domain SSL, which were:exactly as is, except instead of privateKey.key I used name.unencrypted.priv.key, and instead of www_mydomain_com.crt, I used name.crtThen I uploaded the public.pem to the admin console for the "PEM encoded X.509 certificate", and uploaded the private.pem for the "Unencrypted PEM encoded RSA private key".... And that finally worked.Trying to upload a GoDaddy certificate to AWS I failed several times, but in the end it was pretty simple. No need to convert anything to .pem. You just have to be sure to include the GoDaddy bundle certificate in the chain parameter, e.g.And to delete your previous failed upload you can do Run below commands:a) openssl pkcs12 -in Certificates.p12 -out CertificateName.pem -nodes,b) openssl pkcs12 -in Certificates.p12 -out pushcert.pem -nodes -clcertsopenssl pkcs12 -in YOUR_CERTIFICATE.p12 -out YOUR_CERTIFICATE.pem -nodes -clcerts
