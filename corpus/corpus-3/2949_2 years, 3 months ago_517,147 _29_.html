This is not a duplicate of Untrusted App Developer. Since iOS9 there is no option to trust an enterprise build. Has anyone found a workaround? In iOS 9.1 and lower, go to Settings - General - Profiles - tap on your Profile - tap on Trust button.In iOS 9.2+, go to: Settings - General - Profiles & Device Management - tap on your Profile - tap on Trust button. In iOS 10+, go to: Settings - General - Device Management - tap on your Profile - tap on Trust button. Do it like this:Go to Settings -> General -> Profiles - tap on your Profile - tap on the Trust button.but iOS10 has a little change, Users should go to Settings - General - Device Management - tap on your Profile - tap on Trust button.Reference: iOS10AdaptationTips Changes to Enterprise App Distribution Coming in iOS 9iOS 9 introduces a new feature to help protect users from installing\n  in-house apps from untrusted sources. While no new app signing or\n  provisioning methods are required, the way your enterprise users\n  manage in-house apps installed on their iOS 9 devices will change. In-house apps installed using an MDM solution are explicitly trusted\n  and will no longer prompt the user to trust the developer that signed\n  and provisioned the app. If your enterprise app does not use an MDM\n  solution, users who install your app for the first time will be\n  prompted to trust the developer. All users who install your app for\n  the first time will need an internet connection.Using a new restriction, organizations can limit the apps installed on their devices to the in-house apps that they create. And a new interface in Settings allows users to see all enterprise apps installed from their organization.Source: Official email sent from developer@insideapple.apple.com to existing enterprise app developers.For iOS 9 beta 3,4 users.
