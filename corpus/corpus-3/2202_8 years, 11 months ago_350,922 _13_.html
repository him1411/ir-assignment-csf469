How do I get a platform-dependent newline in Java? I can\xe2\x80\x99t use "\\n" everywhere.In addition to the line.separator property, if you are using java 1.5 or later and the String.format (or other formatting methods) you can use %n as inSee the Java 1.8 API for Formatter for more details.You can useto get the line separatorJava 7 now has a System.lineSeparator() method.If you\'re trying to write a newline to a file, you could simply use BufferedWriter\'s newLine() method. This is also possible: String.format("%n").Or String.format("%n").intern() to save some bytes.The commons-lang library has a constant field available called SystemUtils.LINE_SEPARATOR Use the method newLine() of class  BufferedWriter  which provides platform independent way to write  the new line in fileThe above snippet will have two strings separated by a new line irrespective of platforms.Avoid appending strings using String + String etc, use StringBuilder instead.
