How do I make an activity full screen? I mean without the notification bar. Any ideas?You can do it programatically:Or you can do it via your AndroidManifest.xml file:Edit:If you are using AppCompatActivity then you need to set theme as belowThere\'s a technique called Immersive Full-Screen Mode available in KitKat. I think it is now a preferred way to implement a fullscreen Activity.\nExampleIn AndroidManifest.xml file:Or in Java code:If you don\'t want to use the theme @android:style/Theme.NoTitleBar.Fullscreen because you are already using a theme of you own, you can use android:windowFullscreen.In AndroidManifest.xml:In styles.xml:If your using AppCompat and ActionBarActivity, then use thisgetSupportActionBar().hide();Be careful withIf you are using any method to set the action bar as the follow:It will cause a null pointer exception.Try this with appcompat from style.xml. It can support with all platforms.Using Android Studio (current version is 2.2.2 at moment) is very easy to add a fullscreen activity. See the steps:Done! Now you have a fullscreen activity made easily (see the java class and the activity layout to know how the things works)!thanks for answer @Cristian i was getting error android.util.AndroidRuntimeException: requestFeature() must be called\n  before adding contenti solved this usingFirst you must to set you app theme with "NoActionBar" like belowThen add these lines in your fullscreen activity.It will hide actionbar/toolbar and also statusbar in your fullscreen activityI wanted to use my own theme instead of using @android:style/Theme.NoTitleBar.Fullscreen.

Note the documentation for this method says:Set the width and height layout parameters of the window...\n  you can change them to ... an absolute value to make a window that is not full-screen.http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Window.html#setLayout%28int,%20int%29For my purposes, I found that I had to use setLayout with absolute parameters to resize my full screen window correctly.  Most of the time, this worked fine.  It was called by an onConfigurationChanged() event.  There was a hiccup, however.  If the user exited the app, changed the orientation, and reentered, it would lead to firing off my code which included setLayout().  During this re-entry time window, my status bar (which was hidden by the manifest) would be made to re-appear, but at any other time setLayout() would not cause this!  The solution was to add an additional setLayout() call after the one with the hard values like so:The window then correctly re-sized, and the status bar did not re-appear regardless of the event which triggered this.show Full Immersive:move out of full immersive mode:After a lot of time with no success I came with my own solution which is quit similar with another developer.
