When issuing an HTTP DELETE request, the request URI should completely identify the resource to delete. However, is it allowable to add extra meta-data as part of the entity body of the request?The spec does not explicitly forbid or discourage it, so I would tend to say it is allowed.Microsoft sees it the same way (I can hear murmuring in the audience), they state in the MSDN article about the DELETE Method of ADO.NET Data Services Framework:If a DELETE request includes an entity body, the body is ignored [...]Additionally here is what RFC2616 (HTTP 1.1) has to say in regard to requests:For responses, this has been defined:The latest update to the HTTP 1.1 spec explicitly permits entity body in DELETE request. Refer ThisSome versions of Tomcat and Jetty seem to ignore a entity body if it is present. Which can be a nuisance if you intended to receive it.One reason to use the body in a delete request is for optimistic concurrency control.You read version 1 of a record.Your colleague reads version 1 of the record.Your colleague changes the record and updates the database, which updates the version to 2:You try to delete the record:You should get an optimistic lock exception. Re-read the record, see that it\'s important, and maybe not delete it.Another reason to use it is to delete multiple records at a time (for example, a grid with row-selection check-boxes).Notice that each message has its own version. Maybe you can specify multiple versions using multiple headers, but by George, this is simpler and much more convenient. This works in Tomcat (7.0.52) and Spring MVC (4.05), possibly w earlier versions too:It appears to me that RFC 2616 does not specify this.From section 4.3:The presence of a message-body in a request is signaled by the\n  inclusion of a Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header field in\n  the request\'s message-headers. A message-body MUST NOT be included in\n  a request if the specification of the request method (section 5.1.1)\n  does not allow sending an entity-body in requests. A server SHOULD\n  read and forward a message-body on any request; if the request method\n  does not include defined semantics for an entity-body, then the\n  message-body SHOULD be ignored when handling the request.And section 9.7:The DELETE method requests that the origin server delete the resource\n  identified by the Request-URI. This method MAY be overridden by human\n  intervention (or other means) on the origin server. The client cannot\n  be guaranteed that the operation has been carried out, even if the\n  status code returned from the origin server indicates that the action\n  has been completed successfully. However, the server SHOULD NOT\n  indicate success unless, at the time the response is given, it\n  intends to delete the resource or move it to an inaccessible\n  location.A successful response SHOULD be 200 (OK) if the response includes an\n  entity describing the status, 202 (Accepted) if the action has not\n  yet been enacted, or 204 (No Content) if the action has been enacted\n  but the response does not include an entity.If the request passes through a cache and the Request-URI identifies\n  one or more currently cached entities, those entries SHOULD be\n  treated as stale. Responses to this method are not cacheable.cSo it\'s not explicitly allowed or disallowed, and there\'s a chance that a proxy along the way might remove the message body (although it SHOULD read and forward it).It seems ElasticSearch uses this:\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.x/search-request-scroll.html#_clear_scroll_apiWhich means Netty support this.Like mentionned in comments it may not be the case anymoreJust a heads up, if you supply a body in your DELETE request and are using a google cloud HTTPS load balancer, it will reject your request with a 400 error. I was banging my head against a wall and came to found out that Google, for whatever reason, thinks a DELETE request with a body is a malformed request.In case anyone is running into this issue testing, No it is not universally supported.I am currently testing with Sahi Pro and it is very apparent a http DELETE call strips any provided body data (a large list of id\'s to delete in bulk as per endpoint design).I have been in contact with them several times as well as sent in three separate packages of scrips, images, logs for them to review and they still have not confirmed this. A failed patch, and a missed conference calls by their support later and I still haven\'t gotten a solid answer.I am certain Sahi does not support this, and I would imagine many other tools follow suite.This is not defined.  A payload within a DELETE request message has no defined semantics;\n     sending a payload body on a DELETE request might cause some existing\n     implementations to reject the request.\n  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#page-29In Spring MVC, when deleting a resource using REST, we return the status:when you trying to use type-is to identify whether the request a "JSON request" or not, if delete request not includes an entity bod, it will be return false.
