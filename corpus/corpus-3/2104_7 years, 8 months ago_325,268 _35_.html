I\'ll use a concrete, but hypothetical, example.Each Order normally has only one line item:Orders:LineItems:But occasionally there will be an order with two line items:Normally when showing the orders to the user:I want to show the single item on the order. But with this occasional order containing two (or more) items, the orders would appear be duplicated:What I really want is to have SQL Server just pick one, as it will be good enough:If I get adventurous, I might show the user, an ellipsis to indicate that there\'s more than one:So the question is how to eitherMy first naive attempt was to only join to the "TOP 1" line items:But that gives the error:The column or prefix \'Orders\' does not\n  match with a table name or alias name\n  used in the query.Presumably because the inner select doesn\'t see the outer table.In SQL Server 2005 and above, you could just replace INNER JOIN with CROSS APPLY:I know this question was answered a while ago, but when dealing with large data sets, nested queries can be costly.  Here is a different solution where the nested query will only be ran once, instead of for each row returned.You could do:This requires an index (or primary key) on LineItems.LineItemID and an index on LineItems.OrderID or it will be slow.@Quassnoi answer is good, in some cases (especially if the outer table is big), a more efficient query might be with using windowed functions, like this:Sometimes you just need to test which query gives better performance.EDIT: nevermind, Quassnoi has a better answer.For SQL2K, something like this:Correlated sub queries are sub queries that depend on the outer query. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a for loop in SQL. The sub-query will run once for each row in the outer query:Tried the cross, works nicely, but takes slightly longer. Adjusted line columns to have max and added group which kept speed and dropped the extra record.Here\'s the adjusted query:I solve a similar problem by using LEFT JOIN and GROUP BY Orders.OrderNumber. Is there a reason not to do it this way? I\'ll answer your answer question with an answer in your own question:Joining the two together on OrderNumber gives:Where we wanted it to to return only one row:This is why I use GROUP BY Orders.OrderNumber which only returns one row per OrderNumber.My favorite way to run this query is with a not exists clause. I believe this is the most efficient way to run this sort of query:But I have not tested this method against other methods suggested here.,Another aproach using common table expression:or, in the end maybe you would like to show all rows joined?comma separated version here:
