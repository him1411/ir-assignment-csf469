I have a dev Ruby on Rails database full of data. I want to delete everything and rebuild the database. I\'m thinking of using something like:Is this possible?I know two ways to do this:This will reset your database and reload your current schema with all:This will destroy your db and then create it and then migrate your current schema:All data will be lost in both scenarios.On Rails 4, all needed is That would delete the entire contents on your DB and recreate the schema from your schema.rb file, without having to apply all migrations one by one.I use the following one liner in Terminal.I put this as a shell alias and named it remigrateUpdate: With the advent of Rails 5, this command will be accessible through this command:rails db:purge db:create db:migrate RAILS_ENV=testAs of the newest rails 4.2 release you can now run:Source: commitIt can be used together like mentioned above:Depending on what you\'re wanting, you can use\xe2\x80\xa6rake db:create\xe2\x80\xa6to build the database from scratch from config/database.yml, or\xe2\x80\xa6rake db:schema:load\xe2\x80\xa6to build the database from scratch from your schema.rb file.Use like All in one line. This is faster since the environment doesn\'t get reloaded again and again.db:drop - will drop database.db:create - will create database (host/db/password will be taken from config/database.yml)db:migrate - will run existing migrations from directory (db/migration/.rb)*.db:seed - will run seed data possible from directory (db/migration/seed.rb)..I usually prefer:to do all at once.Cheers!Just issue the sequence of the steps: drop the database, then re-create it again, migrate data, and if you have seeds, sow the database:Since the default environment for rake is development, in case if you see the exception in spec tests, you should re-create db for the test environment as follows:In most cases the test database is being sowed during the test procedures, so db:seed task action isn\'t required to be passed. Otherwise, you shall to prepare the database:orAdditionally, to use the recreate task you can add into Rakefile the following code:Then issue:From the command line runYou can manually do:Or just rake db:reset, which will run the above steps but will also run your db/seeds.rb file.  An added nuance is that rake db:reset loads directly from your schema.rb file as opposed to running all the migrations files again.  You data gets blown away in all cases.You can use this following command line:To drop a particular database, you can do this on rails console:And then migrate DB againOn rails 4.2, to remove all data but preserve the databasehttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4-2-stable/activerecord/CHANGELOG.mdYou can use \ndb:reset - for run db:drop and db:setup or\ndb:migrate:reset - which runs db:drop, db:create and db:migrate.dependent at you want to use exist schema.rbAccording to Rails guide, this one liner should be used because it would load from the schema.rb instead of reloading the migration files one by one:Because in development , you will always want to recreate the database,you can define a rake task in your lib/tasks folder like that. and in terminal you will run it will rebuild your databaseI think the best way to run this command:I\'ve today made quite a few changes to my rails schema. I realised I needed an additional two models in a hierarchy and some others to be deleted. There were many little changes required to the models and controllers.I added the two new models and created them, using:Then I edited the schema.rb file. I manually removed the old models that were no longer required, changed the foreign key field as required and just reordered it a bit to make it clearer to me. I deleted all the migrations, and then re-ran the build via:It worked perfectly. All the data has to be reloaded, of course. Rails realised the migrations had been deleted and reset the high-water mark:
