I am going to make a button to take an action and save the data into a database.Once the user clicks on the button, I want a JavaScript alert to offer \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccancel\xe2\x80\x9d options. If the user selects \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d, the data will be inserted into the database, otherwise no action will be taken.How do I display such a dialog?You\xe2\x80\x99re probably looking for confirm(), which displays a prompt and returns true or false based on what the user decided:Use confirm instead of alert.
