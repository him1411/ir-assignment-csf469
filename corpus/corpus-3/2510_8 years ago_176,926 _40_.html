How do I view the SQL generated by entity framework ?(In my particular case I\'m using the mysql provider - if it matters)You can do the following:or in EF6:That will give you the SQL that was generated.For those using Entity Framework 6 and up, if you want to view the output SQL in Visual Studio (like I did) you have to use the new logging/interception functionality.Adding the following line will spit out the generated SQL (along with additional execution-related details) in the Visual Studio output panel:More information about logging in EF6 in this nifty blog series: http://blog.oneunicorn.com/2013/05/08/ef6-sql-logging-part-1-simple-logging/Note: Make sure you are running your project in DEBUG mode.If you are using a DbContext, you can do the following to get the SQL:Starting with EF6.1 you can use Interceptors to register a database logger.\nSee chapters "Interceptors" and "Logging Database Operations" to a File hereThere are two ways:You can do the following in EF 4.1:That will give you the SQL that was generated.Applicable for EF 6.0 and above:\nFor those of you wanting to know more about the logging functionality and adding to the some of the answers already given.Any command sent from the EF to the database can now be logged. To view the generated queries from EF 6.x, use the DBContext.Database.Log propertyWhat Gets LoggedExample:Output:To log to an external file:More info here: Logging and Intercepting Database OperationsWell, I am using Express profiler for that purpose at the moment, the drawback is that it only works for MS SQL Server. You can find this tool here: https://expressprofiler.codeplex.com/To have the query always handy, without changing code\nadd this to your DbContext and check it on the output window in visual studio.Similar to @Matt Nibecker answer, but with this you do not have to add it in your current code, every time you need the query. In my case for EF 6+, instead of using this in the Immediate Window to find the query string:I ended up having to use this to get the generated SQL command:Of course your anonymous type signature might be different.HTH.Will return the sql query. Working using datacontext of EntityFramework 6I\'ve just done this:And the result shown in the Output:For me, using EF6 and Visual Studio 2015 I entered query in the immediate window and it gave me the generated SQL StatementMy answer addresses EF core, (as some commenters observed on the most highly-voted answer "What\'s the EF Core alternative?")Taken from the docs referenced in this github issue : When configuring your DbContext, you tell DbContextOptionsBuilder.UseLoggerFactoryYou have two options for the LoggerFactory:instantiate new LoggerFactory() yourself, adding your own Provider. In the above example, MyLoggerProvider, see the link for a definition of that class) Your code may have access to a dependency-injected ILoggerFactory. In my case, I used AddDbContext , inside Configure(). At this point in Configure(), there was no dependency-injected ILoggerFactory in scope, so I couldn\'t use this technique.Here\'s the implementation of MyLoggerProvider (from the first technique):If you want to have parameter values (not only @p_linq_0 but also their values) too, you can use IDbCommandInterceptor and add some logging to ReaderExecuted method.
