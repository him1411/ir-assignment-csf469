How can I find out which remote branch a local branch is tracking?Do I need to parse git config output, or is there a command that would do this for me?Here is a command that gives you the tracking branch:You have to wade through the SHA and any long-wrapping commit messages, but it\'s quick to type and I get the tracking branches aligned vertically in the 3rd column.Two choices:orI think git branch -av only tells you what branches you have and which commit they\'re at, leaving you to infer which remote branches the local branches are tracking.git remote show origin explicitly tells you which branches are tracking which remote branches.  Here\'s example output from a repository with a single commit and a remote branch called abranch:versusUpdate: Well, it\'s been several years since I posted this! For my specific purpose of comparing HEAD to upstream, I now use @{u}, which is a shortcut that refers to the HEAD of the upstream tracking branch. (See https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrevisions#gitrevisions-emltbranchnamegtupstreamemegemmasterupstreamememuem ).Original answer: I\'ve run across this problem as well. I often use multiple remotes in a single repository, and it\'s easy to forget which one your current branch is tracking against. And sometimes it\'s handy to know that, such as when you want to look at your local commits via git log remotename/branchname..HEAD.All this stuff is stored in git config variables, but you don\'t have to parse the git config output. If you invoke git config followed by the name of a variable, it will just print the value of that variable, no parsing required. With that in mind, here are some commands to get info about your current branch\'s tracking setup:In my case, since I\'m only interested in finding out the name of my current remote, I do this:The local branches and their remotes.All branches and tracking remotes.See where the local branches are explicitly configured for push and pull.I don\'t know if this counts as parsing the output of git config, but this will determine the URL of the remote that master is tracking:This will show you the branch you are on:This will show only the current branch you are on:for example:You can find out the URL of the remote that is used by the current branch you are on with:for example:Yet another wayThis will give youwill list all branches including remote.You can use git checkout, i.e. "check out the current branch". This is a no-op with a side-effects to show the tracking information, if exists, for the current branch.Another simple way is to usecat .git/config in a git repoThis will list details for local branchesAnother method (thanks osse), if you just want to know whether or not it exists:I use EasyGit (a.k.a. "eg") as a super lightweight wrapper on top of (or along side of) Git.  EasyGit has an "info" subcommand that gives you all kinds of super useful information, including the current branches remote tracking branch.  Here\'s an example (where the current branch name is "foo"):I use this aliasthennote that the script can also be used to setup tracking.More great aliases at https://github.com/orefalo/bash-profilesIf you are using gradle,``````Following command will remote origin current fork is referring to  git remote -v  For adding a remote path,  git remote add origin path_name
