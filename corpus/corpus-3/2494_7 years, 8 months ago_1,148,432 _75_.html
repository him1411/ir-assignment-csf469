How come this code throws anUncaught ReferenceError: $ is not definedwhen it was OK before?   Results in tabs don\'t close anymore.jQuery is referenced in the header:You should put the references to the jquery scripts first. Maybe you are calling the ready function before the JQuery Javascript is included?This is what solved it for me.  Originally I went to Google and copied and pasted their suggested snippet for jQuery on their CDN page: The snippet does not include the HTTP: or HTTPS: in the src attribute but my browser, FireFox, needed it so I changed it to:Then it worked.If your custom script is loaded before the jQuery plugin is loaded to the browser then this type of problem may occur. So, always keep your own JavaScript or jQuery code after calling the jQuery plugin so the solution for this is :First add the link to the jQuery file hosted at GoogleApis or a local jQuery file that you will download from http://jquery.com/download/ and host on your server:or any plugin for jQuery. Then put your custom script file link or code:In my case I was putting my .js file before the jQuery script link, putting the .js file after jQuery script link solved my issue.Okay, my problem was different - it was Document Security model in Chrome.Looking at the answers here, it was obvious that I was somehow not loading my jquery files before calling the $(document).ready() etc. functions. However, they were all in the correct positions.In my case, this was because I was accessing the content over a secure HTTPS connection, whereas the page was trying to download the CDN hosted data from google, etc. The solution was to store them locally and then include then directly rather than from the CDN each time.Edit: The other way of doing this is to link to all the CDN-hosted stuff as https:// rather than http:// - then the model doesn\'t complain.If it\'s in wordpress, might be needed to change toor addbeforei had the exact same problem and none of these solutions above helped.\nhowever, i just linked the .css files after the .js files and the problem miraculously disappeared. hope this helps.In my case I had this referenceError as the order of script calls was wrong. Solved that by changing the order:toAdd the library before you start the script.You can add any of these following CDN to start it.Google:MicrosoftJqueryIf you want any other Jquery cdn version check this link.After this:Wordpress:I am proably the only person who had my kind of problem but ill put it down anyway. I wanted to try to make my script asynchronous just for the fun of it. Then i forgot about it and when i went live the [custom].js file only loaded 50% of the time before the jQuery.js.So i changed to :)The source file jquery-1.2.6.min.js is not called the jQuery command $() is executed earlier than <..src=\'jquery-1.2.6.min.js\'>.Please run <.. src="/js/jquery-1.2.6.min.js.."> at first and make sure the src path is right, then execute jquery commandIf you are doing this in .Net and have the script file referenced properly and you jQuery looks fine, make sure that your users have access to the script file. The project I was working on (a coworker) had their web.config denying access to anonymous users. The page I was working on was accessible to anonymous users therefore they didn\'t have access to the script file. Dropped the following into the web.config and all was right in the world:Your JavaScript file is missing so this error occurred. Just add the JavaScript file inside the <head> tag. See the example:or add the following code in  tag :This happened to me before. The reason was that I\'m connecting android to a webview with a JS. And I sent a parameter without quotes.and when I changed it to it worked.In my case it was a typo, I forgot a backslash and was referencing the source incorrectly.Before src="/scripts/jquery.js"After    src="scripts/jquery.js"The error will occur in the following two scenarios as well.So 3 things to be followed - check required scripts are added, check if it is added in the required order and third syntax errors in your Java Script.Doh! I had mixed quotes in my  tags that caused the jquery reference to break.  Doing an inspect in Chrome allowed me to see that the file wasn\'t properly linked.In my case i forgot to include this :Earlier I was including just jquery-mobile which was causing this error.I had a similar issue and it was because I was missing a closing > on a style sheet link.Ok I admit this one was a really dumb thing that happend once to me. I modified the script tag to point to the right content and changed the script order to be the right one in the editor ... but totally forgot to save the change ;( You might laugh now but when you\'re tired all sort of strange problems might happen. I Strange enough, my problem was coming from PHP.A REST API call was failing, and it was breaking the loading of the libraries afterwards. Since failure was from the REST call, it was not giving me a php compile error.Keep this as an option also, if loading jquery seems ok.I had this issue, when I was browsing internet through my mobile hotspot. it was also compressing images and added the following script at the bottom of body tag When I connected to proper wifi connection, all seems to work find for me. Hope this help someone.I had similar issue.  My test server was working fine with  "http". However it failed in production which had SSL.Thus in production, I added "HTPPS" instead of "HTTP" and in test, i kept as it is  "HTTP".wp_register_script( \'jquery\', \'http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js\', array(), null, false );wp_register_script( \'custom-script\', plugins_url( \'/js/custom.js\', FILE ), array( \'jquery\' ) );wp_register_script( \'jquery\', \'https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js\', array(), null, false );wp_register_script( \'custom-script\', plugins_url( \'/js/custom.js\', FILE ), array( \'jquery\' ) );Hope this will help someone who is working on wordpress.This can also happen, if there is network issue. Which means, that even though the " jquery scripts " are in place, and are included prior to usage, since the jquery-scripts are not accessible, at the time of loading the page, hence the definitions to the "$" are treated as "undefined references".FOR TEST/DEBUG PURPOSES :: You can try to access the "jquery-script" url on browser. If it is accessible, your page, should load properly, else it will show the said error (or other script relevant errors). Example - http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js should be accessible, on the browser (or browser context stances).I had similar problem, in which I was able to load the html-page (using scripts) in my windows-host-browser, but was not able to load in vm-ubuntu. Solving the network issue, got the issue resolved.I have similar issue, and you know what, it\'s because of network is disconnected when I test in android device webview and I don\'t realize it, and the local js no problem to load because it doesn\'t need network. It seems ridiculous but it waste my ~1 hour to figure out it.Here is the worst case: Everything seemed perfect. After spending a couple of hours I realized that the jquery file which is added in the correct position was actually a file with empty content!Bitten by this once again, missing library source links. \nGoogle Hosted Libraries\nSimilar linkI had this problem in Fireox, and it was solved after i changed the name of the jQuery js file, from jquery_1.7.js in jquery1_7.js. So, i adeed only one dot, before extension.
