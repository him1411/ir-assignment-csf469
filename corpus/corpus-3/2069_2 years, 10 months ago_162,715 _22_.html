I get an error after updating from my last project. Not a problem in my code but I\'m having trouble with build.gradle. How can I fix it?build.gradle code here: Gradle Sync message output:If you are using version 0.14.0 or higher of the gradle plugin, you should replace "runProguard" with "minifyEnabled" in your build.gradle files.runProguard was renamed to minifyEnabled in version 0.14.0.
