In Eclipse, hovering over a method, variable, etc displays a tooltip with the corresponding JavaDocs. Is there such a feature in IntelliJ?For Intellij 13, there is a checkbox in Editor\'s page in IDE SettingsEDIT: For Intellij 14, the option has been moved to Editor > General page: its the last option in the "Other" group. (For Mac the option is under the menu "IntelliJ Idea" > "Preferences")EDIT: For Intellij 16, it\'s the second-to-last option in Editor > General > Other. EDIT: For Intellij Ultimate 2016.1, it\'s been moved to Editor > General > Code Completion. \nEDIT: (Using Intellij Ultimate 2017.2, aka Intellij IDEA 2017.2.3) There are actually two options:Up until IntelliJ version 11, no, not just by hovering over it. If the cursor is inside the method- or attribute name, then CTRL+Q will show the JavaDoc on *nix and Windows. On MacOSX, this is CTRL+J.Quote: "No, the only way to see the full javadoc is to use Quick Doc (Ctrl-Q)." -- http://devnet.jetbrains.net/thread/121174Since IntelliJ 12.1, this is possible. See @ADNow\'s answer.It is possible in 12.1.Find idea.properties in the BIN folder inside of wherever your IDE is installed, e.g. C:\\Program Files (x86)\\JetBrains\\IntelliJ\\binAdd a new line to the end of that file:Start IDEA and just hover your mouse over something:After doing CTRL+Q, you can Then when you move your cursor, the documentation will appear in this box.  It costs you a little screen real estate, but I find it\'s worth it.I\'d post a screenshot but SO won\'t let me post images.In Intellij13, you can use Editor configuration like below:\nFor Intellij 15, use the checkbox in File > Settings > Editor > General option Show quick documentation on mouse move.You can also get there by typing "quick" or something similar in the search box:Adding on to what ADNow said. On the Macintosh: Add the line:auto.show.quick.doc=trueIntelliJ IDEA 14.0.3 Ultimate: Press Ctrl+Alt+S, then choose Editor\\General choose Show quick domentation on mouse move\nTips: Look at the top right conner (gear icon) at JavaDoc pop-up window, You can choose:\n- Show Toolbar \n- Pinded Mode \n- Docked Mode \n- Floatting Mode \n- Split Mode \nIn IntelliJ IDEA 14, it has moved to: File -> Settings -> Editor -> General -> "Show quick doc on mouse move"IDEA has "find action":Open "Help" menu, type "doc", move cursor to "Quick Documentation" it will be highlighted.Also "find action" can be called from hot key (you can find it in settings->hotkeys)File-->Settings-->EditorCheck "Show quick doc on mouse"Now when you put the mouse over a method a tooltip with the documentation will appear. Sometimes the tooltip size is too small and you will have to resize it moving the mouse down to the bottom of the tooltip.On mac in IntelliJ Ultimate (trial) 14 I have mine under Settings > Editor > General > Code completion. The tooltip short is F1 on my laptop.It\'s called "Autopopup documentation in (ms):"The easiest way, at least for me, was:On my IntelliJ U on Mac I need to point with cursor on some method, variable etc. and press [cntrl] or [cmd] key. Then click on the link inside popup window which appeared to see JavaDocs A note for Android Studio (2.3.3 at least) users, because this page came up for my google search "android studio hover javadoc", and android studio is based on Intellij:See File->Settings->Editor->General: "show quick documentation on mouse moves",\nrather than File->Settings->Editor->General->Code Completion\n"Autopopup documentation in (ms) for explicitly invoked completion" \nand "Autopopup in (ms)", which has been previously talked about.
