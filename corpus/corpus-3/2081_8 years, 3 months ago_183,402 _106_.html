You can create various Java code templates in Eclipse via the e.g.sysout is expanded to:You can activate this by typing sysout followed by CTRL+SPACEWhat useful Java code templates do you currently use?\nInclude the name and description of it and why it\'s awesome.There\'s an open bounty on this for an original/novel use of a template rather than a built-in existing feature.The following code templates will both create a logger and create the right imports, if needed.SLF4JLog4J 2Log4JSource.JULSome additional templates here: Link I -\nLink III like this one:readfileUPDATE: The Java 7 version of this template is:MessageFormat - surround the selection with a MessageFormat.This lets me move a cursor to a string, expand the selection to the entire string (Shift-Alt-Up), then Ctrl-Space twice.lock - surround the selected lines with a try finally lock. Assume the presence of a lock variable.NB ${line_selection} templates show up in the Surround With menu (Alt-Shift-Z). I know I am kicking a dead post, but wanted to share this for completion sake:A correct version of singleton generation template, that overcomes the flawed double-checked locking design (discussed above and mentioned else where)Singleton Creation Template:\nName this createsingleton \nTo access singletons generated using above:Singleton reference Template:\nName this getsingleton: For log, a helpful little ditty to add in the member variable.Append code snippet to iterate over Map.entrySet():One of my beloved is foreach:And traceout, since I\'m using it a lot for tracking:I just thought about another one and have found it over the Internet some day, const:Create a mock with Mockito (in "Java statements" context):And in "Java type members":Mock a void method to throw an exception:\n    ${:import(org.mockito.invocation.InvocationOnMock,org.mockito.stubbing.Answer)}doThrow(${RuntimeException}.class).when(${mock:localVar}).${mockedMethod}(${args});Mock a void method to do something:Verify mocked method called exactly once:\n    ${:importStatic(org.mockito.Mockito.verify,org.mockito.Mockito.times)}verify(${mock:localVar}, times(1)).${mockMethod}(${args});Verify mocked method is never invoked:New linked list using Google Guava (and similar for hashset and hashmap):Also I use a huge template that generates a Test class. Here is a shortened fragment of it that everyone interested should customize:A little tip on sysout -- I like to renamed it to "sop". Nothing else in the java libs starts with "sop" so you can quickly type "sop" and boom, it inserts. Throw an IllegalArgumentException with variable in current scope (illarg):BetterNothing fancy for code production - but quite useful for code reviewsI have my template coderev low/med/high do the followingAnd then in the Tasks view - will show me all of the code review comments I want to bring up during a meeting.Some more templates here.Includes:Bean PropertyPropertyChangeSupportPost Java 7, a great way to set up loggers which need (or prefer) static references to the enclosing class is to use the newly introduced MethodHandles API to get the runtime class in a static context.An example snippet for SLF4J is:Aside from being a simple snippet in any IDE, it is also less brittle if you refactor certain functionality into another class because you won\'t accidentally carry the class name with it.Invoke code on the GUI threadI bind the following template to the shortcut slater to quickly dispatch code on the GUI thread.When testing around with code I sometimes missed out on deleting some syso s. So I made myself a template called syt. Before I compile I always check my TODOs and will never forget to delete a System.out again.strf -> String.format("msg", args) pretty simple but saves a bit of typing.Get an SWT color from current display:Suround with syncexecUse the singleton design pattern:And an equalsbuilder, hashcodebuilder adaptation:The template for the logger declaration is great.I also create linfo, ldebug, lwarn, lerror for the log levels that I use more often.lerror:Since events are kinda a pain to create in Java--all those interfaces, methods, and stuff to write just for 1 event--I made a simple template to create everything needed for 1 event.If you have events that share a single EventObject, just delete the customized one inserted by the template and change the appropriate parts of raise___() and on____().I had written a nice, little, elegant eventing mechanism using a generic interface and generic class, but it wouldn\'t work due to the way Java handles generics. =(Edit:\n1) I ran into the issue where threads were adding/removing listeners while an event was taking place. The List can\'t be modified while in use, so I added synchronized blocks where the list of listeners is being accessed or used, locking on the list itself.I saw a similar version to this one recently while pair programming with a very good developer and friend, and I think it could be a nice addition to this list.This template will create a new test method on a class, following the Given - When - Then approach from the behavior-driven development (BDD) paradigm on the comments, as a guide for structuring the code. It will start the method name with "should" and let you replace the rest of the dummy method name "CheckThisAndThat" with the best possible description of the test method responsibility. After filling the name, TAB will take you straight to the // Given section, so you can start typing your preconditions.I have it mapped to the three letters "tst", with description "Test methods should-given-when-then" ;)I hope you find it as useful as I did when I saw it:Here is a constructor for non-instantiable classes:This one is for custom exceptions:I like a generated class comment like this:The "I..." immediately encourages the developer to describe what the class does. I does seem to improve the problem of undocumented classes.And of course the $Id$ is a useful CVS keyword.Spring InjectionI know this is sort of late to the game, but here is one I use for Spring Injection in a  class:I\'ve had a lot of use of these snippets, looking for null values and empty strings.I use the "argument test"-templates as the first code in my methods to check received arguments.testNullArgumentYou may want to change the exception message to fit your company\'s or project\'s standard. However, I do recommend having some message that includes the name of the offending argument. Otherwise the caller of your method will have to look in the code to understand what went wrong. (A NullPointerException with no message produces an exception with the fairly nonsensical message "null").testNullOrEmptyStringArgumentYou can also reuse the null checking template from above and implement this snippet to only check for empty strings. You would then use those two templates to produce the above code.The above template, however, has the problem that if the in argument is final you will have to amend the produced code some (the ${varName} = ${varName}.trim() will fail).If you use a lot of final arguments and want to check for empty strings but doesn\'t have to trim them as part of your code, you could go with this instead:testNullFieldStateI also created some snippets for checking variables that is not sent as arguments (the big difference is the exception type, now being an IllegalStateException instead).testNullOrEmptyStringFieldStatetestArgumentThis is a general template for testing a variable. It took me a few years to really learn to appreciate this one, now I use it a lot (in combination with the above templates of course!)You enter a variable name or a condition that returns a value, followed by an operand ("==", "<", ">" etc) and another value or variable and if the test fails the resulting code will throw an IllegalArgumentException.The reason for the slightly complicated if clause, with the whole expression wrapped in a "!()" is to make it possible to reuse the test condition in the exception message.Perhaps it will confuse a colleague, but only if they have to look at the code, which they might not have to if you throw these kind of exceptions...Here\'s an example with arrays:You get this result by calling up the template, typing "from.length" [TAB] "== to.length".The result is way funnier than an "ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException" or similar and may actually give your users a chance to figure out the problem.Enjoy!I use this for MessageFormat (using Java 1.4).  That way I am sure that I have no concatenations that are hard to extract when doing internationalizationi18nAlso for logging:logMy favorite few are...1: Javadoc, to insert doc about the method being a Spring object injection method.2: Debug window, to create a FileOutputStream and write the buffer\'s content\'s to a file.\nUsed for when you want to compare a buffer with a past run (using BeyondCompare), or if you can\'t view the contents of a buffer (via inspect) because its too large...
