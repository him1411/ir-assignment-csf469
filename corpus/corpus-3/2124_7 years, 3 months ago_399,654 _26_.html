I would like to convert an array to a Set in Java. There are some obvious ways of doing this (i.e. with a loop) but I would like something a bit neater, something like:Any ideas?Like this:That\'s Collections.addAll(java.util.Collection, T...) from JDK 6.Additionally: what if our array is full of primitives?For JDK < 8, I would just write the obvious for loop to do the wrap and add-to-set in one pass.For JDK >= 8, an attractive option is something like:With Guava you can do:Java 8:After you do Arrays.asList(array) you can execute Set set = new HashSet(list);Here is a sample method, you can write:In Java 8 we have the option of using Stream as well. We can get stream in various ways:The source code of Collectors.toSet() shows that elements are added one by one to a HashSet but specification does not guarantee it will be a HashSet: "There are no guarantees on the type, mutability, serializability, or thread-safety of the Set returned." So it is better to use the later option. The output is:\n\n[A, B, C, D]\n[A, B, C, D]\n[A, B, C, D]Varargs will work too!In Eclipse Collections, the following will work:Note: I am a committer for Eclipse CollectionsQuickly : you can do :and to reverseI\'ve written the below from the advice above - steal it... it\'s nice!Sometime using some standard libraries helps a lot. Try to look at the Apache Commons Collections. In this case your problems is simply transformed to something like thisAnd here is the CollectionsUtils javadocthe output ischange it to the output isnew HashSet<Object>(Arrays.asList(Object[] a));But I think this would be more efficient:
