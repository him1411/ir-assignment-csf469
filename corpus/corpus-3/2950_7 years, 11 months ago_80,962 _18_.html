I\'m working on 2 different branches: release and development.\nI noticed I still need to integrate some changes that were committed to the release branch back into the development branch.\nThe problem is I don\'t need all of the commit, only some hunks in certain files, so a simple  does not do the trick.\nWhen I do aI can see the diff but don\'t really know a good way of applying that partially to my current working tree.\nAny suggestions would be very welcome!The core thing you\'re going to want here is git add -p (-p is a synonym for --patch). This provides an interactive way to check in content, letting you decide whether each hunk should go in, and even letting you manually edit the patch if necessary.To use it in combination with cherry-pick:(Thanks to Tim Henigan for reminding me that git-cherry-pick has a --no-commit option, and thanks to Felix Rabe for pointing out that you need to reset! If you only want to leave a few things out of the commit, you could use git reset <path>... to unstage just those files.)You can of course provide specific paths to add -p if necessary. If you\'re starting with a patch you could replace the cherry-pick with apply.If you really want a git cherry-pick -p <commit> (that option does not exist), your can useThat will diff the current commit against the commit you specify, and allow you to apply hunks from that diff individually. This option may be more useful if the commit you\'re pulling in has merge conflicts in part of the commit you\'re not interested in. (Note, however, that checkout differs from cherry-pick: checkout tries to apply <commit>\'s contents entirely, cherry-pick applies the diff of the specified commit from it\'s parent. This means that checkout can apply more than just that commit, which might be more than you want.)I know I\'m answering an old question, but it looks like there\'s a new way to do this with interactively checking out:Credit to Can I interactively pick hunks from another git commit?Assuming the changes you want are at the head of the branch you want the changes from, use git checkoutfor a single file :for multiple files just daisy chain :Building on Mike Monkiewicz answer you can also specify a single or more files to checkout from the supplied sha1/branch.This will allow you to interactively pick the changes you want to have applied to your current version of the file.If "partly cherry picking" means "within files, choosing some changes but discarding others", it can be done by bringing in git stash:Tip: if you give the stash of unwanted changes a name: git stash save --patch junk then if you forget to do (7) now, later you will recognize the stash for what it is.
