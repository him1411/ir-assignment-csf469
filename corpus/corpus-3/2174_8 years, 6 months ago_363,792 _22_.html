I have a table with a varchar column, and I would like to find all the records that have duplicate values in this column. What is the best query I can use to find the duplicates?Do a SELECT with a GROUP BY clause. Let\'s say name is the column you want to find duplicates in:This will return a result with the name value in the first column, and a count of how many times that value appears in the second.This query returns complete records, not just distinct varchar_column\'s.This query doesn\'t use COUNT(*). If there are lots of duplicates, COUNT(*) is expensive, and you don\'t need the whole COUNT(*), you just need to know if there are two rows with same value.Having an index on varchar_column will, of course, speed up this query greatly.Building off of levik\'s answer to get the IDs of the duplicate rows you can do a GROUP_CONCAT if your server supports it (this will return a comma separated list of ids).Assuming your table is named TableABC and the column which you want is Col and the primary key to T1 is Key.The advantage of this approach over the above answer is it gives the Key.To find how many records are duplicates in name column in Employee, the query below is helpful;The following will find all product_id that are used more than once. You only get a single record for each product_id.Code taken from : http://chandreshrana.blogspot.in/2014/12/find-duplicate-records-based-on-any.htmlI saw the above result and query will work fine if you need to check single column value which are duplicate. For example email.But if you need to check with more columns and would like to check the combination of the result so this query will work fine:Replace city with your Table. \nReplace name with your field nameFor removing duplicate rows with multiple fields , first cancate them to the new unique key which is specified for the only distinct rows, then use "group by" command to removing duplicate rows with the same new unique key:One very late contribution... in case it helps anyone waaaaaay down the line... I had a task to find matching pairs of transactions (actually both sides of account-to-account transfers) in a banking app, to identify which ones were the \'from\' and \'to\' for each inter-account-transfer transaction, so we ended up with this:The result is that the DuplicateResultsTable provides rows containing matching (i.e. duplicate) transactions, but it also provides the same transaction id\'s in reverse the second time it matches the same pair, so the outer SELECT is there to group by the first transaction ID, which is done by using LEAST and GREATEST to make sure the two transactionid\'s are always in the same order in the results, which makes it safe to GROUP by the first one, thus eliminating all the duplicate matches. Ran through nearly a million records and identified 12,000+ matches in just under 2 seconds. Of course the transactionid is the primary index, which really helped.My final query incorporated a few of the answers here that helped - combining group by, count & GROUP_CONCAT.This provides the id of both examples (comma separated), the barcode I needed, and how many duplicates.Change table and columns accordingly.Taking @maxyfc\'s answer further, I needed to find all of the rows that were returned with the duplicate values, so I could edit them in MySQL Workbench:
