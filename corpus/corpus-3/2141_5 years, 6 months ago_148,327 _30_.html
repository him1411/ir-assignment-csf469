If I\'m using terminal and typing in a line of text for a command, is there a hotkey or any way to clear/delete that line?For example, if my current line/command is something really long like:Is there a hotkey or command to go from the above to:?Usually I will press the ↓ key, and if my current line is a brand new one on the history, that will clear it.  But if I\'m going through my command history via the ↑ key and start editing or using those commands, ↓ will only change the prompt to the next newest command in history, so it doesn\'t work here unless I press ↓ multiple times.You can use Ctrl+U to clear up to the beginning.You can also use Ctrl+C to cancel.If you want to keep the history, you can use Alt+Shift+# to make it a comment.Bash Emacs Editing Mode Cheat SheetJust to summarise all the answersI have the complete shortcuts list: Ctrl+A, Ctrl+K to wipe the current line in the terminal. You can then recall it with Ctrl+Y if you need.or if your using vi mode, hit Esc followed by ccto get back what you just erased, Esc and then p :)I\'m not sure if you love it but I use Ctrl+A (to go beginning the line) and Ctrl+K (to delete the line) I was familiar with these commands from emacs, and figured out them accidently. An alternative to Ctrl+A, Ctrl+K is Ctrl+E, Ctrl+U.Ctrl+w: move characters and (multiple) words left from your cursor to a ring bufferCtrl+y: insert last entry from your ring buffer and then you can use Alt+y to rotate through your ring buffer. Press multiple times to continue to "previous" entry in ring buffer.Ctrl + W will clear the word to the left.CTRL+R and start typing to search for previous commands in history. Will show full lines.\nCTRL+R again to cycle.Add to the list:In Emacs mode, hit Esc, followed by R, will delete the whole line.I don\'t know why, just happens to find it. Maybe it\'s not used for delete line but happens to have the same effect. If someone knows, please tell me, thanks :)Works in Bash, but won\'t work in Fish.To delete the whole line no matter where the cursor is, you can use the kill-whole-line command, but it is unbound by default. It can be bound to, for example, Ctrl+Alt+K by insertinginto your Readline init file (conventionally ~/.inputrc).Various remarks:To avoid accidentally re-assigning a key sequence that is already in use for something else, you can check all your bindings with bind -P. Check for the suggested binding withJust to summarise all the answersHere I\'ll add 1 more important Command:
