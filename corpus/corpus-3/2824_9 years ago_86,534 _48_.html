For many questions the answer seems to be found in "the standard". However, where do we find that? Preferably online.Googling can sometimes feel futile, again especially for the C standards, since they are drowned in the flood of discussions on programming forums.To get this started, since these are the ones I am searching for right now, where are there good online resources for:As of 1st September 2014, the best locations by price for C and C++ standards documents in PDF are:C++98 – ISO/IEC 14882:1998: $90 NZD (about $60 US) from Standards New ZealandC11 – ISO/IEC 9899:2011: $30 $60 from ansi.org / WG14 draft version N1570You cannot usually get old revisions of a standard (any standard) directly from the standards bodies shortly after a new edition of the standard is released.  Thus, standards for C89, C90, C99, C++98, C++03 will be hard to find for purchase from a standards body.  If you need an old revision of a standard, check Techstreet as one possible source.  For example, it can still provide the Canadian version CAN/CSA-ISO/IEC 9899:1990 standard in PDF, for a fee.Print copies of the standards are available from national standards bodies and ISO but are very expensive.If you want a hardcopy of the C90 standard for much less money than above, you may be able to find a cheap used copy of Herb Schildt\'s book The Annotated ANSI Standard at Amazon, which contains the actual text of the standard (useful) and commentary on the standard (less useful).The C99 and C++03 standards are available in book form from Wiley and the BSI (British Standards Institute):The working draft for future standards is often available from the committee websites:Note that these documents are not the same as the standard, though the versions just prior to the meetings that decide on a standard are usually very close to what is in the final standard.  The FCD (Final Committee Draft) versions are password protected; you need to be on the standards committee to get them.However, in my opinion, even though the draft versions might be very close to the final ratified versions of the standards, you should really get a copy of the actual documents \xe2\x80\x94 especially if you\'re planning on quoting them as references.  Of course, starving students should go ahead and use the drafts if strapped for cash.It appears that, if you are willing and able to wait a few months after ratification of a standard, to search for "INCITS/ISO/IEC" instead of "ISO/IEC" when looking for a standard is the key. This way I was able to find the C++11 standard at reasonable price and now the C11 standard. So, as an example you search for "INCITS/ISO/IEC 9899:2011" instead of "ISO/IEC 9899:2011" on webstore.ansi.org and you will find the reasonably priced PDF version.Online versions of the standard can be found:The following all draft versions of the standard:\nAll the following are freely downloadable\n2017-03-21: N4659 git\n2017-02-06: N4640 git\n2016-11-28: N4618 git\n2016-07-12: N4606 git\n2016-05-30: N4594 git\n2016-03-19: N4582 git\n2015-11-09: N4567 git\n2015-05-22: N4527 git\n2015-04-10: N4431 git\n2014-11-19: N4296 git This seems to be the new standard:\nThese version requires Authentication\n2014-10-07: N4140 git Essentially C++14 with minor errors and typos corrected\n2014-09-02: N4141 git Standard C++14\n2014-03-02: N3937\n2014-03-02: N3936 gitThe following all draft versions of the standard:\nAll the following are freely downloadable\n2013-10-13: N3797 git\n2013-05-16: N3691\n2013-05-15: N3690\n2012-11-02: N3485\n2012-02-28: N3376\n2012-01-16: N3337 git Essentially C++11 with minor errors and typos corrected  This seems to be the new standard:\nThis version requires Authentication\n2011-04-05: N3291  C++11 (Or Very Close)The following all draft versions of the standard:\nAll the following are freely downloadable\n2011-02-28: N3242  (differences from N3291 very minor)\n2010-11-27: N3225\n2010-08-21: N3126\n2010-03-29: N3090\n2010-02-16: N3035\n2009-11-09: N3000\n2009-09-25: N2960\n2009-06-22: N2914\n2009-03-23: N2857\n2008-10-04: N2798\n2008-08-25: N2723\n2008-06-27: N2691\n2008-05-19: N2606\n2008-03-17: N2588\n2008-02-04: N2521\n2007-10-22: N2461\n2007-08-06: N2369\n2007-06-25: N2315\n2007-05-07: N2284\n2006-11-03: N2134\n2006-04-21: N2009\n2005-10-19: N1905\n2005-04-27: N1804 All the below versions require Authentication\n2004-11-05: N1733\n2004-07-16: N1655 Unofficial\n2004-02-07: N1577 C++03 (Or Very Close)\n2001-09-13: N1316 Draft Expanded Technical Corrigendum\n1997-00-00: N1117   Draft Expanded Technical Corrigendum  All the following are freely downloadable\n1996-00-00: N0836  Draft Expanded Technical Corrigendum\n1995-00-00: N0785 Working Paper for Draft Proposed International Standard for Information Systems - Programming Language C++  2017 /\n2016 /\n2015 /\n2014 /\n2013 /\n2012 /\n2011 C99 is available online. Quoted from www.open-std.org:The lastest publically available version of the standard is the\n  combined C99 + TC1 + TC2 + TC3, WG14 N1256, dated 2007-09-07. This is\n  a WG14 working paper, but it reflects the consolidated standard at the\n  time of issue.Draft Links:C++11 N3337 (or N3242)  C11 N1570 (text)C99 N1256Drafts of the Standard are circulated for comment prior to ratification and publication.Note that a working draft is not the standard currently in force, and it is not exactly the published standardYou might find the draft international standard for C++0x useful.ISO standards cost money, from a moderate amount (for a PDF version), to a bit more (for a book version).While they aren\'t finalised however, they can usually be found online, as drafts. Most of the times the final version doesn\'t differ significantly from the last draft, so while not perfect, they\'ll suit just fine.The C99 and C++03 standards are available in book form from Wiley:Plus, as already mentioned, the working draft for future standards is often available from the committee websites:The C-201x draft is available as N1336, and the C++0x draft as N3225. The actual standards documents may not be the most useful.  Most compilers do not fully implement the standards and may sometimes actually conflict.  So the compiler documentation that you would already have will be more useful.  Additionally, the documentation will contain platform-specific remarks and notes on any caveats.The ISO C and C++ standards are bloody expensive. On the other hand, the INCITS republishes them for a lot less. http://www.techstreet.com/ seems to have the PDF for $30\n(search for INCITS/ISO/IEC 14882:2003).Hardcopy versions are available, too. Look for the British Standards Institute versions, published by Wiley.The text of a draft of the ANSI C standard (aka C.89) is available online. This was standardized by the ANSI committee prior to acceptance by the ISO C Standard (C.90), so the numbering of the sections differ (ANSI sections 2 through 4 correspond roughly to ISO sections 5 through 7), although the content is (supposed to be) largely identical. Although not an actual standard, there is an amendment to ISO C (C89/90) called C94/95, or Normative Addendum 1. It was integrated into C99, although some compilers such as Clang allow you to specifiy -std=c94 on the command line. ISO/IEC 9899:1990/Amd 1:1995 can be purchased for a hefty price from SAI GLOBAL (PDF or hard copy).A summary of the document can be found here.When the (then draft) ANSI C Standard was being considered for\n  adoption of an International Standard in 1990, there were several\n  objections because it didn\'t address internationalization issues. \n  Because the Standard had already been several years in the making, it\n  was agreed that a few changes would be made to provide the basis (for\n  example, the functions in subclause 7.10.7 were added), and work would\n  be carried out separately to provide proper internationalization of\n  the Standard.  This work has culminated in Normative Addendum 1.Normative Addendum 1 embodies C\'s reaction to both the limitations and\n  promises of international character sets.  Digraphs and the \n  header were meant to improve the appearance of C programs written in\n  national variants of ISO 646 without, e.g., { or } characters.  On the\n  other end of the spectrum, the facilities connected to  and\n   extend the old Standard\'s barely adequate basis into a\n  complete and consistent set of utilities for handling wide characters\n  and multibyte strings.This document summarizes Normative Addendum 1.  It is intended to\n  quickly inform readers who are already familiar with the Standard; it\n  does not, and cannot, introduce the complex subject matter behind NA1,\n  nor can it replace the original document as a reference manual. \n  (Nevertheless, it tries to be as accurate as possible, and its author\n  would like to hear about any errors or omissions.)http://c0x.coding-guidelines.com/ contains a searchable, HTML-based version of the C standard. Actually, a slightly modified version:This web site contains a modified version of N1256. It includes\n  wording that has been deleted from C99 (i.e., in struck through form)\n  and wording that does used to appear in C99 (i.e., in underlined\n  form).
