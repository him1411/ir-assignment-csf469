How do I run a PowerShell script?which returns exactly nothing, except that the file name is output.\nNo error, no message, nothing. Oh, when I add -noexit, the same thing happens, but I remain within PowerShell and have to exit manually.The ps1 file is supposed to run a program, and return the error level dependent on that program\'s output. But I\'m quite sure I\'m not even getting there yet.What am I doing wrong?Navigate to the directory where the script livesExecute the script:What am I missing??Or: you can run the PowerShell script from cmd.exe like this:according to this blog post hereOr you could even run your Powershell script from your C# app :-) Asynchronously execute PowerShell scripts from your C# applicationIf you are on PowerShell 2.0 use PowerShell.exe\'s -File parameter to invoke a script from another environment like cmd.exe e.g.:If you want to run a script without modifying the default script execution policy, you can use the bypass switch when launching Windows PowerShell.  Type:powershell -executionpolicy bypass -File .\\Test.ps1NOTE:  Here Test.ps1 is the PowerShell script.I\'ve had the same problem, and I tried and tried... Finally I used:And put this line in a batch-file, and this works.If you only have PowerShell 1.0, this seems to do the trick well enough:It pipes the script file to the PowerShell command line.Using cmd (BAT) file:If you need run as administrator:Give the path of the script, that is, path setting by cmd:$> . c:\\program file\\prog.ps1Run the entry point function of PowerShell:For example, $> add or entry_func or mainAn easy way is to use PowerShell ISE, open script, run and invoke your script, function...Pretty easy. Right click the .ps1 file in Windows and in the shell menu click on Run with PowerShell.If your script is named with the .ps1 extension and you\'re in a PowerShell window, you just run ./myscript.ps1 (assuming the file is in your working directory).This is true for me anyway on Windows 10 with PowerShell version 5.1 anyway, and I don\'t think I\'ve done anything to make it possible.
