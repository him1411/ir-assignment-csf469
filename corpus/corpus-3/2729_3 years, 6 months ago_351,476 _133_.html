I just cloned a git repository and checked out a branch. I worked on it, and then decided to remove all my local changes, as I wanted the original copy.In short, I had to do the following two commands to remove my local changesMy question is,(1) Is this the correct approach in getting rid of local changes, or else please let me know the correct approach.(2) when do we use git reset --hard as i am able to reset even without this commandThanks*Solution : Major Edit(s): 03/26 : * \nReplaced many of vague terms with git specific terminology\n [tracked/untracked/staged/unstaged]There could be only three categories of files when we make local changes:Type 1. Staged Tracked filesType 2. Unstaged Tracked filesType 3. Unstaged UnTracked files a.k.a UnTracked filesWhat each commands do:git checkout . - Removes Unstaged Tracked files ONLY [Type 2]git clean -f - Removes Unstaged UnTracked files ONLY [Type 3]git reset --hard - Removes Staged Tracked and UnStaged Tracked files ONLY[Type 1, Type 2]git stash -u - Removes all changes [Type 1, Type 2, Type 3]Conclusion:It\'s clear that we can use either ORto achieve the desired result.Note: Stashing, as the word means \'Store (something) safely and secretly in a specified place.\' This can always be retrieved using git stash pop.\nSo choosing between the above two options is developer\'s call.Thank you Christoph and Frederik Sch\xc3\xb8ning.Edit: 03/27I thought it\'s worth putting the \'beware\' note to git clean -fgit clean -fThere is no going back. Use -n or --dry-run to preview the damage you\'ll do.If you want to also remove directories, run git clean -f -dIf you just want to remove ignored files, run git clean -f -XIf you want to remove ignored as well as non-ignored files, run git clean -f -xreference : more on git clean : How to remove local (untracked) files from the current Git working tree?Edit: 05/20/15Discarding all local commits on this branch [Removing local commits]In order to discard all local commits on this branch, to make the local branch identical \nto the "upstream" of this branch, simply run git reset --hard @{u}Reference: http://sethrobertson.github.io/GitFixUm/fixup.htmlor do git reset --hard origin/master [if local branch is master]Note: 06/12/2015\nThis is not a duplicate of the other SO question that\'s marked as duplicate.

Start out by reading the post in Ube\'s link. But to attempt an answer:Hard resetcompletely remove all staged and unstaged changes to tracked files.I find myself often using hard resetting, when I\'m like "just undo everything like if I had done a complete re-clone from the remote". In your case, where you just want your repo pristine, this would work.CleanRemove files that are not tracked.For removing temporary files, but keep staged and unstaged changes to already tracked files. Most times, I would probably end up making an ignore-rule instead of repeatedly cleaning - e.g. for the bin/obj folders in a C# project, which you would usually want to exclude from your repo to save space, or something like that.The -f (force) option will also remove files, that are not tracked and are also being ignored by git though ignore-rule. In the case above, with an ignore-rule to never track the bin/obj folders, even though these folders are being ignored by git, using the force-option will remove them from your file system. I\'ve sporadically seen a use for this, e.g. when scripting deployment, and you want to clean your code before deploying, zipping or whatever.Git clean will not touch files, that are already being tracked.Checkout "dot"I had actually never seen this notation before reading your post. I\'m having a hard time finding documentation for this (maybe someone can help), but from playing around a bit, it looks like it means:"undo all changes in my working tree".I.e. undo unstaged changes in tracked files. It apparently doesn\'t touch staged changes and leaves untracked files alone.StashingSome answers mention stashing. As the wording implies, you would probably use stashing when you are in the middle of something (not ready for a commit), and you have to temporarily switch branches or somehow work on another state of your code, later to return to your "messy desk". I don\'t see this applies to your question, but it\'s definitely handy.To sum upGenerally, if you are confident you have committed and maybe pushed to a remote important changes, if you are just playing around or the like, using git reset --hard HEAD followed by git clean -f will definitively cleanse your code to the state, it would be in, had it just been cloned and checked out from a branch. It\'s really important to emphasize, that the resetting will also remove staged, but uncommitted changes. It will wipe everything that has not been committed (except untracked files, in which case, use clean).All the other commands are there to facilitate more complex scenarios, where a granularity of "undoing stuff" is needed :)I feel, your question #1 is covered, but lastly, to conclude on #2: the reason you never found the need to use git reset --hard was that you had never staged anything. Had you staged a change, neither git checkout . nor git clean -f would have reverted that.Hope this covers.As with everything in git there are multiple ways of doing it. The two commands you used are one way of doing it. Another thing you could have done is simply stash them with git stash -u. The -u makes sure that newly added files (untracked) are also included.The handy thing about git stash -u is thatAs of your other question git reset --hard won\'t remove the untracked files so you would still need the git clean -f. But a git stash -u might be the most convenient.Reason for adding an answer at this moment: So far I was adding the conclusion and \xe2\x80\x98answers\xe2\x80\x99 to my initial question itself, making the question very lengthy, hence moving to separate answer, so that I can add more used git commands as well as add more commands that helps me on git, to help someone else too.#check status#create a new local branch#commit local changes [two step process:- Add the file to the index, that means adding to the staging area. Then commit the files that are present in this staging area]#checkout some other local branch#remove all changes in local branch [Suppose you made some changes in local branch like adding new file or modifying existing file, or making a local commit, but no longer need that]\ngit clean -d -f and git reset --hard  [clean all local changes made to the local branch except if local commit]git stash -u  also removes all changes Note:\nIt\'s clear that we can use either\n(1) combination of git clean \xe2\x80\x93d \xe2\x80\x93f and git reset --hard \nOR\n(2) git stash -u\nto achieve the desired result.Note 1: Stashing, as the word means \'Store (something) safely and secretly in a specified place.\' This can always be retreived using git stash pop. So choosing between the above two options is developer\'s call.Note 2: git reset --hard will delete working directory changes.
