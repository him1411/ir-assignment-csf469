The above code opens a dialog showing following apps:- Bluetooth, Google Docs, Yahoo Mail, Gmail, Orkut, Skype etc.Actually, I want to filter these list-options. I want to show only email related apps e.g. Gmail, Yahoo Mail. How to do it?I\'ve seen such example on \'Android Market\' application. The dialog shows only email Apps e.g. Gmail, Yahoo Mail etc. It does not show Bluetooth, Orkut etc. What code produces such dialog?Please provide an answer, so I can increase my \'accept rate\'. ;)when you will change your  intent.setType like below you will getUse android.content.Intent.ACTION_SENDTO (new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SENDTO);) to get only the list of e-mail clients, with no facebook or other apps. Just the email clients.I wouldn\'t suggest you get directly to the email app. Let the user choose his favorite email app. Don\'t constrain him.If you use ACTION_SENDTO, putExtra does not work to add subject and text to the intent. Use Uri to add the subject and body text.EDIT:\nWe can use message/rfc822 instead of "text/plain" as the MIME type. However, that is not indicating "only offer email clients" -- it indicates "offer anything that supports message/rfc822 data". That could readily include some application that are not email clients. message/rfc822 supports MIME Types of .mhtml, .mht, .mimeThe accepted answer doesn\'t work on the 4.1.2. This should work on all platforms: Hope this helps. Update: According to marcwjj, it seems that on 4.3, we need to pass string array instead of a string for email address to make it work. We might need to add one more line: Ref linkThere are three main approaches:1. Custom Uri:2. Using Intent extras:3. Support Library ShareCompat:This is quoted from Android official doc, I\'ve tested it on Android 4.4, and works perfectly. See more examples at https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-common.html#EmailA late answer, although I figured out a solution which could help othersThis was my output (Gmail + Inbox and nothing else)I got this solution from Google Developers siteTry: If you want only the email clients you should use android.content.Intent.EXTRA_EMAIL with an array. Here goes an example:The following code works for me fine.This was the only way I found at the time to get it to work with any characters.doreamon\'s answer is the correct way to go now, as it works with all characters in new versions of Gmail.Old answer:Here is mine. It seems to works on all Android versions, with subject and message body support, and full utf-8 characters support:This works for me:i.e. use the ACTION_SENDTO action rather than the ACTION_SEND action. I\'ve tried it on a couple of Android 4.4 devices and it limits the chooser pop-up to only display email applications (Email, Gmail, Yahoo Mail etc) and it correctly inserts the email address and subject into the email.None of these solutions were working for me. Here\'s a minimal solution that works on Lollipop. On my device, only Gmail and the native email apps appear in the resulting chooser list.Following Code worked for me!!Works on All android Versions:This works for me perfectly fine:If you want to ensure that your intent is handled only by an email app (and not other text messaging or social apps), then use the ACTION_SENDTO action and include the "mailto:" data scheme. For example:I found this in https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-common.html#EmailFinally come up with best way to doMaybe you should try this: intent.setType("plain/text");I found it here. I\'ve used it in my app and it shows only E-Mail and Gmail options.Use this:use build gradle :This is what I use, and it works for me:This will also let the user choose their preferred email app. The only thing this does not allow you to do is to set the recipient\'s email address.This is the way to do it according to Android Developer Docs\nadd these lines of code to your app: If you want to add the body and subject, add thisCompose an email in the phone email client:This code is working in my device
