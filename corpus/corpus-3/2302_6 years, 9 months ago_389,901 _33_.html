I have the following folder structure.application/app/folder/file.pyand I want to import some functions from file.py in another Python file which resides inapplication/app2/some_folder/some_file.pyI\'ve triedfrom application.app.folder.file import func_nameand some other various attempts but so far I couldn\'t manage to import properly. How can I do this?By default, you can\'t. When importing a file, Python only searches the current directory, the directory that the entry-point script is running from, and sys.path which includes locations such as the package installation directory (it\'s actually a little more complex than this, but this covers most cases).However, you can add to the Python path at runtime:Nothing wrong with:Just make sure folder also contains an __init__.py, this allows it to be included as a package. Not sure why the other answers talk about PYTHONPATH.Since your question looks *nix specific, I think a clean way would be to use the environment variableas described in the documentation:\nPython2, Python3When modules are in parallel locations, as in the question:This shorthand makes one module visible to the other:From what I know,  add an __init__.py file directly in the folder of the functions you want  to  import  will do  the job.Worked for me in python3 on linuxConsidering application as the root directory for your python project, create empty \'init.py\' in application, app and folder folders. Then in your some_file.py make changes as follows to get the definition of func_name:-This works for me on windows If the purpose of loading a module from a specific path is to assist you during the development of a custom module, you can create a symbolic link in the same folder of the test script that points to the root of the custom module. This module reference will take precedence over any other modules installed of the same name for any script run in that folder.I tested this on Linux but it should work in any modern OS that supports symbolic links.One advantage to this approach is that you can you can point to a module that\'s sitting in your own local SVC branch working copy which can greatly simplify the development cycle time and reduce failure modes of managing different versions of the module.I\'m quite special : I use Python with Windows !I just complete information : for both Windows and Linux, both relative and absolute path work into sys.path (I need relative paths because I use my scripts on the several PCs and under different main directories).  And when using Windows both \\ and / can be used as separator for file names and of course you must double \\ into Python strings,\nsome valid examples :(note : I think that / is more convenient than \\, event if it is less \'Windows-native\' because it is Linux-compatible and simpler to write and copy to Windows explorer)Your problem is that Python is looking in the Python directory for this file and not finding it. You must specify that you are talking about the directory that you are in and not the Python one.To do this you change this:from application.app.folder.file import func_nameto this:By adding the dot you are saying look in this folder for the application folder instead of looking in the Python directory.(Hope this fixes your problem!)You can refresh the Python shell by pressing f5, or go to Run-> Run Module. This way you don\'t have to change the directory to read something from the file. Python will automatically change the directory. But if you want to work with different files from different directory in the Python Shell, then you can change the directory in sys, as Cameron said earlier.
