I\'m executing an external script, using a <script> inside <head>.Now since the script executes before the page has loaded, I can\'t access the <body>, among other things. I\'d like to execute some JavaScript after the document has been "loaded" (HTML fully downloaded and in-RAM). Are there any events that I can hook onto when my script executes, that will get triggered on page load?These solutions will work:oror evenNote that the last option is a better way to go since it is unobstrusive and is considered more standard.Reasonably portable, non-framework way of having your script set a function to run at load time:You can put a "onload" attribute inside the bodyOr if you are using jQuery, you can do I hope it answer your question.Note that the $(window).load will execute after the document is rendered on your page.Exectues after DOM is loaded (before img and css are parsed): Exectues after everything is loaded and parsed: If the scripts are loaded within the <head> of the document, then it\'s possible use the defer attribute in script tag.Example:From w3schools:Definition and Usage The defer attribute is a boolean attribute.When present, it specifies that the script is executed when the page\n  has finished parsing.Note: The defer attribute is only for external scripts (should only be\n  used if the src attribute is present).Note: There are several ways an external script can be executed:If async is present: The script is executed asynchronously with the\n  rest of the page (the script will be executed while the page continues\n  the parsing) If async is not present and defer is present: The script\n  is executed when the page has finished parsing If neither async or\n  defer is present: The script is fetched and executed immediately,\n  before the browser continues parsing the pageHere\'s a script based on deferred js loading after the page is loaded,Where do I place this?Paste code in your HTML just before the </body> tag (near the bottom of your HTML file). What does it do?This code says wait for the entire document to load, then load the\n   external file deferredfunctions.js.Here\'s an example of the above code - Defer Rendering of JSI wrote this based on defered loading of javascript pagespeed google concept and also sourced from this article Defer loading javascriptLook at hooking document.onload or in jQuery $(document).load(...).Best method, recommended by Google also. :)http://www.feedthebot.com/pagespeed/defer-loading-javascript.htmlWorking FiddleIf you are using jQuery, $(function() {...}); is equivalent to $(document).ready(function () { })See What event does JQuery $function() fire on?look here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ms536957(v=vs.85).aspxJust define <body onload="aFunction()"> that will be called after the page has been loaded. Your code in the script is than enclosed by aFunction() { }.Using the YUI library (I love it):Portable and beautiful! However, if you don\'t use YUI for other stuff (see its doc) I would say that it\'s not worth to use it.N.B. : to use this code you need to import 2 scriptsThis code works well.But window.onload method has various dependencies. So it may not work all the time.I find sometimes on more complex pages that not all the elements have loaded by the time window.onload is fired. If that\'s the case, add setTimeout before your function to delay is a moment. It\'s not elegant but it\'s a simple hack that renders well.becomes...My advise use asnyc attribute for script tag thats help you to load the external scripts after page load Readmore => Run javascript after page load There is a very good documentation on How to detect if document has loaded using Javascript or Jquery.Using the native Javascript this can be achievedThis can also be done inside the intervalEg By MozillaUsing Jquery\nTo check only if DOM is readyTo check if all resources are loaded use window.loadAs Daniel says, you could use document.onload.The various javascript frameworks hwoever (jQuery, Mootools, etc.) use a custom event \'domready\', which I guess must be more effective.  If you\'re developing with javascript, I\'d highly recommend exploiting a framework, they massively increase your productivity.jQuery wrappers that for you.  You\'ll probably find it to be the easiest solution.//It\'s tested and working :)$(document).ready(function() {\n  functon1(); \n  function2()\n});
