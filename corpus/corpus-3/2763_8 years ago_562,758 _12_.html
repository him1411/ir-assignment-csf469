Is there any way to run command prompt commands from within a C# application?  If so how would I do the following:This basically embeds an RAR file within JPG image.  I was just wondering if there was a way to do this automatically in C#.  Thank you.this is all you have to do run shell commands from C#EDIT:This is to hide the cmd window.Tried @RameshVel solution but I could not pass arguments in my console application. If anyone experiences the same problem here is a solution:Yes, there is (see link in Matt Hamilton\'s comment), but it would be easier and better to use .NET\'s IO classes. You can use File.ReadAllBytes to read the files and then File.WriteAllBytes to write the "embedded" version.Though technically this doesn\'t directly answer question posed, it does answer the question of how to do what the original poster wanted to do: combine files.  If anything, this is a post to help newbies understand what Instance Hunter and Konstantin are talking about.This is the method I use to combine files (in this case a jpg and a zip).  Note that I create a buffer that gets filled with the content of the zip file (in small chunks rather than in one big read operation), and then the buffer gets written to the back of the jpg file until the end of the zip file is reached:Here is little simple and less code version. It will hide the console window too-None of the above answers helped for some reason, it seems like they sweep errors under the rug and make troubleshooting one\'s command difficult.  So I ended up going with something like this, maybe it will help someone else:with a reference to Microsoft.VisualBasic
