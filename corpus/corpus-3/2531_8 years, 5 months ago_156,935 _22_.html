When I create and compile a "hello world" application in C#, I get three files in the Debug folder apart from the main exe (e.g. HelloWorld.exe)What purpose do these files serve?The vshost.exe feature was introduced with VS2005 (to answer your comment).The purpose of it is mostly to make debugging launch quicker - basically there\'s already a process with the framework running, just ready to load your application as soon as you want it to.See this MSDN article and this blog post for more information..exe - the \'normal\' executable.vshost.exe - a special version of the executable to aid debuging; see MSDN for details.pdb - the Program Data Base with debug symbols.vshost.exe.manifest - a kind of configuration file containing mostly dependencies on librariesThe vshost.exe file is the executable run by Visual Studio (visual studio host executable). This is the executable that links to Visual Studio and improves debugging.When you\'re distributing your application to others, you do not use the vshost.exe or .pdb (debug database) files. I\'m not sure, but I believe it is a debugging optimization. However, I usually turn it off (see Debug properties for the project) and I don\'t notice any slowdown and I see no limitations when it comes to debugging, so it is certainly not needed for debugging as stated by Guard.Adding on, you can turn off the creation of vshost files for your Release build configuration and have it enabled for Debug.StepsReferenceExcerpt from MSDN How to: Disable the Hosting ProcessCalls to certain APIs can be affected when the hosting process is enabled. In these cases, it is necessary to disable the hosting process to return the correct results.To disable the hosting processWhen the hosting process is disabled, several debugging features are unavailable or experience decreased performance. For more information, see Debugging and the Hosting Process.In general, when the hosting process is disabled:It seems to be a long-running framework process for debugging (to decrease load times?). I discovered that when you start your application twice from the debugger often the same vshost.exe process will be used. It just unloads all user-loaded DLLs first. This does odd things if you are fooling around with API hooks from managed processes.
