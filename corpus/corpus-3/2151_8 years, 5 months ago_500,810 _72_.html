I have a <div> block with some fancy visual content that I don\'t want to change. I want to make it a clickable link.I\'m looking for something like <a href="\xe2\x80\xa6"><div> \xe2\x80\xa6 </div></a>, but that is valid XHTML 1.1.Came here in the hope of finding a better solution that mine, but I don\'t like any of the ones on offer here. I think some of you have misunderstood the question. The OP wants to make a div full of content behave like a link. One example of this would be facebook ads - if you look, they\'re actually proper markup.For me the no-nos are: javascript (shouldn\'t be needed just for a link, and very bad SEO/accessibility); invalid HTML.In essence it\'s this:apply the following CSS to the empty span:It will now cover the panel, and as it\'s inside an <A> tag, it\'s a clickable linkYou can\'t make the div a link itself, but you can make an <a> tag act as a block, the same behaviour a <div> has.You can then set the width and height on it.This is an ancient question, but I thought I\'d answer it since everyone here has some crazy solutions. It\'s actually very very simple...An anchor tag works like this - Sooo...Although I\'m not sure if this is valid. If that\'s the reasoning behind spoken solutions, then I apologise...Requires a little javascript.\nBut, your div would be clickable.This option doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require an empty.gif as in the most upvoted answer:HTML:CSS:As proposed at http://www.digitalskydesign.com/how-to-make-an-entire-div-a-link-using-css/This is a "valid" solution to achieving what you want.But most-likely what you really want is to have an <a> tag displayed as a block level element.I would not advise using JavaScript to simulate a hyperlink as that defeats the purpose of markup validation, which is ultimately to promote accessibility (publishing well-formed documents following proper semantic rules minimizes the possibility the same document will be interpreted differently by different browsers).It would be preferable to publish a web page that does not validate, but renders and functions properly on all browsers, including ones with JavaScript disabled. Furthermore, using onclick does not provide the semantic information for a screen reader to determine that the div is functioning as a link.Not sure if this is valid but it worked for me.The code :To make thepeer\'s answer work in IE 7 and forward, it needs a few tweaks.IE will not honour z-index if the element is has no background-color, so the link will not overlap parts of the containig div that has content, only the blank parts. To fix this a background is added with opacity 0.For some reason IE7 and various compatibility modes completely fail when using the span in a link approach. However if the link itself is given the style it works just fine.The cleanest way would be to use jQuery with the data-tags introduced in HTML. With this solution you can create a link on every tag you want. First define the tag (e.g. div) with a data-link tag:Now you can style the div however you want. And you have to create also the style for the "link"-alike behavior:And at last put this jQuery call to the page:With this code jQuery applys a click listener to every tag on the page which has a "data-link" attribute and redirects to the URL which is in the data-link attribute.you could also try by wrapping an anchor, then turning its height and width to be the same with its parent. This works for me perfectly.This post is Old I know but I just had to fix the same issue because simply writing  a normal link tag with the display set to block does not make the whole div clickable in IE. so to fix this issue far simpler than having to use JQuery. Firstly let us understand why this happens: IE wont make an empty div clickable it only make the text/image within that div/a tag clickable.Solution: Fill the div with a bakground image and hide it from the viewer.How?\nYou ask good questions, now listen up.\nadd this backround style to the a tag And there you have it the whole div is now clickable. This was the best way for me cause Im using it for my Photo Gallery to let the user clik on one half of the image to move left/right and then place a small image as well just for visual effects. so for me I used the left and right images as background images anyway!why not? use <a href="bla"> <div></div> </a> works fine in HTML5Just have the link in the block and enhance it with jquery. It degrades 100% gracefully for anyone without javascript. Doing this with html isn\'t really the best solution imho.\nFor example:Then use jquery to make the block clickable (via web designer wall):Then all you have to do is add cursor styles to the divFor bonus points only apply these styles if javascript is enabled by adding a \'js_enabled\' class to the div, or the body, or whatever.This example worked for me:Actually you need to include the JavaScript code at the moment,\ncheck this tutorial to do so.but there is a tricky way to achieve this using a CSS code\nyou must nest an anchor tag inside your div tag and you must apply this property to it,when you\'ve done that,it will make the whole width area clickable (but within the height of the anchor tag),if you want to cover the whole div area you must set the height of the anchor tag exactly to the height of the div tag,for example:this is gonna make the whole area clickable,then you can apply text-indent:-9999px to anchor tag to achieve the goal.this is really tricky and simple and it\'s just created using CSS code.here is an example: http://jsfiddle.net/hbirjand/RG8wW/While I don\'t recommend doing this under any circumstance, here is some code that makes a DIV into a link (note: this example uses jQuery and certain markup is removed for simplicity):Once again, I wouldn\'t do this so please don\'t vote me down.  I am simply just trying to answer the question.This work for me:You can give a link to your div by following method:You can make surround the element with a href tags or you can use jquery and useThis is the simplest way.Say, this is the div block I want to make clickable:So put a href as follows:Just consider the div block as a normal html element and enable the usual a href tag. \nIt works on FF at least.This is the best way to do it as used on the BBC website and the Guardian:I found the technique here:\nhttp://codepen.io/IschaGast/pen/Qjxpxoheres the htmlheres the CSSI pulled in  a variable because some values in my link will change depending on what record the user is coming from. \nThis worked for testing :and this works too :if just everything could be this simple...just think a little outside the box ;-)My smarty pants answer:"Evasive answer to: "How to make block level element a hyperlink and validate in XHTML 1.1"Just use HTML5 DOCTYPE DTD."Didn\'t actually hold true for ie7onclick="location.href=\'page.html\';"Works IE7-9, Chrome, Safari, Firefox,
