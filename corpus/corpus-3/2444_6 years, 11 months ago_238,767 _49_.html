Is it possible to copy to clipboard directly from Vim? yy only copies stuff to Vim\'s internal buffer. I want to copy to the OS\'s clipboard. Is there any such command in Vim or you can only yank stuff within Vim?The * register will do this. In Windows, + and * are equivalent. In unix there is a subtle difference between + and *:Under Windows, the * and + registers\n  are equivalent. For X11 systems,\n  though, they differ. For X11 systems,\n  * is the selection, and + is the cut buffer (like clipboard). \n  http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Accessing_the_system_clipboard* is probably what you want most of the time, so I use * because it functions as I expect it to in both environments.In Linux distros, for some reason, you have to install vim-gtk first to gain clipboard functionality.On Mac OSXcopy selected part: visually select text(type v or V in normal\nmode) and type :w !pbcopycopy the whole file :%w !pbcopypaste from the clipboard :r !pbpasteOn most Linux Distros, you can substitute:Use the register "+ to copy to the system clipboard (i.e. "+y instead of y).Likewise you can paste from "+ to get text from the system clipboard (i.e. "+p instead of p).In your vimrc file you can specify to automatically use the system clipboard for copy and paste.On Windows set:On Linux set (vim 7.3.74+):NOTE: You may need to use an up to date version of Vim for these to work.http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Accessing_the_system_clipboard@Jacob Dalton has mentioned this in a comment, but nobody seems to have mentioned in an answer that vim has to be compiled with clipboard support for any of the suggestions mentioned here to work. Mine wasn\'t configured that way on Mac OS X by default and I had to rebuild vim. Use this the command to find out whether you have it or not vim --version | grep \'clipboard\'. +clipboard means you\'re good and the suggestions here will work for you, while -clipboard means you have to recompile and rebuild vim.Summing up and make it easier for newbies, To copy the current line, in command mode type:To copy the whole file/buffer, in command mode, first go to the beginning via gg, then typeAs noted, this requires +clipboard out of vim --version, which indicate the availability of clipboard support, -clipboard means no.I wasn\'t able to copy to my clipboard\'s system because I had this in my ~/.vimrc file:But if you add this line next, it will allow you to simply Ctrl+c to get whatever you have selected into your clipboard.Original discussion and more details: Copy text out of vim with set mouse=a enabledIf you are using GVim, you can also set guioptions+=a.

For xclip (which you may need to install previously), the command will be :w !xclip -sel clipIf you are using vim in MAC OSX, unfortunately it comes with older verion, and not complied with clipboard options.
