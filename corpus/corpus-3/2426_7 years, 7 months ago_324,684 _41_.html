I am writing an application for Android. How can I send an email from it?The best (and easiest) way is to use an Intent:Otherwise you\'ll have to write your own client.Use .setType("message/rfc822") or the chooser will show you all of the (many) applications that support the send intent.I\'ve been using this since long time ago and it seems good, no non-email apps showing up. Just another way to send a send email intent:I was using something along the lines of the currently accepted answer in order to send emails with an attached binary error log file. GMail and K-9 send it just fine and it also arrives fine on my mail server. The only problem was my mail client of choice Thunderbird which had troubles with opening / saving the attached log file. In fact it simply didn\'t save the file at all without complaining.I took a look at one of these mail\'s source codes and noticed that the log file attachment had (understandably) the mime type message/rfc822. Of course that attachment is not an attached email. But Thunderbird cannot cope with that tiny error gracefully. So that was kind of a bummer.After a bit of research and experimenting I came up with the following solution:It can be used as follows:As you can see, the createEmailOnlyChooserIntent method can be easily fed with the correct intent and the correct mime type.It then goes through the list of available activities that respond to an ACTION_SENDTO mailto protocol intent (which are email apps only) and constructs a chooser based on that list of activities and the original ACTION_SEND intent with the correct mime type.Another advantage is that Skype is not listed anymore (which happens to respond to the rfc822 mime type).To JUST LET EMAIL APPS to resolve your intent you need to specify ACTION_SENDTO as Action and mailto as Data.The strategy of using .setType("message/rfc822") or ACTION_SEND seems to also match apps that aren\'t email clients, such as Android Beam and Bluetooth.Using ACTION_SENDTO and a mailto: URI seems to work perfectly, and is recommended in the developer documentation. However, if you do this on the official emulators and there aren\'t any email accounts set up (or there aren\'t any mail clients), you get the following error:Unsupported actionThat action is not currently supported.As shown below:It turns out that the emulators resolve the intent to an activity called com.android.fallback.Fallback, which displays the above message. Apparently this is by design.If you want your app to circumvent this so it also works correctly on the official emulators, you can check for it before trying to send the email:Find more info in the developer documentation.Sending email can be done with Intents which will require no configuration. But then it will require user interaction and the layout will be a bit restricted.Build and sending a more complex email without user interaction entails building your own client. The first thing is that the Sun Java API for email are unavailable. I have had success leveraging the Apache Mime4j library to build email. All based on the docs at nilvec.I solved this issue with simple lines of code as the android documentation explains.(https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-common.html#Email)The most important is the flag: it is ACTION_SENDTO, and not ACTION_SENDThe other important line is By the way, if you send an empty Extra, the if() at the end won\'t work and the app won\'t launch the email client.This works for me. According to Android documentation. If you want to ensure that your intent is handled only by an email app (and not other text messaging or social apps), then use the ACTION_SENDTO action and include the "mailto:" data scheme. For example:If you really want to send the email from the app without a user interaction, here is a great code I found online and it works like a charm:http://www.jondev.net/articles/Sending_Emails_without_User_Intervention_(no_Intents)_in_Androidsimple try this one I use the below code in my apps. This shows exactly email client apps, such as Gmail.Use this for send email...use build gradle :This function first direct intent gmail for sending email, if gmail is not found then promote intent chooser. I used this function in many commercial app and it\'s working fine. Hope it will help you:Other solution can beAssuming most of the android device has GMail app already installed.This is how I did it. Nice and simple.This will show you only the email clients (as well as PayPal for some unknown reason)
