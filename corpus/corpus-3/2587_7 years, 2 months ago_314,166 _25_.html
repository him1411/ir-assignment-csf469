How do I rename a file using C#?Take a look at System.IO.File.Move, "move" the file to a new name.You can use File.Move to do it.In the File.Move method, this won\'t overwrite the file if it is already exists. And it will throw an exception.So we need to check whether the file exists or not.Or surround it with a try catch to avoid an exception.Just add:And then...First solutionAvoid System.IO.File.Move solutions posted here (marked answer included).\nIt fails over networks. However, copy/delete pattern works locally and over networks. Follow one of the move solutions, but replace it with Copy instead. Then use File.Delete to delete the original file.You can create a Rename method to simplify it.Ease of useUse the VB assembly in C#.\nAdd reference to Microsoft.VisualBasicThen to rename the file:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.FileSystem.RenameFile(myfile, newName);Both are strings. Note that myfile has the full path. newName does not.\nFor example:The C:\\whatever\\ folder will now contain b.txt.You can copy it as a new file and then delete the old one using the System.IO.File class:NOTE: In this example code we open a directory and search for PDF files with open and closed parenthesis in the name of the file. You can check and replace any character in the name you like or just specify a whole new name using replace functions.There are other ways to work from this code to do more elaborate renames but my main intention was to show how to use File.Move to do a batch rename. This worked against 335 PDF files in 180 directories when I ran it on my laptop. This is spur of the moment code and there are more elaborate ways to do it.Use:Move is doing the same = Copy and Delete old one.Hopefully! it will be helpful for you. :)How to use this code ?When C# doesn\'t have some feature, I use C++ or C:
