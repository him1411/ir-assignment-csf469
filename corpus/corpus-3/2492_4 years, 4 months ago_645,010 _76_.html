When I open Android SDK Manager from Android Studio, the SDK Path displayed is:I want to change this path. How do I do it?From Android Studio 1.0.1Go tofor projects default:You\'ll get a Welcome to Android Studio Dialog. In that:(Example SDK location: C:\\android-sdk; I have sub-folders like\n  add-ons, platforms etc under C:\\android-sdk)From the quick start window, choose Configure, then choose Project Defaults, and then choose Project Structure. Then on the left under Platform Settings choose SDKs. Then to the right of that choose the current android platform, mine was Android 4.2.2 Platform, and delete it using the red minus button at the top, then add a new android platform using the green plus button at the top and point it to your current SDK folder and that is it.I Configured in this wayonWelcome to Android Studio ScreenClick Configure Then Project Defaults  and then Project StructureThen \nAndroid SDK  and Selected the path to my current location of Android SDK\nChanging the sdk location in Project Settings will solve the problem partially. When  Android Studio is used to download a new SDK, it will place the new SDK in the internal SDK folder (inside Android Studio).Existing android developers will already have a large sdks folder (hereinafter referred to as external SDK folder) containing all the SDKs downloaded before Android Studio came around.For Mac/Linux users though there is a good way out. Soft links!Exit Android Studio and perform the following steps:And we\'re good to go.

Currently you can only change sdk path inside android studio project wide which is annoying. What I did instead was I copied all the previous android sdk files that I was using with eclipse to /Android Studio/sdk/ and then just changed the sdk path inside eclipse.Now both android studio and eclipse are happy.You\'ll Android Studio home pageClick on Configure -> Project Defaults -> Project StructureClick on SDK Location in the left column and copy the path.Paste the path in My computer --> Right Click -> Properties -> click on Advanced system settings  -> Environment variables and change the android home path.click on \'OK\' to save the session.Add tools and platforms tools in path and save the changes.Open command prompt[window+R] and type adb + enter.N.B.: Avoid having spaces in the path as it may sometimes lead to issues.In Android Studio 2.2.3 I think you can change default SDK location for all projects from the top menu:File -> Other Settings -> Default Project Structure...A window like below shows up:Thanks DheeB, indeed!\nBut my solution is to link android\'s SDK dir to android studio\'s one:\nln -s <FULL_PATH_TO_ANDROID_SDK> <PATH_TO_ANDROID_STUDIO>/sdk\nand of course beforehand, for just in case, you need to move\nmv <PATH_TO_ANDROID_STUDIO>/sdk to <PATH_TO_ANDROID_STUDIO>/sdk_orig\nAnd additionally I\'ve had to correct project\'s build.gradle file and specify \nclasspath \'com.android.tools.build:gradle:0.6.+\'\n(instead of 0.5.+)I had the same problem, but with the sdk path pointing to a mounted drive. I found, that simply quit Android Studio, unmount the device and restart Android Studio made it ask for the sdk location, because it had none (Android Studio Beta 0.8.7). Therefore I guess if you just quit Android Studio, delete \\android-studio\\sdk or move it somewhere else and start Android Studio again, it should ask for the sdk location aswell.Though many of the above answers serve the purpose, there is one straight forward thing we can do in project itself.In Eclipse, go to Window->Preferences, select "Android" from left side menu.
