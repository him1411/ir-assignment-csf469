How do I make long commands go over multiple lines in a Windows (Vista) batch file?You can break up long lines with the caret ^ as long as you remember that the caret and the newline following it are completely removed. So, if there should be a space where you\'re breaking the line, include a space. (More on that below.)Example:would be written as:The rule for the caret is:A caret at the line end, appends the next line, the first character of the appended line will be escaped.\nYou can use the caret multiple times, but the complete line must not exceed the maximum line length of ~8192 characters (XP/Vista/Win7).To suppress the escaping of the next character you can use a redirection.\nThe redirection has to be just before the caret.\nBut there exist one curiosity with redirection before the caret.\nIf you place a token at the caret the token is removed.And it is also possible to embedd line feeds into the stringThe empty line is important for the success.\nThis works only with delayed expansion, else the rest of the line is ignored after the line feed.  It works because the caret at the line end ignores the next line feed and escapes the next character, even if the next character is also a line feed (carriage returns are always ignored in this phase).(This is basically a rewrite of Wayne\'s answer but with the confusion around the caret cleared up. So I\'ve posted it as a CW. I\'m not shy about editing answers, but completely rewriting them seems inappropriate.)You can break up long lines with the caret (^), just remember that the caret and the newline that follows it are removed entirely from the command, so if you put it where a space would be required (such as between parameters), be sure to include the space as well (either before the ^, or at the beginning of the next line — that latter choice may help make it clearer it\'s a continuation).Examples: (all tested on Windows XP and Windows 7)can be written as:oror even(That last works because there are no spaces betwen the xc and the ^, and no spaces at the beginning of the next line. So when you remove the ^ and the newline, you get...xcopy.)For readability and sanity, it\'s probably best breaking only between parameters (be sure to include the space).Be sure that the ^ is not the last thing in a batch file, as there appears to be a major issue with that.Multiple commands can be put in parenthesis and spread over numerous lines; so something like echo hi && echo hello can be put like this:Also variables can help:Also I noticed with carets (^) that the if conditionals liked them to follow only if a space was present:It seems however that splitting in the middle of the values of a for loop doesn\'t need a caret(and actually trying to use one will be considered a syntax error). For example,Note that no space is even needed after hello or before bye.
