I would like to format my numbers to always display 2 decimal places, rounding where applicable.Examples:I have been using this: But it\'s displaying 1 as 1, rather than 1.00.This works fine in FF4:Live DemoNote that it will round to 2 decimal places, so the input 1.346 will return 1.35.This answer will fail if value = 1.005.As a better solution, the rounding problem can be avoided by using numbers represented in exponential notation:\nCredit: Rounding Decimals in JavaScriptSimplest answer:Example: http://jsfiddle.net/E2XU7/If you\'re already using jQuery, you could look at using the jQuery Number Format plugin.The plugin can return formatted numbers as a string, you can set decimal, and thousands separators, and you can choose the number of decimals to show.You can also get jQuery Number Format from GitHub.https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/NumberFormatIs this what you mean?Convert a number into a string, keeping only two decimals:The result of n will be:Here\'s also a generic function that can format to any number of decimal places:Where specific formatting is required, you should write your own routine or use a library function that does what you need.

A much more generic solution for rounding to N placesI do like:Round the number with 2 decimal points,\nthen make sure to parse it with parseFloat() \nto return Number, not String unless you don\'t care if it is String or Number.Extend Math object with precision methodThis is how I solve my problem: parseFloat(parseFloat(floatString).toFixed(2));
