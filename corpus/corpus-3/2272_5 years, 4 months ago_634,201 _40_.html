I\'m trying to load a 3D model into Three.js with JSONLoader, and that 3D model is in the same directory as the entire website.I\'m getting the "Cross origin requests are only supported for HTTP." error, but I don\'t know what\'s causing it nor how to fix it.My crystal ball says that you are loading the model using either file:// or C:/, which stays true to the error message as they are not http://So you can either install a webserver in your local PC or upload the model somewhere else and use jsonp and change the url to http://example.com/path/to/modelJust to be explicit - so yes you cannot point your browser directly at file://some/path/some.html  so instead once you have python installed cd into the dir where some.html file(s) lives then issue :which will spin up a web server hosting entire dir listing which you reference from URL :this is built into any python install (batteries are included).  For python3 use this :Alternatively, if you demand a more responsive setup and already use nodejs just issuethen, as above, cd into dir containing your some.html and issue :which spins up a nodejs httpd which does a dir listing of your static files visible from :If your preferred language is ruby ... the ruby Gods say this works as well Of course php also has its solution In Chrome you can use this flag:Read more here.Ran in to this today.I wrote some code that looked like this:...but it should\'ve looked like this:The only difference was the lack of http:// in the second snippet of code.Just wanted to put that out there in case there are others with a similar issue.Simple Node.js Solution1) install http-server: npm install http-server -g\n2) run: http-server C:\\location\\to\\app\n  step 2 will out put like thisNow you have a local server up and running. You can access your app through url provided by step 2Just change the url to http://localhost instead of localhost. If you open the html file from local, you should create a local server to serve that html file, the simplest way is using Web Server for Chrome. That will fix the issue.For those on Windows without Python or Node.js, there is still a lightweight solution: Mongoose.All you do is drag the executable to wherever the root of the server should be, and run it. An icon will appear in the taskbar and it\'ll navigate to the server in the default browser.Also, Z-WAMP is a 100% portable WAMP that runs in a single folder, it\'s awesome. That\'s an option if you need a quick PHP and MySQL server.In an Android app — for example, to allow JavaScript to have access to assets via file:///android_asset/ — use setAllowFileAccessFromFileURLs(true) on the WebSettings that you get from calling getSettings() on the WebView.I was getting this exact error when loading an HTML file on the browser that was using a json file from the local directory. In my case, I was able to solve this by creating a simple node server that allowed to server static content. I left the code for this at this other answer.It simply says that the application should be run on a web server. I had the same problem with chrome, I started tomcat and moved my application there, and it worked.I suggest you use a mini-server to run these kind of applications on localhost (if you are not using some inbuilt server).Here\'s one that is very simple to setup and run:er. I just found some official words "Attempting to load unbuilt, remote AMD modules that use the dojo/text plugin will fail due to cross-origin security restrictions. (Built versions of AMD modules are unaffected because the calls to dojo/text are eliminated by the build system.)" https://dojotoolkit.org/documentation/tutorials/1.10/cdn/ One way it worked loading local files is using them with in the project folder instead of outside your project folder. Create one folder under your project example files similar to the way we create for images and replace the section where using complete local path other than project path and use relative url of file under project folder .\nIt worked for me For all y\'all on MacOS... setup a simple LaunchAgent to enable these glamorous capabilities in your own copy of Chrome...Save a plist, named whatever (launch.chrome.dev.mode.plist, for example) in ~/Library/LaunchAgents with similar content to...It should launch at startup.. but you can force it to do so at any time with the terminal commandlaunchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/launch.chrome.dev.mode.plistTADA! \xf0\x9f\x98\x8e \xf0\x9f\x92\x81\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbb \xf0\x9f\x99\x8a \xf0\x9f\x99\x8f\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbeMany problem for this, with my problem is missing \'/\' example:\njquery-1.10.2.js:8720 XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://localhost:xxxProduct/getList_tagLabels/\nIt\'s must be: http://localhost:xxx/Product/getList_tagLabels/I hope this help for who meet this problem.
