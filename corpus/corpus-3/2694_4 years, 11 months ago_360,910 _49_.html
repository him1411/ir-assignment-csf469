I have read about it in other posts, but I couldn\'t figure it out.I have an array,I want to render it as:And also I want to select the option with ID=000002.I have read select and tried, but I can\'t figure it out.One thing to note is that ngModel is required for ngOptions to work... note the ng-model="blah" which is saying "set $scope.blah to the selected value".Try this:Here\'s more from AngularJS\'s documentation (if you haven\'t seen it):for array data sources:for object data sources:For some clarification on option tag values in AngularJS:When you use ng-options, the values of option tags written out by ng-options will always be the index of the array item the option tag relates to. This is because AngularJS actually allows you to select entire objects with select controls, and not just primitive types. For example:The above will allow you to select an entire object into $scope.selectedItem directly. The point is, with AngularJS, you don\'t need to worry about what\'s in your option tag. Let AngularJS handle that; you should only care about what\'s in your model in your scope.Here is a plunker demonstrating the behavior above, and showing the HTML written outDealing with the default option:There are a few things I\'ve failed to mention above relating to the default option.Selecting the first option and removing the empty option:You can do this by adding a simple ng-init that sets the model (from ng-model) to the first element in the items your repeating in ng-options:Note: This could get a little crazy if foo happens to be initialized properly to something "falsy". In that case, you\'ll want to handle the initialization of foo in your controller, most likely.Customizing the default option:This is a little different; here all you need to do is add an option tag as a child of your select, with an empty value attribute, then customize its inner text:Note: In this case the "empty" option will stay there even after you select a different option. This isn\'t the case for the default behavior of selects under AngularJS.A customized default option that hides after a selection is made:If you wanted your customized default option to go away after you select a value, you can add an ng-hide attribute to your default option:I\'m learning AngularJS and was struggling with selection as well. I know this question is already answered, but I wanted to share some more code nevertheless.In my test I have two listboxes: car makes and car models. The models list is disabled until some make is selected. If selection in makes listbox is later reset (set to \'Select Make\') then the models listbox becomes disabled again AND its selection is reset as well (to \'Select Model\'). Makes are retrieved as a resource while models are just hard-coded.For some reason AngularJS allows to get me confused. Their documentation is pretty horrible on this. More good examples of variations would be welcome.Anyway, I have a slight variation on Ben Lesh\'s answer.My data collections looks like this:Nowstill resulted in the options value to be the index (0, 1, 2, etc.).Adding Track By fixed it for me:I reckon it happens more often that you want to add an array of objects into an select list, so I am going to remember this one!Be aware that from AngularJS 1.4 you can\'t use ng-options any more, but you need to use ng-repeat on your option tag:The question is already answered (BTW, really good and comprehensive answer provided by Ben), but I would like to add another element for completeness, which may be also very handy.In the example suggested by Ben:the following ngOptions form has been used: select as label for value in array.Label is an expression, which result will be the label for <option> element. In that case you can perform certain string concatenations, in order to have more complex option labels.Examples:You can also use filters, for example,In CoffeeScript:I highly recommend using Select2, because it will handle this for you.  There is even a directive for AngularJS.If you need a custom title for each option, ng-options is not applicable. Instead use ng-repeat with options:I hope the following will work for you.Actually there is a pure AngularJS solution developed by QuantumUI.You can find more examples and documentations at http://quantumui.org/.It can be useful. Bindings do not always work.For example, you fill the options list source model from a REST service. A selected value was known before filling the list, and it was set. After executing the REST request with $http, the list option is done.But the selected option is not set. For unknown reasons AngularJS in shadow $digest executing does not bind selected as it should be. I have got to use jQuery to set the selected. It`s important! AngularJS, in shadow, adds the prefix to the value of the attr "value" for generated by ng-repeat options. For int it is "number:".
