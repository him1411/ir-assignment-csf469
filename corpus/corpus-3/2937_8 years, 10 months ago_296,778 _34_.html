How can I generate valid XML in C#?It depends on the scenario. XmlSerializer is certainly one way and has the advantage of mapping directly to an object model. In .NET 3.5, XDocument, etc. are also very friendly. If the size is very large, then XmlWriter is your friend.For an XDocument example:Or the same with XmlDocument:If you are writing a large stream of data, then any of the DOM approaches (such as XmlDocument/XDocument, etc.) will quickly take a lot of memory. So if you are writing a 100Â MB XML file from CSV, you might consider XmlWriter; this is more primitive (a write-once firehose), but very efficient (imagine a big loop here):Finally, via XmlSerializer:This is a nice model for mapping to classes, etc.; however, it might be overkill if you are doing something simple (or if the desired XML doesn\'t really have a direct correlation to the object model). Another issue with XmlSerializer is that it doesn\'t like to serialize immutable types : everything must have a public getter and setter (unless you do it all yourself by implementing IXmlSerializable, in which case you haven\'t gained much by using XmlSerializer).The best thing hands down that I have tried is LINQ to XSD (which is unknown to most developers). You give it an XSD Schema and it generates a perfectly mapped complete strongly-typed object model (based on LINQ to XML) for you in the background, which is really easy to work with - and it updates and validates your object model and XML in real-time. While it\'s still "Preview", I have not encountered any bugs with it.If you have an XSD Schema that looks like this:Then you can simply build XML like this:Or simply load an XML from file like this:Or save it like this:rootElement.Untyped also yields the element in form of a XElement (from LINQ to XML).I would give XLINQ (read: LINQ to XML) a try.  It\'s easy, intuitive and is easily editable.Sample: Reading and Writing XML using XLinqAlso check out Mark S. Rasmussen\'s XmlDocument fluent interface, which really provides easy to type/read XML output.XmlWriter is the fastest way to write good XML. XDocument, XMLDocument and some others works good aswell, but are not optimized for writing XML. If you want to write the XML as fast as possible, you should definitely use XmlWriter.In the past I have created my XML Schema, then used a tool to generate C# classes which will serialize to that schema. The XML Schema Definition Tool is one examplehttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x6c1kb0s(VS.71).aspxI think this resource should suffice for a moderate XML save/load: Read/Write XML using C#.My task was to store musical notation. I choose XML, because I guess .NET has matured enough to allow easy solution for the task. I was right :)This is my song file prototype:That can be solved quite easily:For Save to File:For load file:For simple things, I just use the XmlDocument/XmlNode/XmlAttribute classes and XmlDocument DOM found in System.XML.It generates the XML for me, I just need to link a few items together.However, on larger things, I use XML serialization.For simple cases, I would also suggest looking at XmlOutput a fluent interface for building Xml.XmlOutput is great for simple Xml creation with readable and maintainable code, while generating valid Xml.  The orginal post has some great examples.As above.I use stringbuilder.append().Very straightforward, and you can then do xmldocument.load(strinbuilder object as parameter).You will probably find yourself using string.concat within the append parameter, but this is a very straightforward approach.
