Can an abstract class have a constructor?If so, how can it be used and for what purposes?Yes, an abstract class can have a constructor. Consider this:The superclass Product is abstract and has a constructor. The concrete class TimesTwo has a constructor that just hardcodes the value 2. The concrete class TimesWhat has a constructor that allows the caller to specify the value.Abstract constructors will frequently be used to enforce class constraints or invariants such as the minimum fields required to setup the class.NOTE: As there is no default (or no-arg) constructor in the parent\n  abstract class, the constructor used in subclass must explicitly call\n  the parent constructor.You would define a constructor in an abstract class if you are in one of these situations:Note that:In any case, don\'t forget that if you don\'t define a constructor, then the compiler will automatically generate one for you (this one is public, has no argument, and does nothing).Yes it can have a constructor and it is defined and behaves just like any other class\'s constructor.  Except that abstract classes can\'t be directly instantiated, only extended, so the use is therefore always from a subclass\'s constructor.Yes! Abstract classes can have constructors!Yes when we define a class to be an Abstract Class it cannot be instantiated but that does not mean an Abstract class cannot have a constructor. Each abstract class must have a concrete subclass which will implement the abstract methods of that abstract class.When we create an object of any subclass all the constructors in the corresponding inheritance tree are invoked in top to bottom approach. Same case applies to abstract classes. Though we cannot create an object of abstract class, when we create an object of a class which is concrete and subclass of the abstract class, constructor of the abstract class is automatically invoked.Hence we can have a constructor in abstract classes.Note :  A non-abstract class cannot have an abstract methods but an abstract class can have a non-abstract method. Reason is similar to that of constructors, difference being instead of getting invoked automatically we can call super(). Also there is nothing like abstract constructor as it makes no sense at all.Not only can it, it always does. If you do not specify one then it has a default no arg constructor, just like any other class. In fact, ALL classes, including nested and anonymous classes, will get a default constructor if one is not specified (in the case of anonymous classes it is impossible to specify one, so you will always get the default constructor).A good example of an abstract class having a constructor is the Calendar class. You get a Calendar object by calling Calendar.getInstance(), but it also has constructors which are protected. The reason its constructors are protected is so that only its subclasses can call them (or classes in the same package, but since it\'s abstract, that doesn\'t apply). GregorianCalendar is an example of a class that extends Calendar.Yes it can, abstract classes constructors are generally used for super calls for initialization events common to all the subclassesAn abstract class can have a constructor BUT you can not create an object of abstract class so how do you use that constructor?Thing is, when you inherit that abstract class in your subclass you can pass values to its(abstract\'s) constructor through super(value) method in your subclass and no you don\'t inherit a constructor. so using super you can pass values in constructor of abstract class and as far as i remember it has to be the first statement in your method or constructor. Of Course, abstract class can have a constructor.Generally class constructor is used to initialise fields.So, an abstract class constructor is used to initialise fields of the abstract class. You would provide a constructor for an abstract class if you want to initialise certain fields of the abstract class before the instantiation of a child-class takes place. An abstract class constructor can also be used to execute code that is relevant for every child class. This prevents code duplication.We cannot create an instance of an abstract class,But we can create instances of classes those are derived from the abstract class. So, when an instance of derived class is created, the parent abstract class constructor is automatically called.Reference :This ArticleConsider this:The superclass is abstract and has a constructor.In a concrete class, declaration of a constructor for a concrete type Fnord effectively exposes two things:A means by which code can request the creation of an instance of FnordA means by which an instance of a type derived from Fnord which is under construction can request that all base-class features be initialized.While there should perhaps be a means by which these two abilities could be controlled separately, for every concrete type one definition will enable both.  Although the first ability is not meaningful for an abstract class, the second ability is just as meaningful for an abstract class as it would be for any other, and thus its declaration is just as necessary and useful.As described by javafuns here, this is an example:Yes, Abstract Classes can have constructors ! Here is an example using constructor in abstract class:So I think you got the answer.Abstract class can have a constructor though it cannot be instantiated. But the constructor defined in an abstract class can be used for instantiation of concrete class of this abstract class. Check JLS:It is a compile-time error if an attempt is made to create an instance of an abstract class using a class instance creation\n  expression.A subclass of an abstract class that is not itself abstract may be\n  instantiated, resulting in the execution of a constructor for the\n  abstract class and, therefore, the execution of the field initializers\n  for instance variables of that class.inorder to achieve constructor chaining the abstract class will have constructor.\nThe compiler keeps Super() statement inside the subclass constructer, which will call the superclass constructor.If there were no constructors for abstract classes then java rules are violated and we can\'t achieve constructor chaining.Yes surely you can add one, as already mentioned for initialization of Abstract class variables.\nBUT if you dont explicitly declare one, it anyways has an implicit constructor for "Constructor Chaining" to work. Yes an Abstract Class can have a Constructor.You Can Overload as many Constructor as you want in an Abstract Class.These Contructor\'s Can be used to Initialized the initial state of the Objects Extending the Abstract Class. As we know we can\'t make an object of an Abstract Class because Objects are Created by the "new" keywords and not by the constructors...they are there for only initializing the state of the subclass Objects..Although there are many good answers, I would like to give my 2 cents.Constructor DOES NOT BUILD THE OBJECT. It is used to initialize object.Yes, an Abstract class always has a constructor. If you do not define your own constructor, compiler will give a default constructor to the Abstract class.\nAbove holds true for all classes - nested, abstract, anonymous, etc. An abstract class (unlike interface) can have non final non static fields which needs initialization. You can write your own constructor in abstract class to do that. But, in that case there won\'t be any default constructor.Be careful while extending above abstract class, you have to explicitly call super from each constructor.The first line of any constructor is call to super(). if you do not explicitly call super(), java will do that for you.\nBelow code will not compile:You have to use it like below example:yes it is. And a constructor of abstract class is called when an instance of a inherited class is created. For example, the following is a valid Java program.This is the output of the above code,Base Constructor Called\nDerived Constructor Calledreferences:\nenter link description hereYes..It is like any other class. It can have a constructor and it is called after creating object for the base class.
