The difference between rake db:migrate and rake db:reset is pretty clear in my head. The thing which I don\'t understand is how rake db:schema:load different from the former two.Just to be sure that I am on the same page:Please help to clarify, if my understanding has gone wrong.db:schema:load creates tables and columns within the (existing) database following schema.rbdb:setup does db:create, db:schema:load, db:seedTypically, you would use db:migrate after having made changes to the schema via new migration files (this makes sense only if there is already data in the database). db:schema:load is used when you setup a new instance of your app.I hope that helps.UPDATE for rails 3.2.12:I just checked the source and the dependencies are like this now:db:schema:dump dumps the current env\'s schema (and seems to create the db as well)db:setup runs db:schema:load, db:seedFor further information please have a look at https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v3.2.12/activerecord/lib/active_record/railties/databases.rake (for Rails 3.2.x) and https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v4.0.5/activerecord/lib/active_record/railties/databases.rake (for Rails 4.0.x)Use  rake db:schema:load will set up the schema as provided in schema.rb file. This is useful for a fresh install of app as it doesn\'t take as much time as db:migrateImportant note, db:schema:load will delete data on server.  rake db:migrate makes changes to the existing schema. Its like creating versions of schema. db:migrate will look in db/migrate/ for any ruby files and execute the migrations that aren\'t run yet starting with the oldest. Rails knows which file is the oldest by looking at the timestamp at the beginning of the migration filename. db:migrate comes with a benefit that data can also be put in the database. This is actually not a good practice. Its better to use rake db:seed to add data.rake db:migrate provides tasks up, down etc which enables commands like rake db:rollback and makes it the most useful command. rake db:reset does a db:drop and db:setup\nIt drops the database, create it again, loads the schema, and initializes with the seed dataAs far as I understand, it is going to drop your database and re-create it based on your db/schema.rb file. That is why you need to make sure that your schema.rb file is always up to date and under version control.You could simply look in the Active Record Rake tasks as that is where I believe they live as in this file.\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/fe1f4b2ad56f010a4e9b93d547d63a15953d9dc2/activerecord/lib/active_record/tasks/database_tasks.rbWhat they do is your question right?That depends on where they come from and this is just and example to show that they vary depending upon the task. Here we have a different file full of tasks.https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/fe1f4b2ad56f010a4e9b93d547d63a15953d9dc2/activerecord/Rakefilewhich has these tasks.This may not answer your question but could give you some insight into go ahead and look the source over especially the rake files and tasks. As they do a pretty good job of helping you use rails they don\'t always document the code that well. We could all help there if we know what it is supposed to do.
