Does reflection in C# offer a way to determine if some given System.Type type models some interface?You have a few choices off the top of my headtypeof(IMyInterface).IsAssignableFrom(typeof(MyType))typeof(MyType).GetInterfaces().Contains(typeof(IMyInterface))Use Type.IsAssignableFrom:orI think this is the correct release, for three reasons:  1) It uses GetInterfaces and not IsAssignableFrom, it\'s faster since IsAssignableFrom eventually after several checks does call GetInterfaces.\n2) It iterates over the local array, so there will be no bounds checks.\n3) It uses the == operator which is defined for Type, so probably is safer than the Equals method (that the Contains call, will eventually use).As someone else already mentioned:\nBenjamin Apr 10 \'13 at 22:21"It sure was easy to not pay attention and get the arguments for\n  IsAssignableFrom backwards. I will go with GetInterfaces now :p \xe2\x80\x93Well, another way around is just to create a short extension method that fulfills, to some extent, the "most usual" way of thinking (and agreed this is a very little personal choice to make it slightly "more natural" based on one\'s preferences):And why not going a bit more generic (well not sure if it is really that interesting, well I assume I\'m just passing another pinch of \'syntaxing\' sugar):I think it might be much more natural that way, but once again just a matter of very personal opinions:Modifying Jeff\'s answer for optimal performance (thanks to performance test by Pierre Arnaud):To find all types that implement an interface in a given Assembly:I just did:I wish I could have said where I : interface, but interface is not a generic parameter constraint option. class is as close as it gets.Usage:I just said Implements because that\'s more intuitive. I always get IsAssignableFrom flip-flopped.what about ?What about IsAssignableFrom is now moved to TypeInfo so....\ntypeof(ISMSRequest).GetTypeInfo().IsAssignableFrom(typeof(T).GetTypeInfo())
