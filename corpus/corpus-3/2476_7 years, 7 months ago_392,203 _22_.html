I\'ve run into a few cases with WordPress installs with Bluehost where I\'ve encountered errors with my WordPress theme because the uploads folder wp-content/uploads was not present.Apparently the Bluehost cPanel WP installer does not create this folder, though HostGator does.So I need to add code to my theme that checks for the folder and creates it otherwise.Try this:Note that 0777 is already the default mode for directories and may still be modified by the current umask.Here is the missing piece. You need to pass \'recursive\' flag as third argument (boolean true) in mkdir call like this:Something a bit more universal since this comes up on google.  While the details are more specific, the title of this question is more universal.This will take a path, possibly with a long chain of uncreated directories, and keep going up one directory until it gets to an existing directory.  Then it will attempt to create the next directory in that directory, and continue till it\'s created all the directories.  It returns true if successful.Could be improved by providing a stopping level so it just fails if it goes beyond user folder or something and by including permissions.What about a helper function like this:It will return true if the directory was successfully created or already exists, and false if the directory couldn\'t be created.A better alternative is this (shouldn\'t give any warnings):Recursively create directory path:Inspired by Python\'s os.makedirs()Faster way to create folder:Within WordPress there\'s also the very handy function wp_mkdir_p which will recursively create a directory structure.  Source for reference:-I need the same thing for a login site. I needed to create a directory with a two variables.\nThe $directory is the main folder where I wanted to create another sub-folder with the users license number.This is the most up-to-date solution without error suppression:You can try also:I ended up doingafter the commented out part kept failing
