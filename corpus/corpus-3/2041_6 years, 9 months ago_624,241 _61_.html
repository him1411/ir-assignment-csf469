I\'m integrating an API to my website which works with data stored in objects while my code is written using arrays.I\'d like a quick and dirty function to convert an object to an array.Just typecast itFrom http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.phpIf an object is converted to an array, the result is an array whose elements are the object\'s properties. The keys are the member variable names, with a few notable exceptions: integer properties are unaccessible; private variables have the class name prepended to the variable name; protected variables have a \'*\' prepended to the variable name. These prepended values have null bytes on either side.Example: Simple ObjectOutput:Example: Complex ObjectOutput (with \\0s edited in for clarity):Output with var_export instead of var_dump:Typecasting this way will not do deep casting of the object graph and you need to apply the null bytes (as explained in the manual quote) to access any non-public attributes. So this works best when casting StdClass objects or objects with only public properties. For quick and dirty (what you asked for) it\'s fine.Also see this in-depth blog post: You can quickly convert deeply nested objects to associative arrays by relying on the behavior of the JSON encode/decode functions:From the first Google hit for "php object to assoc array" we have this:Source at codesnippets.joyent.com.If your object properties are public you can do:If they are private or protected, they will have weird key names on the array. So, in this case you will need the following function:Just use it, for multidimensional arrayFor multidimensional arrayRather than writing complex functions, we can simply use PHP\'s inbuilt functions json_encode() and json_decode().First convert the object to JSON and get it back as array.json_decode() has second parameter: return associative array, set it to TRUE.All other answers posted here are only working with public attributes. Here is one solution that works with javabean-like objects using reflection and getters:OutputHere is some code:What about get_object_vars($obj)? Seems useful if you only want to access the public properties of an object.\nhttp://www.php.net/function.get-object-varsIf you don\'t want that \'*\' to be prepended to your array, you may simply do something likeThis works just fine and much better than typecasting.Hi,Here is my recursive PHP function to convert PHP objects to an associative array Usage example:Custom Function to convert stdClass to array:Another custom function to convert Array to stdClass:Usage Example:To convert an object into array just cast it explicitlyYou can also create function in PHP to convert object array.You might want to do this when you obtain data as objects from databases -->returns array without special characters and class namestype cast your object to arrayIt will solve your problemConverting and removing annoying stars :Probably, it will be cheaper than using reflections.First of all, if you need an array from object you probably should constitutes the data as array first. Think about it. Don\'t use foreach statement or JSON transformations. If you\'re planning this, again you\'re working with a data structure, not with an object.If you really need it use object orientated approach to have a clean and maintable code. For example:Object as arrayIf you need all properties use transfer objectthis function can convert object proprity to array associatifuse >= php5Some impovements to the "well-knwon" codeNotice that if the function is member of a class (like above) you must change __FUNCTION__ to __METHOD__Here I\'ve made an objectToArray() method, which also works with recursive objects, like when $objectA contains $objectB which points again to $objectA.Additionally I\'ve restricted the output to public properties using ReflectionClass. Get rid of it, if you don\'t need it.To identify already used objects, I am using a protected property in this (abstract) class, named $this->usedObjects. If a recursive nested object is found, it will be replaced by the string **recursive**. Otherwise it would fail in because of infinite loop.due to a lot of people find this thread because of having trouble with dynamically access attributes of an object, i will just recall that you can do this in php: \n$valueRow->{"valueName"}in Context (removed HTML-output for readability):This answer is only the union of the different answers of this post, but it\'s the solution to convert a PHP object with public or private properties with simple values or arrays in associative array ...Short solution of @SpYk3HHAlso you can use The Symfony Serializer Component  By using typecasting you can resolve your problem.\nJust add following lines to your return object :you can also add new key and value pair to it by using:
