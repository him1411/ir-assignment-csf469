What I want to achieve is very simple: I have a Windows Forms (.NET 3.5) application that uses a path for reading information. This path can be modified by the user, by using the options form I provide.Now, I want to save the path value to a file for later use. This would be one of the many settings saved to this file. This file would sit directly in the application folder.I understand three options are available:I read that the .NET configuration file is not foreseen for saving values back to it.\nAs for the registry, I would like to get as far away from it as possible.Does this mean that I should use a custom XML file to save configuration settings?\nIf so, I would like to see code example of that (C#).I have seen other discussions on this subject, but it is still not clear to me.If you work with Visual Studio then it is pretty easy to get persistable settings. Right click on the project in Solution Explorer, choose Properties. Select the Settings tab, click on the hyperlink if settings doesn\'t exist. Use the Settings tab to create application settings. Visual Studio creates the files Settings.settings and Settings.Designer.settings that contain the singleton class Settings inherited from  ApplicationSettingsBase. You can access this class from your code to read/write application settings:This technique is applicable both for console, Windows Forms and other project types.Note that you need to set the scope property of your settings. If you select Application scope then Settings.Default.< your property > will be read-only.If you are planning on saving to a file within the same directory as your executable, here\'s a nice solution that uses the JSON format:The registry is a no-go. You\'re not sure whether the user which uses your application, has sufficient rights to write to the registry.You can use the app.config file to save application-level settings (that are the same for each user who uses your application).I would store user-specific settings in an XML file, which would be saved in Isolated Storage or in the SpecialFolder.ApplicationData directory.Next to that, as from .NET 2.0, it is possible to store values back to the app.config file.The ApplicationSettings class doesn\'t support saving settings to the app.config file.  That\'s very much by design, apps that run with a properly secured user account (think Vista UAC) do not have write access to the program\'s installation folder.You can fight the system with the ConfigurationManager class.  But the trivial workaround is to go into the Settings designer and change the setting\'s scope to User.  If that causes hardships (say, the setting is relevant to every user), you should put your Options feature in a separate program so you can ask for the privilege elevation prompt.  Or forego using a setting.The registry/configurationSettings/XML argument still seems very active. I\'ve used them all, as the technology has progressed, but my favourite is based on Threed\'s system combined with Isolated Storage.The following sample allows storage of an objects named properties to a file in isolated storage. Such as:Properties may be recovered using:It is just a sample, not suggestive of best practices.I wanted to share a library I\'ve built for this. It\'s a tiny library, but a big improvement (IMHO) over .settings files.The library is called Jot (GitHub), here is an old The Code Project article I wrote about it.Here\'s how you\'d use it to keep track of a window\'s size and location:The benefit compared to .settings files: There\'s considerably less code, and it\'s a lot less error-prone since you only need to mention each property once.With a settings files you need to mention each property five times: once when you explicitly create the property and an additional four times in the code that copies the values back and forth.Storage, serialization, etc. are completely configurable. When using inversion of control, you can hook it up so that it applies tracking automatically to all objects it resolves so that all you need to do to make a property persistent is slap a [Trackable] attribute on it.I\'m writing all this, because I think the library is top notch, and I\'d like to popularize it:)I don\'t like the proposed solution of using web.config or app.config. Try reading your own XML.  Have a look at XML Settings Files \xe2\x80\x93 No more web.config.A simple way is to use a configuration data object, save it as an XML file with the name of the application in the local Folder and on startup read it back.Here is an example to store the position and size of a form.The configuration dataobject is strongly typed and easy to use:A manager class for saving and loading:Now you can create an instance and use in your form\'s load and close events:And the produced XML file is also readable:As far as I can tell, .NET does support persisting settings using the built-in application settings facility:The Application Settings feature of Windows Forms makes it easy to create, store, and maintain custom application and user preferences on the client computer. With Windows Forms application settings, you can store not only application data such as database connection strings, but also user-specific data, such as user application preferences. Using Visual Studio or custom managed code, you can create new settings, read them from and write them to disk, bind them to properties on your forms, and validate settings data prior to loading and saving.\n   -  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k4s6c3a0.aspxSometimes you want to get rid of those settings kept in the traditional web.config or app.config file. You want more fine grained control over the deployment of your settings entries and separated data design. Or the requirement is to enable adding new entries at runtime.I can imagine two good options:The advantage of the strongly typed version are the strongly typed settings names and values. There is no risk of intermixing names or data types. The disadvantage is that more settings have to be coded, cannot be added at runtime.With the object oriented version the advantage is that new settings can be added at runtime. But you do not have strongly typed names and values. Must be careful with string identifiers. Must know data type saved earlier when getting a value.You can find the code of both fully functional implementations HERE.Other options, instead of using a custom XML file, we can use a more user friendly file format: JSON or YAML file.You can store your settings file in multiple special folders (for all users and per user) as listed here Environment.SpecialFolder Enumeration and multiple files (default read only, per role, per user, etc.)If you choose to use multiple settings, you can merge those settings: For example, merging settings for default + BasicUser + AdminUser. You can use your own rules: the last one overrides the value, etc.
