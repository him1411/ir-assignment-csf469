When I try to change the linked reference of a local JavaScript file to a GitHub raw version my test file stops working. The error is: Refused to execute script from ... because its MIME type (text/plain) is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled. Is there a way to disable this behavior or is there a service that allows linking to GitHub raw files?Working code:Non-working code:There is a good workaround for this, now, by using rawgit.com.Steps:Example:Use this URL for development:Use this URL in production:Also note that for production environments, consider targeting a specific tag;\nnot the branch, to ensure you are getting the specific version of the file that\nyou expect, rather than the HEAD version, which will change over time.Why is this needed?GitHub started using X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, which instructs more\nmodern browsers to enforce strict MIME type checking. It then returns the raw\nfiles in a MIME type returned by the server, preventing the browser from using\nthe file as-intended (if the browser honors the setting).For background on this topic, please refer to this discussion thread.This is no longer possible. GitHub has explicitly disabled JavaScript\nhotlinking, and newer versions of browsers respect that setting.Heads up: nosniff header support coming to Chrome and Firefoxrawgithub.com redirects to rawgit.com So the above example would now behttp://rawgit.com/user/package/master/link.min.jsTo make things clear and short//raw.githubusercontent.com --> //rawgit.comNote that this is handled by rawgit\'s development hosting and not their cdn for production hostingAbove answers clearly answer the question but I want to provide another alternative - A different view/approach to solve the similar problem.You can also use browser extension to remove X-Content-Type-Options response header for raw.githubusercontent.com files. There are couple of browser extensions to modify response headers.If you use Requestly, I can suggest two solutionsCheck this screenshot for more detailsWe created a simple JS Fiddle to test out if we can use raw github files as scripts in our code. Here is the Fiddle\nwith the following codeIf you see Script evaluated successfully!, It means you are able to use raw github file in your code\nOtherwise Problem evaluating script indicates that there is some problem while executing script from raw github source.I also wrote an article on Requestly blog about this. Please refer it for more details.Hope it helps!!Disclaimer: I am author of Requestly So you can blame for anything you don\'t like. Most simple way:\n<script type="text/plain" src="http://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repo/branch/file.js"></script>\nServed by GitHub, and My use case was to load \'bookmarklets\' direclty from my Bitbucket account which has same restrictions as Github. The work around I came up with was to AJAX  for the script and run eval on the response string, below snippet is based on that approach. Note that appending of sourceURL comment is to allow for debuging of the script within browser\'s developer tools. I found the error was shown due to the comments at the beginning of file , You can solve this issue  , by simply creating your own file without comment and push to git, it shows no error For proof you can try these two file with same code of easy pagination :without commentwith commenthttps://raw.githack.com/found this site supply a CDN forand this site:https://rawgit.com/When a file is uploaded to github you can use it as external source or free hosting. Troy Alford has explained it well above. But to make it easier let me tell you some easy steps then you can use a github raw file in your site:Here is your file\'s link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mindmup/bootstrap-wysiwyg/master/bootstrap-wysiwyg.jsNow to execute it you have to remove https:// and the dot( . ) between raw and githubusercontentLike this:rawgithubusercontent.com/mindmup/bootstrap-wysiwyg/master/bootstrap-wysiwyg.jsNow when you will visit this link you will get a link that can be used to call your javascript:Here is the final link:https://rawgit.com/mindmup/bootstrap-wysiwyg/master/bootstrap-wysiwyg.jsSimilarly if you host a css file you have to do it as mentioned above. It is the easiest way to get simple link to call your external css or javascript file hosted on github.I hope this is helpful.Referance URL: http://101helper.blogspot.com/2015/11/store-blogger-codes-on-github-boost-blogger-speed.htmlraw.github.com is not truely raw access to file asset,\nbut a view rendered by Rails.\nSo accessing raw.github.com is much heavier than needed.\nI don\'t know why raw.github.com is implemented as a Rails view.\nInstead of fix this route issue, GitHub added a X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff header.Workaround:Alternatively, if generating your markup server-side, you can just fetch and inject.\nFor example, in JSTL you could do this:They don\'t allow hotlinking for a reason, so probably bad form if you want to be a good citizen. I\'d suggest you cache that javascript and only actually re-fetch periodically as you see fit.
