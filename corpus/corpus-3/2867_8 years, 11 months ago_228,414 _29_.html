I have a WCF service and I want to expose it as both a RESTfull service and as a SOAP service. \nAnyone has done something like this before?You can expose the service in two different endpoints.\nthe SOAP one can use the binding that support SOAP e.g. basicHttpBinding, the RESTful one can use the webHttpBinding. I assume your REST service will be in JSON, in that case, you need to configure the two endpoints with the following behaviour configurationAn example of endpoint configuration in your scenario is so, the service will be available atApply [WebGet] to the operation contract to make it RESTful.\ne.g.Note, if the REST service is not in JSON, parameters of the operations can not contain complex type.For plain old XML as return format, this is an example that would work both for SOAP and XML.POX behavior for REST Plain Old XMLEndpointsService will be available atREST request\ntry it in browser,http://www.example.com/xml/accounts/A123SOAP request\nclient endpoint configuration for SOAP service after adding the service reference,in C#Another way of doing it is to expose two different service contract and each one with specific configuration. This may generate some duplicates at code level, however at the end of the day, you want to make it working.This post has already a very good answer by "Community wiki" and I also recommend to look at Rick Strahl\'s Web Blog, there are many good posts about WCF Rest like this.I used both to get this kind of MyService-service... Then I can use the REST-interface from jQuery or SOAP from Java.This is from my Web.Config:And this is my service-class (.svc-codebehind, no interfaces required):Actually I use only Json or Xml but those both are here for a demo purpose. Those are GET-requests to get data. To insert data I would use method with attributes:If you only want to develop a single web service and have it hosted on many different endpoints (i.e. SOAP + REST, with XML, JSON, CSV, HTML outputes). You should also consider using ServiceStack which I\'ve built for exactly this purpose where every service you develop is automatically available on on both SOAP and REST endpoints out-of-the-box without any configuration required.The Hello World example shows how to create a simple with service with just (no config required):No other configuration is required, and this service is immediately available with REST in:It also comes in-built with a friendly HTML output (when called with a HTTP client that has Accept:text/html e.g a browser) so you\'re able to better visualize the output of your services.Handling different REST verbs are also as trivial, here\'s a complete REST-service CRUD app in 1 page of C# (less than it would take to configure WCF ;):MSDN seems to have an article for this now: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb412196(v=vs.110).aspxIntro: By default, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) makes endpoints available only to SOAP clients. In How to: Create a Basic WCF Web HTTP Service, an endpoint is made available to non-SOAP clients. There may be times when you want to make the same contract available both ways, as a Web endpoint and as a SOAP endpoint. This topic shows an example of how to do this.
