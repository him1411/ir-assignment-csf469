I\'m making a pagination system (sort of like Facebook) where the content loads when the user scrolls to the bottom. I imagine the best way to do that is to find when the user is at the bottom of the page and run an ajax query to load more posts.The only problem is I don\'t know how to check if the user has scrolled to the bottom of the page with jQuery. Any ideas?I need to find a way to check when the user has scrolled to the bottom of the page with jQuery.Use the .scroll() event on window, like this:You can test it here, this takes the top scroll of the window, so how much it\'s scrolled down, adds the height of the visible window and checks if that equals the height of the overall content (document).  If you wanted to instead check if the user is near the bottom, it\'d look something like this:You can test that version here, just adjust that 100 to whatever pixel from the bottom you want to trigger on.Nick Craver\'s answer works fine, spare the issue that the value of $(document).height() varies by browser.To make it work on all browsers, use this function from James Padolsey:in place of $(document).height(), so that the final code is:For those using Nick\'s solution and getting repeated alerts / events firing, you could add a line of code above the alert example:This means that the code will only fire the first time you\'re within 100px of the bottom of the document. It won\'t repeat if you scroll back up and then back down, which may or may not be useful depending on what you\'re using Nick\'s code for.Further to the excellent accepted answer from Nick Craver, you can throttle the scroll event so that it is not fired so frequently thus increasing browser performance:I\'m not exactly sure why this has not been posted yet, but as per the documentation from MDN, the simplest way is by using native javascript properties:Returns true when you\'re at the bottom of any scrollable element. So simply using javascript:scrollHeight have wide support in browsers, from ie 8 to be more precise, while clientHeight and scrollTop are both supported by everyone. Even ie 6. This should be cross browser safe.Nick Craver\'s answer needs to be slightly modified to work on iOS 6 Safari Mobile and should be:Changing $(window).height() to window.innerHeight should be done because when the address bar is hidden an additional 60px are added to the window\'s height but using $(window).height() does not reflect this change, while using window.innerHeight does.Note: The window.innerHeight property also includes the horizontal scrollbar\'s height (if it is rendered), unlike $(window).height() which will not include the horizontal scrollbar\'s height. This is not a problem in Mobile Safari, but could cause unexpected behavior in other browsers or future versions of Mobile Safari. Changing == to >= could fix this for most common use cases.Read more about the window.innerHeight property hereHere is a piece of code that will help you debug your code, I tested the above answers and found them to be buggy.  I have test the followings on Chrome, IE, Firefox, IPad(Safari). I don\'t have any others installed to test...There may be a simpler solution, but I stopped at the point at which IT WORKEDIf you are still having problems with some rogue browser, here is some code to help you debug:I hope this will save someone some time.Here\'s a fairly simple approach:This is my two cents:It calculates distance scroll bar to bottom of element.\nEqual 0, if scroll bar has reached bottom. Please check this answerYou can do footerHeight - document.body.offsetHeight to see if you are near the footer or reached the footerPure JS with cross-browser and debouncing (Pretty good performance)Demo : http://jsbin.com/geherovena/edit?js,outputPS: Debouncer, getScrollXY, getDocHeight not written by meI just show how its work, And how I will doLet me show approch without JQuery. Simple JS function: Short example how to use it:Nick answers its fine but you will have functions which repeats itsself while scrolling or will not work at all if user has the window zoomed. I came up with an easy fix just math.round the first height and it works just as assumed.I used @ddanone answear and added Ajax call. }To stop repeated alert of Nick\'s answer
