How can I write a here document to a file in Bash script?Read the Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide Chapter 19. Here Documents.Here\'s an example which will write the contents to a file at /tmp/yourfilehereNote that the final \'EOF\' (The LimitString) should not have any whitespace in front of the word, because it means that the LimitString will not be recognized.In a shell script, you may want to use indentation to make the code readable, however this can have the undesirable effect of indenting the text within your here document. In this case, use <<- (followed by a dash) to disable leading tabs (Note that to test this you will need to replace the leading whitespace with a tab character, since I cannot print actual tab characters here.)If you don\'t want to interpret variables in the text, then use single quotes:To pipe the heredoc through a command pipeline:Output:... or to write the the heredoc to a file using sudo:Instead of using cat and I/O redirection it might be useful to use tee instead:It\'s more concise, plus unlike the redirect operator it can be combined with sudo if you need to write to files with root permissions.Note:The question (how to write a here document (aka heredoc) to a file in a bash script?) has (at least) 3 main independent dimensions or subquestions:(There are other dimensions/subquestions which I don\'t consider important. Consider editing this answer to add them!) Here are some of the more important combinations of the dimensions of the question listed above, with various different delimiting identifiers--there\'s nothing sacred about EOF, just make sure that the string you use as your delimiting identifier does not occur inside your heredoc:To overwrite an existing file (or write to a new file) that you own, substituting variable references inside the heredoc:To append an existing file (or write to a new file) that you own, substituting variable references inside the heredoc:To overwrite an existing file (or write to a new file) that you own, with the literal contents of the heredoc:To append an existing file (or write to a new file) that you own, with the literal contents of the heredoc:To overwrite an existing file (or write to a new file) owned by root, substituting variable references inside the heredoc:To append an existing file (or write to a new file) owned by user=foo, with the literal contents of the heredoc:For future people who may have this issue the following format worked:When root permissions are required for the destination file, use |sudo tee instead of >:To build on @Livven\'s answer, here are some useful combinations.variable substitution, leading tab retained, overwrite file, echo to stdoutno variable substitution, leading tab retained, overwrite file, echo to stdoutvariable substitution, leading tab removed, overwrite file, echo to stdoutvariable substitution, leading tab retained, append to file, echo to stdoutvariable substitution, leading tab retained, overwrite file, no echo to stdoutthe above can be combined with sudo as wellAs instance you could use it:First(making ssh connection):Second(executing commands):Third(executing commands):Forth(using variables):
