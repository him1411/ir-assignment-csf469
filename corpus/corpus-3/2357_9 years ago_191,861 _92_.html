You can\'t do "public beta testing" -- pre-releasing to the public.In 2014 along with iOS 8 and XCode 6 apple introduced Beta Testing of iOS App using iTunes Connect.You can upload your build to iTunes connect and invite testers using their mail id\'s. You can invite up to 2000 external testers using just their email address. And they can install the beta app through TestFlightUsing testflight :1) create the ipa file by development certificate2) upload the ipa file on testflight3) Now, to identify the device to be tested on , add the device id on apple account and refresh your development certificate. Download the updated certificate and upload it on testflight website. Check the device id you are getting.4) Now email the ipa file to the testers. 5) While downloading the ipa file, if the testers are not getting any warnings, this means the device token + provisioning profile has been verified. So, the testers can now download the ipa file on device and do the testing job...With iOS 8, Xcode 6, iTunes Connect and TestFlight you don\'t need UDIDs and Ad Hocs anymore. You will just need an Apple ID from your beta tester. Right now you can only beta test your app with 25 internal testers, but soon 1000 external testers will be available too. This blog post shows you how to setup a beta test with internal testers.There\'s a relatively new service called HockeyApp, which seems to rival TestFlight, however they claim to give you access to unlimited users, but it does cost some $$ unlike TestFlight which has now been integrated directly into iTunes Connect.(As the official guide is still missing in this thread..)TestFlight, acquired by Apple and now (iOS8+) available for beta testing makes it easy to hand your app to beta testers without the need to collect device UUIDs beforehand (you only need email addresses of your testers). An extensive guide explaining all necessary steps may be found in the iTunes Connect Developer Guide.You can use AppBox, A mac application that uses your dropbox account to distribute you ad-hoc and enterprise apps, if you want to install form any other browser.Dashboard** Will be available in future versionUpload IPA\nArchive and Upload IPA\nUploading IPA\n
