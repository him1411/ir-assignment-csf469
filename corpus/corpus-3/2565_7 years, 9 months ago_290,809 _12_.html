Is there a way to do something like PHPs $array[] = \'foo\'; in bash vs doing:Yes there is:Bash Reference Manual:In the context where an assignment statement is assigning a value to a shell variable or array index (see Arrays), the \xe2\x80\x98+=\xe2\x80\x99 operator can be used to append to or add to the variable\'s previous value.As Dumb Guy points out, it\'s important to note whether the array starts at zero and is sequential. Since you can make assignments to and unset non-contiguous indices ${#array[@]} is not always the next item at the end of the array.Here\'s how to get the last index:That illustrates how to get the last element of an array. You\'ll often see this:As you can see, because we\'re dealing with a sparse array, this isn\'t the last element. This works on both sparse and contiguous arrays, though:If you array is always sequential and starts at 0, then you can do this:array[${#array[@]}] = \'foo\'${#array_name[@]} gets the length of the arrayWith an indexed array, you can to something like this:
