In Android, an ImageView is a rectangle by default. How can I make it a rounded rectangle (clip off all 4 corners of my Bitmap to be rounded rectangles) in the ImageView? This is pretty late in response, but for anyone else that is looking for this, you can do the following code to manually round the corners of your images.http://www.ruibm.com/?p=184This isn\'t my code, but I\'ve used it and it\'s works wonderfully. I used it as a helper within an ImageHelper class and extended it just a bit to pass in the amount of feathering I need for a given image.Final code looks like this:Hope this helps someone!While the above answer works, Romain Guy (a core Android developer) shows a better method in his blog which uses less memory by using a shader not creating a copy of the bitmap. The general gist of the functionality is here:The advantages of this over other methods is that it:I\'ve created a RoundedImageView based off this code that wraps this logic into an ImageView and adds proper ScaleType support and an optional rounded border.In the v21 of the Support library there is now a solution to this: it\'s called RoundedBitmapDrawable.It\'s basically just like a normal Drawable except you give it a corner radius for the clipping with:So, starting with Bitmap src and a target ImageView, it would look something like this:I found that both methods were very helpful in coming up with a working solution. Here is my composite version, that is pixel independent and allows you to have some square corners with the rest of the corners having the same radius (which is the usual use case). \nWith thanks to both of the solutions above:Also, I overrode ImageView to put this in so I could define it in xml.\nYou may want to add in some of the logic that the super call makes here, but I\'ve commented it as it\'s not helpful in my case.Hope this helps!Rounded image Using ImageLoader hereCreate DisplayImageOptions:Or you can user Picasso Library from Square.you can download RoundedTransformation file here\nhereAnother easy way is to use a CardView with the corner radius and an ImageView inside:Clipping to rounded shapes was added to the View class in API 21.Just do this:res/drawable/round_outline.xmlUnfortunately, there\'s a bug and that XML attribute is not recognized. Luckily, we can still set up clipping in Java:Here\'s what it will look like:Note:This method works for any drawable shape (not just rounded). It will clip the ImageView to whatever shape outline you\'ve defined in your Drawable xml.Special note about ImageViewssetClipToOutline() only works when the View\'s background is set to a shape drawable. If this background shape exists, View treats the shape\'s outline as the borders for clipping and shadowing purposes.This means, if you want to use setClipToOutline() to round the corners on an ImageView, your image must be set using android:src instead of android:background (since background must be set to your rounded shape). If you MUST use background to set your image instead of src, you can use this workaround:I have done by Custom ImageView:How to use:Output:Hope this would help you.As all the answers seemed too complicated for me just for round corners I thought and came to another solution which I think is worth to share, just with XML in case you have some space around the image:Create a bordered shape with transparent content like this:Then in a RelativeLayout you can first place your image and then in the same location above the shape with another ImageView. The cover-shape should be larger in size by the amount of the border width. Be careful to take a larger corner radius as the outer radius is defined but the inner radius is what covers your image. Hope it helps somebody, too.Edit as per CQM request the relative layout example:My implementation of ImageView with rounded corners widget, that (down||up)sizes image to required dimensions. It utilizes code form CaspNZ.You should extend ImageView and draw your own rounded rectangle. If you want a frame around the image you could also superimpose the rounded frame on top of the image view in the layout.[edit]Superimpose the frame on to op the original image, by using a FrameLayout for example. The first element of the FrameLayout will be the image you want to diplay rounded. Then add another ImageView with the frame. The second ImageView will be displayed on top of the original ImageView and thus Android will draw it\'s contents above the orignal ImageView.Props to George Walters II above, I just took his answer and extended it a bit to support rounding individual corners differently.  This could be optimized a bit further (some of the target rects overlap), but not a whole lot.I know this thread is a bit old, but its one of the top results for queries on Google for how to round corners of ImageViews on Android.Romain Guy is where it\'s at.Minified version as follows.The following creates a rounded rectangle layout object that draws a rounded rectangle around any child objects that are placed in it.  It also demonstrates how to create views and layouts programmatically without using the layout xml files.The class for RoundedRectangle layout object is as defined here:Thanks a lot to first answer. Here is modified version to convert a rectangular image into a square one (and rounded) and fill color is being passed as parameter.why not do clipping in draw()?Here is my solution:code:Apply a shape to your imageView as below:it may be helpful to you friend.This pure xml solution was good enough in my case. http://www.techrepublic.com/article/pro-tip-round-corners-on-an-android-imageview-with-this-hack/EDITHere\'s the answer in a nutshell:In the /res/drawable folder, create a frame.xml file. In it, we define a simple rectangle with rounded corners and a transparent center.In your layout file you add a LinearLayout that contains a standard ImageView, as well as a nested FrameLayout. The FrameLayout uses padding and the custom drawable to give the illusion of rounded corners.Here is a simple example overriding imageView, you can then also use it in layout designer to preview.}This is for fast solution. Radius is used on all corners and is based of percentage of bitmap width.I just overrided setImageDrawable and used support v4 method for rounded bitmap drawable.Usage:Preview with imageView and custom imageView:With the help of glide library and RoundedBitmapDrawableFactory class it\'s easy to achieve. You may need to create circular placeholder image.if your image is on internet the best way is using glide and RoundedBitmapDrawableFactory (from API 21 - but available in support library) like so:You can try this library - RoundedImageViewIt is: A fast ImageView that supports rounded corners, ovals, and circles. A full superset of CircleImageView.I\'ve used it in my project, and it is very easy.If any of you are facing this problem Most probably , you are using Android Studio. Due to image re-size and all in Android Studio ,you may encounter this problem. An easy fix to this problem is to decrease the radius of circle in drawCircle(). In my case i use this fixUsing canvas.drawCircle(100, 100, 90, paint); instead of canvas.drawCircle(100, 100, 100, paint); this will definitely solve your problem. Here is finally edited code:-Use this to get circular image with border-Answer for the question that is redirected here:\n"How to create a circular ImageView in Android?"If you\'re looking for a fast but dirty solution you can use this lib by Vincent Mi.I\'m using a custom view that I layout on top of the other ones and that just draws the 4 small inverted corners in the same color as the background. Advantages:Code: This isn\'t exactly the answer, but it\'s a solution that is similar. It may help people who were in the same boat as I was.My image, an application logo, had a transparent background, and I was applying an XML gradient as the image background. I added the necessary padding/margins to the imageView in XML, then added this as my background:Quite a lot of answers!I followed this example which a few people have kinda suggested too: http://www.techrepublic.com/article/pro-tip-round-corners-on-an-android-imageview-with-this-hack/However, what I needed was a coloured circle, behind a transparent image. For anyone who is interested in doing the same...1) Set the FrameLayout to the width and height - in my case the size of the image (50dp). \n2) Place the ImageView that has the src = "@drawable/...", above the ImageView that has the image. Give it an id, in my case I called it iconShape\n3) Drawable mask.xml should have a solid colour of #ffffffff\n4) If you want to dynamically change the circle colour in your code, do
