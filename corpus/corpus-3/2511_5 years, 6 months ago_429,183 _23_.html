I have 5 addons / extensions for FF, Chrome, IE, Opera and Safari. I need the code to recognize the user browser and redirect (on click in an install button) to download the corresponding addon.Googling for browser reliable detection often results in checking the User agent string. This method is not reliable, because it\'s trivial to spoof this value.\nI\'ve written a method to detect browsers by duck-typing.Only use the browser detection method if it\'s truly necessary, such as showing browser-specific instructions to install an extension. Use feature detection when possible.Demo: https://jsfiddle.net/311aLtkz/The previous method depended on properties of the rendering engine (-moz-box-sizing and -webkit-transform) to detect the browser. These prefixes will eventually be dropped, so to make detection even more robust, I switched to browser-specific characteristics:Updated in November 2016 to include detection of Safari browsers from 9.1.3 and upwardsYou can try following way to check Browser version.    And if you need to know only IE Browser version then you can follow below code. This code working well for version IE6 to IE11I know it may be overkill to use a lib for that, but just to enrich the thread, you could check is.js way of doing this:In case anyone finds this useful, I\'ve made Rob W\'s answer into a function that returns the browser string rather than having multiple variables floating about. Since the browser also can\'t really change without loading all over again, I\'ve made it cache the result to prevent it from needing to work it out the next time the function is called.Here\'s a 2016 adjusted version of Rob\'s answer, including Microsoft Edge and detection of Blink:(edit: I updated Rob\'s answer above with this information.)The beauty of this approach is that it relies on browser engine properties, so it covers even derivative browsers, such as Yandex or Vivaldi, which are practically compatible with the major browsers whose engines they use. The exception is Opera, which relies on user agent sniffing, but today (i.e. ver. 15 and up) even Opera is itself only a shell for Blink.you can use try and catch to use the different browser error messages.\nIE and edge were mixed up, but I used the duck typing from Rob W.There is also a less "hacky" method which works for all popular browsers.\nGoogle has included a browser-check in their Closure Library. In particular, have a look at goog.userAgent and goog.userAgent.product. In this way, you are also up to date if something changes in the way the browsers present themselves (given that you always run the latest version of the closure compiler.)Simple single line of javascript code will give you name of browser:This combines both Rob\'s original answer and Pilau\'s update for 2016 If you need to know what is the numeric version of some particular browser you can use the following snippet. Currently it will tell you the version of Chrome/Chromium/Firefox:Thank you, everybody. I tested the code snippets here on the recent browser: Chrome 55, Firefox 50, IE 11 and Edge 38, and I came up with the following combination that worked for me for all of them. I\'m sure it can be improved, but it\'s a quick solution for whoever needs:It adds a CSS class to the HTML, with the name of the browser.
