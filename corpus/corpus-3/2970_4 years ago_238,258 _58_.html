After downloading the EF6 by nuget and try to run my project, it returns the following error:No Entity Framework provider found for the ADO.NET provider with invariant name \'System.Data.SqlClient\'. Make sure the provider is registered in the \'entityFramework\' section of the application config file. See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=260882 for more information.I just got into the same problem and it looks like EntityFramework although installed from NuGet Package Manager was not correctly installed in the project.I managed to fix it by running the following command on Package Manager Console:You\'ve added EF to a class library project, you also need to add it to the project that references it (your console app, website or whatever).You don\'t need to install Entity Framework in your Console application, you just need to add a reference to the assembly EntityFramework.SqlServer.dll. You can copy this assembly from the Class Library project that uses Entity Framework to a LIB folder and add a reference to it. In summary:I hope it helps.You can also see this message if you forget to include "EntityFramework.SqlServer.dll". It appears to be a newly added file in EF6. Initially I hadn\'t included it in my merge module and ran into the problem listed here.When you install Entity Framework 6 through Nuget. EntityFramework.SqlServer sometime miss for another executable. Simply add the Nuget package to that project.Sometimes above does not work for Test ProjectTo solve this issue in Test Project just place this Method inside Test Project:This method is never been called, but as my observations, the compiler will remove all "unnecessary" assemblies and without using the EntityFramework.SqlServer stuff the test fails. Instead of adding EntityFramework.SqlServer to host project you can ensure a static reference to it from your Model/entity project like this This will make the build process include the assembly with the host project. More info on my blog\nhttp://andersmalmgren.com/2014/08/20/implicit-dependencies-and-copy-local-fails-to-copy/None of these worked for me. I did find the solution in another stackoverflow question. I\'ll add it here for easy reference:You need to make a reference, so it will be copied in den application\n  path. Because later it will be referenced in runtime. So you don\'t\n  need to copy any files.Add this function to database context class in the library class and the missing DLL EntityFramework.SqlServer.dll will be copied to the correct places..I got the same error while using Entity Framework 6 with SQL Server Compact 4.0. The article on MSDN for Entity Framework Providers for EF6 was helpful. Running the respective provider commands as nuget packages at Package Manager Console might solve the problem, as also NuGet packages will automatically add registrations to the config file. I ran PM> Install-Package EntityFramework.SqlServerCompact to solve the problem.When the error happens in tests projects the prettiest solution is to decorate the test class with:Ran into this problem today when working with a set of web services, each in different projects, and a separate project containing integration tests for some of those services. I\'ve been using this setup for some time with EF5, without needing to include references to EF from the Integration Test Project. Now, after upgrading to EF6, it seems I need to include a reference to EF6 in the integration test project too, even though it is not used there (pretty much as pointed out above by user3004275).Indications you\'re facing the same problem:The third point is what threw me off for a while, and I\'m still not sure why this is required. Adding a ref to EF6 in my Integration Test project solved it in any case... I just run into this problem today. I have data repository class library with EF63 NuGet package and console application for testing, which have reference only to class library project. I created very simple post-build command, which copies EntityFramework.SqlServer.dll from class library\'s Bin\\Debug folder to console application\'s Bin\\Debug folder and problem solved. Do not forget to add entityFramework section to console application\'s .config file.Add below to your app.config.I have just re-installed the Entity Framework using Nuget.\nAnd follow the instruction written on the link below :\nhttp://robsneuron.blogspot.in/2013/11/entity-framework-upgrade-to-6.htmlI think the problem will get solved.You should force a static reference to the EntityFramework.SqlServer.dll assembly, but instead of putting a dummy code, you can do this in a more beautiful way:If you already have a DbConfiguration class:If you don\'t have a DbConfiguration class you must put the following code at app startup (before EF is used):I tried almost all the above and nothing worked.Only when I set the referenced DLLs in the Default Project EntityFramework and EntityFramework.SqlServer properties Copy Local to True did it start working!I had a related issue when migrating from a CE db over to Sql Server on Azure.  Just wasted 4 hrs trying to solve this.  Hopefully this may save someone a similar fate.  For me, I had a reference to SqlCE in my packages.config file.  Removing it solved my entire issue and allowed me to use migrations.  Yay Microsoft for another tech with unnecessarily complex setup and config issues. Deleting the BIN-Folder did it for meAlso, make sure you startup project is the project that contains your dbcontext (or relevant app.config). Mine was trying to start up a website project which didnt have all the necessary configuration settings.I had the same issue, just copied the App Config file from the project that contained the DBContext to my test project I had the identical exception thrown. I included and everything is back to working again .. As message shows that we need to add provider System.Data.SqlClient that\'s why we need to install nuget package of EntityFramework that has two dll but if we are developing only console application then we just need to add reference of EntityFramework.SqlServer.dlleverybody I need your Attention that two dll EntityFramework.dll And EntityFramework.SqlServer.dll are DataAccess layer Library And it is not Logical to Use them in view or any other layer.it solves your problem but it is not logical.logical way is that enitiess attribute remove and replace them with Fluent API.this is real solutionNote: I had this problem while Generating Database Sql from Model. It had created all the tables fine but wouldn\'t export the changes. What you need to notice is that this error is generated when you try to export the sql using the DDL Generation Template as SSDLtoSQL10. It is expecting MySQL connection here so make sure you select from the drop down DDL Generation Template SSDLtoMySQL on the Model properties. Spent a whole day on this !I had one console application and class library. In class library I created Entity Data Model (right click to Class Library > Add > New Item > Data > ADO.NET Entity Data Model 6.0) and put reference inside console application. So, you have console application which has reference to class library and inside class library you have EF model. I had the same error when I tried to get some records from the table. I resolved this issue by following these steps:That\'s all I had to do and everything worked perfect.I hope it helped.In my case, everything was working properly then suddenly stopped worked because I think Resharper altered some changes which caused the problem. My project was divided into the data layer, service and presentation layer. I had Entity framework installed and referenced in my data layer but still the error didn\'t go away. Uninstalling and reinstalling didn\'t work either. Finally, I solved it by making the data layer the Startup project, making migration, updating the database and changing the Startup project back to my presentation layer.Expand YourModel.edmx file and open YourModel.Context.cs class under YourModel.Context.tt. I added the following line in the using section and the error was fixed for me.using SqlProviderServices = System.Data.Entity.SqlServer.SqlProviderServices;You may have to add this line to the file each time the file is auto generated.
