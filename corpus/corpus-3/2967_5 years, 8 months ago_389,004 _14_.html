I looked into the Python os interface, but was unable to locate a method to move a file. How would I do the equivalent of $ mv ... in Python?os.rename() or shutil.move()Both employ the same syntax:Note that in both cases the directory in which the new file is being created must already exist, (but, on Windows, a file with that name must not or an exception will be raised). Note also, you must include the file name (file.foo) in both the source and destination arguments. If it is changed, the file will be renamed as well as moved.As has been noted in comments on other answers, shutil.move simply calls os.rename in most cases. However, if the destination is on a different disk than the source, it will instead copy and then delete the source file.Although os.rename() and shutil.move() will both rename files, the command that is closest to the Unix mv command is shutil.move().  The difference is that os.rename() doesn\'t work if the source and destination are on different disks, while shutil.move() doesn\'t care what disk the files are on.For either the os.rename or shutil.move you will need to import the module. \nNo * character is necessary to get all the files moved.  We have a folder at /opt/awesome called source with one file named awesome.txt.  We used os.listdir to see that the folder name in fact changed.\nHere\'s the shutil moving the destination back to source.  This time I checked inside the source folder to be sure the awesome.txt file I created exists.  It is there :) Now we have moved a folder and its files from a source to a destination and back again.  The accepted answer is not the right one, because the question is not about renaming a file into a file, but moving many files into a directory. shutil.move will do the work, but for this purpose os.rename is useless (as stated on comments) because destination must have an explicit file name.This is what I\'m using at the moment:Now fully functional. Hope this helps you.
