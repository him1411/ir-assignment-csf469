Can anyone explain the difference between Server.MapPath("."), Server.MapPath("~"), Server.MapPath(@"\\") and Server.MapPath("/")?Server.MapPath specifies the relative or virtual path to map to a physical directory.An example:Let\'s say you pointed a web site application (http://www.example.com/) toand installed your shop application (sub web as virtual directory in IIS, marked as application) in For example, if you call Server.MapPath() in following request:then:If Path starts with either a forward slash (/) or backward slash (\\), the MapPath() returns a path as if Path was a full, virtual path. If Path doesn\'t start with a slash, the MapPath() returns a path relative to the directory of the request being processed.Note: in C#, @ is the verbatim literal string operator meaning that the string should be used "as is" and not be processed for escape sequences.FootnotesJust to expand on @splattne\'s answer a little:MapPath(string virtualPath) calls the following:MapPath(VirtualPath virtualPath) in turn calls MapPath(VirtualPath virtualPath, VirtualPath baseVirtualDir, bool allowCrossAppMapping) which contains the following:So if you call MapPath(null) or MapPath(""), you are effectively calling MapPath(".")
