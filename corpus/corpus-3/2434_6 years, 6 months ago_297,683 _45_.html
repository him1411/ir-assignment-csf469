I have been reading some source code and in several places I have seen the usage of assert. What does it mean exactly? What is its usage?The assert statement exists in almost every programming language. When you do...... you\'re telling the program to test that condition, and trigger an error if the condition is false.In Python, it\'s roughly equivalent to this:Try it in the Python shell:Assertions can include an optional message, and you can disable them when you\'re done debugging. See here for the relevant documentation.Watch out for the parentheses. As has been pointed out above, in Python 3, assert is still a statement, so by analogy with print(..), one may extrapolate the same to assert(..) or raise(..) but you shouldn\'t.This is important because:won\'t work, unlikeThe reason the first one will not work is that bool( (False, "Houston we\'ve got a problem") ) evaluates to True.In the statement assert(False), these are just redundant parentheses around False, which evaluate to their contents. But with assert(False,) the parentheses are now a tuple, and a non-empty tuple evaluates to True in a boolean context.As other answers have noted, assert is similar to throwing an exception if a given condition isn\'t true. An important difference is that assert statements get ignored if you compile your code with the optimization option. The documentation says that assert expression can better be described as being equivalent to This can be useful if you want to thoroughly test your code, then release an optimized version when you\'re happy that none of your assertion cases fail - when optimization is on, the __debug__ variable becomes False and the conditions will stop getting evaluated. This feature can also catch you out if you\'re relying on the asserts and don\'t realize they\'ve disappeared.Others have already given you links to documentation.You can try the following in a interactive shell:The first statement does nothing, while the second raises an exception. This is the first hint: asserts are useful to check conditions that should be true in a given position of your code (usually, the beginning (preconditions) and the end of a function (postconditions)).Asserts are actually highly tied to programming by contract, which is a very useful engineering practice:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract.The assert statement has two forms.The simple form, assert <expression>, is equivalent toThe extended form, assert <expression1>, <expression2>, is equivalent toAssertions are a systematic way to check that the internal state of a program is as the programmer expected, with the goal of catching bugs. See the example below.From docs:Here you can read more: http://docs.python.org/release/2.5.2/ref/assert.htmlThe goal of an assertion in Python is to inform developers about unrecoverable errors in a program.Assertions are not intended to signal expected error conditions, like \xe2\x80\x9cfile not found\xe2\x80\x9d, where a user can take corrective action (or just try again).Another way to look at it is to say that assertions are internal self-checks in your code. They work by declaring some conditions as impossible in your code. If these conditions don\xe2\x80\x99t hold that means there\xe2\x80\x99s a bug in the program.If your program is bug-free, these conditions will never occur. But if one of them does occur the program will crash with an assertion error telling you exactly which \xe2\x80\x9cimpossible\xe2\x80\x9d condition was triggered. This makes it much easier to track down and fix bugs in your programs.Here\xe2\x80\x99s a summary from a tutorial on Python\xe2\x80\x99s assertions I wrote:Python\xe2\x80\x99s assert statement is a debugging aid, not a mechanism for handling run-time errors. The goal of using assertions is to let developers find the likely root cause of a bug more quickly. An assertion error should never be raised unless there\xe2\x80\x99s a bug in your program.Here is a simple example, save this in file (let\'s say b.py)and the result when $python b.pyIf you ever want to know exactly what a reserved function does in python, type in help(enter_keyword)Make sure if you are entering a reserved keyword that you enter it as a string. if the statement after assert  is true then the program continues , but if the statement after assert is false then the program gives an error. Simple as that.e.g.:Can be used to ensure parameters are passed in the function call.format :\n  assert Expression[,arguments]\nWhen assert encounters a statement,Python evaluates the expression.If the statement is not true,an exception is raised(assertionError).\nIf the assertion fails, Python uses ArgumentExpression as the argument for the AssertionError. AssertionError exceptions can be caught and handled like any other exception using the try-except statement, but if not handled, they will terminate the program and produce a traceback.\nExample:When the above code is executed, it produces the following result:Basically the assert keyword meaning is that if the condition is not true then it through an assertionerror else it continue for example in python.code-1OUTPUT: code-2OUTPUT:
