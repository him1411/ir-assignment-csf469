The code below gives me the current time. But it does not tell anything about milliseconds.  I get date in the format 2009-09-22 16:47:08 (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:Sec).But I want to retrieve the current time in the format 2009-09-22 16:47:08.128 ((YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:Sec.Ms).where 128 tells the millisecond.SimpleTextFormat will work fine. Here the lowest unit of time is second, but how do I get millisecond as well?A Java one linerin JDK8 styleYou only have to add the millisecond field in your date format string:The API doc of SimpleDateFormat describes the format string in detail.try this:-http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.htmlor2016-05-06T23:24:25.694Z2016-05-06 19:24:25.694In Java 8 and later, we have the java.time framework built into Java 8 and later. These new classes supplant the troublesome old java.util.Date/.Calendar classes. The new classes are inspired by the highly successful Joda-Time framework, intended as its successor, similar in concept but re-architected. Defined by JSR 310. Extended by the ThreeTen-Extra project. See the Tutorial.Be aware that java.time is capable of nanosecond resolution (9 decimal places in fraction of second), versus the millisecond resolution (3 decimal places) of both java.util.Date & Joda-Time. So when formatting to display only 3 decimal places, you could be hiding data.If you want to eliminate any microseconds or nanoseconds from your data, truncate.The java.time classes use ISO 8601 format by default when parsing/generating strings. A Z at the end is short for Zulu, and means UTC. An Instant represents a moment on the timeline in UTC with resolution of up to nanoseconds. Capturing the current moment in Java 8 is limited to milliseconds, with a new implementation in Java 9 capturing up to nanoseconds depending on your computer\xe2\x80\x99s hardware clock\xe2\x80\x99s abilities.2016-05-06T23:24:25.694ZReplace the T in the middle with a space, and the Z with nothing, to get your desired output. 2016-05-06 23:24:25.694As you don\'t care about including the offset or time zone, make a "local" date-time unrelated to any particular locality.The highly successful Joda-Time library was the inspiration for the java.time framework. Advisable to migrate to java.time when convenient.The ISO 8601 format includes milliseconds, and is the default for the Joda-Time 2.4 library.When run\xe2\x80\xa6Also, you can ask for the milliseconds fraction-of-a-second as a number, if needed:To complement the above answers, here is a small working example of a program that prints the current time and date, including milliseconds.I would use something like this:Variable dateTime could be any date and/or time value, see JavaDoc for Formatter.You can simply get it in the format you want.
