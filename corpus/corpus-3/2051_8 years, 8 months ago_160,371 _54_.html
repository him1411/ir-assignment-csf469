The answers to How to modify existing, unpushed commits? describe a way to amend previous commit messages that haven\'t yet been pushed upstream.  The new messages inherit the timestamps of the original commits.  This seems logical, but is there a way to also re-set the times?Use git filter-branch with an env filter that sets GIT_AUTHOR_DATE and GIT_COMMITTER_DATE for the specific hash of the commit you\'re looking to fix.This will invalidate that and all future hashes.Example:If you wanted to change the dates of commit 119f9ecf58069b265ab22f1f97d2b648faf932e0, you could do so with something like this:You can do an interactive rebase and choose edit for the commit whose date you would like to alter.
