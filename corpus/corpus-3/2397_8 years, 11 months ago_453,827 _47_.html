Conditions: do not modifiy the original lists; JDK only, no external libraries. Bonus points for a one-liner or a JDK 1.3 version.Is there a simpler way than:Off the top of my head, I can shorten it by one line:In Java 8:You could use the Apache commons-collections library:Probably not simpler, but intriguing and ugly:Don\'t use it in production code... ;)One of your requirements is to preserve the original lists.  If you create a new list and use addAll(), you are effectively doubling the number of references to the objects in your lists.  This could lead to memory problems if your lists are very large.If you don\'t need to modify the concatenated result, you can avoid this using a custom list implementation.  The custom implementation class is more than one line, obviously...but using it is short and sweet.CompositeUnmodifiableList.java:Usage:Not simpler, but without resizing overhead:Found this question looking to concatenate arbitrary amount of lists, not minding external libraries. So, perhaps it will help someone else:Useful if you want to apply the same logic to a number of different collections in one for().Another Java 8 one-liner:As a bonus, since Stream.of() is variadic, you may concatenate as many lists as you like.This is simple and just one line, but will add the contents of listTwo to listOne. Do you really need to put the contents in a third list?A little shorter would be:Slightly simpler:Here is a java 8 solution using two lines:Be aware that this method should not be used ifdue to side effect considerations.Both of the above conditions do not apply for the above case of joining two lists, so this is safe.Based on this answer to another question.You can do a oneliner if the target list is predeclared.The proposed solution is for three lists though it can be applied for two lists as well. In Java 8 we can make use of Stream.of or Stream.concat as:Stream.concat takes two streams as input and creates a lazily concatenated stream whose elements are all the elements of the first stream followed by all the elements of the second stream. As we have three lists we have used this method (Stream.concat) two times.We can also write a utility class (say StringUtils) with a method that takes any number of lists (using varargs) and returns a concatenated list as:Then we can make use of this method as:another one liner solution using Java8 stream, since flatMap solution is already posted, here is a solution without flatMaporcodeoutputIn Java 8 (the other way):The smartest in my opinion:Java 8 version with support for joining by object key:You could do it with a static import and a helper classnb the generification of this class could probably be improvedThen you can do things likeUse a Helper class.I suggest:I\'m not claiming that it\'s simple, but you mentioned bonus for one-liners ;-)No way near one-liner, but I think this is the simplest:Here\'s an approach using streams and java 8 if your lists have different types and you want to combine them to a list of another type.Oh, you have to implement the combine method :-)I can\'t improve on the two-liner in the general case without introducing your own utility method, but if you do have lists of Strings and you\'re willing to assume those Strings don\'t contain commas, you can pull this long one-liner:If you drop the generics, this should be JDK 1.4 compliant (though I haven\'t tested that). Also not recommended for production code ;-)
