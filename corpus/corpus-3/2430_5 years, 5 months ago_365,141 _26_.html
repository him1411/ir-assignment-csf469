It seems the minlength attribute for an <input> field doesn\'t work. Is there any other attribute in HTML5 with the help of which I can set the minimal length of a value for fields?You can use the pattern attribute. The required attribute is also needed, otherwise an input field with an empty value will be excluded from constraint validation.If you want to create the option to use the pattern for "empty, or minimum length", you could do the following:There is a minlength property in HTML5 spec now, as well as the validity.tooShort interface.P.S. This hasn\'t been implemented as of Firefox 33.0a1 and Chrome 38.0.2071.0 canary.Update: HTML5 has been stable and Chrome has minlength and validity.tooShort enabled by default since version 40.Here is HTML5-only solution (if you want minlength 5, maxlength 10 character validation)http://jsfiddle.net/xhqsB/102/Yes, there it is. It\'s like maxlength. W3.org documentation:\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#attr-fe-minlengthIn case minlength doesn\'t work, use the pattern attribute as mentioned by @Pumbaa80 for the input tag.For textarea:\nFor setting max; use maxlength and for min go to this link.You will find here both for max and min.Not HTML5, but practical anyway: if you happen to use AngularJS, you can use ng-minlength for both inputs and textareas. See also this Plunk.minLength attribute (unlike maxLength) does not exist natively in HTML5.\nHowever there a some ways to validate a field if it contains less than x characters.An example is given using jQuery at this link : http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Methods/minlengthMy solution for textarea using jQuery and combining HTML5 required validation to check the minimum length.New version:It extends the use (textarea and input) and fixes bugs.I notice that sometimes in chrome when autofill is on and the fields are field by the autofill browser build in method,\n it bypass the minlength validation rules, so in this case you will have to disable autofill by the following attribute:autocomplete="off" I wrote this JavaScript code, [minlength.js]:In my case, in which I validate the most at hand and using Firefox (43.0.4), minlength and validity.tooShort are not available unfortunately.But since I only need to have minimum lengths stored to proceed, an easy and handy way is to assign this value to another valid attribute of the input tag. In that case then, you can use min, max, and step of other properly from non-text type inputs (type="number"), but still inputs.Rather than storing those limits in an array it\'s easier to find it stored in the same input instead of getting the element id to match the array index.Add both a max and a min value you can specify the range of allowed values:
