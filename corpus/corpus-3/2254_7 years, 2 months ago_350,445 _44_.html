How do I read an embedded resource (text file) using StreamReader and return it as a string?  My current script uses a Windows form and textbox that allows the user to find and replace text in a text file that is not embedded. You can use the Assembly.GetManifestResourceStream Method:Add the following usingSet property of relevant file:\nParameter Build Action with value Embedded ResourceUse the following code\n\nresourceName is the name of one of the resources embedded in assembly.\nFor example, if you embed a text file named "MyFile.txt" that is placed in the root of a project with default namespace "MyCompany.MyProduct", then resourceName is "MyCompany.MyProduct.MyFile.txt".\nYou can get a list of all resources in an assembly using the Assembly.GetManifestResourceNames Method.You can add a file as a resource using two separate methods.The C# code required to access the file is different, depending on the method used to add the file in the first place.Add the file to your project, then set the type to Embedded Resource.NOTE: If you add the file using this method, you can use GetManifestResourceStream to access it (see answer from @dtb).Open up the Resources.resx file, use the dropdown box to add the file, set Access Modifier to public.NOTE: If you add the file using this method, you can use Properties.Resources to access it (see answer from @Night Walker).Take a look at this page: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/319292Basically, you use System.Reflection to get a reference to the current Assembly. Then, you use GetManifestResourceStream().Example, from the page I posted:Note: need to add using System.Reflection; for this to workIn Visual Studio you can directly embed access to a file resource via the Resources tab of the Project properties ("Analytics" in this example). \nThe resulting file can then be accessed as a byte array by Should you need it as a stream, then ( from https://stackoverflow.com/a/4736185/432976 )When you added the file to the resources, you should select its Access Modifiers as public than you can make something like following.CLIST01 is the name of the embedded file.Actually you can go to the resources.Designer.cs  and see what is the name of the getter.I know it is an old thread, but this is what worked for me :read the text like this :The text that I added to the resources: \'SomeText.txt\'You can also use this simplified version of @dtb\'s answer:I read an embedded resource text file use:Sample:Something I learned just now is that your file is not allowed to have a "." (dot) in the filename.Templates.plainEmailBodyTemplate-en.txt   --> Works!!!\nTemplates.plainEmailBodyTemplate.en.txt   --> doesn\'t work via GetManifestResourceStream()Probably because the framework gets confused over namespaces vs filename...I know this is old, but I just wanted to point out for NETMF (.Net MicroFramework), you can easily do this:Since NETMF doesn\'t have GetManifestResourceStreamBy all your powers combined I use this helper class for reading resources from any assembly and any namespace in a generic way.I was annoyed that you had to always include the namespace and the folder in the string. I wanted to simplify the access to the embedded resources. This is why I wrote this little class. Feel free to use and improve!Usage:Class:adding e.g. Testfile.sql\nProject Menu -> Properties -> Resources -> Add Existing filePut the following inside the Generated Code BlockWhat this achieved was this, a method to combine multiple txt files, and read their embedded data, inside a single rich text box. which was my desired effect with this sample of Code.
