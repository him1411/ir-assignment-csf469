Consider a method signature like:Can Mockito help return the same string that the method received?You can create an Answer in Mockito. Let\'s assume, we have an interface named Application with a method myFunction.Here is the test method with a Mockito answer:Since Mockito 1.9.5 and Java 8 there is an even easier way by using the returnsFirstArg() method instead of the Answer object (thanks to @David Wallace for mentioning it):when(myMock.myFunction(anyString())).then(returnsFirstArg());If you have Mockito 1.9.5 or higher, there is a new static method that can make the Answer object for you.  You need to write something likeor alternativelyNote that the returnsFirstArg() method is static in the AdditionalAnswers class, which is new to Mockito 1.9.5; so you\'ll need the right static import.I had a very similar problem. The goal was to mock a service that persists Objects and can return them by their name. The service looks like this:The service mock uses a map to store the Room instances.We can now run our tests on this mock. For example:With Java 8 it is possible to create a one-line answer even with older version of Mockito:Of course this is not as useful as using AdditionalAnswers suggested by David Wallace, but might be useful if you want to transform argument "on the fly".With Java 8, Steve\'s answer can become  EDIT: Even shorter:  I use something similar (basically it\'s the same approach). Sometimes it\'s useful to have a mock object return pre-defined output for certain inputs. That goes like this:You might want to use verify() in combination with the ArgumentCaptor to assure execution in the test and the ArgumentCaptor to evaluate the arguments:The argument\'s value is obviously accessible via the argument.getValue() for further manipulation / checking /whatever.
