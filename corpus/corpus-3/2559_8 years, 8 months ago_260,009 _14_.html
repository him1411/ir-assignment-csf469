What is the best way to subtract one day?You can use a timedelta object:Subtract datetime.timedelta(days=1)If your Python datetime object is timezone-aware than you should be careful to avoid errors around DST transitions (or changes in UTC offset for other reasons):In general, day_ago and yesterday may differ if UTC offset for the local timezone has changed in the last day.For example,  daylight saving time/summer time ends on Sun 2-Nov-2014 at 02:00:00 A.M. in America/Los_Angeles timezone therefore if:then day_ago and yesterday differ: pendulum module handles it automatically:Just to Elaborate an alternate method and a Use case for which it is helpful:It can similarly be used with other parameters e.g. seconds, weeks etcAlso just another nice function i like to use when i want to compute i.e. first/last day of the last month or other relative timedeltas etc. ...The relativedelta function from dateutil function (a powerful extension to the datetime lib)Genial arrow module existsoutput:
