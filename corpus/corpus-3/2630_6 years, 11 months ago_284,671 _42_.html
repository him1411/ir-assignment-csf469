I want to remove all empty strings from a list of strings in python.My idea looks like this:Is there any more pythonic way to do this?I would use filter:Python 3 returns an iterator from filter, so should be wrapped in a call to list()(etc.)Tests:List comprehensionsOutput: [\'first\', \'second\']Edit: Shortened as suggestedfilter actually has a special option for this:It will filter out all elements that evaluate to False. No need to use an actual callable here such as bool, len and so on.It\'s equally fast as map(bool, ...)Compare timeNotice that filter(None, lstr) does not remove empty strings with a space \' \', it only prunes away \'\' while \' \'.join(lstr).split() removes both.To use filter() with white space strings removed, it takes a lot more time:Instead of if x, I would use if X != \'\' in order to just eliminate empty strings. Like this:This will preserve None data type within your list. Also, in case your list has integers and 0 is one among them, it will also be preserved.For example,Reply from @Ib33X is awesome. If you want to remove every empty string, after stripped. you need to use the strip method too. Otherwise, it will return the empty string too if it has white spaces. Like, " " will be valid too for that answer. So, can be achieved by.Answer for this will be ["first", "second"].Use filter:The drawbacks of using filter as pointed out is that it is slower than alternatives; also, lambda is usually costly. \nOr you can go for the simplest and the most iterative of all:this is the most intuitive of the methods and does it in decent time.Depending on the size of your list, it may be most efficient if you use list.remove() rather than create a new list:This has the advantage of not creating a new list, but the disadvantage of having to search from the beginning each time, although unlike using while \'\' in l as proposed above, it only requires searching once per occurrence of \'\' (there is certainly a way to keep the best of both methods, but it is more complicated).As reported by Aziz Alto filter(None, lstr) does not remove empty strings with a space \' \' but if you are sure lstr contains only string you can use filter(str.strip, lstr)Compare time on my pcThe fastest solution to remove \'\' and empty strings with a space \' \' remains \' \'.join(lstr).split().As reported in a comment the situation is different if your strings contain spaces.You can see that filter(str.strip, lstr) preserve strings with spaces on it but \' \'.join(lstr).split() will split this strings.To eliminate empties after stripping:Some PROs:fast, selectively using builtins and comprehensions.Short and sweet.Loop through the existing string list and then check for a empty string, if it\'s not empty populate a new string list with the non-empty values and then replace the old string list with the new string listfilter(None, str) does not remove empty strings with a space \' \', it only prunes away \'\' and \' \'. join(str).split() removes both. but if your element of list having space then it will change your list elements also because it\'s joining first your all elements of list then spiting them by space so You should use : -It will remove both and won\'t effect your elements also \nLike :-output:- [\'hello\', \'world\', \'ram\']   <-------------- output of \' \'.join(lstr).split()\n[\'hello\', \'world ram\']
