How can I generate UML diagrams (especially sequence diagrams) from existing Java code?Is what I used. It is easily installed from the repository:And produces quite nice UML diagrams:The ObjectAid UML Explorer is different from other UML tools. It uses\n  the UML notation to show a graphical representation of existing code\n  that is as accurate and up-to-date as your text editor, while being\n  very easy to use. Several unique features make this possible:EDIT:\nIf you\'re a designer then Papyrus is your best choice it\'s very advanced and full of features, but if you just want to sketch out some uml diagrams and easy installation then ObjectAid  is pretty cool and it doesn\'t require any plugins I just installed it over Eclipse-Java EE  and works great !.UPDATE Oct 11th 2013My original post was in June 2012 alot of things have changed many tools has grown and others didn\'t. Since I\'m going back to do some modeling and also getting some replies to the post I decided to install papyrus again, and will investigate other possible uml modeling solutions again. Uml generation (with synchronization feature) is really important not to software designer but to the average developer.I wish papyrus had straightforward way to Reverse Engineer classes into UML class diagram and It would be super cool if that reverse engineering had a synchronization feature, but unfortunately papyrus project is full of features and I think developers there have already much at hand since also many actions you do over papyrus might not give you any response and just nothing happens but that\'s out of this question scope anyway.The Answer (Oct 11th 2013)ToolsStepsRight click on MyProject_kdm.xmi -> Discovery -> Discoverer -> Discover UML model from KDM code again you\'ll get a property dialog set the serialization prop to TRUE to generate a file named MyProject.uml \nMove generated MyProject.uml which was generated at root, to UML folder, Eclipse will ask you If you wanted to replace it click yes. What we did in here was that we replaced an empty model with a generated one.ALT+W -> show view -> papyrus -> model explorerIn that view you\'ll find your classes like in the picture \nIn the view Right click root model -> New diagram Then start grabbing classes to the diagram from the viewSome featuresTo show the class elements (variables, functions etc) Right click on any class -> Filters -> show/hide contents  Voila !!You can have default friendly color settings from Window -> pereferences -> papyrus -> class diagramone very important setting is Arrange when you drop the classes they get cramped right click on any empty space at class diagram and click Arrange AllArrows in the model explorer view can be grabbed to the diagram to show generalization, realization etcAfter all of that your settings will show diagrams like \nSince Synchronization isn\'t available as far as I know you\'ll need to manually import any new classes.That\'s all, And don\'t buy commercial products unless you really need it, papyrus is actually great and sophisticated instead donate or something.Disclaimer: I\'ve no relation to the papyrus people infact i didn\'t like papyrus at first until I did lots of research and experienced it with some patience. And will get back to this post again when I try other free tools.What is your codebase? Java or C++?alt text http://www.soyatec.com/euml2/images/product_euml2_110x80.pngeUML2 for Java is a powerful UML modeler designed for Java developper\n  in Eclipse. The free edition can be used for commercial use. It\n  supports the following features:The commercial edition provides:Advanced reversed engineeringHow about PlantUML?\nIt\'s not for reverse engineering!!! It\'s for engineering before you code.I would recommend EclipseUML from Omondo for general usage, although I did experience some problems a few months back, with my web projects. They had a free edition at one point in time, but that is supposedly no longer promoted.If you are really keen on reverse engineering sequence diagrams from source code, I would recommend jTracert.As far as Eclipse projects themselves are concerned, the Eclipse UML2 Tools project might support reverse engineering, although I\'ve have never seen its use in practice.The MoDisco (Model Discovery) project Eclipse GMT project seems to be clearer in achieving your objective. The list of technology specific tools would be a good place to start with.You could also give the netbeans UML modeller a try. I have used it to generate javacode that I used in my eclipse projects. You can even import eclipse projects in netbeans and keep the eclipse settings synced with the netbeans project settings.I tried several UML modellers for eclipse and wasn\'t satisfied with them. They were either unstable, complicated or just plain ugly. ;-)I found Green plugin very simple to use and to generate class diagram from source code.\nGive it a try :).\nJust copy the plugin to your plugin dir.I developed a maven plugin that can both, be run from CLI as a plugin goal, or import as dependency and programatically use the parser, @see Main#main() to get the idea on how. It renders PlantUML src code of desired packages recursively that you can edit manually if needed (hopefully you won\'t). Then, by pasting code in plantUML page, or by downloading plant\'s jar you can render the UML diagram as a png image.  Check it out here https://github.com/juanmf/Java2PlantUMLExample output diagram:\nAny contribution is more than welcome. It has a set of filters that customize output but I didn\'t expose these yet in the plugin CLI params.It\'s important to note that it\'s not limited to your *.java files, it can render UML diagrams src from you maven dependencies as well. This is very handy to understand libraries you depend on. It actually inspects compiled classes with reflection so no source needed Be the 1st to star it at github :P You can use the 30 days evaluation build of EclipseUML for Eclipse 3.5 : http://www.uml2.org/eclipse-java-galileo-SR2-win32_eclipseUML2.2_package_may2010.zip\nThis is not the latest 3.6 build but pretty good and don\'t need to buy it for testing reverse engineering.Reverse engineering : http://www.forum-omondo.com/documentation_eclipseuml_2008/reverse/reverse/reverse_engineering_example.htmlLive flash demo: http://www.ejb3.org/reverse.swfEclipseUML Omondo is the best tool in the world for Java. Only eUML seems to compete with him on this live java synchronization market but eUML add model tags in the code which is really very very bad and a definitive no go for me.Something very simillar has been asked before.  By far the best tool I have used for reverse engineering, and round tripping java -> UML is Borland\'s Together.  It is based on Eclipse (not just a single plugin) and really works well.Using IntelliJ IDEA. To generate class diagram select package and press Ctrl + Alt + U:By default, it displays only class names and not all dependencies. To change it: right click -> Show Categories... and Show dependencies:\nTo genarate dependencies diagram (UML Deployment diagram) and you use maven go View -> Tool Windows -> Maven Projects and press Ctrl + Alt + U:\nThe result:\nAlso it is possible to generate more others diagrams. See documentation.I suggest PlantUML. this tools is very usefull and easy to use. PlantUML have a plugin for Netbeans that you can create UML diagram from your java code.you can install PlantUML plugin in the netbeans by this method:Netbeans Menu -> Tools -> PluginNow select Available Plugins and then find PlantUML and install it.For more information go to website: www.plantuml.comhttp://www.zenuml.com does not generate UML diagrams from Java code directly, but its DSL is Java-like. BTW I created zenuml :)
