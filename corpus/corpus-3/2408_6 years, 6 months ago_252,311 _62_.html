I\'m using virtualenv and I need to install "psycopg2".I have done the following:And I have the following messages:My question, I only need to do this to get the psycopg2 working?I found this post searching for a Linux solution to this problem.This post by "goshawk" gave me the solution: run sudo apt-get install libpq-dev python-dev if you are on Ubuntu/Debian.Since more people have found this answer useful and posted their own solutions, here\'s a list of them:If none of the above solve your issue, tryorOn CentOS, you need the postgres dev packages:That was the solution on CentOS 6 at least.On Mac Mavericks with Postgres.app version 9.3.2.0 RC2 I needed to use the following code after installing Postgres:sudo PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.3/bin pip install psycopg2if you\'re on a mac you can use homebrewAnd all other options are here: http://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx/Good luckI recently configured psycopg2 on a windows machine. The easiest install is using a windows executable binary. You can find it at http://stickpeople.com/projects/python/win-psycopg/.To install the native binary in a virtual envrionment, use easy_install: For Python 3 you should use sudo apt-get install libpq-dev python3-dev under Debian.This is what worked for me (On RHEL, CentOS:And now include the path to your postgresql binary dir with you pip install:Make sure to include the correct path. Thats all :)UPDATE: For python 3, please install python3-devel instead of python-develIf you using Mac OS, you should install PostgreSQL from source.\nAfter installation is finished, you need to add this path using:or you can append the path like this:in your .profile file or .zshrc file.This maybe vary by operating system.You can follow the installation process from http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2009/04/linux-postgresql-install-and-configure-from-source/The answers so far are too much like magic recipes. The error that you received tells you that pip cannot find a needed part of the PostgreSQL Query library. Possibly this is because you have it installed in a non-standard place for your OS which is why the message suggests using the --pg-config option.But a more common reason is that you don\'t have libpq installed at all. This commonly happens on machines where you do NOT have PostgreSQL server installed because you only want to run client apps, not the server itself. Each OS/distro is different, for instance on Debian/Ubuntu you need to install libpq-dev. This allows you to compile and link code against the PostgreSQL Query library.Most of the answers also suggest installing a Python dev library. Be careful. If you are only using the default Python installed by your distro, that will work, but if you have a newer version, it could cause problems. If you have built Python on this machine then you already have the dev libraries needed for compiling C/C++ libraries to interface with Python. As long as you are using the correct pip version, the one installed in the same bin folder as the python binary, then you are all set. No need to install the old version.On Debian/Ubuntu:First install and build dependencies of psycopg2 package:Then in your virtual environment, compile and install psycopg2 module:I\'ve done this before where in windows you install first into your base python installation.Then, you manually copy the installed psycopg2 to the virtualenv install.It\'s not pretty, but it works.Besides installing the required packages, I also needed to manually add PostgreSQL bin directory to PATH.\n$vi ~/.bash_profile\nAdd PATH=/usr/pgsql-9.2/bin:$PATH before export PATH.\n$source ~/.bash_profile\n$pip install psycopg2On windows XP you get this error if postgres is not installed ...I installed Postgresql92 using the RedHat / CentOS repository on PG\'s downloads site http://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/redhat/To get pg_config, I had to add /usr/pgsql-9.2/bin to PATH.On Fedora 24: For Python 3.xActivate your Virtual Environment:I\'ve been battling with this for days, and have finally figured out how to get the "pip install psycopg2" command to run in a virtualenv in Windows (running Cygwin).I was hitting the "pg_config executable not found." error, but I had already downloaded and installed postgres in Windows. It installed in Cygwin as well; running "which pg_config" in Cygwin gave "/usr/bin/pg_config", and running "pg_config" gave sane output -- however the version installed with Cygwin is:VERSION = PostgreSQL 8.2.11This won\'t work with the current version of psycopg2, which appears to require at least 9.1. When I added "c:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\9.2\\bin" to my Windows path, the Cygwin pip installer was able to find the correct version of PostgreSQL, and I was able to successfully install the module using pip. (This is probably preferable to using the Cygwin version of PostgreSQL anyway, as the native version will run much quicker).For lowly Windows users were stuck having to install psycopg2 from the link below, just install it to whatever Python installation you have setup.  It will place the folder named "psycopg2" in the site-packages folder of your python installation. After that, just copy that folder to the site-packages directory of your virtualenv and you will have no problems. here is the link you can find the executable to install psycopg2http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/On OpenSUSE 13.2, this fixed it:I could install it in a windows machine and using Anaconda/Spyder with python 2.7 through the following commands:Then to establish the connection to the database:In Arch base distributions:Psycopg2 Depends on Postgres Libraries.\nOn Ubuntu You can use:Then:On Ubuntu I just needed the postgres dev package:*Tested in a virtualenvOn OSX 10.11.6 (El Capitan)On OSX with macports:Try this in Gentoo:
