I\'ve created database, for example \'mydb\'. Now i can login to database from everywhere, but can\'t create tables.How to grant all privileges on that database and (in the future) tables. I can\'t create tables in \'mydb\' database. I always get:This is how I create my "Super User" privileges (although I would normally specify a host).While this answer can solve the problem of access, WITH GRANT OPTION creates a MySQL user that can edit the permissions of other users. The GRANT OPTION privilege enables you to give to other users or remove from other users those privileges that you yourself possess. For security reasons, you should not use this type of user account for any process that the public will have access to (i.e. a website). It is recommended that you create a user with only database privileges for that kind of use.This is old question but I don\'t think the accepted answer is safe. It\'s good for creating a super user but not good if you want to grant privileges on a single database.% seems to not cover socket communications, that the localhost is for. WITH GRANT OPTION is only good for the super user, otherwise it is usually a security risk.Hope this helps.This will be helpful for some people:From MySQL command line:Sadly, at this point newuser has no permissions to do anything with the databases. In fact, if newuser even tries to login (with the password, password), they will not be able to reach the MySQL shell. Therefore, the first thing to do is to provide the user with access to the information they will need.The asterisks in this command refer to the database and table (respectively) that they can access\xe2\x80\x94this specific command allows to the user to read, edit, execute and perform all tasks across all the databases and tables. Once you have finalized the permissions that you want to set up for your new users, always be sure to reload all the privileges.Your changes will now be in effect.For more information: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/grant.htmlIf you are not comfortable with the command line then you can use a client like MySQL workbench, Navicat or SQLyogCreate the username for the database db_name\ngrant all privileges on db_name.* to \'username\'@\'localhost\' identified by \'password\';Use the database\nuse db_name;This SQL grants on all databases but just basic privileges. They\'re enough for Drupal or Wordpress and as a nicety, allows one developer account for local projects. Hello I used this code to have the super user in mysqland thenI could able to make it work only by adding GRANT OPTION, without that always receive permission denied errorworks for privileges on schema :) optional: after mypasswd you can add WITH GRANT OPTIONTo access from remote server to  mydb database onlyTo access from remote server to all databases.
