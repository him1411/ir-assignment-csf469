I have a form that I would like all fields to be filled in. If a field is clicked into and then not filled out, I would like to display a red background. Here is my code:It applies the warning class regardless of the field being filled in or not.What am I doing wrong?And you don\'t necessarily need .length or see if it\'s >0 since an empty string evaluates to false anyway but if you\'d like to for readability purposes:If you\'re sure it will always operate on a textfield element then you can just use this.value.Also you should take note that $(\'input:text\') grabs multiple elements, specify a context or use the this keyword if you just want a reference to a lone element (provided there\'s one textfield in the context\'s descendants/children).Everybody has the right idea, but I like to be a little more explicit and trim the values.if you dont use .length , then an entry of \'0\' can get flagged as bad, and an entry of 5 spaces could get marked as ok without the $.trim . Best of Luck.Doing it on blur is too limited. It assumes there was focus on the form field, so I prefer to do it on submit, and map through the input. After years of dealing with fancy blur, focus, etc. tricks, keeping things simpler will yield more usability where it counts.how come nobody mentionedseems more jquery-like to meyou can use also..if you have doubt about spaces,then try..The :empty pseudo-selector is used to see if an element contains no childs, you should check the value :Consider using the jQuery validation plugin instead.  It may be slightly overkill for simple required fields, but it mature enough that it handles edge cases you haven\'t even thought of yet (nor would any of us until we ran into them).You can tag the required fields with a class of "required", run a $(\'form\').validate() in $(document).ready() and that\'s all it takes.It\'s even hosted on the Microsoft CDN too, for speedy delivery: http://www.asp.net/ajaxlibrary/CDN.ashxThere is one other thing you might want to think about, Currently it can only add the warning class if it is empty, how about removing the class again when the form is not empty anymore.like this:Here is an example using keyup for the selected input. It uses a trim as well to make sure that a sequence of just white space characters doesn\'t trigger a truthy response. This is an example that can be used to begin a search box or something related to that type of functionality.Check if all fields are empty and append ON or OFF on Filter_buttonYou can try something like this:It will apply .blur() event only to the inputs with empty values.With HTML 5  we can use a new feature "required" the just add it to the tag which you want to be required like:<input type=\'text\' required>
