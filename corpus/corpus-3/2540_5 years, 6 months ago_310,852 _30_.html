I\'m trying to use the new bundling feature in a project I recently converted from MVC 3 to MVC 4 beta.  It requires a line of code in global.asax, BundleTable.Bundles.RegisterTemplateBundles();, which requires using System.Web.Optimization; at the top.When I do this, I get the red squiggly lines that say, "Are you missing an assembly reference?"  When I try and add reference, and click on the .NET tab in the dialog, sort from A-Z, I do not see System.Web.Optimization.How do I add this ref to my project? Thanks.The Microsoft.Web.Optimization package is now obsolete. With ASP.NET (MVC) 4 and higher you should install the Microsoft ASP.NET Web Optimization Framework:Install the package from nuget:Create and configure bundle(s) in App_Start\\BundleConfig.cs:Call the RegisterBundles() function from Application_Start() in your global.asax.cs:In your view.cshtml include the Optimization namespace and render the bundle(s):See http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/performance/bundling-and-minification for more informationUpdate\nVersion 1.1.x is available, read the release notes: http://aspnetoptimization.codeplex.com/releases/view/101096With the final released version of ASP.Net MVC 4 the approach is as follows:Install Microsoft.AspNet.Web.Optimization via nuget (as it is not installed by the framework)Create the bundle in Global.asax Application_Start:Add the "System.Web.Optimization" namespace to the "Views" web.config:In your view.cshtml add an include to the bundle created in the last step:In debug mode, all script files in your directory will render individually; in release mode they will be bundled and minified.In my case it was a tfs issue, since tfs exclude binaries, so the Nugget PM find the nugget installed and don\'t update the library \nIf you have similar issue :NB : the package folder is in the same level of yousolution.sln fileUpdate (reinstall) the package from nuget, you can use the command:update-Package Microsoft.AspNet.Web.Optimization -reinstallUsing nuget to uninstall System.Web.Optimization in the package manager console like this:Uninstall-Package Microsoft.AspNet.Web.OptimizationThen reinstalling using:Install-Package Microsoft.AspNet.Web.OptimizationMay solve this problem for you.Install it from NUGet through Visual Studio \nOpen Visual Studio 2010 , select Tools-> Library Package Manager-> Package Manager ConsoleThis will open the conslve, paste and enter. and you are doneset in Global.asax application_start (in RELEASE mode etc.) :to enable minification and change to false in DEBUG mode to render all script and style files individually.
