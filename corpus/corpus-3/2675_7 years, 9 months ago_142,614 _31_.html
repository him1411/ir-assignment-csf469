I\'d like to push and pull all the branches by default, including the newly created ones.Is there a setting that I can define for it?Otherwise, when I add a new branch, locally and I want to pull it from the server, what is the simplest way to do it?I created a new branch with the same name and tried to pull but it doesn\'t work. Asks me for all the remote config of the branch. How do I set it.The simplest way is to do:This will push tags and branches.With modern git you always fetch all branches (as remote-tracking branches into refs/remotes/origin/* namespace, visible with git branch -r or git remote show origin).  By default (see documentation of push.default config variable) you push matching branches, which means that first you have to do git push origin branch for git to push it always on git push.If you want to always push all branches, you can set up push refspec.  Assuming that the remote is named origin you can either use git config:or directly edit .git/config file to have something like the following:Including the + in the push spec is probably a bad idea, as it means that git will happily do a non-fast-forward push even without -f, and if the remote server is set up to accept those, you can lose history.  Try just this:I had used below commands to migrate all branches to the new repository.NOTE: I had to use second last (i.e. push master first) command while cloning a repo from Atlassian Stash to AWS CodeCommit (blank repo). I am not sure the reason, but after pushing (git push new-origin --mirror) default branch was referring to some other branch than master.If you are moving branches to a new repo from an old one and do NOT have all the old repo branches local, you will need to track them first.Then add your new remote repo:Then you can push all using this command:Or you can configure the repo using the git config commands noted in the other responses here if you are not doing this one time or are only looking to move local branches.The important point, the other responses only push all LOCAL branches.   If the branches only exist on an alternate REMOTE repository they will not move without tracking them first.  The for loop presented here will help with that.To see all the branches with out using git branch -a you should execute:Now you can see all the branches:To push all the branches try:If you are moving all branches to a new repo from an old one then in your local repo you need to set up tracking of each branch to existing origin branches, before pushing to the new repo, otherwise all your origin branches won\xe2\x80\x99t appear in the new origin. Do this manually by tracking or checking out each branch, or use the one liner:This one line command is based on versions of it in other answers on this page, but is arguably better because:Next, if you are switching origins, replace the link to the old origin and point to a new remote.  Ensure you create the new remote first, using bitbucket/github GUI, but don\xe2\x80\x99t add any files to it or there will be a merge problem. E.g.Now push.  Note the second command is needed to push the tags as well:Use the following in your global gitconfigThis pushes all branches and all tagsIf you hardcode:As per Jakub Nar\xc4\x99bski\'s answer:With modern git you always fetch all branches (as remote-tracking branches into refs/remotes/origin/* namespace
