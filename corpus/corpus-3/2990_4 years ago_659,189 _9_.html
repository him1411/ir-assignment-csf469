I have to check the time in linux terminal.\nWhat is the command for getting date and time in  Linux terminal ?\nIs there any way in which we can set custom function ?The command is dateTo customise the output there are a myriad of options available, see date --help for a list.For example, date \'+%A %W %Y %X\' gives Tuesday 34 2013 08:04:22 which is the name of the day of the week, the week number, the year and the time.You can use date to get time and date of a day: Also hwclock would do:For customized output, you can either redirect the output of date to something like awk, or write your own program to do that. Remember to put your own executable scripts/binary into your PATH (e.g. /usr/bin) to make it invokable anywhere.However, I don\'t think this is a good question for StackOverflow.
