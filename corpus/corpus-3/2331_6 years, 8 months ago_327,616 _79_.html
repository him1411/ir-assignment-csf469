I have a series of 20 plots (not subplots) to be made in a single figure.  I want the legend to be outside of the box.  At the same time, I do not want to change the axes, as the size of the figure gets reduced.  Kindly help me for the following queries:Create font propertiesThere are a number of ways to do what you want.  To add to what @inalis and @Navi already said, you can use the bbox_to_anchor keyword argument to place the legend partially outside the axes and/or decrease the font size. Before you consider decreasing the font size (which can make things awfully hard to read), try playing around with placing the legend in different places:So, let\'s start with a generic example:If we do the same thing, but use the bbox_to_anchor keyword argument we can shift the legend slightly outside the axes boundaries:Similarly, you can make the legend more horizontal and/or put it at the top of the figure (I\'m also turning on rounded corners and a simple drop shadow):Alternatively, you can shrink the current plot\'s width, and put the legend entirely outside the axis of the figure:And in a similar manner, you can shrink the plot vertically, and put the a horizontal legend at the bottom:Have a look at the matplotlib legend guide. You might also take a look at plt.figlegend(). Hope that helps a bit, anyway!If you are using Pandas plot() wrapper function and want to place legend outside then here\'s very easy way:We just chain legend() call after the plot().Results would look something like this:A legend is positioned inside the bounding box of the axes using the loc argument to plt.legend.\nE.g. loc="upper right" places the legend in the upper right corner of the bounding box, which by default extents from (0,0) to (1,1) in axes coordinates (or in bounding box notation (x0,y0, width, height)=(0,0,1,1)).To place the legend outside of the axes bounding box, one may specify a tuple (x0,y0) of axes coordinates of the lower left corner of the legend.However, a more versatile approach would be to manually specify the bounding box into which the legend should be placed, using the bbox_to_anchor argument. One can restrict oneself to supply only the (x0,y0) part of the bbox. This creates a zero span box, out of which the legend will expand in the direction given by the loc argument. E.g.plt.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.04,1), loc="upper left")places the legend outside the axes, such that the upper left corner of the legend is at position (1.04,1) in axes coordinates. Further examples are given below, where additionally the interplay between different arguments like mode and ncols are shown. Details about how to interpret the 4-tuple argument to bbox_to_anchor can be found in this question. Sometimes it may be useful to specify the bounding box in figure coordinates instead of axes coordinates. This is shown in the example l5 from above, where the bbox_transform argument is used to put the legend in the lower left corner of the figure. Having placed the legend outside the axes often leads to the undesired situation that it is completely or partially outside the figure canvas.Solutions to this problem are:Adjust the subplot parameters\nOne can adjust the subplot parameters such, that the axes take less space inside the figure (and thereby leave more space to the legend) by using plt.subplots_adjust. E.g. leaves 30% space on the right-hand side of the figure, where one could place the legend.Tight layout\nUsing plt.tight_layout Allows to automatically adjust the subplot parameters such that the elements in the figure sit tight against the figure edges. Unfortunately, the legend is not taken into account in this automatism, but we can supply a rectangle box that the whole subplots area (including labels) will fit into. Saving the figure with bbox_inches = "tight"\nThe argument bbox_inches = "tight" to plt.savefig can be used to save the figure such that all artist on the canvas (including the legend) are fit into the saved area. If needed, the figure size is automatically adjusted. Comparisson between the cases discussed above:  An alternative to using bbox_to_anchor would be to place the legend in its dedicated subplot axes (lax). \nSince the legend subplot should be smaller than the plot, we may use gridspec_kw={"width_ratios":[4,1]} at axes creation.\nWe can hide the axes lax.axis("off") but still put a legend in. The legend handles and labels need to obtained from the real plot via h,l = ax.get_legend_handles_labels(), and can then be supplied to the legend in the lax subplot, lax.legend(h,l). A complete example is below.This produces a plot which is visually pretty similar to the plot from above:We could also use the first axes to place the legend, but use the bbox_transform of the legend axes,In this approach, we do not need to obtain the legend handles externally, but we need to specify the bbox_to_anchor argument.Short answer: you can use bbox_to_anchor + bbox_extra_artists + bbox_inches=\'tight\'.Longer answer:\nYou can use bbox_to_anchor to manually specify the location of the legend box, as some other people have pointed out in the answers. However, the usual issue is that the legend box is cropped, e.g.:In order to prevent the legend box from getting cropped, when you save the figure you can use the parameters bbox_extra_artists and bbox_inches to ask savefig to include cropped elements in the saved image:fig.savefig(\'image_output.png\', bbox_extra_artists=(lgd,), bbox_inches=\'tight\')Example (I only changed the last line to add 2 parameters to fig.savefig()):I wish that matplotlib would natively allow outside location for the legend box as Matlab does:Short Answer: Invoke draggable on the legend and interactively move it wherever you want:Long Answer: If you rather prefer to place the legend interactively/manually rather than programmatically, you can toggle the draggable mode of the legend so that you can drag it to wherever you want. Check the example below:In addition to all the excellent answers here, newer versions of matplotlib and pylab can automatically determine where to put the legend without interfering with the plots.This will automatically place the legend outside the plot!\nTo place the legend outside the plot area, use loc and bbox_to_anchor keywords of legend(). For example, the following code will place the legend to the right of the plot area:For more info, see the legend guideNot exactly what you asked for, but I found it\'s an alternative for the same problem.\nMake the legend semi-transparant, like so:\nDo this with:As noted, you could also place the legend in the plot, or slightly off it to the edge as well. Here is an example using the Plotly Python API, made with an IPython Notebook. I\'m on the team. To begin, you\'ll want to install the necessary packages:Then, install Plotly:This creates your graph, and allows you a chance to keep the legend within the plot itself. The default for the legend if it is not set is to place it in the plot, as shown here.  For an alternative placement, you can closely align the edge of the graph and border of the legend, and remove border lines for a closer fit. You can move and re-style the legend and graph with code, or with the GUI. To shift the legend, you have the following options to position the legend inside the graph by assigning x and y values of <= 1. E.g : In this case, we choose the upper right, legendstyle = {"x" : 1, "y" : 1}, also described in the documentation:Something along these lines worked for me. Starting with a bit of code taken from Joe, this method modifies the window width to automatically fit a legend to the right of the figure.You can also try figlegend.  It is possible to create a legend independent of any Axes object.  However, you may need to create some "dummy" Paths to make sure the formatting for the objects gets passed on correctly.Here is an example from the matplotlib tutorial found here. This is one of the more simpler examples but I added transparency to the legend and added plt.show() so you can paste this into the interactive shell and get a result:The solution that worked for me when I had huge legend was to use extra empty image layout. \nIn following example I made 4 rows and at the bottom I plot image with offset for legend (bbox_to_anchor) at the top it does not get cut.Here\'s another solution, similar to adding bbox_extra_artists and bbox_inches, where you don\'t have to have your extra artists in the scope of your savefig call. I came up with this since I generate most of my plot inside functions.Instead of adding all your additions to the bounding box when you want to write it out, you can add them ahead of time to the Figure\'s artists. Using something similar to Franck Dernoncourt\'s answer above:Here\'s the generated plot.don\'t know if you already sorted out your issue...probably yes, but...\nI simply used the string \'outside\' for the location, like in matlab.\nI imported pylab from matplotlib.\nsee the code as follow:Click to see the plot
