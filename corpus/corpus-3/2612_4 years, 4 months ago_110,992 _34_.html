In Eclipse when you hover your mouse over a method, a window would appear with a description of what the method does, what the parameters mean and what it returns. Is there a way to get Android Studio to do the same thing?The easiest and the most straightforward way:You can activate it by going to: File > Settings > Editor > General and check Show quick documentation on mouse move:Other ways:You can go into your IntelliJ\'s bin folder and search for idea.properties. Add this line to the document:auto.show.quick.doc=trueNow you\'ll have the same floating docs window like in Eclipse. You have to press CTRL+Q to see the Javadoc.You can pin the window and make the documentation appear every time you select a method with your mouse though.Android Studio 1.0: You have to hold CTRL if you want to get hold of documentation window for e.g. scrolling documentation otherwise as you move your mouse away from method documentation window will disappear.Yes you can. Go to File -> Settings -> Editor -> Show quick doc on mouse moveAndroid Studio 1.2.2 has moved the setting into the General subfolder of Editor settings.It comes very handy if you create a keymap for functionalities you use very frequently. By default (if you select OSX 10.5+ keymap) :  Android Studio 2.x.x\nMoved under Editor -> GeneralOlder Versions\nUsing windows 7 and Android Studio 1.0.x it took me a while to figure out the steps provided in the answer.\nTo help further visitors save some time, here is the way I did it:\nGo to File -> Settings or press CTRL+ALT+S.\nThe following window will open and check Show quick doc on mouse move under IDE Settings -> Editor.Or just press CTRL and hover your move over your method, class ...If you just need a shortcut, then it is Ctrl + Q on linux.\nJust hover the mouse on the method and press Ctrl + Q to see the doc.Go to Preference->Editor->General\nand choose show quick doc on mouse hover On Mac the default key combination for showing the quick documentation is: CTRL + F1The cursor has to be on the method when using this.If you need only Parameter info then:On Mac, it\'s assigned to Command+POn Windows, it\'s assigned to Ctrl+PIf you need document info then:On Mac, it\'s assigned to Command+QOn Windows, it\'s assigned to Ctrl+QOn my mac ctrl f1 stopped working but f1 on its own works..Many of the other answers are all well but if you want an informational tooltip instead of a fullblown window then do this: after enabling it using @Ahmad\'s answer then click on the little pin on the upper right corner:\nAfter this the method information will appear on a tooltip like almost every other mainstream IDE.
