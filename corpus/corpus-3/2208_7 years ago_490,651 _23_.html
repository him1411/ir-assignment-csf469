I have a string representing a unix timestamp (i.e. "1284101485") in Python, and I\'d like to convert it to a readable date. When I use time.strftime, I get a TypeError:Use datetime module:In this code datetime.datetime can look strange, but 1st datetime is module name and 2nd is class name. So datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp() is fromtimestamp() method of datetime class from datetime module.Taken from http://seehuhn.de/pages/pdateThe most voted answer suggests using fromtimestamp which is error prone since it uses the local timezone. To avoid issues a better approach is to use UTC:Where posix_time is the Posix epoch time you want to convertFor a human readable timestamp from a UNIX timestamp, I have used this in scripts before:Output:\'December 26, 2012\'You can convert the current time like thisTo convert a date in string to different formats.There are two parts:A portable way to get the local time that works even if the local time zone had a different utc offset in the past and python has no access to the tz database is to use a pytz timezone:To display it, you could use any time format that is supported by your system e.g.:If you do not need a local time, to get a readable UTC time instead:If you don\'t care about the timezone issues that might affect what date is returned or if python has access to the tz database on your system:On Python 3, you could get a timezone-aware datetime using only stdlib (the UTC offset may be wrong if python has no access to the tz database on your system e.g., on Windows):Functions from the time module are thin wrappers around the corresponding C API and therefore they may be less portable than the corresponding datetime methods otherwise you could use them too:quick and dirty one liner:\'2013-5-5-1-9-43\'i just successfully used:You can use easy_date to make it easy:Did you look at the datetime package? I believe it has a fromUnixTimestamp method.
