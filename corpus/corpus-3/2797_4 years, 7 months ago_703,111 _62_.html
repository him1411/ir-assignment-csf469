I\'m trying to add a directory to my path so it will always be in my Linux path. I\'ve tried:This works, however each time I exit the terminal and start a new terminal instance, this path is lost, and I need to run the export command again.How can I do it so this will be set permanently?You need to add it to your ~/.profile file.Depending on what you\'re doing, you also may want to symlink to binaries:I can\'t believe nobody mentioned /etc/environment file.\nIt\'s sole purpose is to store Environment Variables. Originally the $PATH variable is defined here.\nThis is a paste from my /etc/environment file:So you can just open up this file as root and add whatever you want.For Immediate results,\nRun (try as normal user and root):UPDATE:If you use zsh (a.k.a Z Shell), add this line right after the comments in /etc/zsh/zshenv:I encountered this little quirk on Ubuntu 15.10, but if your zsh is not getting the correct PATH, this could be whyThere are multiple ways to do it. The actual solution depends on the purpose.The variable values are usually stored in either a list of assignments or a shell script that is run at the start of the system or user session. In case of the shell script you must use a specific shell syntax.Put the export declaration in ~/.bashrc. My .bashrc contains this:You may set $PATH permanently in 2 ways.To set path for particular user :\nYou may need to make the entry in .bash_profile in home directory in the user.e.g in my case I will set java path in tomcat user profileTo set common path for ALL system users, you may need to set path like this :You can add that line to your console config file (e.g. .bashrc) , or to .profileYou can use on Centos or RHEL for local user:This add the current directory(or you can use other directory) to the PATH, this make it permanent but take effect at the next user logon.If you don\'t want do a re-logon, then can use:That reload the # User specific environment and startup programs this comment is present in .bash_profilethe files where you add the export command depends if you are in login-mode or non-login-mode.if you are in login-mode, the files you are looking for is either /etc/bash or /etc/bash.bashrcif you are in non-login-mode, you are looking for the file /.profile or for the files within the directory /.profiles.dthe files mentioned above if where the system variables are.Add to /etc/profile.d folder script [name_of_script].sh with line: export PATH=$PATH:/dir. Every script within /etc/profile.d folder is automaticaly executed by /etc/profile on login.Zues77 has the right idea. The OP didn\'t say "how can i hack my way through this". OP wanted to know how to permanently append to $PATH:This is where it is set for everything and is the best place to change it for all things needing $PATHYou can also set permanently, editing one of these files:/etc/profile (for all users)~/.bash_profile (for actual user)~/.bash_login (for actual user)~/.profile (for actual user)You can also use /etc/environment to set a permanent PATH environment variable, but it does not support variable expansion. Extracted from: http://www.sysadmit.com/2016/06/linux-anadir-ruta-al-path.htmlI stumbled across this question yesterday when searching for a way to add a folder containing my own scripts to the PATH - and was surprised to find out that my own ~/.profile file (on Linux Mint 18.1) already contained this: Thus, all I had to do was create the folder ~/bin and put my scripts there.the best simple way is the following line:\nPATH="<directory you want to include>:$PATH"\nin your .bashrc file in home directory.It will not get reset even if you close the terminal or reboot your PC. Its permanentMy answer is in reference to the setting-up of go-lang on Ubuntu linux/amd64.I have faced the same trouble of setting the path of environment variables (GOPATH and GOBIN), losing it on terminal exit and rebuilding it using the  source <file_name> every time.The mistake was to put the path (GOPATH and GOBIN) in ~/.bash_profile folder. After wasting a few good hours, I found that the solution was to put GOPATH and GOBIN in ~/.bash_rc file in the manner:and doing so, the go installation worked fine and there were no path losses. EDIT 1:\nThe reason with which this issue can be related is that settings for non-login shells like your ubuntu terminal or gnome-terminal where we run the go code are taken from ~./bash_rc file and the settings for login shells are taken from ~/.bash_profile file, and from ~/.profile file if ~/.bash_profile file is unreachable. Permanently add PATH variableGlobal:Local(for user only):For global restart. For local relogin.ExampleBefore:After:Alternatively you can just edit profile:Another way(thanks gniourf_gniourf):You shouldn\'t use double quotes here! echo \'export\n  PATH=$PATH:/new/path/variable\'... And by the way, the export keyword\n  is very likely useless as the PATH variable is very likely already\n  marked as exported. \xe2\x80\x93  gniourf_gniourfone way to add permanent path, which worked for me, is:\n    cd /etc/profile.d\n    touch custom.sh\n    vi custom.sh \n    export PATH=$PATH:/path according to your setting/\nrestart your computer and here we go path will there permanently\ncheers.I think the most elegant way is:1.add this in ~./bashrc file2.source ~/.bashrc(Ubuntu)I\'ve just encountered the same issue,and paste the reason that PATH get always reset when relogin.After a lot of searching works,I finally realize it\'s a \ncustom system issue when i see this code in my /etc/passwd file:It means this custom system disable the bash shell of root.\nIf you have tried every solution but get nothing helpful information.And you use a custom system,you could take a look at my possible reason.It can be directly added by using the following command:echo \'export PATH=$PATH:/new/directory\' >> ~/.zshrc\nsource ~/.zshrc
