What does the \'fn\' here mean?In jQuery, the fn property is just an alias to the prototype property.The jQuery identifier (or $) is just a constructor function, and all instances created with it, inherit from the constructor\'s prototype.A simple constructor function:A simple structure that resembles the architecture of jQuery:jQuery.fn is defined shorthand for jQuery.prototype.  From the source code:That means jQuery.fn.jquery is an alias for jQuery.prototype.jquery, which returns the current jQuery version.  Again from the source code:fn literally refers to the jquery prototype.This line of code is in the source code:But the real tool behind fn is its availability to hook your own functionality into jQuery. Remember that jquery will be the parent scope to your function, so this will refer to the jquery object.So here is a simple example of that. Lets say I want to make two extensions, one which puts a blue border, and which colors the text blue, and I want them chained.Now you can use those against a class like this:(I know this is best done with css such as applying different class names, but please keep in mind this is just a demo to show the concept)This answer has a good example of a full fledged extension.For more examples and expansion on jQuery plugins, view the jQuery Plugins Documentation page
