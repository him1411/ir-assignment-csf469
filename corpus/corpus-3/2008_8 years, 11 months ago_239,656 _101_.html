Recently I was asked this during a job interview. I was honest and said I knew how a symbolic link behaves and how to create one, but do not understand the use of a hard link and how it differs from a symbolic one.Underneath the file system files are represented by inodes (or is it multiple inodes not sure)A file in the file system is basically a link to an inode.\nA hard link then just creates another file with a link to the same underlying inode.When you delete a file it removes one link to the underlying inode. The inode is only deleted (or deletable/over-writable) when all links to the inode have been deleted.A symbolic link is a link to another name in the file system.Once a hard link has been made the link is to the inode. deleting renaming or moving the original file will not affect the hard link as it links to the underlying inode. Any changes to the data on the inode is reflected in all files that refer to that inode.Note: Hard links are only valid within the same File System. Symbolic links can span file systems as they are simply the name of another file.Some nice intuition that might help, using any Linux(ish) console.Create two files:Enter some Data into them:(Actually, I could have used echo in the first place, as it creates the files if they don\'t exist... but never mind that.)And as expected:Let\'s create hard and soft links:Let\'s see what just happened:Changing the name of blah1 does not matter:blah1-hard points to the inode, the contents, of the file - that wasn\'t changed.The contents of the file could not be found because the soft link points to the name, that was changed, and not to the contents. Likewise, If blah1 is deleted, blah1-hard still holds the contents; if blah2 is deleted, blah2-soft is just a link to a non-existing file.As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words. Here is how I visualize it:Here is how we get to that picture:Create a name myfile.txt in the file system that points to a new inode (which contains the metadata for the file and points to the blocks of data that contain its contents, i.e. the text "Hello, World!":Create a hard link my-hard-link to the file myfile.txt, which means "create a file that should point to the same inode that myfile.txt points to":Create a soft link my-soft-link to the file myfile.txt, which means "create a file that should point to the file myfile.txt":Look what will now happen if myfile.txt is deleted (or moved): my-hard-link still points to the same contents, and is thus unaffected, whereas my-soft-link now points to nothing. Other answers discuss the pros/cons of each.Hard links are useful when the original file is getting moved around.  For example, moving a file from /bin to /usr/bin or to /usr/local/bin.  Any symlink to the file in /bin would be broken by this, but a hardlink, being a link directly to the inode for the file, wouldn\'t care.Hard links may take less disk space as they only take up a directory entry, whereas a symlink needs its own inode to store the name it points to.Hard links also take less time to resolve - symlinks can point to other symlinks that are in symlinked directories.  And some of these could be on NFS or other high-latency file systems, and so could result in network traffic to resolve.  Hard links, being always on the same file system, are always resolved in a single look-up, and never involve network latency (if it\'s a hardlink on an NFS filesystem, the NFS server would do the resolution, and it would be invisible to the client system).  Sometimes this is important.  Not for me, but I can imagine high-performance systems where this might be important.I also think things like mmap(2) and even open(2) use the same functionality as hardlinks to keep a file\'s inode active so that even if the file gets unlink(2)ed, the inode remains to allow the process continued access, and only once the process closes it does the file really go away.  This allows for much safer temporary files (if you can get the open and unlink to happen atomically, which there may be a POSIX API for that I\'m not remembering, then you really have a safe temporary file) where you can read/write your data without anyone being able to access it.  Well, that was true before /proc gave everyone the ability to look at your file descriptors, but that\'s another story.Speaking of which, recovering a file that is open in process A, but unlinked on the file system revolves around using hardlinks to recreate the inode links so the file doesn\'t go away when the process which has it open closes it or goes away.Symbolic links link to a path name. This can be anywhere in a system\'s file tree, and doesn\'t even have to exist when the link is created. The target path can be relative or absolute.Hard links are additional pointers to an inode, meaning they can exist only on the same volume as the target. Additional hard links to a file are indistinguishable from the "original" name used to reference a file.Soft Link:soft or symbolic is more of a short cut to the original file....if you delete the original the shortcut fails and if you only delete the short cut nothing happens to the original.Soft link Syntax: ln -s file1 file2Hard Link:Hard link is more of a mirror copy or multiple paths to the same file. Do something to file1 and it appears in file 2.\nDeleting one still keeps the other ok.The inode(or file) is only deleted when all the (hard)links or all the paths to the (same file)inode has been deleted.Once a hard link has been made the link has the inode of the original file. Deleting renaming or moving the original file will not affect the hard link as it links to the underlying inode. Any changes to the data on the inode is reflected in all files that refer to that inode.Hard Link syntax: ln file1 file2Note: Symbolic links can span file systems as they are simply the name of another file. Whereas hard links are only valid within the same File System.Symbolic links have some features hard links are missing:Reason why hard-links can\'t cross file systems or partitions:On a hard disk there are lots of sectors.Say a file starts at inode (sector) 4001 and ends at 5000. The file is "/export/home/john/mail.doc"Then:\n1. A hard link to "mail.doc" which is named "hardLinkToMail" contains the value: "4001".\n2. A soft link to "mail.doc" which is named "softLinkToMail" contains the value: "/export/home/john/mail.doc".In 1) the hard link can only point to the same disk. It can not point to another drive. All drives has an inode of value "4001", how can the hard link distinguish between all discs? Which drive\'s "4001" is it?In 2) the soft link contains a string. The string can point to another filesystem on another drive, because the full path is specified.A simple way to see the difference between a hard link and a symbolic link is through a simple example. A hard link to a file will point to the place where the file is stored, or the inode of that file. A symbolic link will point to the actual file itself.So if we have a file called "a" and create a hard link "b" and a symbolic link "c" which all refer to file "a" :The output of "a", "b", and "c" will be :Now let\'s remove file "a" and see what happens to the output of "a", "b", and "c":So what happened? Because file "c" points to file "a" itself, if file "a" is deleted then file "c" will have nothing to point to, in fact it is also deleted. However, file "b" points to the place of storage, or the inode, of file "a". So if file "a" is deleted then it will no longer point to the inode, but because file "b" does, the inode will continue to store whatever contents belonged to "a" until no more hard links point to it anymore.I would point you to Wikipedia:A few points:Hard links are very useful when doing incremental backups. See rsnapshot, for example. The idea is to do copy using hard links:The new backup will not take up any extra space apart from any changes you\'ve made, since all the incremental backups will point to the same set of inodes for files which haven\'t changed.I add on Nick\'s question: when are hard links useful or necessary? The only application that comes to my mind, in which symbolic links wouldn\'t do the job, is providing a copy of a system file in a chrooted environment.Also:What you think of as an ordinary "file" is actually two separate things: The data of a file, and a directory entry. When you create a hard link for a file, you actually create a second directory entry which refers to the same data. Both directory entries have the exact same functionality; each one can be used to open the file to read it. So you don\'t really have "a file plus a hard link", you have "file data with two directory entries". What you think of as deleting a file actually deletes a directory entry, and when the last directory entry for the data is deleted, then the data itself is deleted as well. For ordinary files that have only one directory entry, deleting the directory entry will delete the data as always. (While a file is opened, the OS creates a temporary link to the file, so even when you delete all directory entries, the data stays but disappears as soon as you close the file). As an example, create a file A.txt, a hard link B.txt, and delete A.txt. When you created A.txt, some data was created, and a directory entry A.txt. When you created the hard link, another directory entry B.txt was created, pointing to the exact same data. When you delete A.txt, you still have all the data and a single directory entry B.txt, exactly as if you had create a file B.txt in the first place. A soft link is just an (almost) ordinary file, except that it doesn\'t contain data, but the path of another directory entry. If you delete the file that the soft link refers to, then the soft link will contain a path that doesn\'t point to a directory entry anymore; it is broken. If you delete the soft link, it\'s like deleting any other file, the file it points to is unaffected. Simply , Hard link : is just add new name to a file, that\'s mean , a file can have many name in the same time, all name are equal to each other, no one preferred, Hard link is not mean to copy the all contents of file and make new file is not that, it just create an alternative name to be known.. Symbolic link (symlink) : is a file pointer to another file, if the symbolic link points to an existing file which is later deleted, the symbolic link continues to point to the same file name even though the name no longer names any file.A symbolic link is a file-system object that points to another file system object. The object being pointed to is called the target.Symbolic links are transparent to users; the links appear as normal\n  files or directories, and can be acted upon by the user or application\n  in exactly the same manner.Symbolic links are designed to aid in migration and application\n  compatibility with UNIX operating systems. Microsoft has implemented\n  its symbolic links to function just like UNIX links.Symbolic links can either be absolute or relative links. Absolute\n  links are links that specify each portion of the path name; relative\n  links are determined relative to where relative\xe2\x80\x93link specifiers are in\n  a specified pathAn example of Absolute Symbolic LinkAn example of Relative Symbolic LinksA hard link is the file system representation of a file by which\n  more than one path references a single file in the same volume.To create a hard link in windows, navigate to where link is to be created and enter this command:Note that you can delete hard links any order, regardless of the order in which they were created. Also, hard links can not be created whenNTFS supports another link type called junction. MSDN defines it as follows:A junction (also called a soft link) differs from a hard link in that the storage objects it references are separate directories, and a junction can link directories located on different local volumes on the same computer. Otherwise, junctions operate identically to hard links. The bolded parts in hard link section and junction section show the basic difference between the two.Command to create a junction in windows, navigate to where link is to be created and then enter:A directory entry is link a structrue:the ino is the number of inode, the name is the file name, inode structure maybe like\xef\xbc\x9afor example you creat a file /1, the directory entry maybe like:the inode struct maybe like:then you create a hard link(may be /100), the directory entry maybe like:the inode struct maybe like:then you create a symbolic link(may be /200) to file 1, the directory entry maybe like:the inode struct maybe like:Adding to all the above answers, the difference in finding the hardlink and softlink file can be understood as below:I have a file f6 in my current directory, as well as a directory named t2.File named f1 and ./t2/f2 are symbolic links to f6.File named f7 and ./t2/f8 are hard links of f6.To find soft as well as hard link we can use:To find only hardlink we can use:Since hardlinks can be created on the same file system, we can search all the hardlinks without -L option used (with -xdev option) in the same file-system/mount-point. It saves the unnecessary search into different mount points. So searching the hardlink is somewhat faster then searching the softlinks(Please rectify if I am wrong or not clear).Hard links can be useful,\nbecause it enables you to access the file from multiple different locations. it access inode directly. Some\nrestrictions are :The nice thing about hard links is that no difference exists between the first hard\nlink and the second hard link. They are both just hard links, and if the first hard link\nthat ever existed for a file is removed, that does not impact the other hard links that still exist. \nThe Linux operating system uses links on many locations to make files more accessible. Where as a symbolic link (also referred to as soft link) does not link directly to the inode but to the name of the file.The major disadvantage is that when the\noriginal file is removed, the symbolic link becomes invalid and does not work any longer. Some information on Inode:Linux stores administrative data about files in inodes. Every file on Linux has an\ninode, and in the inode, important information about the file is stored:Just one important piece of information is not stored in the inode: the name. Names\nare stored in the directory, and each filename knows which inode it has to address to\naccess further file information. It is interesting to know that an inode does not know\nwhich name it has; it just knows how many names are associated with the inode.\nThese names are referred to as hard links.\nWhen you create a file, you give it a name. Basically, this name is a hard link.Symbolic links give another name to a file, in a way similar to hard links. But a file can be deleted even if there are remaining symbolic links.
