How can you you insert a newline from your batch file output?I want to do something like:> echo hello\\nworldWhich would output:hello \n  worldecho hello & echo.worldThis means you could define & echo. as a constant for a newline.Use:Here you go, create a .bat file with the following in it:You should see output like the following:You only need the code between the REM statements, obviously. There is a standard feature echo: in cmd/bat-files to write blank line, which emulates a new line in your cmd-output:Output of cited above cmd-file:Like the answer of Ken, but with the use of the delayed expansion.  First a single linefeed character is created and assigned to the \\n-variable.\nThis works as the caret at the line end tries to escape the next character, but if this is a Linefeed it is ignored and the next character is read and escaped (even if this is also a linefeed).\nThen you need a third linefeed to end the current instruction, else the third line would be appended to the LF-variable.\nEven batch files have line endings with CR/LF only the LF are important, as the CR\'s are removed in this phase of the parser.  The advantage of using the delayed expansion is, that there is no special character handling at all.\necho Line1%LF%Line2 would fail, as the parser stops parsing at single linefeeds.  More explanations are at\nSO:Long commands split over multiple lines in Vista/DOS batch (.bat) file\nSO:How does the Windows Command Interpreter (CMD.EXE) parse scripts?Edit: Avoid echo. This doesn\'t answer the question, as the question was about single echo that can output multiple lines.But despite the other answers who suggests the use of echo. to create a new line, it should be noted that echo. is the worst, as it\'s very slow and it can completly fail, as cmd.exe searches for a file named ECHO and try to start it.  For printing just an empty line, you could use one of But the use of echo., echo\\ or echo: should be avoided, as they can be really slow, depending of the location where the script will be executed, like a network drive.echo. Enough said.If you need it in a single line, use the &. For example,would output as:Now, say you want something a bit fancier, ...OutputsThen just throw in a %n% whenever you want a new line in an echo statement.  This is more close to your \\n used in various languages.Breakdownset n= sets the variable n equal to:^ Nulls out the next symbol to follow:& Means to do another command on the same line.  We don\'t care about errorlevel(its an echo statement for crying out loud), so no && is needed.echo. Continues the echo statement.All of this works because you can actually create variables that are code, and use them inside of other commands.  It is sort of like a ghetto function, since batch is not exactly the most advanced of shell scripting languages.  This only works because batch\'s poor usage of variables, not designating between ints, chars, floats, strings, etc naturally.If you are crafty, you could get this to work with other things.  For example, using it to echo a tabWhen echoing something to redirect to a file, multiple echo commands will not work. I think maybe the ">>" redirector is a good choice:Just like Grimtron suggests - here is a quick example to define it:If you need to put results to a file, you can use You can also do like this,The output will be,Note that when this is put in a batch file, \'%\' shall be doubled.If anybody comes here because they are looking to echo a blank line from a MINGW make makefile, I used@cmd /c echo.simply using echo. causes the dreaded process_begin: CreateProcess(NULL, echo., ...) failed. error message.I hope this helps at least one other person out there :)To start a new line in batch, all you have to do is add "echo[", like so:Ken and Jeb solutions works well.But the new lines are generated with only an LF character and I need CRLF characters (Windows version).To this, at the end of the script, I have converted LF to CRLF.Example:You can use @echo ( @echo + [space] + [insecable space] )Note: The insecable space can be obtained with Alt+0160Hope it helps :)[edit] Hmm you\'re right, I needed it in a Makefile, it works perfectly in there. I guess my answer is not adapted for batch files... My bad.This worked for me, no delayed expansion necessary:It writes output like this:I can\'t make it any simpler than:I am not sure why people did not recommend this but echo has an option to enable backslash escapes, which mean \\n would work with echo.Hencewould give output
