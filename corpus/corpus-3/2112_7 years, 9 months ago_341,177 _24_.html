This question already has an answer here:I\'m not clear on how git revert works. For example, I want to revert to a commit six commits behind the head, reverting all the changes in the intermediary commits in between.Say its SHA hash is 56e05fced214c44a37759efa2dfc25a65d8ae98d. Then why can\'t I just do something like:?If you want to commit on top of the current HEAD with the exact state at a different commit, undoing all the intermediate commits, then you can use reset to create the correct state of the index to make the commit.What git-revert does is create a commit which undoes changes made in a given commit, creating a commit which is reverse (well, reciprocal) of a given commit. Therefore should and does work.If you want to rewind back to a specified commit, and you can do this because this part of history was not yet published, you need to use git-reset, not git-revert:(Note that --hard would make you lose any non-committed changes in the working directory).By the way, perhaps it is not obvious, but everywhere where documentation says <commit> or <commit-ish> (or <object>), you can put an SHA-1 identifier (full or shortened) of commit.It reverts the said commit, that is, adds the commit opposite to it. If you want to checkout an earlier revision, you do:The best way to rollback to a specific commit is:Then:If your changes have already been pushed to a public, shared remote, and you want to revert all commits between HEAD and <sha-id>, then you can pass a commit range to git revert,and it will revert all commits between 56e05f and HEAD (excluding the start point of the range, 56e05f).Updated:This answer is simpler than my answer: How to revert Git repository to a previous commit?Original answerThe two commands git reset --hard and git reset --soft are magic here. The first one changes the working directory, but it also changes head too. We fix the head by the second one.This is more understandable:And to prove that it worked:Should be as simple as:That\'ll get you back to that specific point in time.This might work:
