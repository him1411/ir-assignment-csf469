Is there a simple method of parsing XML files in C#? If so, what?I\'d use LINQ to XML if you\'re in .NET 3.5 or higher.It\'s very simple. I know these are standard methods, but you can create your own library to deal with that much better.Here are some examples:Also, there are some other methods to work with. For example, here. And I think there is no one best method to do this; you always need to choose it by yourself, what is most suitable for you.Use a good XSD Schema to create a set of classes with xsd.exe and use an XmlSerializer to create a object tree out of your XML and vice versa. If you have few restrictions on your model, you could even try to create a direct mapping between you model classes and the XML with the Xml*Attributes.There is an introductory article about XML Serialisation on MSDN.Performance tip: Constructing an XmlSerializer is expensive. Keep a reference to your XmlSerializer instance if you intend to parse/write multiple XML files. If you\'re processing a large amount of data (many megabytes) then you want to be using XmlReader to stream parse the XML.Anything else (XPathNavigator, XElement, XmlDocument and even XmlSerializer if you keep the full generated object graph) will result in high memory usage and also a very slow load time.Of course, if you need all the data in memory anyway, then you may not have much choice.Use XmlTextReader, XmlReader, XmlNodeReader and the System.Xml.XPath namespace. And (XPathNavigator, XPathDocument, XPathExpression, XPathnodeIterator).Usually XPath makes reading XML easier, which is what you might be looking for.I\'m not sure whether "best practice for parsing XML" exists. There are numerous technologies suited for different situations. Which way to use depends on the concrete scenario.You can go with LINQ to XML, XmlReader, XPathNavigator or even regular expressions. If you elaborate your needs, I can try to give some suggestions.If you\'re using .NET 2.0, try XmlReader and its subclasses XmlTextReader, and XmlValidatingReader. They provide a fast, lightweight (memory usage, etc.), forward-only way to parse an XML file.If you need XPath capabilities, try the XPathNavigator. If you need the entire document in memory try XmlDocument.You can parse the XML using this library System.Xml.Linq. Below is the sample code I used to parse a XML file You can use ExtendedXmlSerializer to serialize and deserialize.Instalation\nYou can install ExtendedXmlSerializer from nuget or run the following command:Serialization:DeserializationStandard XML Serializer in .NET is very limited.ExtendedXmlSerializer can do this and much more.ExtendedXmlSerializer support .NET 4.5 or higher and .NET Core. You can integrate it with WebApi and AspCore. you can try using XDocument.Load(pathOfYourXmlFileHere)lxml - A python based library for parsing XML for python users
