I have an Excel file that has some Spanish characters (tildes, etc.) that I need to convert to a CSV file to use as an import file.  However, when I do Save As CSV it mangles the "special" Spanish characters that aren\'t ASCII characters.  It also seems to do this with the left and right quotes and long dashes that appear to be coming from the original user creating the Excel file in Mac.Since CSV is just a text file I\'m sure it can handle a UTF8 encoding, so I\'m guessing it is an Excel limitation, but I\'m looking for a way to get from Excel to CSV and keep the non-ASCII characters intact.A simple workaround is to use Google Spreadsheet. Paste (values only if you have complex formulas) or import the sheet then download CSV. I just tried a few characters and it works rather well.NOTE: Google Sheets does have limitations when importing. See here.NOTE: Be careful of sensitive data with Google Sheets.EDIT: Another alternative - basically they use VB macro or addins to force the save as UTF8. I have not tried any of these solutions but they sound reasonable.I\'ve found OpenOffice\'s spreadsheet application, Calc, is really good at handling CSV data. In the "Save As..." dialog, click "Format Options" to get different encodings for CSV. LibreOffice works the same way AFAIK.Save the Excel sheet as "Unicode Text (.txt)". The good news is that all the international characters are in UTF16 (note, not in UTF8). However, the new "*.txt" file is TAB delimited, not comma delimited, and therefore is not a true CSV. (optional) Unless you can use a TAB delimited file for import, use your favorite text editor and replace the TAB characters with commas ",".Import your *.txt file in the target application. Make sure it can accept UTF16 format.If UTF-16 has been properly implemented with support for non-BMP code points, that you can convert a UTF-16 file to UTF-8 without losing information. I leave it to you to find your favourite method of doing so.I use this procedure to import data from Excel to Moodle. I know this is an old question but I happened to come upon this question while struggling with the same issues as the OP.Not having found any of the offered solutions a viable option, I set out to discover if there is a way to do this just using Excel.Fortunately, I have found that the lost character issue only happens (in my case) when saving from xlsx format to csv format.  I tried saving the xlsx file to xls first, then to csv.  It actually worked.Please give it a try and see if it works for you.  Good luck.You can use iconv command under Unix (also available on Windows as libiconv).After saving as CSV under Excel in the command line put:(remember to replace cp1250 with your encoding).Works fast and great for big files like post codes database, which cannot be imported to GoogleDocs (400.000 cells limit).The only "easy way" of doing this is as follows. First, realize that there is a difference between what is displayed and what is kept hidden in the Excel .csv file.(1) Open an Excel file where you have the info (.xls, .xlsx)(2) In Excel, choose "CSV (Comma Delimited) (*.csv) as the file type and save as that type. (3) In NOTEPAD (found under "Programs" and then Accessories in Start menu), open the saved .csv file in Notepad(4) Then choose -> Save As..and at the bottom of the "save as" box, there is a select box labelled as "Encoding". Select UTF-8 (do NOT use ANSI or you lose all accents etc). After selecting UTF-8, then save the file to a slightly different file name from the original.This file is in UTF-8 and retains all characters and accents and can be imported, for example, into MySQL and other database programs.This answer is taken from this forum.Another one I\'ve found useful:\n"Numbers" allows encoding-settings when saving as CSV."nevets1219" is right about Google docs, however if you simply "import" the file it often does not convert it to UTF-8.But if you import the CSV into an existing Google spreadsheet it does convert to UTF-8.Here\'s a recipe:The resulting file will be in UTF-8You can do this on a modern Windows machine without third party software. This method is reliable and it will handle data that includes quoted commas, quoted tab characters, CJK characters, etc.1. Save from ExcelIn Excel, save the data to file.txt using the type Unicode Text (*.txt).2. Start PowerShellRun powershell from the Start menu.3. Load the file in PowerShell4. Save the data as CSVFor those looking for an entirely programmatic (or at least server-side) solution, I\'ve had great success using catdoc\'s xls2csv tool.Install catdoc:Do the conversion:This is blazing fast.Note that it\'s important that you include the -d utf-8 flag, otherwise it will encode the output in the default cp1252 encoding, and you run the risk of losing information.Note that xls2csv also only works with .xls files, it does not work with .xlsx files.What about using Powershell.I was not able to find a VBA solution for this problem on Mac Excel.  There simply seemed to be no way to output UTF-8 text.So I finally had to give up on VBA, bit the bullet, and learned AppleScript.  It wasn\'t nearly as bad as I had thought.Solution is described here:\nhttp://talesoftech.blogspot.com/2011/05/excel-on-mac-goodbye-vba-hello.htmlAssuming an Windows environment, save and work with the file as usual in Excel but then open up the saved Excel file in Gnome Gnumeric (free). Save Gnome Gnumeric\'s spreadsheet as CSV which - for me anyway - saves it as UTF-8 CSV.Easy way to do it: download open office (here), load the spreadsheet and open the excel file (.xls or .xlsx). Then just save it as a text CSV file and a window opens asking to keep the current format or to save as a .ODF format. select "keep the current format" and in the new window select the option that works better for you, according with the language that your file is been written on. For Spanish language select Western Europe (Windows-1252/ WinLatin 1) and the file works just fine. If you select Unicode (UTF-8), it is not going to work with the spanish characters.Save xls file (Excel file) as Unicode text=>file will be saved in text format (.txt)Change format from .txt to .csv (rename the file from XYX.txt to XYX.csvAs funny as it may seem, the easiest way I found to save my 180MB spreadsheet into a UTF8 CSV file was to select the cells into Excel, copy them and to paste the content of the clipboard into SublimeText.A second option to "nevets1219" is to open your CSV file in Notepad++ and do a convertion to ANSI.Choose in the top menu :\nEncoding -> Convert to AnsiMicrosoft Excel has an option to export spreadsheet using Unicode encoding. See following screenshot.easiest way:\nno need Open office and google docsdont open it with Ms-office anyway!!!\nNow you have a tab delimited CSV file.I have written a small Python script that can export worksheets in UTF-8.You just have to provide the Excel file as first parameter followed by the sheets that you would like to export. If you do not provide the sheets, the script will export all worksheets that are present in the Excel file.Encoding -> Convert to Ansi will encode it in ANSI/UNICODE. Utf8 is a subset of Unicode. Perhaps in ANSI will be encoded correctly, but here we are talking about UTF8, @SequenceDigitale.There are faster ways, like exporting as csv ( comma delimited ) and then, opening that csv with Notepad++ ( free ), then Encoding > Convert to UTF8. But only if you have to do this once per file. If you need to change and export fequently, then the best is LibreOffice or GDocs solution.open .csv fine with notepad++. if you see your encoding is good (you see all characters as they should be) press encoding , then convert to ANSI\nelse - find out what is your current encodinganother solution is to open the file by winword and save it as txt and then reopen it by excel and it will work ISACame across the same problem and googled out this post. None of the above worked for me. At last I converted my Unicode .xls to .xml (choose Save as ... XML Spreadsheet 2003) and it produced the correct character. Then I wrote code to parse the xml and extracted content for my use.I used the following solution: Mac Exel 2008 > file > Save-as and then under format use MS_DOS Comma Separated (.csv). Worked perfect.Another way is to open the UTF-8 CSV file in Notepad where it will be displayed correctly.\nThen replace all the "," with tabs.\nPaste all of this into a new excel file.I have the same problem and come across this add in  , and it works perfectly fine in excel 2013 beside excel 2007 and 2010 which it is mention for.Save Dialog > Tools Button > Web Options > Encoding TabI needed to automate this process on my Mac. I originally tried using catdoc/xls2csv as suggested by mpowered, but xls2csv had trouble detecting the original encoding of the document and not all documents were the same. What I ended up doing was setting the default webpage output encoding to be UTF-8 and then providing the files to Apple\'s Automator, applying the Convert Format of Excel Files action to convert to Web Page (HTML). Then using PHP, DOMDocument and XPath, I queried the documents and formatted them to CSV.This is the PHP script (process.php):And this is the shell command I used to convert the HTML documents to csv:This is a really, really roundabout way of doing this, but it was the most reliable method that I found.I use a program that i found on the net (not mine and there is no credit). But it works flowlesshttps://www.dropbox.com/s/vllyvlv6rekd69v/CpConverter.exe?dl=0and click runYou can import to UTF8 or import an UFT8 file, manage it in excel then re export it in UTF8
