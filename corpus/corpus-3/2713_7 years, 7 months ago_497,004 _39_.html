In PHP you can do if(isset($array[\'foo\'])) { ... }. In JavaScript you often use if(array.foo) { ... } to do the same, but this is not exactly the same statement. The condition will also evaluate to false if array.foo does exists but is false or 0 (and probably other values as well).What is the perfect equivalent of PHP\'s isset in JavaScript?In a broader sense, a general, complete guide on JavaScript\'s handling of variables that don\'t exist, variables without a value, etc. would be convenient.I generally use the typeof operator:    It will return "undefined" either if the property doesn\'t exist or its value is undefined.(See also: Difference between undefined and not being defined.)There are other ways to figure out if a property exists on an object, like the hasOwnProperty method:And the in operator:The difference between the last two is that the hasOwnProperty method will check if the property exist physically on the object (the property is not inherited).The in operator will check on all the properties reachable up in the prototype chain, e.g.:As you can see, hasOwnProperty returns false and the in operator returns true when checking the toString method, this method is defined up in the prototype chain, because obj inherits form Object.prototype.Reference to SOURCEThis simple solution works, but not for deep object check.If you are using underscorejs I always useThis solution worked for me.  I always use this generic function to prevent errrors on primitive variables as well as arrays and objects.This is a pretty bulletproof solution for testing if a variable exists :Unfortunately, you cannot simply encapsulate it in a function.You might think of doing something like this :However, this will produce a reference error if variable variable has not been defined, because you cannot pass along a non-existing variable to a function : Uncaught ReferenceError: foo is not definedOn the other hand, it does allow you to test whether function parameters are undefined :Even though no value for y is passed along to function test, our isset function works perfectly in this context, because y is known in function test as an undefined value.Provide the object path as a string, then you can break this string into a path and resolve hasOwnProperty at each step while overwriting the object itself with each iteration.If you are coding in ES6 environment, take a look at this stackoverflow Ques.plus Tests:https://gist.github.com/daylik/24acc318b6abdcdd63b46607513ae073To check wether html block is existing or not, I\'m using this code:Age old thread, but here\'s a new way to run an equivalent isset(). See below for explanation. Note I use StandardJS syntaxNote that in PHP you can reference any variable at any depth - even trying to\naccess a non-array as an array will return a simple true or false:In JavaScript, we don\'t have that freedom, we\'ll always get an error if we do \nthe same  because JS is immediately attempting to access the value of deeper \nbefore we can wrap it in our isset() function so...More failing alternatives:And some working alternatives that can get redundant fast:All of the other answers - though most are viable...I think I covered a lot of it. There are some points I make in my answer that I\ndon\'t touch upon because they - although relevant - are not part of the \nquestion. If need be, though, I can update my answer with links to some of the\nmore technical aspects based on demand.I spent waaay to much time on this so hopefully it helps people out.Thank-you for reading!
