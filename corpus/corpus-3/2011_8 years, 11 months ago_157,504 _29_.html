pre tags are super-useful for code blocks in HTML and for debugging output while writing scripts, but how do I make the text word-wrap instead of printing out one long line?The answer, from this page in CSS:This works great to wrap text and maintain white-space within the pre-tag:I\'ve found that skipping the pre tag and using white-space: pre-wrap on a div is a better solution.I suggest forget the pre and just put it in a textarea.Your indenting will remain and your code wont get word-wrapped in the middle of a path or something. Easier to select text range in a text area too if you want to copy to clipboard.The following is a php excerpt so if your not in php then the way you pack the html special chars will vary.For info on how to copy text to the clipboard in js see: How do I copy to the clipboard in JavaScript? .However...I just inspected the stackoverflow code blocks and they wrap in a <code> tag wrapped in <pre> tag with css ...Also the content of the stackoverflow code blocks is syntax highlighted using (I think) http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/ .Its a nice setup but Im just going with textareas for now.This is what I needed. It kept words from breaking but allowed for dynamic width in the pre area.You can either:to maintain the monospace font but add word-wrap, or:which will allow a fixed size with horizontal scrolling for long lines.Try thisTry using Or better throw CSS.I combined @richelectron and @user1433454 answers. \nIt works very well and preserves the text formatting. The following helped me:ThanksThe Best Cross Browser Way worked for me to get line breaks and shows exact code or text: (chrome, internet explorer, Firefox)CSS:HTML:The <pre>-Element stands for "pre-formatted-text" and is intended to keep the formatting of the text (or whatever) between its tags. Therefore it is actually not inteded to have automatic word-wrapping or line-breaks within the <pre>-TagText in a  element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks.source: w3schools.com, emphasises made by myself.
