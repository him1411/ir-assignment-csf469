I am looking to split a commit up and not sure which reset option to use.I was looking at the page Can you explain what "git reset" does in plain english?, but I realized I don\'t really understand what the git index or staging area is and thus the explanations didn\'t help.Also the use cases for --mixed and --soft look the same to me in that answer (when you want to fix and recommit.) Can someone break it down even more?  I realize --mixed is probably the option to go with, but I want to know why. Lastly, what about --hard?Can someone give me a workflow example of how selecting the 3 options would happen?When you modify a file in your repository, the change is initially unstaged. In order to commit it, you must stage it\xe2\x80\x94that is, add it to the index\xe2\x80\x94using git add. When you make a commit, the changes that are committed are those that have been added to the index.git reset changes, at minimum, where the current branch (HEAD) is pointing. The difference between --mixed and --soft is whether or not your index is also modified. So, if we\'re on branch master with this series of commits:HEADpoints to C and the index matches C.When we run git reset --soft B, master (and thus HEAD) now points to B, but the index still has the changes from C; git status will show them as staged. So if we run git commit at this point, we\'ll get a new commit with the same changes as C.Okay, so starting from here again:Now let\'s do git reset --mixed B. (Note: --mixed is the default option). Once again, master and HEAD point to B, but this time the index is also modified to match B. If we run git commit at this point, nothing will happen since the index matches HEAD. We still have the changes in the working directory, but since they\'re not in the index, git status shows them as unstaged. To commit them, you would git add and then commit as usual.And finally, --hard is the same as --mixed (it changes your HEAD and index), except that --hard also modifies your working directory. If we\'re at C and run git reset --hard B, then the changes added in C, as well as any uncommitted changes you have, will be removed, and the files in your working copy will match commit B. Since you can permanently lose changes this way, you should always run git status before doing a hard reset to make sure your working directory is clean or that you\'re okay with losing your uncommitted changes.And finally, a visualization:\nPlease be aware, this is a simplified explanation intended as a first step in seeking to understand this complex functionality.May be helpful for visual learners who want to visualise what their project state looks like after each of these commands:For those who use Terminal with colour turned on \n(git config --global color.ui auto): git reset --soft A and you will see B and C\'s stuff in green (staged and ready to commit) git reset --mixed A (or git reset A) and you will see B and C\'s stuff in red (unstaged and ready to be staged (green) and then committed) git reset --hard A and you will no longer see B and C\'s changes anywhere (will be as if they never existed)Or for those who use a GUI program like \'Tower\' or \'SourceTree\'git reset --soft A and you will see B and C\'s stuff in the \'staged files\' area ready to commitgit reset --mixed A (or git reset A) and you will see B and C\'s stuff in the \'unstaged files\' area ready to be moved to staged and then committedgit reset --hard A and you will no longer see B and C\'s changes anywhere (will be as if they never existed)Here is a basic explanation for TortoiseGit users:git reset --soft and --mixed leave your files untouched. git reset --hard actually change your files to match the commit you reset to.In TortoiseGit, The concept of the index is very hidden by the GUI. When you modify a file, you don\'t have to run git add to add the change to the staging area/index.  When simply dealing with modifications to existing files that are not changing file names, git reset --soft and --mixed are the same! You will only notice a difference if you added new files or renamed files. In this case, if you run git reset --mixed, you will have to re-add your file(s) from the Not Versioned Files list.  A short answer in what context the 3 options are used:To keep the current changes in the code but to rewrite the commit history:To actually lose your changes in the code as well:
