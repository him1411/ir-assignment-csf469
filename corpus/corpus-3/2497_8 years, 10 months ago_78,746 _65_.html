Compiling a C++ file takes a very long time when compared to C# and Java. It takes significantly longer to compile a C++ file than it would to run a normal size Python script. I\'m currently using VC++ but it\'s the same with any compiler. Why is this?The two reasons I could think of were loading header files and running the preprocessor, but that doesn\'t seem like it should explain why it takes so long.Several reasons:Header files: Every single compilation unit requires hundreds or even thousands of headers to be 1: loaded, and 2: compiled. Every one of them typically has to be recompiled for every compilation unit, because the preprocessor ensure that the result of compiling a header might vary between every compilation unit. (A macro may be defined in one compilation unit which changes the content of the header).This is probably the main reason, as it requires huge amounts of code to be compiled for every compilation unit, and additionally, every header has to be compiled multiple times (once for every compilation unit that includes it)Linking: Once compiled, all the object files have to be linked together. This is basically a monolithic process that can\'t very well be parallelized, and has to process your entire project. Parsing: The syntax is extremely complicated to parse, depends heavily on context, and is very hard to disambiguate. This takes a lot of timeTemplates: In C#, List<T> is the only type that is compiled, no matter how many instantiations of List you have in your program. In C++, vector<int> is a completely separate type from vector<float>, and each one will have to be compiled separately.Add to this that templates make up a full turing-complete "sub-language" that the compiler has to interpret, and this can become ridiculously complicated. Even relatively simple template metaprogramming code can define recursive templates that create dozens and dozens of template instantiations. Templates may also result in extremely complex types, with ridiculously long names, adding a lot of extra work to the linker. (It has to compare a lot of symbol names, and if these names can grow into many thousand characters, that can become fairly expensive). And of course, they exacerbate the problems with header files, because templates generally have to be defined in headers, which means far more code has to be parsed and compiled for every compilation unit. In plain C code, a header typically only contains forward declarations, but very little actual code. In C++, it is not uncommon for almost all the code to reside in header files.Optimization: C++ allows for some very dramatic optimizations. C# or Java don\'t allow classes to be completely eliminated (they have to be there for reflection purposes), but even a simple C++ template metaprogram can easily generate dozens or hundreds of classes, all of which are inlined and eliminated again in the optimization phase.Moreover, a C++ program must be fully optimized by the compiler. A C# program can rely on the JIT compiler to perform additional optimizations at load-time, C++ doesn\'t get any such "second chances". What the compiler generates is as optimized as it\'s going to get.Machine code: C++ is compiled to machine code which may be somewhat more complicated than the bytecode Java or .NET use (especially in the case of x86).\n(This is mentioned out of completeness only because it was mentioned in comments and such. In practice, this step is unlikely to take more than a tiny fraction of the total compilation time.)Most of these factors are shared by C code, which actually compiles fairly efficiently. The parsing step is a lot more complicated in C++, and can take up significantly more time, but the main offender is probably templates. They\'re useful, and make C++ a far more powerful language, but they also take their toll in terms of compilation speed.The slowdown is not necessarily the same with any compiler.I haven\'t used Delphi or Kylix but back in the MS-DOS days, a Turbo Pascal program would compile almost instantaneously, while the equivalent Turbo C++ program would just crawl. The two main differences were a very strong module system and a syntax that allowed single-pass compilation.It\'s certainly possible that compilation speed just hasn\'t been a priority for C++ compiler developers, but there are also some inherent complications in the C/C++ syntax that make it more difficult to process. (I\'m not an expert on C, but Walter Bright is, and after building various commercial C/C++ compilers, he created the D language. One of his changes was to enforce a context-free grammar to make the language easier to parse.)Also, you\'ll notice that generally Makefiles are set up so that every file is compiled separately in C, so if 10 source files all use the same include file, that include file is processed 10 times.Parsing and code generation are actually rather fast.  The real problem is opening and closing files.  Remember, even with include guards, the compiler still have open the .H file, and read each line (and then ignore it).A friend once (while bored at work), took his company\'s application and put everything -- all source and header files--  into one big file.   Compile time dropped from 3 hours to 7 minutes.C++ is compiled into machine code. So you have the pre-processor, the compiler, the optimizer, and finally the assembler, all of which have to run.Java and C# are compiled into byte-code/IL, and the Java virtual machine/.NET Framework execute (or JIT compile into machine code) prior to execution.Python is an interpreted language that is also compiled into byte-code.I\'m sure there are other reasons for this as well, but in general, not having to compile to native machine language saves time.Another reason is the use of the C pre-processor for locating declarations. Even with header guards, .h still have to be parsed over and over, every time they\'re included.  Some compilers support pre-compiled headers that can help with this, but they are not always used.See also: C++ Frequently Questioned AnswersThe biggest issues are:1) The infinite header reparsing. Already mentioned. Mitigations (like #pragma once) usually only work per compilation unit, not per build. 2) The fact that the toolchain is often separated into multiple binaries (make, preprocessor, compiler, assembler, archiver, impdef, linker, and dlltool in extreme cases) that all have to reinitialize and reload all state all the time for each invocation (compiler, assembler) or every couple of files (archiver, linker, and dlltool).See also this discussion on comp.compilers: http://compilers.iecc.com/comparch/article/03-11-078 specially this one:http://compilers.iecc.com/comparch/article/02-07-128Note that John, the moderator of comp.compilers seems to agree, and that this means it should be possible to achieve similar speeds for C too, if one integrates the toolchain fully and implements precompiled headers. Many commercial C compilers do this to some degree.Note that the Unix model of factoring everything out to a separate binary is a kind of the worst case model for Windows (with its slow process creation). It is very noticable when comparing GCC build times between Windows and *nix, especially if the make/configure system also calls some programs just to obtain information.A compiled language is always going to require a bigger initial overhead than an interpreted language. In addition, perhaps you didn\'t structure your C++ code very well. For example:Compiles a lot slower than:Building C/C++: what really happens and why does it take so longA relatively large portion of software development time is not spent on writing, running, debugging or even designing code, but waiting for it to finish compiling.\nIn order to make things fast, we first have to understand what is happening when C/C++ software is compiled. The steps are roughly as follows:We will now look at each step in more detail focusing on how they can be made faster.ConfigurationThis is the first step when starting to build. Usually means running a configure script or CMake, Gyp, SCons or some other tool. This can take anything from one second to several minutes for very large Autotools-based configure scripts.This step happens relatively rarely. It only needs to be run when changing configurations or changing the build configuration. Short of changing build systems, there is not much to be done to make this step faster.Build tool startupThis is what happens when you run make or click on the build icon on an IDE (which is usually an alias for make). The build tool binary starts and reads its configuration files as well as the build configuration, which are usually the same thing.Depending on build complexity and size, this can take anywhere from a fraction of a second to several seconds. By itself this would not be so bad. Unfortunately most make-based build systems cause make to be invocated tens to hundreds of times for every single build. Usually this is caused by recursive use of make (which is bad).It should be noted that the reason Make is so slow is not an implementation bug. The syntax of Makefiles has some quirks that make a really fast implementation all but impossible. This problem is even more noticeable when combined with the next step.Dependency checkingOnce the build tool has read its configuration, it has to determine what files have changed and which ones need to be recompiled. The configuration files contain a directed acyclic graph describing the build dependencies. This graph is usually built during the configure step.\nBuild tool startup time and the dependency scanner are run on every single build. Their combined runtime determines the lower bound on the edit-compile-debug cycle. For small projects this time is usually a few seconds or so. This is tolerable.\nThere are alternatives to Make. The fastest of them is Ninja, which was built by Google engineers for Chromium.\nIf you are using CMake or Gyp to build, just switch to their Ninja backends. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to change anything in the build files themselves, just enjoy the speed boost. Ninja is not packaged on most distributions, though, so you might have to install it yourself.CompilationAt this point we finally invoke the compiler. Cutting some corners, here are the approximate steps taken.Contrary to popular belief, compiling C++ is not actually all that slow. The STL is slow and most build tools used to compile C++ are slow. However there are faster tools and ways to mitigate the slow parts of the language.Using them takes a bit of elbow grease, but the benefits are undeniable. Faster build times lead to happier developers, more agility and, eventually, better code.Some reasons are:1) C++ grammar is more complex than C# or Java and takes more time to parse.2) (More important) C++ compiler produces machine code and does all optimizations during compilation. C# and Java go just half way and leave these steps to JIT.The trade off you are getting is that the program runs a wee bit faster. That may be a cold comfort to you during development, but it could matter a great deal once development is complete, and the program is just being run by users.Most answers are being a bit unclear in mentioning that C# will always run slower due to the cost of performing actions that in C++ are performed only once at compile time, this performance cost is also impacted due runtime dependencies (more things to load to be able to run), not to mention that C# programs will always have higher memory footprint, all resulting in performance being more closely related to the capability of hardware available. The same is true to other languages that are interpreted or depend on a VM.An easy way to reduce compilation time in larger C++ projects is to make a *.cpp include file that includes all the cpp files in your project and compile that.  This reduces the header explosion problem to once.  The advantage of this is that compilation errors will still reference the correct file. For example, assume you have a.cpp, b.cpp and c.cpp.. create a file: everything.cpp:Then compile the project by just making everything.cppThere are two issues I can think of that might be affecting the speed at which your programs in C++ are compiling.POSSIBLE ISSUE #1 - COMPILING THE HEADER: (This may or may not have already been addressed by another answer or comment.) Microsoft Visual C++ (A.K.A. VC++) supports precompiled headers, which I highly recommend. When you create a new project and select the type of program you are making, a setup wizard window should appear on your screen. If you hit the \xe2\x80\x9cNext >\xe2\x80\x9d button at the bottom of it, the window will take you to a page that has several lists of features; make sure that the box next to the \xe2\x80\x9cPrecompiled header\xe2\x80\x9d option is checked. (NOTE: This has been my experience with Win32 console applications in C++, but this may not be the case with all kinds of programs in C++.)POSSIBLE ISSUE #2 - THE LOCATION BEING COMPILED TO: This summer, I took a programming course, and we had to store all of our projects on 8GB flash drives, as the computers in the lab we were using got wiped every night at midnight, which would have erased all of our work. If you are compiling to an external storage device for the sake of portability/security/etc., it can take a very long time (even with the precompiled headers that I mentioned above) for your program to compile, especially if it\xe2\x80\x99s a fairly large program. My advice for you in this case would be to create and compile programs on the hard drive of the computer you\xe2\x80\x99re using, and whenever you want/need to stop working on your project(s) for whatever reason, transfer them to your external storage device, and then click the \xe2\x80\x9cSafely Remove Hardware and Eject Media\xe2\x80\x9d icon, which should appear as a small flash drive behind a little green circle with a white check mark on it, to disconnect it.I hope this helps you; let me know if it does! :)As already commented, the compiler spends a lot of time instantiating and instantiating over again the templates.  To such an extend that there are projects that focus on that particular item, and claim an observable 30x speed-up in some really favorable cases.  See http://www.zapcc.com.
