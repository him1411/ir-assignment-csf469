How can I set an icon for my android application?If you intend on your application being available on a large range of devices, you should place your application icon into the different res/drawable... folders provided. In each of these folders, you should include a 48dp sized icon:You may then define the icon in your AndroidManifest.xml file as such:I found this tool most useful.Donehttp://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/Add application launcher icon with automatic sizing ( Android studio ) Go to File > New > Image Assets > select launcher icon > choose image file. It will automatically re-size. Done ! Put your images in mipmap folder and set in manifest file...\nlike as  App Folder Directory :Icon Size & Format :\nPlace your images in drawables folder under either of the three and set it like this.CodeRight click your project, go to New > Other > Android > Android Icon SetThen follow the instructions on the WizardIt\'s simple now simply go to File -> New -> Image Asset\nThis will open a new dialogue and then make sure Launcher Icons is selected (Which it is by default) and then browse to the directory of your icon (It doesn\'t have to be in the project resources) and then once selected make sure other settings are to your liking and hit done. Now all resolutions are saved into their respective folders and you don\'t have to worry about copying it yourself or using tools etc.Don\'t forget "Shape - none" for a transparent BG.1-Create Your icon in Photoshop Or Coreldraw by size 256*256note that use PNG file format if you want to have a transparent icon2-Upload Your icon in https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/icons-launcher.html3-Set your setting on this site \n4-Download the zip file automatically created by the webpage by clicking on download button\n5-Extract the zip file and copy res folder to you project library\nnote that res folder contain all size icon6-finally you need to set the manifest to use iconYou can start by reading the documentation.Here is a link:How to change the launcher logo of an app in Android Studio?Open manifest file and set Run programIf you have an SVG icon, you can use this script to generate your android icon set.You have to follow steps like:Now you can run and see your application icon with new image.Happy Coding :) :)A bit old, but for future use:You can simply install an Android studio Martial icons plugin its name is  please check plugin URL \nMaterial Design Icon Generator and check this gif for more details This mainly for creating the icons with required sizes and it will be located directly in its folders.https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.htmlYou should create separate icons for all generalized screen densities,\n  including low-, medium-, high-, and extra-high-density screens. This\n  ensures that your icons will display properly across the range of\n  devices on which your application can be installed...Launcher icons should be 32-bit PNGs with an alpha channel for\n  transparency. The finished launcher icon dimensions corresponding to a\n  given generalized screen density are shown in the table below.android:icon="@drawable/icon_name" or android:icon="@mipmap/icon_name"developer.android.com/guide says,This attribute must be set as a reference to a drawable resource\n  containing the image (for example "@drawable/icon").about launcher icons android-developers.googleblog.com says,It\xe2\x80\x99s best practice to place your app icons in mipmap- folders (not the\n  drawable- folders) because they are used at resolutions different from\n  the device\xe2\x80\x99s current density. For example, an xxxhdpi app icon can be\n  used on the launcher for an xxhdpi device.Dianne Hackborn from Google (Android Framework) says,If you are building different versions of your app for different\n  densities, you should know about the "mipmap" resource directory. \n  This is exactly like "drawable" resources, except it does not\n  participate in density stripping when creating the different apk\n  targets.Little bit more quoting thisYou want to load an image for your device density and you are going to use it "as is", without changing its actual size. In this case you should work with drawables and Android will give you the best fitting image.You want to load an image for your device density, but this image is going to be scaled up or down. For instance this is needed when you want to show a bigger launcher icon, or you have an animation, which increases image\'s size. In such cases, to ensure best image quality, you should put your image into mipmap folder. What Android will do is, it will try to pick up the image from a higher density bucket instead of scaling it up. This will increase sharpness (quality) of the image.Fore more you can read mipmap vs drawable foldersRead more :  https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design_launcher.htmlGoto File->new->ImageAsset.From their you can create Image Assets for your icon.After that we will get icon image in mipmap different formats like\n    hdpi,mdpi,xhdpi,xxhdpi,xxxhdpi.Now goto AndroidManifest.xml
