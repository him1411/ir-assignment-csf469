I hear a lot about spring, people are saying all over the web that Spring is a good framework for web development. What exactly is Spring Framework for? How can I use it for my Web-Java application development? any examples?Basically Spring is a framework for dependency-injection which is a pattern that allows to build very decoupled systems.For example, suppose you need to list the users of the system and thus declare an interface called UserLister:And maybe an implementation accessing a database to get all the users:In your view you\'ll need to access an instance (just an example, remember):Note that the code above doesn\'t have initialized the variable userLister. What should we do? If I explicitly instantiate the object like this:...I\'d couple the view with my implementation of the class that access the DB. What if I want to switch from the DB implementation to another that gets the user list from a comma-separated file (remember, it\'s an example)? In that case I would go to my code again and change the last line by:This has no problem with a small program like this but... What happens in a program that has hundreds of views and a similar number of business classes. The maintenance becomes a nightmare!What Spring does is to wire the classes up by using a XML file, this way all the objects are instantiated and initialized by Spring and injected in the right places (Servlets, Web Frameworks, Business classes, DAOs, etc, etc, etc...).Going back to the example in Spring we just need to have a setter for the userLister field and have an XML like this:This way when the view is created it magically will have a UserLister ready to work. It is great! Isn\'t it?There are some other options for Dependency Injection around there, what in my opinion has made Spring so famous besides its simplicity, elegance and stability is that the guys of SpringSource have programmed many many POJOs that help to integrate Spring with many other common frameworks without being intrusive in your application. Also Spring has several good subprojects like Spring MVC, Spring WebFlow, Spring Security and again a loooong list of etceteras.Hope this helps. Anyway, I encourage you to read Martin Fowler\'s article about Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control because he does it better than me. After understanding the basics take a look to Spring Documentation, in my opinion it is used to be the best Spring book ever.Spring contains (as Skaffman rightly pointed out) a MVC framework. To explain in short here are my inputs.\nSpring supports segregation of service layer, web layer and business layer, but what it really does best is "injection" of objects. So to explain that with an example consider the example below:Now in your code you have a class called RoadTrip as followsNow whenever you want a instance of Trip; sometimes you may want a SUV to initialize FourWheel or sometimes you may want Sedan. It really depends what you want based on specific situation. To solve this problem you\'d want to have a Factory Pattern as creational pattern. Where a factory returns the right instance. So eventually you\'ll end up with lots of glue code just to instantiate objects correctly. Spring does the job of glue code best without that glue code. You declare mappings in XML and it initialized the objects automatically. It also does lot using singleton architecture for instances and that helps in optimized memory usage.This is also called Inversion Of Control. Other frameworks to do this are Google guice, Pico container etc. Apart from this, Spring has validation framework, extensive support for DAO layer in collaboration with JDBC, iBatis and Hibernate (and many more). Provides excellent Transactional control over database transactions. There is lot more to Spring that can be read up in good books like "Pro Spring".Following URLs may be of help too.\nhttp://static.springframework.org/docs/Spring-MVC-step-by-step/\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Framework\nhttp://www.theserverside.com/tt/articles/article.tss?l=SpringFramework What is Spring for? I will answer that question shortly, but first, let\'s take another look at the example by victor hugo. It\'s not a great example because it doesn\'t justify the need for a new framework.Done! So now even if you have hundreds or thousands of views, you still just need to change the one line of code, as in the Spring XML approach.\nBut changing a line of code still requires recompiling as opposed to editing XML you say? Well my fussy friend, use Ant and script away!So what is Spring for? It\'s for:Further reading: http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/?joel.3.219431.12Old days, spring was a dependency injection frame work only like (Guice, PicoContainer,...), but now a days it is a total solutions for building you Enterprise Application.The spring dependency injection, which is of course the heart of spring is still there (and you can review other good answers here), but there are more from spring  ....Spring now has lots of projects, each with some sub projects (http://spring.io/projects) . When some one speaks about spring, you must find out what spring project he is talking about, is it only spring core, which is known as spring framework, or it is another spring projects.Some spring projects which is worth too mention are:If you need some more specify feature for your application, you may find it there too:There are also some small projects there for example spring-social-facebook (http://projects.spring.io/spring-social-facebook/)You can use spring for web development as it has the Spring MVC module which is part of spring framework project. Or you can use spring with another web frame work, like struts2.Very short summarized, I will say that Spring is the "glue" in your application. It\'s used to integrate different frameworks and your own code.What you\'d probably want in a web application with Spring - In addition, Spring is HUGE - so there are a lot of other things you might be interested in using in a web app such as Spring AOP or Spring Security. But the four things listed above describe the common components of Spring that are used in a web app. Spring is three things.The problem is that Spring DI is really well thought out, the wrappers around other things are really well thought out in that the other things thought everything out and Spring just nicely wraps it. The Spring implementations of MVC and REST and all the other stuff is not as well done (YMMV, IMHO) but there are exceptions (Spring Security is da bomb). So I tend to use Spring for DI, and its cool wrappers but prefer other stuff for Web (I like Tapestry a lot), REST (Jersey is really robust), etc.I see two parts to this:Note that you can perfectly well use Spring in a web application without using Spring MVC. I would say most Java web applications do this, while using other web frameworks like Wicket, Struts, Seam, ...Spring is great for gluing instances of classes together.  You know that your Hibernate classes are always going to need a datasource, Spring wires them together (and has an implementation of the datasource too).  Your data access objects will always need Hibernate access, Spring wires the Hibernate classes into your DAOs for you.Additionally, Spring basically gives you solid configurations of a bunch of libraries, and in that, gives you guidance in what libs you should use. Spring is really a great tool.  (I wasn\'t talking about Spring MVC, just the base framework).Spring is a good alternative to Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) technology. It also has web framework and web services framework component.The advantage is Dependency Injection (DI). It means outsourcing the task of object creation.Let me explain with an example. Now in my code I have a class LunchDecide as follows: In the above class, depending on our mood, we pick Buffet() or Plated(). However this system is tightly coupled. Every time we need a different type of Object, we need to change the code. In this case, commenting out a line ! Imagine there are 50 different classes used by 50 different people. It would be a hell of a mess. In this case, we need to Decouple the system. Let\'s rewrite the LunchDecide class. Notice that instead of creating an object using new keyword we passed the reference to an object of Lunch Type as a parameter to our constructor. Here, object creation is outsourced. This code can be wired either using Xml config file (legacy) or Java Annotations (modern). Either way, the decision on which Type of object would be created would be done there during runtime. An object would be injected by Xml into our code - Our Code is dependent on Xml for that job. Hence, Dependency Injection (DI). \nDI not only helps in making our system loosely coupled, it simplifies writing of Unit tests since it allows dependencies to be mocked. Last but not the least, DI streamlines Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) which leads to further decoupling and increase of modularity. \nAlso note that above DI is Constructor Injection. DI can be done by Setter Injection as well - same plain old setter method from encapsulation. The accepted answer doesn\'t involve the annotations usage since Spring introduced support for various annotations for configuration.There the another way to wire the classes up alongside using a XML file: the annotations. Let\'s use the example from the accepted answer and register the bean directly in the class using the only annotation @Bean:This way when the view is created it magically will have a UserLister ready to work.The above statement is valid with a little bonus of no need of any XML file usage and wiring with another annotation @Autowired that finds a relevant implementation and inject it in.Spring started off as a fairly simple dependency injection system. Now it is huge and has everything in it (except for the proverbial kitchen sink).But fear not, it is quite modular so you can use just the pieces you want.To see where it all began try:http://www.amazon.com/Expert-One-Design-Development-Programmer/dp/0764543857/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1246374863&sr=1-1 It might be old but it is an excellent book.For another good book this time exclusively devoted to Spring see:http://www.amazon.com/Professional-Java-Development-Spring-Framework/dp/0764574833/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1246374863&sr=1-2It also references older versions of Spring but is definitely worth looking at.Spring was dependency injection in the begining, then add king of wrappers for almost everything (wrapper over JPA implementations etc).Long story ... most parts of Spring preffer XML solutions (XML scripting engine ... brrrr), so for DI I use GuiceGood library, but with growing depnedenciec, for example Sprong JDBC (maybe one Java jdbc solution with real names parameters) take from maven 4-5 next.Using Spring MVC (part of "big spring") for web development ... it is "request based" framework, there is holy war "request vs component" ... up to You
