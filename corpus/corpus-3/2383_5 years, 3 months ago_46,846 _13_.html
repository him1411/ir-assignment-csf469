In VS2012 when you select a file in solution explorer it automatically opens file in a special "preview" tab.Maybe my computer is not fast enough, but this preview is too slow for my taste.How do I disable this feature?In Tools > Options > Environment > Tabs and Windows, you can disable it by unckecking "Solution explorer" under Preview tab.I find it using the "Quick launch" new feature. Simply type "preview", and a link to the setting will be suggested. Great new feature of VSYou can also toggle file preview within the Solution Explorer tool-window itself:This may have been added in the July update because I hadn\'t noticed it before then.One of the buttons at the top of the solution explorer toggles whether this is enabled.On Visual Studio 2013 I have done this by this Icon : An even better solution IMO is to completely disable the File Preview feature (not just for Solution Explorer):This also prevents things like Go To Definition (F12) from using preview tabs.
