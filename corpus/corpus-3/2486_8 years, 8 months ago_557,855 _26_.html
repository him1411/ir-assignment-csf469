cd as in the shell command to change the working directory.How do I change the current working directory in Python?You can change the working directory with:There are two best practices to follow when using this method:Changing the current working directory in a subprocess does not change the current working directory in the parent process.  This is true of the Python interpreter as well.  You cannot use os.chdir() to change the CWD of the calling process.Here\'s an example of a context manager to change the working directory. It is simpler than an ActiveState version referred to elsewhere, but this gets the job done.Or try the more concise equivalent(below), using ContextManager.I would use os.chdir like this:By the way, if you need to figure out your current path, use os.getcwd().More here: http://effbot.org/librarybook/os.htmcd() is easy to write using a generator and a decorator.Then, the directory is reverted even after an exception is thrown:If you\'re using a relatively new version of Python, you can also use a context manager, such as this one:UPDATEIf you prefer to roll your own:os.chdir() is the right way.As already pointed out by others, all the solutions above only change the working directory of the current process. This is lost when you exit back to the Unix shell. If desperate you can change the parent shell directory on Unix with this horrible hack:os.chdir() is the Pythonic version of cd.Further into direction pointed out by Brian and based on sh (1.0.8+)If You would like to perform something like "cd.." option, just type:os.chdir("..") it is the same as in Windows cmd: cd..\nOf course import os is neccessary (e.g type it as 1st line of your code)Try this on python command line:Changing the current directory of the script process is trivial. I think the question is actually how to change the current directory of the command window from which a python script is invoked, which is very difficult. A Bat script in Windows or a Bash script in a Bash shell can do this with an ordinary cd command because the shell itself is the interpreter. In both Windows and Linux Python is a program and no program can directly change its parent\'s environment. However the combination of a simple shell script with a Python script doing most of the hard stuff can achieve the desired result. For example, to make an extended cd command with traversal history for backward/forward/select revisit, I wrote a relatively complex Python script invoked by a simple bat script. The traversal list is stored in a file, with the target directory on the first line. When the python script returns, the bat script reads the first line of the file and makes it the argument to cd. The complete bat script (minus comments for brevity) is:The python script, dSup.py is:and for easy interactive use, ipython has all the common shell commands built in.
