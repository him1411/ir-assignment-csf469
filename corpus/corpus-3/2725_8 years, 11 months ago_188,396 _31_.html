How do I concatenate two std::vectors?I would use the insert function, something like:If you are using C++11,  and wish to move the elements rather than merely copying them, you can use std::move_iterator (http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/move_iterator) along with insert (or copy):This will not be more efficient for the example with ints, since moving them is no more efficient than copying them, but for a data structure with optimized moves, it can avoid copying unnecessary state:After the move, src\'s element is left in an undefined but safe-to-destruct state, and its former elements were transfered directly to dest\'s new element at the end.Or you could use:This pattern is useful if the two vectors don\'t contain exactly the same type of thing, because you can use something instead of std::back_inserter to convert from one type to the other.With C++11, I\'d prefer following to append vector b to a:when a and b are not overlapped, and b is not going to be used anymore.I prefer one that is already mentioned: But if you use C++11, there is one more generic way:Also, not part of a question, but it is advisable to use reserve before appending for better performance. And if you are concatenating vector with itself, without reserving it fails, so you always should reserve.So basically what you need:If you are interested in strong exception guarantee (when copy constructor can throw an exception):Similar append_move with strong guarantee can\'t be implemented in general if vector element\'s move constructor can throw (which is unlikely but still).Add this one to your header file:and use it this way:r will contain [1,2,62]With range v3, you may have a lazy concatenation:Demo.You should use vector::insert If what you\'re looking for is a way to append a vector to another after creation, vector::insert is your best bet, as has been answered several times, for example:Sadly there\'s no way to construct a const vector<int>, as above you must construct and then insert.If what you\'re actually looking for is a container to hold the concatenation of these two vector<int>s, there may be something better available to you, if:If the above are all true, I\'d suggest using the basic_string who\'s char_type matches the size of the primitive contained in your vector. You should include a static_assert in your code to validate these sizes stay consistent:With this holding true you can just do:For more information on the differences between string and vector you can look here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/35558008/2642059For a live example of this code you can look here: http://ideone.com/7Iww3ITo be honest, you could fast concatenate two vectors by copy elements from two vectors into the other one or just only append one of two vectors!. It depends on your aim.Method 1: Assign new vector with its size is the sum of two original vectors\' size.Method 2: Append vector A by adding/inserting elements of vector B.
