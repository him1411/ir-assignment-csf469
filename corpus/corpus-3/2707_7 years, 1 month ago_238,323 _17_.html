Is there any way to get the API version that the phone is currently running?As described in the Android documentation, the SDK level (integer) the phone is running is available in:android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INTThe class corresponding to this int is in the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES class.Code example:Edit: This SDK_INT is available since Donut (android 1.6 / API4) so make sure your application is not retro-compatible with Cupcake (android 1.5 / API3) when you use it or your application will crash (thanks to Programmer Bruce for the precision).Corresponding android documentation is here and hereThat will give you the actual numbers of your version; aka 2.3.3 or 2.2.\nThe problem with using Build.VERSION.SDK_INT is if you have a rooted phone or custom rom, you could have a none standard OS (aka my android is running 2.3.5) and that will return a null when using Build.VERSION.SDK_INT so Build.VERSION.RELEASE will work no matter what!To use it, you could just do this;Taking into account all said, here is the code I use for detecting if device has Froyo or newer Android OS (2.2+):Obviously, you can modify that if condition to take into account 1.0 & 1.5 versions of Android in case you need generic checker. You will probably end up with something like this:Let me know if code is not working for you.android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK should give you the value of the API Level. You can easily find the mapping from api level to android version in the android documentation. I believe, 8 is for 2.2, 7 for 2.1, and so on.try this:Got it. Its using the getApplicationInfo() method of the Context class.i prefer have the version as number to be handeled more easyway than i wrote this:I improved code i used
