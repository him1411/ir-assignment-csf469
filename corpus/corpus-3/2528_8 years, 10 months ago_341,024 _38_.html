How can I validate a username and password against Active Directory? I simply want to check if a username and password are correct.If you work on .NET 3.5 or newer, you can use the System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement namespace and easily verify your credentials:It\'s simple, it\'s reliable, it\'s 100% C# managed code on your end - what more can you ask for? :-)Read all about it here:Update:As outlined in this other SO question (and its answers), there is an issue with this call possibly returning True for old passwords of a user. Just be aware of this behavior and don\'t be too surprised if this happens :-) (thanks to @MikeGledhill for pointing this out!)We do this on our IntranetYou have to use System.DirectoryServices;Here are the guts of the codeSeveral solutions presented here lack the ability to differentiate between a wrong user / password, and a password that needs to be changed. That can be done in the following way:If the users password is wrong, or the user doesn\'t exists, error will contain "8009030C: LdapErr: DSID-0C0904DC, comment: AcceptSecurityContext error, data 52e, v1db1", if the users password needs to be changed, it will contain "8009030C: LdapErr: DSID-0C0904DC, comment: AcceptSecurityContext error, data 773, v1db1"The lexc.ServerErrorMessage data value is a hex representation of the Win32 Error Code.  These are the same error codes which would be returned by otherwise invoking the Win32 LogonUser API call.  The list below summarizes a range of common values with hex and decimal values:very simple solution using DirectoryServices:the NativeObject access is required to detect a bad user/passwordUnfortunately there is no "simple" way to check a users credentials on AD.With every method presented so far, you may get a false-negative: A user\'s creds will be valid, however AD will return false under certain circumstances:ActiveDirectory will not allow you to use LDAP to determine if a password is invalid due to the fact that a user must change password or if their password has expired.To determine password change or password expired, you may call Win32:LogonUser(), and check the windows error code for the following 2 constants:Probably easiest way is to PInvoke LogonUser Win32 API.e.g.http://www.pinvoke.net/default.aspx/advapi32/LogonUser.htmlMSDN Reference here...http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa378184.aspxDefinitely want to use logon typeThis creates a lightweight token only - perfect for AuthN checks.  (other types can be used to build interactive sessions etc.)A full .Net solution is to use the classes from the System.DirectoryServices namespace. They allow to query an AD server directly. Here is a small sample that would do this:This code directly connects to the AD server, using the credentials provided. If the credentials are invalid, searcher.FindOne() will throw an exception. The ErrorCode is the one corresponding to the "invalid username/password" COM error.You don\'t need to run the code as an AD user. In fact, I succesfully use it to query informations on an AD server, from a client outside the domain !Yet another .NET call to quickly authenticate LDAP credentials:Try this code\n(NOTE: Reported to not work on windows server 2000) except you\'ll need to create your own custom exception for "LogonException"If you are stuck with .NET 2.0 and managed code, here is another way that works whith local and domain accounts:My Simple Function Windows authentication can fail for various reasons: an incorrect user name or password, a locked account, an expired password, and more. To distinguish between these errors, call the LogonUser API function via P/Invoke and check the error code if the function returns false:Sample usage:Note: LogonUser requires a trust relationship with the domain you\'re validating against.
