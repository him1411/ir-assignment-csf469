How to select rows from a DataFrame based on values in some column in pandas?\nIn SQL I would use: I tried to look at pandas documentation but did not immediately find the answer.To select rows whose column value equals a scalar, some_value, use ==:To select rows whose column value is in an iterable, some_values, use isin:Combine multiple conditions with &: To select rows whose column value does not equal some_value, use !=:isin returns a boolean Series, so to select rows whose value is not in some_values, negate the boolean Series using ~:For example,yieldsIf you have multiple values you want to include, put them in a\nlist (or more generally, any iterable) and use isin:yieldsNote, however, that if you wish to do this many times, it is more efficient to\nmake an index first, and then use df.loc:yieldsor, to include multiple values from the index use df.index.isin:yieldsThe pandas equivalent to isMultiple conditions:orIn the above code it is the line df[df.foo == 222] that gives the rows based on the column value, 222 in this case.Multiple conditions are also possible:But at that point I would recommend using the query function, since it\'s less verbose and yields the same result:I find the syntax of the previous answers to be redundant and difficult to remember. Pandas introduced the query() method in v0.13 and I much prefer it. For your question, you could do df.query(\'col == val\')Reproduced from http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.17.0/indexing.html#indexing-queryYou can also access variables in the environment by prepending an @.There are a few basic ways to select rows from a pandas dataframe.For each base type, we can keep things simple by restricting ourselves to the pandas API or we can venture outside the API, usually into numpy, and speed things up.I\'ll show you examples of each and guide you as to when to use certain techniques.Setup\nThe first thing we\'ll need is to identify a condition that will act as our criterion for selecting rows.  The OP offers up column_name == some_value.  We\'ll start there and include some other common use cases.Borrowing from @unutbu:Assume our criterion is column \'A\' = \'foo\'1.\nBoolean indexing requires finding the truth value of each row\'s \'A\' column being equal to \'foo\', then using those truth values to identify which rows to keep.  Typically, we\'d name this series, an array of truth values, mask.  We\'ll do so here as well.We can then use this mask to slice or index the dataframeThis is one of the simplest ways to accomplish this task and if performance or intuitiveness isn\'t an issue, this should be your chosen method.  However, if performance is a concern, then you might want to consider an alternative way of creating the mask.2.\nPositional indexing has its use cases, but this isn\'t one of them.  In order to identify where to slice, we first need to perform the same boolean analysis we did above.  This leaves us performing one extra step to accomplish the same task.3.\nLabel indexing can be very handy, but in this case, we are again doing more work for no benefit4.\npd.DataFrame.query is a very elegant/intuitive way to perform this task.  But is often slower.  However, if you pay attention to the timings below, for large data, query is very efficient.  More so than the standard approach and of similar magnitude as my best suggestion.My preference is to use the Boolean mask Actual improvements can be made by modifying how we create our Boolean mask.mask alternative 1\nUse the underlying numpy array and forgo the overhead of creating another pd.Series I\'ll show more complete time tests at the end, but just take a look at the performance gains we get using the sample dataframe.  First we look at the difference in creating the maskEvaluating the mask with the numpy array is ~ 30 times faster.  This is partly due to numpy evaluation often being faster.  It is also partly due to the lack of overhead necessary to build an index and a corresponding pd.Series object.Next we\'ll look at the timing for slicing with one mask versus the other.The performance gains aren\'t as pronounced.  We\'ll see if this holds up over more robust testing.mask alternative 2\nWe could have reconstructed the dataframe as well.  There is a big caveat when reconstructing a dataframe\xe2\x80\x94you must take care of the dtypes when doing so!Instead of df[mask] we will do thisIf the dataframe is of mixed type, which our example is, then when we get df.values the resulting array is of dtype object and consequently, all columns of the new dataframe will be of dtype object.  Thus requiring the astype(df.dtypes) and killing any potential performance gains.However, if the dataframe is not of mixed type, this is a very useful way to do it.GivenVersusWe cut the time in half.mask alternative 3\n@unutbu also shows us how to use pd.Series.isin to account for each element of df[\'A\'] being in a set of values.  This evaluates to the same thing if our set of values is a set of one value, namely \'foo\'.  But it also generalizes to include larger sets of values if needed.  Turns out, this is still pretty fast even though it is a more general solution.  The only real loss is in intuitiveness for those not familiar with the concept.However, as before, we can utilize numpy to improve performance while sacraficing virtually anything.  We\'ll use np.in1dTiming\nI\'ll include other concepts mentioned in other posts as well for reference.\nCode Below Each Column in this table represents a different length dataframe over which we test each function. Each column shows relative time taken, with the fastest function given a base index of 1.0.You\'ll notice that fastest times seem to be shared between mask_with_values and mask_with_in1dFunctions Testing Special Timing\nLooking at the special case when we have a single non-object dtype for the entire dataframe.\nCode Below Turns out, reconstruction isn\'t worth it past a few hundred rows.Functions Testing Here is a simple example  I just tried editing this, but I wasn\'t logged in, so I\'m not sure where my edit went. I was trying to incorporate multiple selection. So I think a better answer is:For a single value, the most straightforward (human readable) is probably:For lists of values you can also use:For example,yieldsIf you have multiple criteria you want to select against, you can put them in a list and use \'isin\':yieldsNote, however, that if you wish to do this many times, it is more efficient to make A the index first, and then use df.loc:yieldsUsing numpy.where results can be achieved faster,\nusing unubtu setup:If you came here looking to select rows from a dataframe by including those whose column\'s value is NOT any of a list of values, here\'s how to flip around unutbu\'s answer for a list of values above:(To not include a single value, of course, you just use the regular not equals operator, !=.)Example:gives usTo subset to just those rows that AREN\'T one or three in column B:yieldsTo append to this famous question (though a bit too late): You can also do df.groupby(\'column_name\').get_group(\'column_desired_value\').reset_index() to make a new data frame with specified column having a particular value. E.g.Run this gives:
