I am creating a modal window using Twitter Bootstrap. The default behavior is if you click outside the modal area, the modal will automatically close. I would like to disable that -- i.e. not close the modal window when clicking outside the modal.Can someone share jQuery code to do this?I believe you want to set the backdrop value to static. If you want to avoid the window to close when using the Esc key, you have to set another value.Example:OR if you are using JavaScript:Just set the backdrop property to \'static\'.You may also want to set the keyboard property to false because that prevents the modal from being closed by pressing the Esc key on the keyboard.myModal is the ID of the div that contains your modal content.You can also include these attributes in the modal definition itself:If you already have initialized the modal window, then you may want to reset the options with $(\'#myModal\').removeData("modal").modal({backdrop: \'static\', keyboard: false}) to make sure it will apply the new options.Override the Bootstrap \xe2\x80\x98hide\xe2\x80\x99 event of Dialog and stop its default behavior (to dispose the dialog).Please see the below code snippet:It works fine in our case.Kind of like @AymKdn\'s answer, but this will allow you to change the options without re-initializing the modal.Or if you need to do multiple options, JavaScript\'s with comes in handy here!If the modal is already open, these options will only take effect the next time the modal is opened.Yes, you can do it like this:Just add these two thingsIt will look like this nowIt will disable the escape button and also the click anywhere and hide.You can disable the background\'s click-to-close behavior and make this the default for all your modals by adding this JavaScript to your page (make sure it is executed after jQuery and Bootstrap JS are loaded):As D3VELOPER says, the following code resolve it:I\'m using both jquery & bootstrap and simply removeData(\'modal\') don\'t work.The best I found is add this code to the linkIn case anyone comes here from Google trying to figure out how to prevent someone from closing a modal, don\'t forget that there\'s also a close button on the top right of the modal that needs to be removed.I used some CSS to hide it:Note that using "display: none;" gets overwritten when the modal is created, so don\'t use that.If you want to conditionally disable the backdrop click closing feature. You can use the following line to set the backdrop option to static during runtime.Bootstrap v3.xxBootstrap v2.xxThis will prevent an already instantiated model with backdrop option set to false (the default behavior), from closing.On Options chapter, on the page you linked, you can see the backdrop option. Passing this option with value \'static\' will prevent closing the modal.\nyou can also pass {keyboard: false} to prevent closing the modal by pressing Esc.  If you opening the modal by js use:  If you are using data attributes, use:    Doing that is very easy nowadays.
