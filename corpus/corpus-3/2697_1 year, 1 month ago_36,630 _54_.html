I wanted to start a simple hello world app for Angular.When I followed the instructions in the official quickstart the installation created 32,000 files in my project.I figured this is some mistake or I missed something, so I decided to use angular-cli, but after setting up the project I counted 41,000 files.Where did I go wrong? Am I missing something really really obvious?There is nothing wrong with your configuration.Angular 2 uses npm modules and dependencies for development. That\'s the sole reason you are seeing such a huge number of files.A basic setup of Angular 2 contains transpiler, typings dependencies which are essential for development purposes only.Once you are done with development, all you will need to do is to bundle this application.After bundling your application, there will be only one bundle.js file which you can then deploy on your server.\'transpiler\' is just a compiler, thanks @omninonsense for adding that.NPM Package                       Files (Development)                   Real World Files (Deployment) *: bundled with @angular [ see this for bundling process &neArr; ]There is nothing wrong with your development configuration.Something wrong with your production configuration.When you develop a "Angular 2 Project" or "Any Project Which is based on JS" you can use all files, you can try all files, you can import all files. But if you want to serve this project you need to COMBINE all structured files and get rid of useless files.There are a lot of options for combine these files together:As several people already mentioned: All files in your node_modules directory (NPM location for packages) are part of your project dependencies (So called direct dependencies). As an addition to that, your dependencies can also have their own dependencies and so on etc. (So called transitive dependencies). Several ten thousand files are nothing special.Because you are only allowed to upload 10\'000 files (See comments), I would go with a bundler engine. This engine will bundle all your JavaScript, CSS, HTML etc. and create a single bundle (or more if you specify them). Your index.html will load this bundle and that\'s it.I am a fan of webpack, so my webpack solution will create an application bundle and a vendor bundle (For the full working application see here https://github.com/swaechter/project-collection/tree/master/web-angular2-example):index.htmlwebpack.config.jsAdvantages:Disadvantages:Disclaimer: This is a good solution for Http 1.*, because it minimizes the overhead for each Http request. You only have a request for your index.html and each bundle - but not for 100 - 200 files. At the moment, this is the way to go.Http 2 on the other hand tries to minimize the Http overhead, so it\'s based on a stream protocol. This stream is able to communicate in both direction (Client <--> Server) and as a reason of that a more intelligent resource loading is possible (You only load the required files). The stream eliminates much of the Http overhead (Less Http round trips).But it\'s the same as with IPv6: It will take a few years until people will really use Http 2You need to ensure that you\'re just deploying the dist (short for distributable) folder from your project generated by the Angular CLI. This allows the tool to take your source code and it\'s dependencies and only give you what you need in order to run your application.That being said there is/was an issue with the Angular CLI in regards to production builds via `ng build --prodYesterday (August 2, 2016) a release was done which switched the build mechanism from broccoli + systemjs to webpack which successfully handles production builds.Based upon these steps:I am seeing a dist folder size of 1.1 MB across the 14 files listed here:Note Currently to install the webpack version of the angular cli, you must run... npm install angular-cli@webpack -gAngular 2 itself has lots of dependencies, and the beta version of CLI downloads four times more files. This is how to create a simple project will less files ("only" 10K files)\nhttps://yakovfain.com/2016/05/06/starting-an-angular-2-rc-1-project/Seems like nobody have mentioned Ahead-of-Time Compilation as described here: https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/aot-compiler.htmlMy experience with Angular 2 so far is that AoT creates the smallest builds with almost no loading time. And most important as the question here is about - you only need to ship a few files to production.This seems to be because the Angular compiler will not be shipped with the production builds as the templates are compiled "Ahead of Time". It\'s also very cool to see your HTML template markup transformed to javascript instructions that would be very hard to reverse engineer into the original HTML.I\'ve made a simple video where I demonstrate download size, number of files etc. for an Angular 2 app in dev vs AoT build - which you can see here:https://youtu.be/ZoZDCgQwnmQYou\'ll find the source code for the demo here:https://github.com/fintechneo/angular2-templatesAnd - as all the others said here - there\'s nothing wrong when there are many files in your development environment. That\'s how it is with all the dependencies that comes with Angular 2, and many other modern frameworks. But the difference here is that when shipping to production you should be able to pack it into a few files. Also you don\'t want all of these dependency files in your git repository.This is actually not Angular 2 specific, it happens with almost any project that uses the NodeJs / npm ecosystem for its tooling. Those project are inside your node_modules folders, and are the transititve dependencies that your direct dependencies need to run.In the node ecosystem modules are usually small, meaning that instead of developing things ourselves we tend to import most of what we need under the form of a module. This can include such small things like the famous left-pad function, why write it ourselves if not as an exercise ?So having a lot of files its actually a good thing, it means everything is very modular and module authors frequently reused other modules. This ease of modularity is probably one of the main reasons why the node ecosystem grew so fast.In principle this should not cause any issue, but it seems you run into a google app engine file count limit. In that I case I suggest to not upload node_modules to app engine.instead build the application locally and upload to google app engine only the bundled filesn but don\'t to the build in app engine itself.If you are usin angular cli newer version use ng build --prod\nI will create dist folder which have less files and spped of project will increasedAlso for testing in local with best performance of angular cli you can use ng serve --prodyou will see huge files/folder in node_modules.which are all packages which imports in modules,services,components.For production just use ng build --prod it will generate folder dist contains bundled css,js files and html.Use that for production.Its less than MB.There is nothing wrong. These are all the node dependencies that you have mentioned in the package.json.Just be careful if you have download some of the git hub project, it might have lot of other dependencies that are not actually require for angular 2 first hello world app :)
