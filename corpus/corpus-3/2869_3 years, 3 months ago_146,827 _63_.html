This crash has been a blocking issue, basically I used following steps to reproduce the issue:The app immediate crashed upon launching, here is console log:I have tried to build on iOS 7.1 and 8.0 devices, they both have the same crash. However I can build app and run on simulator fine. Also I am aware that I can change the framework to from Required to Optional in Link Binary With Libraries, but it did not completely resolve the problem, the app crashed when I create an instance of Dog. The behavior is different on device and simulator, I suspect that we can\'t distribute framework for device using beta version of Xcode. Can anyone shed light on this?In the target\'s General tab, there is an Embedded Binaries field. When you add the framework there the crash is resolved.Reference is here on Apple Developer Forums.Under the target\'s General tab, in the Embedded Binaries section add the framework. This will copy the framework into the compiled so that it can be linked to at runtime.Why is this happening? : because the framework you are linking to is compiled as a dynamically linked framework and thus is linked to at runtime. Note : Embedding custom frameworks is only supported in iOS > 8 and thus and alternative solution that works on older versions of iOS follows. If you have influence on this framework (have access to the source code / build process) you may change this framework to be statically linked rather than dynamically linked. This will cause the code to be include in your compiled app rather than linked to at runtime and thus the framework will not have to be embedded.How : Under the framework\'s Build Setting tab, in the Linking section change the Mach-O Type to Static Library. You should now not need to include the framework under embedded binaries. Including Assets : To include things such as images, audio, or xib/nib files I recommend creating a bundle (essentially a directory, more info here bit.ly/ios_bundle) and then load the assets from the bundle using NSBundle. Firstly Try to build after Command+Option+Shift+K .If still fails then do below steps.If anybody is facing this error in Xcode 8 then change your framework status to Optional instead of Required under the General Tab of your target.I created a framework using Swift3/Xcode 8.1 and was consuming it in an Objective-C/Xcode 8.1 project. To fix this issue i had to enable Always Embed Swift Standard Libraries option under Build Options.Have a look at this screenshot:Hope that helps!I received this same error while attempting to manually add my created framework into my project. Just dragging the framework into your project isn\'t going to be good enough. That is like being in the same ballpark but not being able to find your kids. It took me some trial and error to get it to work properly but following these steps did it for me.1) Create your framework2) Access your framework3) Place framework in your project4) Configure app project for framework5) Clean, then run your projectI had to (on top of what mentioned here) add the following line to Runpath Search Paths under Build Settings tab:\n@executable_path/FrameworksYou need to add the framework to a new Copy Files Build Phase to ensure that the framework is copied into the application bundle at runtime..See How to add a 'Copy Files build phase' to my Target for more information.Official Apple Docs: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/recipes/xcode_help-project_editor/Articles/CreatingaCopyFilesBuildPhase.htmlI got same kind of issue in iOS 9.x versionI have resolved this issue by changing Required to Optional in Linked Frameworks and Libraries for UserNotifications.framework framework.My environment: Cocos2d 2.0, Box2d, Objective CIn addition to doing the other answers above I finally went to the General tab and made WatchKit Optional.If you are using a third-party framework, and using Cocoapods as your dependency manager, try doing a pod install to refresh your pods.This crash was occurring on a third-party library I was using, so glad the above solution worked for me, hope it works for you!In my case the solution was to remove the compiled framework from the Embedded Binaries, which was a standalone project in the workspace, clean and rebuild it, and finally re-add to Embedded Binaries.I had the same issue. I tried building my project with an iPhone that I never used before and I didn\'t add a new framework. For me, cleaning up worked fine (Shift+Command+K). Maybe it\'s because I use beta 5 of Xcode 7 and an iPhone 6 with iOS 9 Beta, but it worked.Surprisingly, not all of the necessary pieces are documented here, at least for Xcode 8.My case was a custom-built framework as part of the same workspace. It turns out it was being built incorrectly. Based on jeremyhu\'s last response to this thread:https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/4687I had to set Dynamic Library Install Name Base (DYLIB_INSTALL_NAME_BASE) under Build Settings of the Framework and then rebuild it. It was incorrectly set to $(LOCAL_LIBRARY_DIR) and I had to change it to @rpath.So in the link processing stage, it was instructing the host App to dynamically  load it at runtime from /Library/Frameworks/fw.Framework/fw (as in, the root of the filesystem) rather than path-to-App/Frameworks/fw.Framework/fwRegarding all the other settings: it does have to be in 3 places in Build Phases, but these are all set at once when you just add it to the Embedded Binaries setting of the General tab of the hosting App.I did not have to set up an extra Copy Files phase, which seems intuitively redundant with respect to the embedding stage anyway.  By checking the tail end of the build transcript we can assure that that\'s not necessary.[Many verbose lines removed, but it\'s clear from the simplified transcript in the Xcode UI.]I still have no idea why Xcode set the DYLIB_INSTALL_NAME_BASE value incorrectly on me.In case anyone is still experiencing this issue, despite following all the steps outlined in the many other answers, you may need to revoke and recreate your code signing certificate, as per the following:https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1886/_index.htmlFor those who the fix didn\'t work, try updating the OS to Yosemite. It worked for me!
