I keep seeing "bootstrapping" mentioned in discussions of application development.  It seems both widespread and important, but I\'ve yet to come across even a poor explanation of what bootstrapping actually is; rather, it seems as though everyone is just supposed to know what it means.  I don\'t, though.  Near as I can figure, it has something to do with initialization tasks required of an application upon launch, but I could be completely wrong about that.  Can anyone help me to understand this idea?"Bootstrapping" comes from the term "pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps." That much you can get from Wikipedia.In computing, a bootstrap loader is the first piece of code that runs when a machine starts, and is responsible for loading the rest of the operating system. In modern computers it\'s stored in ROM, but I recall the bootstrap process on the PDP-11, where you would poke bits via the front-panel switches to load a particular disk segment into memory, and then run it. Needless to say, the bootstrap loader is normally pretty small."Bootstrapping" is also used as a term for building a system using itself -- or more correctly, a predecessor version. For example, ANTLR version 3 is written using a parser developed in ANTLR version 2.An example of bootstrapping is in some web frameworks. You call index.php (the bootstrapper), and then it loads the frameworks helpers, models, configuration, and then loads the controller and passes off control to it.As you can see, it\'s a simple file that starts a large process.See on the Wikipedia article on bootstrapping.There is a section and links explaining what it means in Computing. It has four different uses in the field.Here are some quotes, but for a more in depth explanation, and alternative meanings, consult the links above."...is a technique by which a simple computer program activates a more complicated system of programs.""A different use of the term bootstrapping is to use a compiler to compile itself, by first writing a small part of a compiler of a new programming language in an existing language to compile more programs of the new compiler written in the new language."In the context of application development, "bootstrapping" usually comes up when talking about modular and/or auto-updatable software. Rather than the user downloading the entire app, including features he does not need, and re-downloading and manually updating it whenever there is an update, the user only downloads and starts a small "bootstrap" executable, which in turn downloads and installs those parts of the application that the user needs. Additionally, the bootstrap component is able to look for updates and install them each time it is started.For completeness, it is also a rather important (and relatively new) method in statistics that uses resampling / simulation to infer population properties from a sample. It has its own lengthy Wikipedia article on bootstrapping (statistics).Alex, it\'s pretty much what your computer does when it boots up. (\'Booting\' a computer actually comes from the word bootstrapping)Initially, the small program in your BIOS runs. That contains enough machine code to load and run a larger, more complex program.That second program is probably something like NTLDR (in Windows) or LILO (in Linux), which then executes and is able to load, then run, the rest of the operating system.Forget links: here\'s the wikipedia section :DComputing Main article: BootingThe computer term bootstrap began as a\n  metaphor in the 1950s. In computers,\n  pressing a bootstrap button caused a\n  hardwired program to read a bootstrap\n  program from an input unit and then\n  execute the bootstrap program which\n  read more program instructions and\n  became a self-sustaining process that\n  proceeded without external help from\n  manually entered instructions. As a\n  computing term, bootstrap has been\n  used since at least 1958.[5]The bootstrap concept was used in the\n  IBM 701 computer (1952-1956) which had\n  a "load button" which initiated\n  reading of the first 36-bit word from\n  a punched card in a card reader, or\n  from a magnetic tape unit, or drum\n  unit (predecessor of the hard disk\n  drive). The left 18-bit half-word was\n  then executed as an instruction which\n  read additional words into memory.[6]In terms of it in regards to using the popular Twitter Bootstrap I feel like this type of bootstrapping is the action of integrating a modular component into a Web application without the Web application having to even acknowledge the modular component exists until it needs it or references it. The developer can seamlessly integrate a default copy of the CSS Twitter Bootstrap theme by simply loading (referencing) it into the Web application. Vuola! Then you may need to override some of these changes, but you can do so in such a way that the resource/component is untouched and completely reusable. This same concept is how Web Devs implement jQuery APIs and so on, but it\'s not really expressed by Devs as bootstrapping per se. What it does is it improves flexibility and reusability while allowing the isolation of different components/resources of an app to reside freely either on the same server/s or possibly on a CDN.NOTE: In computing bootstrapping deals with the MBR and in UNIX it requires a special bootloader or manager which is a small program in ROM that loads the OS into RAM. If you think about it the same concept takes places in the action of the bootstrap loader checking the MBR and loading the OS based on this table which occurs without the OS having any idea that this takes place. Boot strapping the dictionary meaning is to start up with minimum resources.    In the Context of an OS the OS should be able to swiftly load once the Power On   Self Test (POST)  determines that its safe to wake up the CPU. The boot strap  code  will be run from the BIOS. BIOS is a small sized ROM. Generally it is a   jump instruction to the set of instructions  which will load the Operating   system to the RAM. The destination of the Jump is the Boot sector in the Hard Disk. Once the bios  program checks it is a valid Boot sector which contains  the starting address of the stored OS, ie whether it is a valid MBR  (Master Boot Record) or not. If its a valid MBR the OS will be copied to the   memory (RAM)from there on the OS takes care of Memory and Process management.  IMHO there is not a better explanation than the fact about How was the first compiler written?These days the Operating System loading is the most common process referred as Bootstrapping
