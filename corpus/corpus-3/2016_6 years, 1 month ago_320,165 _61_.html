I have a solution with multiple projects in it. Most of the third party references are missing, yet there are packages.config file for each project.  How do I get NuGet to install/update all the packages needed? Does this need to be done via command line for each project?You can use nuget.exe to restore your packages or with NuGet 2.7, or above, installed you can simply compile your solution in Visual Studio, which will also restore the missing packages.For NuGet.exe you can run the following command for each project.Or with NuGet 2.7 you can restore all packages in the solution using the command line.Both of these will pull down the packages. Your project files will not be modified however when running this command so the project should already have a reference to the NuGet packages. If this is not the case then you can use Visual Studio to install the packages.With NuGet 2.7, and above, Visual Studio will automatically restore missing NuGet packages when you build your solution so there is no need to use NuGet.exe.To update all the packages in your solution, first restore them, and then you can either use NuGet.exe to update the packages or from within Visual Studio you can update the packages from the Package Manager Console window, or finally you can use the Manage Packages dialog.From the command line you can update packages in the solution to the latest version available from nuget.org.Note that this will not run any PowerShell scripts in any NuGet packages.From within Visual Studio you can use the Package Manager Console to also update the packages. This has the benefit that any PowerShell scripts will be run as part of the update where as using NuGet.exe will not run them. The following command will update all packages in every project to the latest version available from nuget.org.You can also restrict this down to one project.If you want to reinstall the packages to the same versions as were previously installed then you can use the -reinstall argument with Update-Package command.You can also restrict this down to one project.The -reinstall option will first uninstall and then install the package back again into a project.Or, you can update the packages using the Manage Packages dialog.Updates:Reinstall all packages in ALL PROJECTS of the current solution:Reinstall all packages in SPECIFIC PROJECT of the current solution (Thanks to unarity and  ashes999):There is another, newer and quicker way to do this from within Visual Studio.  Check out  this post by David Ebbo, and reference the comments section if you run into trouble.  Basically, you do the following in Package Manager prompt:Afterwards, when you build your solution the packages will be automatically installed if they\'re missing.Update:This functionality is built into Nuget 1.6 with visual studio integration so you don\'t even need to install NuGetPowerTools or type commands.  All you have to do is Right click on the Solution node in Solution Explorer and select\n  Enable NuGet Package Restore.Read this article for more details.Here\'s another solution if you are using website projects, or don\'t want to enable NuGet Package restore.You can use the package manager console to enumerate all the packages in the package.config file and re-install them.This is best and easiest example I found. It will reinstall all nugets that are listed in packages.config and it will preserve current versions. Replace YourProjectNameGoesHere with the project name.With the latest NuGet 2.5 release there is now an "Update All" button in the packages manager: http://docs.nuget.org/docs/release-notes/nuget-2.5#Update_All_button_to_allow_updating_all_packages_at_onceI\'m using visual studio 2015 and the solutions given above didn\'t work for me, so i did the following:Delete the packages folder from my solution and also bin and obj folders from every project in the solution and give it a rebuild.Maybe you will have the next error: unable to locate nuget.exeTo solve this: Change this line in your NuGet.targets file and setting it to true:Reference:https://stackoverflow.com/a/30918648 and https://stackoverflow.com/a/20502049I believe the first thing you need to do is enable the package restore feature.  See also here.  This is done at the solution (not project) level.But that won\'t get you all the way -- I ran into a similar issue after having enabled the restore feature.  (VS2013, NuGet 2.8.)It turned out I had (unintentionally) committed the packages to source control when I committed the project -- but Visual Studio (and the source control plugin) had helpfully ignored the binaries when performing the check-in.The problem arose when I created a release branch.  My local copy of the dev/main/trunk branch had the binaries, because that\'s where I had originally installed/downloaded the packages.\nHowever, in the new release branch,I deleted all the package folders in $(SolutionDir)/packages (under the release branch) and then ran a full rebuild, and this time the build succeeded.\n... and then of course I went back and removed the package folders from source control (in the trunk and release branch).  I\'m not clear (yet) on whether the repositories.config file should be removed as well.Many of the components installed for you by the project templates -- at least for web projects -- are NuGet packages. That is, this issue is not limited to packages you\'ve added.\nSo enable package restore immediately after creating the project/solution, and before you perform an initial check-in, clear the packages folder (and make sure you commit the .nuget folder to source control).Disclaimer: I saw another answer here on SO which indicated that clearing the packages folder was part of the resolution.  That put me on the right track, so I\'d like to give the author credit, but I can no longer locate that question/answer.  I\'ll post an edit if I stumble across  it.I\'d also note that Update-Package -reinstall will modify the .sln and  .csproj/.vbproj files.  At least that\'s what it did in my case.  Which IMHO makes this option much less attractive.If you Nuget 2.8 install, check the checkboxin Visual Studio. If it is checked, then simply rebuild the project will restore all your reference libraries.now Nuget Package Manager Console in Visual Studio 2012 gives you a "Restore" button automatically as soon it find any package not installed but in there in package.config.\nAwesome Feature!At VS2012 V11, if I use "-Reinstall" at the end of the line it doesn\'t work.So I simply used:I know this is an old post, but thought this could be useful.  If you have a need to ignore specific packages during the update process (like any packages that update JavaScript references), use the following PowerShell script (make sure your package source is set to "All" in Package Manager Console):EDIT 2014-09-25 10:55 AM EST - Fixed a bug in the scriptFor those arriving here due to the build server falling foul of this, you can create an MSBuild target running the exec command to run the nuget restore command, as below (in this case nuget.exe is in the .nuget folder, rather than on the path), which can then be run in a TeamCity build step immediately prior to building the solutionAfter 3 hours of searching and investigation. I had problems with it because we have two members in team (using GitHub source control), because we didn\'t restrict files for packages for sending to remote repository, one of team members was send packages to server and i have pull that changes to my local. After that i had same problem as PO, also i wasn\'t be able to publish my API project to server.At the and I have just used Update-Package -Reinstall - run this command on Package Manager Console This command will reinstall all your packages that you have used in your solution. (For every project)Reinstall all packages in ALL PROJECTS of the current solution:Update-Package -ProjectName \'NameOfProject\' -Reinstall - run this command on Package Manager ConsoleThis command will reinstall all your packages that are in relation with project that you specified after "-ProjectName". And i think that this is better because i had wait for half a hour to reinstall all packages in solution. For this many thanks to Rodolpho Brock. Also, I would recommend you that when you pull changes from remote server, to press "Restore packages" button that will be shown by Visual studio.
