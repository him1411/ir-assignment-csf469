I can make Firefox not display the ugly dotted focus outlines on links with this:But how can I do this for <button> tags as well? When I do this:the buttons still have the dotted focus outline when I click on them.(and yes, I know this is a usability issue, but I would like to provide my own focus hints which are appropriate to the design instead of ugly grey dots)No need to define a selector.If you prefer to use CSS to get rid of the dotted outline:The below worked for me in case of LINKS, thought of sharing - in case someone is interested. Cheers![Update] This solution doesn\'t work anymore. The solution that worked for me is this one https://stackoverflow.com/a/3844452/925560The answer marked as correct didn\'t work with Firefox 24.0.To remove Firefox\'s dotted outline on buttons and anchor tags I added the code below:I found the solution here: http://aghoshb.com/articles/css-how-to-remove-firefoxs-dotted-outline-on-buttons-and-anchor-tags.htmlThere\'s no way to remove these dotted focus in Firefox using CSS.If you have access to the computers where your webapplication works, go to about:config in Firefox and set browser.display.focus_ring_width to 0. Then Firefox won\'t show any dotted borders at all.The following bug explains the topic: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=74225Tried most of the answers here, but none of them worked for me.

Use the ::-moz-focus-inner pseudo class.If you have a border on a button and want to hide the dotted outline in Firefox without removing the border (and hence it\'s extra width on the button) you can use:The CSS code below works to remove this:This works on firefox v-27.0Simply add this css for select box This is working fine for me.You can try button::-moz-focus-inner {border: 0px solid transparent;} in your CSS.After trying many options from the above only the following worked for me.Along with Bootstrap 3 I used this code.
