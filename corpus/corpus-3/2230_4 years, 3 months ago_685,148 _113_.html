In every instance in all of my classes where I reference R.id.something, the R is in red and it says "cannot resolve symbol R".  Also every time there is R.layout.something it is underlined in red and says "cannot resolve method setContentView(?)". The project always builds fine. It is annoying to see this all the time. I have read many other questions on here about something similar but most involved importing projects from eclipse. I am using what I believe to be the most recent version of android studio and the project was created with android studio and worked without any cannot resolve R problems. I would like to know what causes this if anyone knows.UPDATE:\nSolution: At the time android studio was brand new and I was also a brand new developer. I should never had been using android studio, I never realized how unfinished it was. Thanks everyone for the support in trying to help since this has been posted. Ironically the actual answer to this question has been deleted and cannot be undeleted. I feel that my original answer is the solution to this problem.My original answer that was deleted:I think I have figured out the issue. The issue is with Android\n  Studio, every time I added the admob library all these errors started.\n  All my other projects without ads don\'t have similar issues. I\'m now\n  using Intelij and staying away from Android StudioI had this this issue too. A simple \'gradlew clean\' and \'gradlew build\' did the trick.Click on Build->Clean Project and that will perform a gradle cleanIn the latest versions of Android Studio, at least for me, the following works:"Tools" -> "Android" -> "Sync Project with Gradle Files"I have similar problem and here is what I did:clean project and Sync Project with Gradle , check buildTools version in my sdk\nFrom build gradle (module ) change minSdkVersion from 8 to 9 But all this didn\'t help.Finally I found the answer (this worked in my case)Change from build.gradle(module:app) Or select File | Project Structure change Build Tools Version to 21.1.1This is it.For example I had an entry in my strings.xml:And in activity_main.xml I used this string entryWhile\'d been working with project, I deleted thatAnd consequently activity_main.xml became not valid. As the result: cannot resolve R.So, check your *.xml files and clean project.There seems to be many causes for this issue. Recently, I added an activity to test with called NewActivity. This created a file called res/menu/new.xml and gradle did not like that name because new is a reserved word.gradlew cleanor "Tools" -> "Android" -> "Sync Project with Gradle Files"Those are definitely good things to try, but you may have some other issues you need to resolve before you run those commands.If you see this error after moving java files or directories to other locations, then you can guarantee that Android Studio has gotten confused.  And guess what? undo-ing those actions doesn\'t fix the problem.So you try a clean, but that doesn\'t work.And restarting doesn\'t work either.But try File -> Invalidate Caches / Restart... -> Invalidate and Restart.Android Studio maintains information about which files are dependent on which other files.  And since moving files around is not implemented correctly, moving files causes errors.  And that\'s not all: caches of these dependencies are used in an attempt to speed up the build.This means you not only have to restart, but you need to invalidate those caches to restore (or more accurately, rebuild) sanity.I think if you put your Activities files to another folder than the default one. You need to import the com.example.yourproject.R (this is your project R file NOT Android.R file) to ALL activities using R. For example, in MainActivity file insert this line:import com.example.yourproject.R; Just clean your project and Sync Project with Gradle File.And the problem will be resolved.I recently had this issue and the clean/build etc. didn\'t resolve it. I guessed I had an issue somewhere but wasn\'t sure where to look to find it (was it in the manifest, resource xml files etc?).When something is wrong, you can find out what it is by doing a code analysis run.From the menu at the top choose:Analyze -> Inspect code, scan the whole project using the \'Default\' profile.Your inspection results will contain an element called \'Android\'. In here you will get a list of anything that is causing issues in your resources and manifest file. The errors will open up the generated xml files from your build which will show any errors in red.My exact issue was caused because I was using flavour based manifest files and I copied some permissions inside the <application> tag in the flavour by accident.UPDATE: I did have an issue after where Android Studio still showed the error after the fix, even though I could now build and run perfectly fine while the error was still there. (I am running a canary build so putting it down to that for now)Just go to Android Top menu list. click on Build Menu, in under Build click on Rebuild Project.Do: Build > Clean ProjectIMPORTANT: Make sure you don\'t have any Errors after Clean Project in Message Pane (Alt+0). If you find any red circles with exclamation mark, than you must remove those errors in your code. Mostly these errors are related to @string/ or @array/. Clean Project again and done! Have you updated your SDK tools recently? Launch the android SDK manager and make sure you have the latest SDK tools, which is now separate from the platform tools. I had this same issue when I first updated my SDK manager, the SDK build tools package did not show up for install/update until I closed and reopened the SDK manager.Build > Clean ProjectThis worked for me. Had the same problem a few times, and this seems to set it right. Unless you have changed something or called a variable R. This issue usually happens out of nowhere, when it happens to me, so I imagine its just Android studios freaking out. hahaHave a good one, and good luck with your projects.This is a very old question, but it still happens a lot and there is no truly comprehensive answer here. I have had this problem more times than I want to admit. It can be caused by a wide variety of issues that mostly all have to do with your project structure not matching what\'s expected. Here\'s a list of all the problems I\'ve had:Importing from Eclipse to Android Studio does not always work smoothly, especially with older versions of Android Studio. Make sure you\'re using the correct directory tree. It should look like this for a moderately mature app:It may not look like this in your IDE. There is a drop-down above the file tree that displays your files in different ways, and it defaults on my system to one called Android that breaks your files out into their different types. It\'s easier to fix this kind of problem from the one called Project, and even easier directly from your OS\'s file system, because Android Studio collapses folders that only contain another folder onto a single line.Especially if you ever change the name of your app, you need to make sure that the source tree main/java/com/domain/AppName is updated. Also make sure that the package tag in your AndroidManifest.xml is correct.If there are errors in either your Gradle files or your AndroidManifest.xml, this will prevent Android Studio from properly building your resource files. Gradle files can be broken by upgrading Android Studio sometimes, especially from the pre-1.0 versions. Sometimes this is because it stops supporting older versions of the Gradle plugin, so you need to update your version numbers. It can sometimes be hard to find what the current versions are. As of today, 7/17/15, my apps are compiling fine with com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.2.3. This is in the dependencies block in the outermost gradle file, If your AndroidManifest references a non-existent drawable or string resource or activity, it will break and cause this error. Sometimes if anything references a nonexistent drawable or string resource you will get this error.If you have a file in your resources that is corrupted, or an invalid xml file, you will get this error.In my experience, sometimes Android Studio just hiccups for no reason, and you need to restart it and/or your PC. I don\'t know why, but sometimes it works.If you have two xml resources with the same name, in directories that do not override each other, you can have this problem. For instance, you can have the same name in drawable-mhdpi and drawable-xhdpi because they override each other depending on the target device, but if you have the same name in layout and in menu, it will cause a problem. Rename or delete one of the files.If only some resources are having this problem, those resources are most likely in the wrong directory.In one case I had to completely reinstall Android Studio. I don\'t know what was wrong, but it worked.In one case I moved my entire project to a different directory and re-imported it as a new project. I don\'t know what was wrong, but it worked.Xml files with reserved words for names can cause this problem. Rename or delete them.There are a few ways your Gradle file can end up referencing a version of the build-tools that you do not have installed. Correct this by changing Gradle or downloading the appropriate build-tools.Finally, after you\'ve fixed whatever is wrong, you need to clean your Gradle project. You do this by going to the Build menu at the top and selecting Clean Project.This notation seems to work fine. Android Studio\'s design panel doesn\'t seem to work well.I have had this withSame problem. Started when I added a few images in my drawable folder and tried to access them. Also the images added were having the extension with capital letters. That seems to have crashed the build, since even if I renamed them, the message was the same and R was inaccessible. What I did is, in the .iml file I looked for the excludeFolder and removed them (like bellow):After that I rebuilt the project and R magically re-appeared.Brother, R.java file contains the link between xml and java page. "R cannot be resolved" arise only if there is a problem with some of your resource files. So the best and effective way is delete the last done xml or drawable in res file. and then again start from there according to android coding norms. This is the only way. The effective and right way. Also use Git for proper tracking of code. .. Happy coding..:)I had to import my R package in android studio. For ex: import com.example.<package name>.RI have the same problem, and it happens when I create a new proyect. What I do is check for SDK updates and then android studio updates, then reopen the proyect, open the andoridmanifest.xml erase a space between a "_>" in the android:label and save. Well that works for me :) i hope it works for you.This was a big headache for me. In my case the error appeared after configuring "Google Play Services" in Android Studio (installing + build.gradle config). This in turn requires minsdk > 7 but the error is very unclear about it (actually a complaint about this only appears as "info"). Anyhow.. upon changing minsdk to 8 both in the manifest file and the build.gradle file and rebuilding the project, the error was gone.So.. a general advice about this, if I may generalize - you probably have some problem in your manifest file, or some other configuration file, that is preventing a proper build. Try looking really hard at the error report, even the messages titled "info" for any hint about what it might be...change the latest sdk version,that was work for me1.Click file and then click project structure\n2.then select "app"\nthen click ok,its worked for me.\nApparently in my case the problem was resolved by adding an "*" at the end There are many causes for this error.Best way to track the error is Rebuild it rather clean or sync doing some intentional error.If it doesn\'t solve your problem then there must have to be some flaw or runtime error or error occurred due to improper use of resources in may be both java or xml file in your code or design which is forcing gradle to stop because (R)esource file can\'t index your resources properly and you have to admit that.If your project ran before you made the changes then comment out the changes you have made and try to rebuild the project.It will surely work since there will be no changes.To track down the exact error, check the changes by breaking the changes into smaller module.For example - If you are making a list visible with a button click and inserting list values in the adapter, first check if you are able to make it visible or not then check for adapter errors.I had the same problem and most times it is resolved by But this time the error persisted even after doing all these things and at last i found the culprit.The problem was in an xml file, where i have given ordinary string value for an android:id instead of an id resource type.MISTAKECORRECTIONMessing up things related to resources in xml files is a major\n  reason for this error.Beware of the fact that it may not be shown as an error in the xml layout file.NOTE In most cases the compiler shows you the source of error in the Message.\nTry to check it first before attempting other solutionsI faced this issue when I manually renamed the domain folder of my app. To fix this issue, I had to File Menu -> Invalidate Caches / Restart ...The issue will be gone, once the Android studio restarts and builds the fresh index.On OS X with Android Studio 0.2.13, I did "Jump to Declaration" on the com.< project >.R import in one of my activities. When I went back to the activity file all the warnings were gone.Edit: You need to build the current build variant before this will work.None of the above answers helped me.  I finally realized that the issue was that the "build" folder was missing from Android Studio.  I found a number of lines in the projects "iml" file excluding "build/*".  After removing those, the build file appeared and the errors disappeared.Make sure you have AndroidManifest.xml in the project. It happened to me that I imported a project that didn\'t have the manifest yet so Android Studio wouldn\'t recognize it as an Android project. Then I pulled the project in GIT and it downloaded the manifest but still not working. \nThen I restarted Android Studio and it said something like "Framework detected android".So make sure your project is configured as an Android project.In my case, after having the same error (Cannot resolve symbol R) with android studio version 0.8.9, what I did was go to File->Project structure and changed the JDK location to oracle JDK which I manually installed. So in my case in linux instead of /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle which was the preset one. I changed it to /home/phvz/App/jdk1.8.0_20 saved the settings and the R symbol issue was fixed immediately
