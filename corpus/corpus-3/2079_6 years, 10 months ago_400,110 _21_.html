I would like to know what selectors are available for these data attributes that come with HTML5.Taking this piece of HTML as an example:Are there selectors to get:Look in to jQuery Selectors :contains is a selectorhere is info on the :contains selectorjQuery UI has a :data() selector which can also be used. It has been around since Version 1.7.0 it seems.You can use it like this:Get all elements with a data-company attributeGet all elements where data-company equals MicrosoftGet all elements where data-company does not equal Microsoftetc...One caveat of the new :data() selector is that you must set the data value by code for it to be selected. This means that for the above to work, defining the data in HTML is not enough. You must first do this:This is fine for single page applications where you are likely to use $(...).data("datakey", "value") in this or similar ways.jsFiddle DemojQuery provides several selectors (full list) in order to make the queries you are looking for work. To address your question "In other cases is it possible to use other selectors like "contains, less than, greater than, etc..."." you can also use contains, starts with, and ends with to look at these html5 data attributes. See the full list above in order to see all of your options.The basic querying has been covered above, and using John Hartsock\'s answer is going to be the best bet to either get every data-company element, or to get every one except Microsoft (or any other version of :not).In order to expand this to the other points you are looking for, we can use several meta selectors. First, if you are going to do multiple queries, it is nice to cache the parent selection.Next, we can look for companies in this set who start with GOr perhaps companies which contain the word softIt is also possible to get elements whose data attribute\'s ending matches
