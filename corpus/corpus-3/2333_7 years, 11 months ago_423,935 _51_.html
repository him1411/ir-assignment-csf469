I have a command line program in Python that takes a while to finish. I want to know the exact time it takes to finish running.I\'ve looked at the timeit module, but it seems it\'s only for small snippets of code. I want to time the whole program.The simplest way in Python:This assumes that your program takes at least a tenth of second to run.Prints:I put this timing.py module into my own site-packages directory, and just insert import timing at the top of my module:I can also call timing.log from within my program if there are significant stages within the program I want to show.  But just including import timing will print the start and end times, and overall elapsed time.  (Forgive my obscure secondsToStr function, it just formats a floating point number of seconds to hh:mm:ss.sss form.)Note: A Python 3 version of the above code can be found here or here.In Linux or UNIX:In Windows, see this Stackoverflow discussion: How to measure execution time of command in windows command line?time.clock() returns the processor time, which allows us to calculate only the time used by this process (on Unix anyway). The documentation says "in any case, this is the function to use for benchmarking Python or timing algorithms"You can use the python profiler cProfile to measure CPU time and additionally how much time is spent inside each function and how many times each function is called. This is very useful if you want to improve performance of your script without knowing where to start. This answer to another SO question is pretty good. It\'s always good to have a look in the docs too.Here\'s an example how to profile a script using cProfile from a command line:I really like Paul McGuire\'s answer, but I use Python3. So for those who are interested: here\'s a modification of his answer that works with Python 3 on *nix (I imagine, under Windows, that clock() should be used instead of time()):If you find this useful, you should still up-vote his answer instead of this one, as he did most of the work ;).I like the output the datetime module provides, where time delta objects show days, hours, minutes etc. as necessary in a human-readable way.For example:Sample output e.g.orUpdate: As J.F. Sebastian mentioned, this approach might encounter some tricky cases with local time, so it\'s safer to use:Even better for Linux: /usr/bin/timeNormally, just time is a simpler shell builtin that shadows the more capable /usr/bin/time.The solution of rogeriopvl works fine, but if you want more specific info you can use the python built-in profiler. Check this page:http://docs.python.org/library/profile.htmla profiler tells you a lot of useful information like the time spent in every functionI\'ve looked at the timeit module, but it seems it\'s only for small snippets of code. I want to time the whole program.It runs your_module.main() function one time and print the elapsed time using time.time() function as a timer.To emulate /usr/bin/time in Python see Python subprocess with /usr/bin/time: how to capture timing info but ignore all other output?.To measure CPU time (e.g., don\'t include time during time.sleep()) for each function, you could use profile module (cProfile on Python 2):You could pass -p to timeit command above if you want to use the same timer as profile module uses.See How can you profile a Python script?Ipython "timeit" any script: time.clock()Deprecated since version 3.3: The behavior of this function depends\n  on the platform: use perf_counter() or process_time() instead,\n  depending on your requirements, to have a well-defined behavior.time.perf_counter()Return the value (in fractional seconds) of a performance counter,\n  i.e. a clock with the highest available resolution to measure a short\n  duration. It does include time elapsed during sleep and is\n  system-wide.time.process_time()Return the value (in fractional seconds) of the sum of the system and\n  user CPU time of the current process. It does not include time elapsed\n  during sleep.The following snippet prints elapsed time in a nice human readable <HH:MM:SS> format.I like Paul McGuire\'s answer too and came up with a context manager form which suited more my needs.There is a timeit module which can be used to time the execution times of python codes.\nIt has detailed documentation and examples in python docs (https://docs.python.org/2/library/timeit.html)This is Paul McGuire\'s answer that works for me. Just in case someone was having trouble running that one. call timing.main() from your program after importing the file.To use metakermit\'s updated answer for python 2.7 you will require the monotonic package.The code would then be as follows:The time of a Python program\'s execution measure could be inconsistent depending on:This is because the most effective way is using the "Order of Growth" and learn the Big "O" notation to do it properly, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notationAnyway you can try to evaluate the performance of any Python program in specific machine counting steps per second using this simple algorithm:\nadapt this to the program you want to evaluateHope this help you.Just Use timeit module. It works with both Python 2 And Python 3It returns in Seconds and you can have your Execution Time. Simple but you should write these in Main Function which starts program execution. If you want to get the Execution time even when you get error then take your parameter "Start" to it and calculate there like
