What is the difference between a View\'s Margin and Padding?To help me remember the meaning of padding, I think of a big coat with lots of thick cotton padding. I\'m inside my coat, but me and my padded coat are together. We\'re a unit.But to remember margin, I think of, "Hey, give me some margin!" It\'s the empty space between me and you. Don\'t come inside my comfort zone -- my margin.To make it more clear, here is a picture of padding and margin in a TextView:Padding is the space inside the border, between the border and the actual view\'s content. Note that padding goes completely around the content: there is padding on the top, bottom, right and left sides (which can be independent).Margins are the spaces outside the border, between the border and the other elements next to this view. In the image, the margin is the grey area outside the entire object. Note that, like the padding, the margin goes completely around the content: there are margins on the top, bottom, right, and left sides.An image says more than 1000 words (extracted from Margin Vs Padding - CSS Properties):Padding is inside of a View.Margin is outside of a View.This difference may be relevant to background or size properties.Padding is within the view, margin is outside. Padding is available for all views. Depending on the view, there may or may not be a visual difference between padding and margin.For buttons, for example, the characteristic button background image includes the padding, but not the margin. In other words, adding more padding makes the button look visually bigger, while adding more margin just makes the gap between the button and the next control wider.For TextViews, on the other hand, the visual effect of padding and margin is identical.Whether or not margin is available is determined by the container of the view, not by the view itself. In LinearLayout margin is supported, in AbsoluteLayout (considered obsolete now) - no. Below image will let you understand the padding and margin-Padding is the space inside the border between the border and the actual image or cell contents.\nMargins are the spaces outside the border, between the border and the other elements next to this object. Sometimes you can achieve the same result by playing only with padding OR margin. Example : Say View X contains view Y (aka : View Y is inside View X).-View Y with Margin=30 OR View X with Padding=30 will achieve the same result: View Y will have an offset of 30.Padding\n Padding is inside of a View.For example if you give android:paddingLeft=20dp, then the items inside the view will arrange with 20dp width from left.You can also use paddingRight, paddingBottom, paddingTop which are to give padding from right, bottom and top respectively.Margin\nMargin is outside of a View. For example if you give android:marginLeft=20dp , then the view will be arranged after 20dp from left.Lets just suppose you have a button in a view and the size of view is 200 by 200, and the size of button is 50 by 50, and the button title is HT, now the difference between margin and padding is, you can set the margin of button in view, for example 20 from left 20 from top, and padding will adjust the text position in button or textview etc. for example, padding value is 20 from left. so it will adjust the position of text.Margin refers to the extra space outside of an element. Padding refers to the extra space within an element. The margin is the extra space around the control. The padding is extra space inside the control.It\'s hard to see the difference with margin and padding with a white fill, but with a colored fill you can see it fine.Padding means space between widget and widget original frame. But the margin is space between widget\'s original frame to boundaries other widget\'s frame..In simple words:\npadding changes the size of the box (with something).\nmargin changes the space between different boxes
