I would like to ask for some simple examples showing the uses of <div> and <span>.  I\'ve seen them both used to mark a section of a page with an id or class, but I\'m interested in knowing if there are times when one is preferred over the other.div is a block element, span is inline.This means that to use them semantically, divs should be used to wrap sections of a document, while spans should be used to wrap small portions of text, images, etc.For example:Note that it is illegal to place a block level element within an inline element, so:...is illegal.EDIT: As of HTML5, some block elements can be placed inside of some inline elements - notably, the above is now legal.You asked for some concrete examples, so is one taken from my bowling website, BowlSK:Ok, what\'s going on?  At the top of my page, I have a logical section, the "header".  Since this is a section, I use a div (with an appropriate id).  Within that, I have a couple of sections: the user bar and the actual page title. The title uses the appropriate tag, h1.  The userbar, being a section, is wrapped in a div.  Within that, the username is wrapped in a span, so that I can change the style.  As you can see, I have also wrapped a span around 2 letters in the title - this allows me to change their color in my stylesheet.Also note that HTML5 includes a broad new set of elements that define common page structures, such as article, section, nav, etc.  Section 4.4 of the HTML 5 working draft lists them, and gives hints as to their usage.  HTML5 is still a working spec, so nothing is "final" yet, but it is highly doubtful that any of these elements are going anywhere.  There is a javascript hack that you will need to use if you want to style these elements in some older version of IE - you basically need to create one of each element using document.createElement before any of those elements are specified in your source. There are a bunch of libraries that will take care of this for you - a quick Google search turned up html5shiv.Just for the sake of completeness, I invite you to think about it like this:There are already good, detailed answers here, but no visual examples, so here\'s a quick illustration:<div> is a block tag, while <span> is an inline tag.<div> is a block-level element and <span> is an inline element. If you wanted to do something with some inline text, <span> is the way to go since it will not introduce line breaks that a <div> would.As noted by others, there are some semantics implied with each of these, most significantly the fact that a <div> implies a logical division in the document, akin to maybe a section of a document or something, a la:The real important difference is already mentioned in Chris\' answer. However, the implications won\'t be obvious for everybody.As an inline element, <span> may only contain other inline elements. The following code is therefore wrong:The above code isn\'t valid. To wrap block-level elements, another block-level element must be used (such as <div>). On the other hand, <div> may only be used in places where block-level elements are legal.Furthermore, these rules are fixed in (X)HTML and they are not altered by the presence of CSS rules! So the following codes are also wrong!As mentioned in other answers, by default div will be rendered as a block element, while span will be rendered inline within its context.  But neither has any semantic value; they exist to allow you to apply styling and an identity to any given bit of content.  Using styles, you can make a div act like a span and vice-versa.One of the useful styles for div is inline-blockExamples:http://dustwell.com/div-span-inline-block.htmlCSS display: inline vs inline-blockI have used inline-block to a great success, in game web projects.The significance of "block element" is implied but never stated explicitly. If we ignore all the theory (theory is good) then the following is a pragmatic comparison. The following:produces:That shows that not only should a div not be used inline, it simply won\'t produce the desired affect.Div is a block element and span is an inline element and its width depends upon the content of it self where div does notI would say that if you know a bit of spanish to look at this page, where is properly explained. However, a fast definition would be that div is for dividing sections and span is for applying some kind of style to an element within another block element like div.DIV TAG:Following are the characteristics:SPAN TAG:Following are the characteristics:In HTML there are tags that add structure or semantics to content. For example the <p> tag is used to identify a paragraph. Another example is the <ol> tag for an ordered list.When there is no suitable tag available in HTML as shown above, the <div> and <span> tags are usually resorted to.The <div> tag is used to identify a blocklevel section/division of a document that has a line break both before and after it.Examples of where div tags can be used are headers, footers, navigations etc. However in HTML 5 these tags have already been provided.The <span> tag is used to identify an inline section/division of a document.For example a span tag can be used to add inline pictographs to an element.
