I\'m trying to make login with Facebook available in my script. I\'ve done everything, but when I attempt to login with a Facebook account I get this error from Facebook:ErrorApp Not Setup: The developers of this app have not set up this app properly for Facebook Login.Here\'s error screenshot:Any ideas?With respect to the all the other answers, here\'s the screenshot to help someone.The circle next to your app name is not fully green. When you hover mouse on it, you\'ll see a popup saying, "Not available to all users because your app is not live."So next, you\'ve to make it publicly available.the problem was you have to set Do you want to make this app and all its live features available to the general public?set status and review to ON and problem solved enjoy codingSince the UI of the facebook has changed recently, here\'s the latest update for setting the sandbox mode ON/OFF :Go to https://developers.facebook.com/Click on the Apps menu on the top bar.Select the respective app from the drop down.Go to \'Status & Review\' from the table in the left side of the page.Do you want to make this app and all its live features available to the general public? - Select switch to set YES/NO value.Update: \nThe YES/NO button will be disabled until and unless you provide your contact email.Go to "Settings" in the left menu.Update your Contact Email.Hit the "Save" button at the bottom of the page.Update: \n\'Status & Review\' is replaced by \'App Review\' nowIf the app is still in private mode (Status and Review set to NO), then only Facebook users with role in the app can login. \nThat unless you set it to public (Status and Review set to YES).To add more users to be able to login to a private app:Many reasons including: This error also occurs when you try to log in in your test version of the Facebook app and you have not added the user you are trying to test the log in with in the Roles -> Testers section.To fix it, just add the email address of the Facebook account you are trying to log in with in the section above.Finally, make sure the user you added accepts the request sent before you try to test otherwise the log in process will fail in the second screen just after the user accept the conditions.There are a bunch of possible things which could trigger this error:In your case, you just need to add your facebook account into either tester, developer or admin of your facebook app as you want to use that account to test.But if you see the error upon clicking connect to facebook(before you have chance to enter facebook credentials), then it means your current facebook account detected from cookie is not a valid tester/developer/admin account for your app.\nYour could either add your account in or just hit facebook.com and sign out(to remove the undesired cookie).Make Sure in left panel App review tab selected (Your app is currently live and available to the public.) tab is ON and App status is GREENHappy ProgrammingI had the same problem but now here is how I solved it\nGo to https://developers.facebook.com/\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Click on the Apps menu on the top bar.\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Select the respective app from the drop down.\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Click Settings from the table in the left side of the page\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Then under the Contact Email type in your email you would like to use\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Then click save settings  button\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Go to \'Status & Review\' from the table in the left side of the page.\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Do you want to make this app and all its live features available to the general public? - Select switch to set YES/NO value.For other users that run into this issue, the app I was testing against was a test version of our production app and didn\'t have the option to turn status and review to ON as others have mentioned here.The fix was to create a new app which is not a test app, and configure it like the production version. The non-test version allows the option to turn status and review to ON.My specific use was testing a user registered with a phone number instead of an email address. I tried adding that user into different roles of our test app (Developer and Tester), but to no avail. My guess is it has something to do with the user not having an email associated with it.Here\'s more info on test apps: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/test-appsOkay - sandbox is off, domain has to be correct because 99% of the users can reach the app, and "all its live features available to the general public" is set to yes.Now, You need to add a "Privacy Policy URL" in the App Details tab (developers.facebook.com).\nThis is a new Policy of Facebook.Hemang\'s answer was right, BUT, there\'s one extra step you\'ll need, which is to add a Facebook App ID. (I discovered I was missing this part):\nOnce you\'ve done that in addition to Hemang\'s answer, you\'ll be good to go!And addition to all these beautifull comments dont forget to Start A SubmissionThis resolved my issue if you do not want to make the app available to the public (keeping Status & Review on NO)I  had to sign out of the previous account on the Facebook App and also remove the Facebook account in Settings. Removing just from the Settings will not remove the error because the App itself still has the previous account logged in. If  you have set your Roles as Administrator/Developer/Tester, you can put in that account login info in and it should work then. do setup by following bellow link and domain name you need to mention as like wht you have mentioned in facebook app domain name.Go to https://developers.facebook.com/Click on the Apps menu on the top bar.after a lot of tries, I\'ve read in other topics which someone said "delete all your apps and create it again". I did that but, as you can imagine, a new App will create a new Application ID on Facebook\'s page. So, even after all the "set public things" it didn\'t work because the application ID was wrong in my code due to the creation of a new App on Facebook developer page.So, as AndrewSmiley said above, you should remeber to update that in your app @strings
