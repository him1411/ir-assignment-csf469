I\'m not asking about full email validation.I just want to know what are allowed characters in user-name and server parts of email address. This may be oversimplified, maybe email adresses can take other forms, but I don\'t care. I\'m asking about only this simple form: user-name@server (e.g. wild.wezyr@best-server-ever.com) and allowed characters in both parts.See RFC 5322: Internet Message Format and, to a lesser extent, RFC 5321: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.RFC 822 also covers email addresses, but it deals mostly with its structure:And as usual, Wikipedia has a decent article on email addresses:The local-part of the email address may use any of these ASCII characters:In addition to ASCII characters, as of 2012 you can use international characters above U+007F, encoded as UTF-8.For validation, see Using a regular expression to validate an email address.The domain part is defined as follows:The Internet standards (Request for Comments) for protocols mandate that component hostname labels may contain only the ASCII letters a through z (in a case-insensitive manner), the digits 0 through 9, and the hyphen (-). The original specification of hostnames in RFC 952, mandated that labels could not start with a digit or with a hyphen, and must not end with a hyphen. However, a subsequent specification (RFC 1123) permitted hostname labels to start with digits. No other symbols, punctuation characters, or blank spaces are permitted.Watch out! There is a bunch of knowledge rot in this thread (stuff that used to be true and now isn\'t). To avoid false-positive rejections of actual email addresses in the current and future world, and from anywhere in the world, you need to know at least the high-level concept of RFC 3490, "Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)". I know folks in US and A often aren\'t up on this, but it\'s already in widespread and rapidly increasing use around the world (mainly the non-English dominated parts).The gist is that you can now use addresses like mason@\xe6\x97\xa5\xe6\x9c\xac.com and wildwezyr@fahrvergn\xc3\xbcgen.net. No, this isn\'t yet compatible with everything out there (as many have lamented above, even simple qmail-style +ident addresses are often wrongly rejected). But there is an RFC, there\'s a spec, it\'s now backed by the IETF and ICANN, and--more importantly--there\'s a large and growing number of implementations supporting this improvement that are currently in service.I didn\'t know much about this development myself until I moved back to Japan and started seeing email addresses like hei@\xe3\x82\x84\xe3\x82\x8b.ca and Amazon URLs like this:http://www.amazon.co.jp/\xe3\x82\xa8\xe3\x83\xac\xe3\x82\xaf\xe3\x83\x88\xe3\x83\xad\xe3\x83\x8b\xe3\x82\xaf\xe3\x82\xb9-\xe3\x83\x87\xe3\x82\xb8\xe3\x82\xbf\xe3\x83\xab\xe3\x82\xab\xe3\x83\xa1\xe3\x83\xa9-\xe3\x83\x9d\xe3\x83\xbc\xe3\x82\xbf\xe3\x83\x96\xe3\x83\xab\xe3\x82\xaa\xe3\x83\xbc\xe3\x83\x87\xe3\x82\xa3\xe3\x82\xaa/b/ref=topnav_storetab_e?ie=UTF8&node=3210981I know you don\'t want links to specs, but if you rely solely on the outdated knowledge of hackers on Internet forums, your email validator will end up rejecting email addresses that non-Enlish users increasingly expect to work. For those users, such validation will be just as annoying as the commonplace brain-dead form that we all hate, the one that can\'t handle a + or a three-part domain name or whatever.So I\'m not saying it\'s not a hassle, but the full list of characters "allowed under some/any/none conditions" is (nearly) all characters in all languages. If you want to "accept all valid email addresses (and many invalid too)" then you have to take IDN into account, which basically makes a character-based approach useless (sorry), unless you first convert the internationalized email addresses to Punycode.After doing that you can follow (most of) the advice above.Name: Server:Wikipedia has a good article on this, and the official spec is here. From Wikipdia:The local-part of the e-mail address may use any of these ASCII characters:Additionally, quoted-strings (ie: "John Doe"@example.com) are permitted, thus allowing characters that would otherwise be prohibited, however they do not appear in common practice. RFC 5321 also warns that "a host that expects to receive mail SHOULD avoid defining mailboxes where the Local-part requires (or uses) the Quoted-string form".The format of e-mail address is: local-part@domain-part (max. 64@255 characters, no more 256 in total).The local-part and domain-part could have different set of permitted characters, but that\'s not all, as there are more rules to it.In general, the local part can have these ASCII characters:Domain part: These e-mail addresses are valid:And these examples of invalid:Source: Email address at WikipediaPerl\'s RFC2822 regex for validating emails:The formal definitions of e-mail addresses are in:Related:You can start from wikipedia article:Google do an interesting thing with their gmail.com addresses.\ngmail.com addresses allow only letters (a-z), numbers, and periods(which are ignored).e.g., pikachu@gmail.com is the same as pi.kachu@gmail.com, and both email addresses will be sent to the same mailbox. PIKACHU@gmail.com is also delivered to the same mailbox.So to answer the question, sometimes it depends on the implementer on how much of the RFC standards they want to follow. Google\'s gmail.com address style is compatible with the standards. They do it that way to avoid confusion where different people would take similar email addresses e.g. The wikipedia link is a good reference on what email addresses generally allow. \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_addressThe short answer is that there are 2 answers. There is one standard for what you should do. ie behaviour that is wise and will keep you out of trouble. There is another (much broader) standard for the behaviour you should accept without making trouble. This duality works for sending and accepting email but has broad application in life.For a good guide to the addresses you create; see: http://www.remote.org/jochen/mail/info/chars.htmlTo filter valid emails, just pass on anything comprehensible enough to see a next step.\nOr start reading a bunch of RFCs, caution, here be dragons.Check for @ and . and then send an email for them to verify. I still can\'t use my .name email address on 20% of the sites on the internet because someone screwed up their email validation, or because it predates the new addresses being valid.A good read on the matter.Excerpt:As can be found in this Wikipedia linkThe local-part of the email address may use any of these ASCII characters:uppercase and lowercase Latin letters A to Z and a to z;digits 0 to 9;special characters !#$%&\'*+-/=?^_`{|}~;dot ., provided that it is not the first or last character unless quoted, and provided also that it does not appear consecutively unless quoted (e.g. John..Doe@example.com is not allowed but "John..Doe"@example.com is allowed);space and "(),:;<>@[\\] characters are allowed with restrictions (they are only allowed inside a quoted string, as described in the paragraph below, and in addition, a backslash or double-quote must be preceded by a backslash);comments are allowed with parentheses at either end of the local-part; e.g. john.smith(comment)@example.com and (comment)john.smith@example.com are both equivalent to john.smith@example.com.In addition to the above ASCII characters, international characters above U+007F, encoded as UTF-8, are permitted by RFC 6531, though mail systems may restrict which characters to use when assigning local-parts.A quoted string may exist as a dot separated entity within the local-part, or it may exist when the outermost quotes are the outermost characters of the local-part (e.g., abc."defghi".xyz@example.com or "abcdefghixyz"@example.com are allowed. Conversely, abc"defghi"xyz@example.com is not; neither is abc\\"def\\"ghi@example.com). Quoted strings and characters however, are not commonly used. RFC 5321 also warns that "a host that expects to receive mail SHOULD avoid defining mailboxes where the Local-part requires (or uses) the Quoted-string form".The local-part postmaster is treated specially\xe2\x80\x94it is case-insensitive, and should be forwarded to the domain email administrator. Technically all other local-parts are case-sensitive, therefore jsmith@example.com and  JSmith@example.com specify different mailboxes; however, many organizations treat uppercase and lowercase letters as equivalent.Despite the wide range of special characters which are technically valid; organisations, mail services, mail servers and mail clients in practice often do not accept all of them. For example, Windows Live Hotmail only allows creation of email addresses using alphanumerics, dot (.), underscore (_) and hyphen (-). Common advice is to avoid using some special characters to avoid the risk of rejected emails.The accepted answer refers to a Wikipedia article when discussing the valid local-part of an email address, but Wikipedia is not an authority on this.IETF RFC 3696 is an authority on this matter, and should be consulted at section 3. Restrictions on email addresses on page 5.As others have done, I submit a regex that works for both PHP and JavaScript to validate email addresses:The answer is (almost) ALL (7-bit ASCII).\nIf the inclusion rules is "...allowed under some/any/none conditions..."Just by looking at one of several possible inclusion rules for allowed text in the "domain text" part in RFC 5322 at the top of page 17 we find:the only three missing chars in this description are used in domain-literal [], to form a quoted-pair \\, and the white space character (%d32). With that the whole range 32-126 (decimal) is used. A similar requirement appear as "qtext" and "ctext". Many control characters are also allowed/used. One list of such control chars appears in page 31 section 4.1 of RFC 5322 as obs-NO-WS-CTL.All this control characters are allowed as stated at the start of section 3.5:And such an inclusion rule is therefore "just too wide". Or, in other sense, the expected rule is "too simplistic".In my PHP I use this check try it yourself http://phpfiddle.org/main/code/9av6-d10r2016-01-24Regarding all RFCs up to 6531 at this time...I am looking into removing all text withing double quotes and the surrounding double quotes before validation, putting the kibosh on email address submissions based on what is disallowed specifically (seems to be a much shorter list...) after the quoted material is removed, followed up by sending a confirm email message to the whole email address if it passes the previous two conditions, and unconfirmed account setups fall out of the system entirely after a reasonable amount of time.Disallowed:I created this regex according to RFC guidelines:For those interested in validation of international domains, there is a .NET tool available here (not affiliated with the company):http://cobisi.com/email-validation/.net-component \n- compliant with a long list of RFCs: IETF standards (RFC 1123, RFC 2821, RFC 2822, RFC 3490, RFC 3696, RFC\n  4291, RFC 5321, RFC 5322 and RFC 5336), with support for quoted words,\n  domain literals, non-ASCII domain names (IDNA) and mailboxes, and\n  commentsGmail will only allow + sign as special character and in some cases (.) but any other special characters are not allowed at Gmail.  RFC\'s says that you can use special characters but you should avoid sending mail to Gmail with special characters.
