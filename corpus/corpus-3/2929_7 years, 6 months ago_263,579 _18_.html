I\'ve got two branches from my master:Is there a way to copy yesterday\'s commits from wss to v2.1?You should really have a workflow that lets you do this all by merging:So all you have to do is git checkout v2.1 and git merge wss. If for some reason you really can\'t do this, and you can\'t use git rebase to move your wss branch to the right place, the command to grab a single commit from somewhere and apply it elsewhere is git cherry-pick. Just check out the branch you want to apply it on, and run git cherry-pick <SHA of commit to cherry-pick>.Some of the ways rebase might save you:If your history looks like this:You could use git rebase --onto v2 v2-only wss to move wss directly onto v2:Then you can merge! If you really, really, really can\'t get to the point where you can merge, you can still use rebase to effectively do several cherry-picks at once:Note: the reason that it takes some extra work in order to do this is that it\'s creating duplicate commits in your repository. This isn\'t really a good thing - the whole point of easy branching and merging is to be able to do everything by making commit(s) one place and merging them into wherever they\'re needed. Duplicate commits mean an intent never to merge those two branches (if you decide you want to later, you\'ll get conflicts).Use to apply <commit> to your current branch. I myself would probably cross-check the commits I pick in gitk and cherry-pick them with right-clicks on the commit entry there instead.If you want to go more automatic (with all its dangers) and assuming all commits since yesterday happened on wss you could generate the list of commits using git log with (--pretty suggested by Jefromi)so everything together assuming you use bashIf something goes wrong here (there is a lot of potential) you are in trouble since this works on the live checkout, so either do manual cherry-picks or use rebase like suggested by Jefromi.You could create a patch from the commits that you want to copy and apply the patch to the destination branch.Or if You are little less on the evangelist\'s side You can do a little ugly way I\'m using. In deploy_template there are commits I want to copy on my master as branch deploy This will create new branch deploy (I use -f to overwrite existing deploy branch) on deploy_template, then rebase this new branch onto master, leaving deploy_template untouched.
