I want to search a text from all my database stored procedures. I use the below SQL:I want to search for [ABD] in all stored procedures including square brackets, but it\'s not giving the proper result. How can I change my query to achieve this?Escape the square brackets:Then the square brackets will be treated as a string literals not as wild cards.Try this request:QueryHave you tried using some of the third party tools to do the search? There are several available out there that are free and that saved me a ton of time in the past. Below are two SSMS Addins I used with good success.ApexSQL Search \xe2\x80\x93 Searches both schema and data in databases and has additional features such as dependency tracking and more\xe2\x80\xa6  SSMS Tools pack \xe2\x80\x93 Has same search functionality as previous one and several other cool features. Not free for SQL Server 2012 but still very affordable. I know this answer is not 100% related to the questions (which was more specific) but hopefully others will find this useful. I usually run the following to achieve that:Redgate\'s SQL Search is a great tool for doing this, it\'s a free plugin for SSMS.Good practice to work with SQL Server.Make below store procedure and set short key for that like bottom image, Now - Set short key as below,So next time whenever you want to find a particular text in any of the four objects like Store procedure, Views, Functions and Tables. You just need to write that keyword and press short key.For example: I want to search \'PaymentTable\' then write \'PaymentTable\' in query editor and press short key ctrl+4 - it will provide you full result.You can also use this one:It might help you!Using CHARINDEX:Using PATINDEX:Using this double [[]ABD] is similar to escaping :Also you can use:Thats include commentsPlease take this as a "dirty" alternative but this saved my behind many times especially when I was not familiar with the DB project. Sometimes you are trying to search for a string within all SPs and forget that some of the related logic may have been hiding between Functions and Triggers or it can be simply worded differently than you thought. From your MSSMS you may right click your DB and select\nTasks -> Generate Scripts wizard to output all the SPs, Fns and Triggers into a single .sql file. Make sure to select Triggers too!Then just use Sublime or Notepad to search for the string you need to find. I know this may be quite inefficient and paranoid approach but it works :)Every so often I use this script to figure out which procs to modify, or to figure out what uses a column of a table, or that table at all to remove some old junk.  It checks each database on the instance it is ran on by the wonderfully supplied sp_msforeachdb.OBJECT_NAME([id]) --> Object Name (View,Store Procedure,Scalar Funciton,Table function name)id  (int) = Object identification numberxtype   char(2) Object type. Can be one of the following object types:FN = Scalar functionP = Stored procedureV = ViewTF = Table functionI created a procedure to search procedures, tables, views, or jobs. The first parameter @search is the search criterion, @target is for specifying procedures only or others. if not specified, it will search all. @db is to specify the database to search. Here is the query.You can also useand then run
