I have a small code example I want to include in the Javadoc comment for a method.  The problem is the code example shows up in the Javadoc with no line breaks making it hard to read.  I guess I am wrong in assuming the code tag would handle line breaks.  What is the best way to format code examples in Javadoc comments ?In addition to the already mentioned <pre> tags, you should also use the @code JavaDoc annotation, which will make life much easier when it comes to HTML entities issues (in particular with Generics), e.g.:Will give correct HTML output:While omitting the @code block (or using a <code> tag) will result in HTML like this:(For reference, Java SE 8 tag descriptions can be found here: Javadoc Tags)I had a really tough time with including a specific code example in a javadoc comment. I\'d like to share this one.\nPlease note the following:javadoc code: gets printed as The java source has lots of good examples for this. Here\'s an example from the head of "String.java":Enclose your multiline code with <pre></pre> tags.You need the <pre></pre> tags for the line breaks, and the {@code ... } inside them for generics. But then it\'s not allowed to place the opening brace on the same line as the <generic> tag, because then everything will be displayed on 1 line again.Displays on one line:Displays with line breaks:Another weird thing is when you paste the closing brace of {@code, it gets displayed:Output:The minimum requirements for proper codes are <pre/> and {@code}.yieldsAnd an optional surrounding <blockquote/> inserts an indentation.yieldsInserting <p> or surrounding with <p> and </p> yields warnings.I was able to generate good looking HTML files with the following snip-it shown in Code 1.(Code 1)Code 1 turned into the generated javadoc HTML page in Fig 1, as expected.(Fig. 1)However, in NetBeans 7.2, if you hit Alt+Shift+F (to reformat the current file), Code 1 turns in to Code 2.(Code 2)where the first <pre> is now broken onto two lines.  Code 2 produces generated javadoc HTML file as shown in Fig 2.(Fig 2)Steve B\'s suggestion (Code 3) seems to give the best results and remains formatted as expected even after hitting Alt+Shift+F.(Code 3)Use of Code 3 produces the same javadoc HTML output as shown in Fig 1.There is a significant difference between <blockquote><pre>... and <pre>{@code.... The former will omit the type declarations in generics but the latter will keep it.E.g.:\nList<MyClass> myObject = null;\ndisplays as List myObject = null; with the firts and as List<MyClass> myObject = null; with the secondIf you are Android developer you can use:To pretty print your code in Javadoc with Java code.Try replacing "code" with "pre". The pre tag in HTML marks the text as preformatted and all linefeeds and spaces will appear exactly as you type them.I enclose my example code with <pre class="brush: java"></pre> tags and use SyntaxHighlighter for published javadocs. It doesn\'t hurt IDE and makes published code examples beautiful.Using Java SE 1.6, it looks like all UPPERCASE PRE identifiers is the best way to do this in Javadoc:is the simplest way to do this.An Example from a javadoc I got from a java.awt.Event method:This produces output that looks exactly like the regular code, with the regular code spacings and new lines intact.I just read the Javadoc 1.5 reference here, and only the code with <and > must be enclosed inside {@code ...}. Here a simple example:
