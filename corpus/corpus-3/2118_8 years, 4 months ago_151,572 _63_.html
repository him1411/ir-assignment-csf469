I\'m curious to know if it\'s possible to bind an array of values to a placeholder using PDO.  The use case here is attempting to pass an array of values for use with an IN() condition.\nI\'m not very good at explaining, so here\'s some psuedocode to demonstrate. I\'d like to be able to do something like this:And have PDO bind and quote all the values in the array.At the moment I\'m doing:Which certainly does the job, but just wondering if there\'s a built in solution I\'m missing?i think soulmerge is right. you\'ll have to construct the query-string.fix: dan, you were right. fixed the code (didn\'t test it though)edit: both chris (comments) and somebodyisintrouble suggested that the foreach-loop ...... might be redundant, so the foreach loop and the $stmt->execute could be replaced by just ...(again, i didn\'t test it)For something quick:Is it so important to use IN statement? Try to use FIND_IN_SET op.For example, there is a query in PDO like that Then you only need to bind an array of values, imploded with comma, like this one and it\'s done.UPD: As some people pointed out in comments to this answer, there are some issues which should be stated explciitly. In fine, if you are not heavily dependent on indexes and do not use strings with comma for search, my solution will be much easier, simpler, and faster than solutions listed above.Since I do a lot of dynamic queries, this is a super simple helper function I made. Use it like this:Returns a string :id1,:id2,:id3 and also updates your $bindArray of bindings that you will need when it\'s time to run your query. Easy!Solution from EvilRygy didn\'t worked for me. In Postgres you can do another workaround:I extended PDO to do something similar to what stefs suggests, and it was easier for me in the long run:You can use it like this:very clean way for postgres is using the postgres-array ("{}"):Here is my solution:Note the use of array_values.  This can fix key ordering issues.I was merging arrays of ids and then removing duplicate items.  I had something like:And that was failing.I also realise this thread is old but I had a unique problem where, while converting the soon-to-be deprecated mysql driver to the PDO driver I had to make a function which could build, dynamically, both normal params and INs from the same param array. So I quickly built this:It is still untested however the logic seems to be there.Hope it helps someone in the same position,Edit: After some testing I found out:Code edited to working version.Looking at  PDO :Predefined Constants there is no PDO::PARAM_ARRAY which you would need as is listed on PDOStatement->bindParam bool PDOStatement::bindParam ( mixed $parameter , mixed &$variable [, int $data_type [, int $length [, mixed $driver_options ]]] )So I don\'t think it is achievable. A little editing about the code of SchnalleWhen you have other parameter, you may do like this:What database are you using? In PostgreSQL I like using ANY(array). So to reuse your example:Unfortunately this is pretty non-portable. On other databases you\'ll need to make up your own magic as others have been mentioning. You\'ll want to put that logic into a class/function to make it reusable throughout your program of course. Take a look at the comments on mysql_query page on PHP.NET for some more thoughts on the subject and examples of this scenario.After going through the same problem, i went to a simpler solution (although still not as elegant as an PDO::PARAM_ARRAY would be) : given the array $ids = array(2, 4, 32): ... and so onSo if you are using a mixed values array, you will need more code to test your values before assigning the type param:But i have not tested this one.As I know there is no any possibility to bind an array into PDO statement.But exists 2 common solutions:Use Positional Placeholders (?,?,?,?) or Named Placeholders (:id1, :id2, :id3)$whereIn = implode(\',\', array_fill(0, count($ids), \'?\'));Quote array earlier$whereIn = array_map(array($db, \'quote\'), $ids);Both options are good and safe. \nI prefer second one because it\'s shorter and I can var_dump parameters if I need it.\nUsing placeholders you must bind values and in the end your SQL code will be the same.And the last and important for me is avoiding error "number of bound variables does not match number of tokens"Doctrine it\'s great example of using positional placeholders, only because it has internal control over incoming parameters.If the column can only contain integers, you could probably do this without placeholders and just put the ids in the query directly. You just have to cast all the values of the array to integers. Like this:This shouldn\'t be vulnerable to any SQL injection.here is my solution. I have also extended the PDO class:Here is a sample usage for the above code:Let me know what you thinkI took it a bit further to get the answer closer to the original question of using placeholders to bind the params.  This answer will have to make two loops through the array to be used in the query.  But it does solve the issue of having other column placeholders for more selective queries. you first set number of "?" in query  and then by a "for" send parameters\nlike this :For me the sexier solution is to construct a dynamic associative array & use it
