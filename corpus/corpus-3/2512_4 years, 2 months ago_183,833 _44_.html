Trying to install modules from github results in: ENOENT error on package.json.Easily reproduced using express:npm install https://github.com/visionmedia/express throws error. npm install express works. Why can\'t I install from github?Here is the console output:Because https://github.com/visionmedia/express is the URL of a web page and not an npm module. Use this flavor:or this flavor if you need SSH:You can also do npm install visionmedia/expressor There is also support for installing directly from a gist, bitbucket, gitlab, and a number of other specialized formats. Look at the npm install documentation for them all.If git is not install then we can try npm install --save https://github.com/Amitesh/gulp-rev-all/tarball/master.There\'s also npm install https://github.com/{USER}/{REPO}/tarball/{BRANCH} to use a different branch.The current top answer by Peter Lyons is not relevant with recent NPM versions. For example, using the same command that was criticized in this answer is now fine.If you have continued problems it might be a problem with whatever package you were using.UPDATE sept 2016Installing from vanilla https github URLs now seems to work:EDIT: there are a couple of users commenting that you cant do this for all modules because you are reading from a source control system, which may well contain invalid/uncompiled/buggy code. So to be clear (although it should go without saying): given that the code in the repo is in an npm-usable state, you can now quite happily install directly from githubInstall it directly:Alternatively, you can add "express": "github:visionmedia/express" to the "dependencies" section of package.json file, then run:You could also doorBasically:UPDATE now you can do: npm install git://github.com/foo/bar.git\nor in package.json:The methods are covered pretty well now in npm\'s install documentation as well as the numerous other answers here.However, something notable that has changed recently is npm adding the prepare script to replace the prepublish script.  This fixes a longstanding problem where modules installed via git did not run the prepublish script and thus did not complete the build steps that occur when a module is published to the npm registry. See https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/3055.Of course, the module authors will need to update their package.json to use the new prepare directive for this to start working.You can directly install an github repo by npm install command, like this:\n\nnpm install https://github.com/futurechallenger/npm_git_install.git --save\nNOTE: In the repo which will be installed by npm command:The general form of the syntax iswhich means for your case it will beFrom npmjs docs:npm install :Installs the package from the hosted git provider, cloning it with\n  git.
