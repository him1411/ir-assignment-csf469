I\'m sort of new to bundler and the files it generates. I have a copy of a git repo from GitHub that is being contributed to by many people so I was surprised to find that bundler created a file that didn\'t exist in the repo and wasn\'t in the .gitignore list.Since I have forked it, I know adding it to the repo won\'t break anything for the main repo, but if I do a pull request, will it cause a problem?Should Gemfile.lock be included in the repository?Assuming you\'re not writing a rubygem, Gemfile.lock should be in your repository. It\'s used as a snapshot of all your required gems and their dependencies. This way bundler doesn\'t have to recalculate all the gem dependencies each time you deploy, etc.From cowboycoded\'s comment.If you are working on a gem, then DO\n  NOT check in your Gemfile.lock.Here\'s a nice article explaining what the lock file is.The real problem happens when you are working on an open-source Rails app that needs to have a configurable database adapter. I\'m developing the Rails 3 branch of Fat Free CRM. \nMy preference is postgres, but we want the default database to be mysql2. In this case, Gemfile.lock still needs be checked in with the default set of gems, but I need to ignore changes that I have made to it on my machine. To accomplish this, I run:and to reverse:It is also useful to include something like the following code in your Gemfile. This loads the appropriate database adapter gem, based on your database.yml.I can\'t say if this is an established best practice or not, but it works well for me.My workmates and I have different Gemfile.lock, because we use different platforms, windows and mac, and our server is linux. We decide to remove Gemfile.lock in repo and create Gemfile.lock.server in git repo, just like database.yml. Then before deploy it on server, we copy Gemfile.lock.server to Gemfile.lock on server using cap deploy hookAgreeing with r-dub, keep it in source control, but to me, the real benefit is this:collaboration in identical environments (disregarding the windohs and linux/mac stuff). Before Gemfile.lock, the next dude to install the project might see all kinds of confusing errors, blaming himself, but he was just that lucky guy getting the next version of super gem, breaking existing dependencies.Worse, this happened on the servers, getting untested version unless being disciplined and install exact version. Gemfile.lock makes this explicit, and it will explicitly tell you that your versions are different.Note: remember to group stuff, as :development and :testThe Bundler docs address this question as well:ORIGINAL: http://gembundler.com/v1.3/rationale.htmlEDIT: http://web.archive.org/web/20160309170442/http://bundler.io/v1.3/rationale.htmlSee the section called "Checking Your Code into Version Control":After developing your application for a while, check in the\n  application together with the Gemfile and Gemfile.lock snapshot. Now,\n  your repository has a record of the exact versions of all of the gems\n  that you used the last time you know for sure that the application\n  worked. Keep in mind that while your Gemfile lists only three gems\n  (with varying degrees of version strictness), your application depends\n  on dozens of gems, once you take into consideration all of the\n  implicit requirements of the gems you depend on.This is important: the Gemfile.lock makes your application a single\n  package of both your own code and the third-party code it ran the last\n  time you know for sure that everything worked. Specifying exact\n  versions of the third-party code you depend on in your Gemfile would\n  not provide the same guarantee, because gems usually declare a range\n  of versions for their dependencies.The next time you run bundle install on the same machine, bundler will\n  see that it already has all of the dependencies you need, and skip the\n  installation process.Do not check in the .bundle directory, or any of the files inside it.\n  Those files are specific to each particular machine, and are used to\n  persist installation options between runs of the bundle install\n  command.If you have run bundle pack, the gems (although not the git gems)\n  required by your bundle will be downloaded into vendor/cache. Bundler\n  can run without connecting to the internet (or the RubyGems server) if\n  all the gems you need are present in that folder and checked in to\n  your source control. This is an optional step, and not recommended,\n  due to the increase in size of your source control repository.A little late to the party, but answers still took me time and foreign reads to understand this problem. So I want to summarize what I have find out about the Gemfile.lock.When you are building a Rails App, you are using certain versions of gems in your local machine. If you want to avoid errors in the production mode and other branches, you have to use that one Gemfile.lock file everywhere and tell bundler to bundle for rebuilding gems every time it changes.If Gemfile.lock has changed on your production machine and Git doesn\'t let you git pull, you should write git reset --hard to avoid that file change and write git pull again.No Gemfile.lock means:-> Always check in Gemfile.lock, make travis delete it if you want to be extra thorough https://grosser.it/2015/08/14/check-in-your-gemfile-lock/
