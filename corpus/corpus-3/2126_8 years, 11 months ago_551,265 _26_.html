What regex pattern would need I to pass to the java.lang.String.split() method to split a String into an Array of substrings using all whitespace characters (\' \', \'\\t\', \'\\n\', etc.) as delimiters?Something in the lines ofThis groups all white spaces as a delimiter. So if I have the string:"Hello[space][tab]World"This should yield the strings "Hello" and "World" and omit the empty space between the [space] and the [tab].As VonC pointed out, the backslash should be escaped, because Java would first try to escape the string to a special character, and send that to be parsed. What you want, is the literal "\\s", which means, you need to pass "\\\\s". It can get a bit confusing.The \\\\s is equivalent to [ \\\\t\\\\n\\\\x0B\\\\f\\\\r]In most regex dialects there are a set of convenient character summaries you can use for this kind of thing - these are good ones to remember:\\w - Matches any word character. \\W - Matches any nonword character. \\s - Matches any white-space character. \\S - Matches anything but white-space characters. \\d - Matches any digit. \\D - Matches anything except digits.A search for "Regex Cheatsheets" should reward you with a whole lot of useful summaries.To get this working in Javascript, I had to do the following:"\\\\s+" should do the trickAlso you may have a UniCode non-breaking space xA0...Apache Commons Lang has a method to split a string with whitespace characters as delimiters:http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/apidocs/org/apache/commons/lang3/StringUtils.html#split(java.lang.String)This might be easier to use than a regex pattern.Since it is a regular expression, and i\'m assuming u would also not want non-alphanumeric chars like commas, dots, etc that could be surrounded by blanks (e.g. "one , two" should give [one][two]), it should be:you can split a string by line break by using the following statement :you can split a string by Whitespace by using the following statement :Study this code.. good luck
