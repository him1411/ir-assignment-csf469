Scenario:Let\'s say I have two tables, TableA and TableB.  TableB\'s primary key is a single column (BId), and is a foreign key column in TableA.In my situation, I want to remove all rows in TableA that are linked with specific rows in TableB: Can I do that through joins? Delete all rows that are pulled in from the joins?Or am I forced to do this:The reason I ask is it seems to me that the first option would be much more effecient when dealing with larger tables.Thanks!should workI would use this syntaxYes you can. Example :Was trying to do this with an access database and found I needed to use a.* right after the delete.It\'s almost the same in MySQL, but you have to use the table alias right after the word "DELETE":The syntax above doesn\'t work in Interbase 2007.  Instead, I had to use something like:(Note Interbase doesn\'t support the AS keyword for aliases)Let\'s say you have 2 tables, one with a Master set (eg. Employees) and one with a child set (eg. Dependents) and you\'re wanting to get rid of all the rows of data in the Dependents table that cannot key up with any rows in the Master table.The point to notice here is that you\'re just collecting an \'array\' of EmpIDs from the join first, the using that set of EmpIDs to do a Deletion operation on the Dependents table. In SQLite, the only thing that work is something similar to beauXjames\' answer. It seems to come down to this \n    DELETE FROM table1 WHERE table1.col1 IN (SOME TEMPORARY TABLE);\nand that some temporary table can be crated by SELECT and JOIN your two table which you can filter this temporary table based on the condition that you want to delete the records in Table1.you can run this query:-I\'m using thisand @TheTXI way is good as enough but I read answers and comments and I found one things must be answered is using condition in WHERE clause or as join condition. So I decided to test it and write an snippet but didn\'t find a meaningful difference between them. You can see sql script here and important point is that I preferred to write it as commnet because of this is not exact answer but it is large and can\'t be put in comments, please pardon me.If you could get good reason from this script or write another useful, please share. Thanks and hope this help.The simpler way is:
