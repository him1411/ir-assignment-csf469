In XML, we can set a text color by the textColor attribute, like android:textColor="#FF0000". But how do I change it by coding?I tried something like:Where holder is just a class and text is of type TextView. Red is an RGB value (#FF0000) set in strings.But it shows a different color rather than red. What kind of parameter can we pass in setTextColor()? In documentation, it says int, but is it a resource reference value or anything else?You should use:For a sanity check, I just tried it, because I had a project open anyway, and yes, it\'s nice and red ;DYou can use various functions from the Color class to get the same effect of course. Color.parseColor (Manual) (like LEX uses)Color.rgb and Color.argb (Manual rgb) (Manual argb) (like Ganapathy uses)And of course, if you want to define your color in an XML file, you can do this:because the getColor() function is deprecated1, you need to use it like so:You can also insert plain HEX, like so:Where you have an alpha-channel first, then the color value.Check out the complete manual of course, public class Color extends Object.1This code used to be in here as well:This method is now deprecated in Android M. You can however use it from the contextCompat in the support library, as the example now shows.If you still want to specify your colors in your XML file:Then reference it in your code with one of these two methods:orThe first is probably preferable if you\'re compiling against Android M, however the theme you pass in can be null, so maybe that\'s easier for you?And if you\'re using the Compat library you can do something like thisAnd another one: You can do this only from an XML file too. Create a color.xml file in the values folder:Then in any XML file, you can set color for text using,Or you can use this color in a Java file:You can useYou can also specify what color you want with Transparency.a for Alpha (Transparent) value r-red  g-green  b-blueI normally do this for any views:where AA defines alpha (00 for transparent, FF for opaque)RRGGBB defines the normal HTML color code (like FF0000 for red).use the following code in layout.xmlIf you plan to use setTextAppearance you should know that it will overwrite the text color with the style inherited from the theme. So if you want to use both, set the color afterwards.This works:While this will cause your textcolor to be for instance white(for dark theme) or black(for the light theme):Contrary to this in XML the order is arbitrary.I believe that if you want to specify a color as a resource (in the XML file), you\'ll have to provide its ARGB value (not simply the RGB value).Try changing your color value to #FFFF0000. It should give you RED.There are many different ways to set color on text view.Add color value in studio res->values->colors.xml asNow set the color in xml or actvity class asIf you want to give color code directly use below Color.parseColor codeYou can also use RGB Use can also use direct hexcode for textView. You can also insert plain HEX, like so:You can also use argb with alpha values.a for Alpha (Transparent) v.And if you\'re using the Compat library you can do something like thisholder.text.setTextColor(Color.rgb(200,0,0));\nor myTextView.setTextColor(0xAARRGGBB);Use:Using Adapter you can set the text color by using this code:text1.setTextColor(Color.parseColor("#000000"));Above code is working on my side. Here text is a TextView on which color is needed to be set.if you want to give color code directly then useor if you want to give color code from colors folder then useIn Adapter you can set the text color by using this code:In order to set color of a TextView, TextView.setTextColor(R.color.YOURCOLOR) is not enough!It has to be used like this \xe2\x80\x93ORSimilarly, I was using color.xml:For setting the TextView background like:I was getting a different color, but when I used the below code I got the actual color.I did this way:\nCreate a XML file, called Colors in res/values folder.My Colors.xml:To get this colors from the xml file, I\'ve used this code:\n valor it\'s a TextView, and ctx it\'s a Context object. I\'m not using it from an Activity, but a BaseAdapter to a ListView. That\'s why I\'ve used this Context Object.Hope it helps.For providing rgb values: text.setTextColor(Color.rgb(200,0,0));\nFor parsing the color from a hex value:\ntext.setTextColor(Color.parseColor("#FFFFFF")); If you are in an adapter and still want to use a color defined in resources you can try the following approach:getColor() is deprecetedSo try this way:I was doing this for a TextView in a ViewHolder for a RecyclerView. I\'m not so sure why, but it didn\'t work for me in the ViewHolder initialization.But when I moved it to the onBindViewHolder, it worked fine.Hope this helps someone.You can use textView.setTextColor(Color.BLACK) to use any of the in-built colors of the Color class.You can also use textView.setTextColor(Color.parseColor(hexRGBvalue)) to define custom colors.Try using the following code :
