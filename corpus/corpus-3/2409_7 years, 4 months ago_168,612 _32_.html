I have a tabbar application, with many views.   Is there a way to know if a particular UIViewController is currently visible from within the UIViewController?  (looking for a property)The view\'s window property is non-nil if a view is currently visible, so check the main view in the view controller:[EDIT] Invoking the view method causes the view to load (if it is not loaded) which is unnecessary and may be undesirable.  It would be better to check first to see if it is already loaded.  I\'ve added the call to isViewLoaded to avoid this problem.Or if you have a UINavigationController managing the view controllers, you could check its visibleViewController property instead.Here\'s @progrmr\'s solution as a UIViewController category:There are a couple of issues with the above solutions.  If you are using, for example, a UISplitViewController, the master view will always return true for Instead, take this simple approach which seems to work well in most, if not all cases:For those of you looking for a Swift 2.2 version of the answer:and Swift 3:You want to use the UITabBarController\'s selectedViewController property. All view controllers attached to a tab bar controller have a tabBarController property set, so you can, from within any of the view controllers\' code:For over-full-screen or over-context presentation, "is visible" could mean it is on top of view controller stack or just visible but covered by another view controller.To check if the view controller "is the top view controller" is quite different from "is visible", you should check the view controller\'s navigation controller\'s view controller stack.I wrote a piece of code to solve this problem:I made a swift extension based on @progrmr\'s answer. It allows you to easily check if a UIViewController is on screen like so:The extension:For my purposes, in the context of a container view controller, I\'ve found thatworks well.if you\'re utilizing a UINavigationController and also want to handle modal views, the following is what i use:you can check it by window propertyThe approach that I used for a modal presented view controller was to check the class of the presented controller.  If the presented view controller was ViewController2 then I would execute some code.XCode 6.4, for iOS 8.4, ARC enabledObviously lots of ways of doing it.  The one that has worked for me is the following...This can be used in any view controller in the following way,If you call this property in -(void)viewDidLoad you get 0, then if you call this after -(void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated you get 1.Hope this helps someone.  Thanks!  Cheers.If you are using a navigation controller and just want to know if you are in the active and topmost controller, then use:This answer is based on @mattdipasquale\'s comment.If you have a more complicated scenario, see the other answers above.I found those function in UIViewController.h.Maybe the above functions can detect the ViewController is appeared or not.Since UIAlertController is derived from UIViewController you can just use the isBeingPresented
