How can I generate the name of the month (e.g: Oct/October) from this date object in JavaScript?Shorter version:It is now possible to do this with the ECMAScript Internationalization API:http://jsfiddle.net/dstorey/Xgerq/"long" uses the full name of the month, "short" for the short name, and "narrow" for a more minimal version, such as the first letter in alphabetical languages.You can change the locale to any that you please, and it will use the right name for that language/country. With toLocaleString you have to pass in the locale and options each time. If you are going do use the same locale info and formatting options on multiple different dates, you can use Intl.DateTimeFormat instead:The main issue with this API is it is new. It is only available in Blink browsers (Chrome and Opera), IE11, Microsoft Edge and Firefox 29+. It is not supported by Safari.For more information see my blog post on the Internationalization API.Here\'s another one, with support for localization :)you can then easily add support for other languages:If you don\'t mind extending the Date prototype (and there are some good reasons to not want to do this), you can actually come up with a very easy method:These functions will then apply to all javascript Date objects.I heartily recommend the format function from, the moment.js library, which you can use like this:In addition to a lengthy list of other features, it has strong support for internationalization.You might use datejs to do that. Check the FormatSpecifiers, MMMM gives you the month\'s name:And datejs got that localized for more than 150 locales! See hereIt can be used asSome common easy process from date object can be done by this.Or you can make date prototype likeEx: var dateFormat3 = new Date().getMonthName(); # Marchvar dateFormat4 = new Date().getFormatDate(); # 16 March, 2017Try:Here\'s a way that does not depend on a hard-coded array and supports multiple locales.If you need a whole array:Usage:If you need only a selected month (faster):Usage:Tested and works fine on Chrome and IE 11. On mozilla some modifications are needed, because it returns the whole date.The natural format this days is to use Moment.js.The way to get the month in a string format , is very simple in Moment.js no need to hard code the month names in your code:\nTo get the current month and year in month name format and full year (May 2015) :Instead of declaring array which hold all the month name and then pointing with an index, we can also write it in a shorter version as below:You can use one of several available Date formatters. Since this falls within the JavaScript specification, it will be available in both browser and server-side modes.e.g.There are more at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DateUnfortunately the best way to extract the month name is from the UTCString representation:My Best Solution is as follow:Store the names in a array and look up by the index of the month.JavaScript getMonth() MethodThere\'s a really useful date bolt-on here:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/jqueryjs/source/browse/trunk/plugins/methods/date.js?r=6305\nThis extends the built-in Date class with methods such as getMonthName() etc..If you\'re using jQuery, you\'re probably also using jQuery UI, which means you can use $.datepicker.formatDate().If you don\'t want to use an external library, or store an array of month names, or if the ECMAScript Internationalization API is not good enough because of browser compatibility you can always do it the old-fashioned way by extracting the info from the date output:This would give you the abbreviated month name, e.g. Oct. I believe the date will come in all sorts of formats depending on the initialization and your locale so take a look at what toDateString() returns and recalculate your substring() values based on that.With momentjs, just use the format notation.I have a partial solution that I came up with. It uses a regular expression to extract the month and day name. But as I look through the Region and Language options (Windows) I realize that different cultures have different format order...  maybe a better regular expression pattern could be useful.Just extending on the many other excellent answers - if you are using jQuery - you could just do something likewhere date is equal to the var d = new Date(somevalue). The primary advantage of this is per @nickf said about avoiding the global namespace.If you don\'t want to use moment and want to display month name - This can be also done if you are using kendo.Here are list of formatters from kendo site:"d"    Renders the day of the month, from 1 through 31."dd"   The day of the month, from 01 through 31."ddd"  The abbreviated name of the day of the week."dddd" The full name of the day of the week."f"    The tenths of a second in a date and time value."ff"   The hundredths of a second in a date and time value."fff"  The milliseconds in a date and time value."M"    The month, from 1 through 12."MM"   The month, from 01 through 12."MMM"  The abbreviated name of the month."MMMM" The full name of the month."h"    The hour, using a 12-hour clock from 1 to 12."hh"   The hour, using a 12-hour clock from 01 to 12."H"    The hour, using a 24-hour clock from 1 to 23."HH"   The hour, using a 24-hour clock from 01 to 23."m"    The minute, from 0 through 59."mm"   The minute, from 00 through 59."s"    The second, from 0 through 59."ss"   The second, from 00 through 59."tt"   The AM/PM designator."yy"   The last two characters from the year value."yyyy" The year full value."zzz"  The local timezone when using formats to parse UTC date strings.To get a array of month name :http://jsfiddle.net/polinux/qb346/
