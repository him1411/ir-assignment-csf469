From https://developer.android.com/preview/material/ui-widgets.htmlWhen we creating RecyclerView.Adapter we have to specify ViewHolder that will bind with that adapter.So, is it possible to create RecyclerView with multiple view type?Yes, it\'s possible. Just implement getItemViewType(), and take care of the viewType parameter in onCreateViewHolder().So you do something like:If the layouts for view types are only a few and binding logics are simple, follow Anton\'s solution.\nBut the code will be messy if you need to manage the complex layouts and binding logics.  I believe the following solution will be useful for someone who need to handle complex view types.Base DataBinder class The functions needed to define in this class are pretty much same as the adapter class when creating the single view type.\nFor each view type, create the class by extending this DataBinder.  Sample DataBinder class In order to manage DataBinder classes, create adapter class.Base DataBindAdapter class Create the class by extending this base class, and then instantiate DataBinder classes and override abstract methodsgetItemCount\nReturn the total item count of DataBindersgetItemViewType\nDefine the mapping logic between the adapter position and view type.getDataBinder\nReturn the DataBinder instance based on the view typegetPosition\nDefine convert logic to the adapter position from the position in the specified DataBindergetBinderPosition\nDefine convert logic to the position in the DataBinder from the adapter positionHope this solution will be helpful.\nI left more detail solution and samples in GitHub, so please refer the following link if you need.\nhttps://github.com/yqritc/RecyclerView-MultipleViewTypesAdapter The below is not pseudocode and I have tested it and it has worked for me.I wanted to create a headerview in my recyclerview and then display a list of pictures below the header which the user can click on. I used a few switches in my code, don\'t know if that is the most efficient way to do this so feel free to give your comments:Yes, it is possible.Write a generic view holder:then create your view holders and make them extend the GenericViewHolder. For example, this one:then the RecyclerView.Adapter class will look like this one:following Anton\'s solution, come up with this ViewHolder which holds/handles/delegates different type of layouts.\nBut not sure if the replacing new layout would work when the recycling view\'s ViewHolder is not type of the data roll in.So basically, \nonCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) is only called when new view layout is needed;getItemViewType(int position) will be called for the viewType;onBindViewHolder(ViewHolder holder, int position) is always called when recycling the view (new data is brought in and try to display with that ViewHolder).So when onBindViewHolder is called it needs to put in the right view layout and update the ViewHolder.Is the way correct to replacing the view layout for that ViewHolder to be brought in, or any problem? \nAppreciate any comment!Edit: ViewHolder has member mItemViewType to hold the viewEdit: looks like in onBindViewHolder(ViewHolder holder, int position) the ViewHolder passed in has been picked up (or created) by looked at getItemViewType(int position) to make sure it is a match, so may not need to worry there that ViewHolder\'s type does not match the data[position]\'s type.\nDoes anyone knows more how the ViewHolder in the onBindViewHolder() is picked up?Edit: Looks like The recycle ViewHolder is picked by type, so no warrior there.Edit: http://wiresareobsolete.com/2014/09/building-a-recyclerview-layoutmanager-part-1/ answers this question.It gets the recycle ViewHolder like:or create new one if not find recycle ViewHolder of right type.I have a better solution which allows to create multiple view types in a declarative and type safe way. It\xe2\x80\x99s written in Kotlin which btw is really nice.Simple view holders for all required view typesThere is an abstraction of adapter data item. Note that a view type is represented by a hashCode of particular view holder class (KClass in Kotlin)Only bindViewHolder needs to be overriden in concrete adapter item classes (type safe way)List of such AdapterItemMedium objects is a data source for the adapter which actually accepts List<AdapterItem> see below.Important part of this solution is a view holder factory which will provide fresh instances of a specific ViewHolderAnd the simple adapter class looks like thisOnly 3 steps to create a new view type:Here is an example of this concept : android-drawer-template \nIt goes even further - view type which act as a spinner component, selectable adapter items.  Actually, I\'d like to improve on Anton\'s answer.Since getItemViewType(int position) returns an integer value, you can return the layout resource ID you\'d need to inflate. That way you\'d save some logic in onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) method.Also, I wouldn\'t suggest doing intensive calculations in getItemCount() as that particular function is called at least 5 times while rendering the list, as well as while rendering each item beyond the visible items. Sadly since notifyDatasetChanged() method is final, you can\'t really override it, but you can call it from another function within the adapter.It is very simple and straight forward.Just Override getItemViewType() method in your adapter. On the basis of data return different itemViewType values. e.g\nConsider an object of type Person with a member isMale, if isMale is true, return 1 and isMale is false, return 2 in getItemViewType() method.Now comes to the createViewHolder (ViewGroup parent, int viewType), on the basis of different viewType yon can inflate the different layout file. like the followingin onBindViewHolder (VH holder,int position) check where holder is instance of AdapterFemaleViewHolder or AdapterMaleViewHolder by instanceof and accordingly assign the values.ViewHolder May be like thisYou can use the library: https://github.com/vivchar/RendererRecyclerViewAdapter`For each item, you should to implement a ViewRenderer, ViewHolder, SomeModel:ViewHolder - it is a simple view holder of recycler view.SomeModel - it is your model with ItemModel interfaceFor more details you can look documentations.There Too LAzy Solution are presented...\nTry this out very easy and quick solution to make multiple layout in Recycler viewuse this when you need to change layout change isME( true  or false ) is upto you
