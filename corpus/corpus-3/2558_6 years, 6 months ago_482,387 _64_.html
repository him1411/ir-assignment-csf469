Is there an easy way I can print the full path of file.txt ?The <command> should printUse readlink:I suppose you are using Linux.I found a utility called realpath in coreutils 8.15.The following usually does the trick:I know there\'s an easier way that this, but darned if I can find it...orYou could use the fpn (full path name) script:fpn is not a standard Linux package, but it\'s a free and open github project and you could set it up in a minute.If you are in the same directory as the file:Replace file.txt with your target filename.In a similar scenario, I\'m launching a cshell script from some other location. For setting the correct absolute path of the script so that it runs in the designated directory only, I\'m using the following code:$0 stores the exact string how the script was executed.For e.g. if the script was launched like this: $> ../../test/test.csh,\n$script_dir will contain /home/abc/sandbox/v1/../../testFor Mac OS X, I replaced the utilities that come with the operating system and replaced them with a newer version of coreutils. This allows you to access tools like readlink -f (for absolute path to files) and realpath (absolute path to directories) on your Mac. The Homebrew version appends a \'G\' (for GNU Tools) in front of the command name -- so the equivalents become greadlink -f FILE and grealpath DIRECTORY. Instructions for how to install the coreutils/GNU Tools on Mac OS X  through Homebrew can be found in this StackExchange arcticle. NB: The readlink -f and realpath commands should work out of the box for non-Mac Unix users. You can save this in your "shell.rc" or just put in console function absolute_path { echo "$PWD/$1"; }alias ap="absolute_path"example: ap somefile.txtwill output/home/user/somefile.txtWill find all the links to the file with the same inode number as file.txtadding a -xdev flag will avoid find to cross device boundaries ("mount points"). (But this will probably cause nothing to be found if the find does not start at a directory on the same device as file.txt)Do note that find can report multiple paths for a single filesystem object, because an Inode can be linked by more than one directory entry, possibly even using different names. For instance:Will output:I know that this is an old question now, but just to add to the information here:The Linux command which can be used to find the filepath of a command file, i.e.There are some caveats to this; please see https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-do-i-find-the-path-to-a-command-file/.Works on Mac, Linux, *nix:This will give you a quoted csv of all files in the current dir:The output of this can be easily copied into a python list or any similar data structure.In windows you can This will copy the full path of the file to clipboard. realpath yourfile to get the full path of a file as suggested by many.Copies the text to your clipboard and displays the text on the terminal window.:)(I copied some of the code from another stack overflow answer but cannot find that answer anymore)the easiest way I found is it works well for meThis will work for both file and folder:Usually:Alternatively, just for the current folder:I like many of the answers already given, but I have found this really useful, especially within a script to get the full path of a file, including following symlinks and relative references such as . and ..Which will return the full path of the file from the root path onwards.\nThis can be used in a script so that the script knows which path it is running from, which is useful in a repository clone which could be located anywhere on a machine.I can then use the ${basePath} variable in my scripts to directly reference other scripts.Hope this helps,DaveIn Mac OSX, do the following steps:Another Linux utility, that does this job:This is explanation of what is going on at @ZeRemz\'s answer:For Mac OS, if you just want to get the path of a file in the finder, control click the file, and scroll down to "Services" at the bottom. You get many choices, including "copy path" and "copy full path". Clicking on one of these puts the path on the clipboard.Beside "readlink -f" , another commonly used command:This also give the full path and file name at consoleOff-topic: This method just gives relative links, not absolute. The readlink -f command is the right one.the below prints the absolute path of file.txt, which in this example is supposed to be in the current directory. Let us suppose that file.txt is in the home directory of user foo. All of the below commands are equivalent and they all will return the same /home/foo/file.txt in Linux or /Users/foo/file.txt in OS X:This works with both Linux and Mac OSX .. This will give you absolute path of the file:
