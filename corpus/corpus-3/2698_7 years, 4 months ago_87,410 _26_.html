I have created a specific List which exists out of the following elements to create a scrollable list with every row containing a Image on the left side and some text on the right side:To begin with a "root" layout :and then within the ListView I place the following "row" item :As long as the screen is shown statically (as in no movement) it will be shown correctly, but when I start scrolling through the list the background of the row-item (an "icon" as can be shown in the code) will be shown correctly but the background of the "root" layout will become completely black... when the scrolling stops the background will, most of the times, get back its color...\nAs I test I also added a TextView in that root-element with the same background, this one will detain it\'s color when the List is scrolled...\nAny idea why this is happening, and how to solve this?Add an attribute on the ListView TagFor more details check this blogIt\'s very simple just use this line in your layout file :like this:you can use like this:\n\nWe have plenty of options for this problem, you can set the background as transparent through programming likeor through xmlThere are allot of answers to this question but today I realized this question is still missing a critical piece of information.There are two possible solutions for the problem, both work but each should be used in different situations.Methods Use android:cacheColorHint when your ListView has a solid color background.Use android:scrollingCache when your ListView has a (complex) image as background.When your ListView has a solid color background both methods will work, so not only the cacheColorHint will work. But it\'s not recommended to use the scrolingCache method for solid color backgrounds since it turns off an optimization method used for smooth animating and scrolling the ListView.Note for the note: scrolingCache set to false does not necessarily mean the ListView\'s animations and scrolling will become slow.I am using images in listView and it turns black sometimes in samsung s4 not even scrolling. It was a stupid mistake which I have done in the adapter.I just put my view to null to fix this issueIn your xml where to use Listview setThe following worked for me:android:cacheColorHint="#00000000"// setting transparent color ordon\'t set background of listview.
