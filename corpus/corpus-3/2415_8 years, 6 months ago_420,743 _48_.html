I want to record the time using System.currentTimeMillis() when a user begins something in my program. When he finishes, I will subtract the current System.currentTimeMillis() from the start variable, and I want to show them the time elapsed using a human readable format such as "XX hours, XX mins, XX seconds" or even "XX mins, XX seconds" because its not likely to take someone an hour.What\'s the best way to do this?Use the java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit class:Note: TimeUnit is part of the Java 1.5 specification, but toMinutes was added as of Java 1.6.To add a leading zero for values 0-9, just do:If TimeUnit or toMinutes are unsupported (such as on Android before API version 9), use the following equations:Based on @siddhadev\'s answer, I wrote a function to do this recently.  Just thought I\'d share in case anyone finds it useful:Enjoy!Prints:25:36:259Uhm... how many milliseconds are in a second? And in a minute? Division is not that hard.Continue like that for hours, days, weeks, months, year, decades, whatever.I would not pull in the extra dependency just for that (division is not that hard, after all), but if you are using Commons Lang anyway, there are the DurationFormatUtils.Either hand divisions, or use the SimpleDateFormat API.Edit by Bombe: It has been shown in the comments that this approach only works for smaller durations (i.e. less than a day).Just to add more info\nif you want to format like:  HH:mm:ss0 <= HH <= infinite0 <= mm < 600 <= ss < 60use this:I just had this issue now and figured this outUsing the java.time package in Java 8:Output is in ISO 8601 Duration format: PT1M3.553S (1 minute and 3.553 seconds).I think the best way is:Shortest solution:Here\'s probably the shortest which also deals with time zones.Which outputs for example:Explanation:%tT is the time formatted for the 24-hour clock as %tH:%tM:%tS.%tT also accepts longs as input, so no need to create a Date. printf() will simply print the time specified in milliseconds, but in the current time zone therefore we have to subtract the raw offset of the current time zone so that 0 milliseconds will be 0 hours and not the time offset value of the current time zone.Note #1: If you need the result as a String, you can get it like this:Note #2: This only gives correct result if millis is less than a day because the day part is not included in the output.for Android below API 9Using Joda-Time:For small times, less than an hour, I prefer:  for longer intervalls:  My simple calculation:Happy coding :)Here is an answer based on Brent Nash answer, Hope that helps !Revisiting @brent-nash contribution above, we could use modulus function instead of subtractions and use String.format method for the result string:for correct strings ("1hour, 3sec", "3 min" but not "0 hour, 0 min, 3 sec") i write this code:If you know the time difference would be less than an hour, then you can use following code:It will result to: 51:00This answer is similar to some answers above. However, I feel that it would be beneficial because, unlike other answers, this will remove any extra commas or whitespace and handles abbreviation.I have covered this in another answer but you can do:The output is something like Map:{DAYS=1, HOURS=3, MINUTES=46, SECONDS=40, MILLISECONDS=0, MICROSECONDS=0, NANOSECONDS=0}, with the units ordered.It\'s up to you to figure out how to internationalize this data according to the target locale.I modified @MyKuLLSKI \'s answer and added plurlization support. I took out seconds because I didn\'t need them, though feel free to re-add it if you need it.
