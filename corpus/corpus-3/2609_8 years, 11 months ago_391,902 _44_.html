I would like to redirect www.example.com to example.com. The following htaccess code makes this happen:But, is there a way to do this in a generic fashion without hardcoding the domain name?Same as Michael\'s except this one works :PBut if we need to do this for separate http and https:Redirect non-www to www (both: http + https)If you want to do this in the httpd.conf file, you can do it without mod_rewrite (and apparently it\'s better for performance).I got that answer here: https://serverfault.com/questions/120488/redirect-url-within-apache-virtualhost/120507#120507Here are the rules to redirect a www URL to no-www:Here are the rules to redirect a no-www URL to www:Note that I used NE flag to prevent apache from escaping the query string. Without this flag, apache will change the requested URL http://www.example.com/?foo%20bar to http://www.example.com/?foo%2250barThe RewriteCond captures everything in the HTTP_HOST variable after the "www." and saves it in %1. The RewriteRule captures the URL (sans leading "/") and saves it in $1.Try this:If the host starts with www, we stick the whole host onto the start of the URL, then take off the "www."There can be a lot of misinformation out there about htaccess redirects, I find.  First off, make sure your site is running on Unix using Apache and not on a Windows host if you expect this code to work.  (Make sure there are no line spaces between each line of text, though; I have added an extra space between lines so it renders okay in this window.)This is one snippet of code that can be used to direct the www version of your site to the http:// version.  There are other similar codes that can be used, too.Complete Generic WWW handler, http/httpsI didn\'t see a complete answer. I use this to handle WWW inclusion.Please let me know how this works or if I left a loophole.For subfolderFor those that need to able to access the entire site WITHOUT the \'www\' prefix.Mare sure you add this to the following filewww to non www with httpsI am not sure why u want to remove www.\nBut reverse version would be:And advantage of this script is: \nif u have something like test.whattimein.com or any other (enviroments for developing/testing) \nit wont redirect U to the original enviroment.I used the above rule to fwd www to no www and it works fine for the homepage, however on the internal pages they are forwarding to /index.phpI found this other rule in my .htaccess file which is causing this but not sure what to do about it. Any suggestions would be great: The only way I got it to work...If you are forcing www. in url or forcing ssl prototcol, then try to use possible variations in htaccess file, such as:If you want to remove www on both http and https , use the following :This redirects \nNon ssltoAnd\nSSLtoon apache 2.4.* you can accomplish this  using a Redirect with if directive,This is updated to work on Apache 2.4:The only change vs Michael\'s is to remove the [NC], which produces the "AH00665" error:NoCase option for non-regex pattern \'-f\' is not supported and will be ignoredThe selected answer and many other solutions here dropped the the part of the url after /, so basically it always redirected to main domain, at least for me..
