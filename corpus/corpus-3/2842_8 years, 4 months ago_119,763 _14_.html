All of the Func delegates return a value. What are the .NET delegates that can be used with methods that return void?All Func delegates return something; all the Action delegates return void.Func<TResult> takes no arguments and returns TResult:Action<T> takes one argument and does not return a value:Action is the simplest, \'bare\' delegate:There\'s also Func<TArg1, TResult> and Action<TArg1, TArg2> (and others up to four arguments). All of these (except for Action<T>) are new to .NET 3.5 (defined in System.Core).... takes no arguments and has a void return type?I believe Action is a solution to this.All of the Func delegates take at least one parameterThat\'s not true.  They all take at least one type argument, but that argument determines the return type. So Func<T> accepts no parameters and returns a value.  Use Action or Action<T> when you don\'t want to return a value.Try System.Func<T> and System.ActionOccasionally you will want to write a delegate for event handling, in which case you can take advantage of System.EvenHandler<T> which implicitly accepts an argument of type object in addition to the second parameter that should derive from EventArgs. EventHandlers will return voidI personally found this useful during testing for creating a one-off callback in a function body.
