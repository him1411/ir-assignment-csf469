I have a DataFrames from pandas:Output:Now I want to iterate over the rows of the above frame. For every row I want to be able to access its elements (values in cells) by the name of the columns. So, for example, I would like to have something like that:Is it possible to do that in pandas?I found similar question. But it does not give me the answer I need. For example, it is suggested there to use:orBut I do not understand what the row object is and how I can work with it.iterrows is a generator which yield both index and rowWhile iterrows() is a good option, sometimes itertuples() can be much faster:To iterate through DataFrame\'s row in pandas way one can use:DataFrame.iterrows()DataFrame.itertuples()itertuples() is supposed to be faster than iterrows()But be aware, according to the docs (pandas 0.19.1 at the moment):Because iterrows returns a Series for each row, it does not preserve dtypes across the rows (dtypes are preserved across columns for DataFrames)\n  *iterrows: Do not modify rowsYou should never modify something you are iterating over. This is not guaranteed to work in all cases. Depending on the data types, the iterator returns a copy and not a view, and writing to it will have no effect.Use DataFrame.apply() instead:itertuples: The column names will be renamed to positional names if they are invalid Python identifiers, repeated, or start with an underscore. With a large number of columns (>255), regular tuples are returned.You can also use df.apply() to iterate over rows and access multiple columns for a function.docs: DataFrame.apply()You can use the df.iloc function as follows:To loop all rows in a dataframe you can use:Use itertuples(). It is faster than iterrows():Using iterrows which return a generator that iterates over the rows of the framefor more detail on iterrows
