The contents of file.txt are:Where 5 3 is a coordinate pair.\nHow do I process this data line by line in C++?I am able to get the first line, but how do I get the next line of the file?First, make an ifstream:The two standard methods are:Assume that every line consists of two numbers and read token by token:Line-based parsing, using string streams:You shouldn\'t mix (1) and (2), since the token-based parsing doesn\'t gobble up newlines, so you may end up with spurious empty lines if you use getline() after token-based extraction got you to the end of a line already.Use ifstream to read data from a file:If you really need to read line by line, then do this:But you probably just need to extract coordinate pairs:Update:In your code you use ofstream myfile;, however the o in ofstream stands for output. If you want to read from the file (input) use ifstream. If you want to both read and write use fstream.Since your coordinates belong together as pairs, why not write a struct for them?Then you can write an overloaded extraction operator for istreams:And then you can read a file of coordinates straight into a vector like this:Expanding on the accepted answer, if the input is:you will still be able to apply the same logic, like this:with command line arguments:
