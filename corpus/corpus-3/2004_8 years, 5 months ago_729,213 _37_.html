What\'s the easiest way to add an option to a dropdown using jQuery? Will this work?Personally, I prefer this syntax for appending options:If you\'re adding options from a collection of items, you can do the following:I agree Ashish, this did NOT work in IE8 (yet did in FF):This DID work:You can add option using following syntax, Also you can visit to way handle option in jQuery for more details.$(\'select\').append($(\'\', {value:1, text:\'One\'}));$(\'select\').append(\'One\');var option = new Option(text, value); $(\'select\').append($(option));If the option name or value is dynamic, you won\'t want to have to worry about escaping special characters in it; in this you might prefer simple DOM methods:You can try this-Like this-Or try this-Like this-for whatever reason doing $("#myselect").append(new Option("text", "text")); isn\'t working for me in IE7+I had to use $("#myselect").html("<option value=\'text\'>text</option>");That works well. If adding more than one option element, I\'d recommend performing the append once as opposed to performing an append on each element.To help performance you should try to only alter the DOM once, even more so if you are adding many options. I like to use non jquery approach:If you want the option to be selected, it is just as simple as:Not mentioned in any answer but useful is the case where you want that option to be also selected, you can add:You can add options dynamically into dropdown as shown in below example. Here in this example I have taken array data and binded those array value to dropdown as shown in output screenshotOutput:You can append and set the Value attribute with text:If you want to insert the new option at a specific index in the select:This will insert the "New Item" as the 3rd item in the select.We found some problem when you append option and use jquery validate.\nYou must click one item in select multiple list.\nYou will add this code to handle:if u have optgroup inside select, u got error in DOM.I think a best way:U can try below code to append to option
