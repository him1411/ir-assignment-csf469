Is it possible I make a simple query to count how many records I have in a determined period of time like a Year, month or day, having a TIMESTAMP field, like: Or even:To have a monthly statistic. Thanks!Check out the date and time functions in MySQL.Note (primarily, to potential downvoters). Presently, this may not be as efficient as other suggestions. Still, I leave it as an alternative, and a one, too, that can serve in seeing how faster other solutions are. (For you can\'t really tell fast from slow until you see the difference.) Also, as time goes on, changes could be made to MySQL\'s engine with regard to optimisation so as to make this solution, at some (perhaps, not so distant) point in future, to become quite comparable in efficiency with most others.I tried using the \'WHERE\' statement above, I thought its correct since nobody corrected it but I was wrong; after some searches I found out that this is the right formula for the WHERE statement so the code becomes like this:try this oneEXTRACT(unit FROM date) function is better as less grouping is used and the function return a number value.Comparison condition when grouping will be faster than DATE_FORMAT function (which return a string value). Try using function|field that return non-string value for SQL comparison condition (WHERE, HAVING, ORDER BY, GROUP BY).If your search is over several years, and you still want to group monthly, I suggest:version #1:version #2 (more efficient):I compared these versions on a big table with 1,357,918 rows (innodb),\nand the 2nd version appears to have better results.version1 (average of 10 executes):  1.404 seconds \nversion2 (average of 10 executes):  0.780 seconds (SQL_NO_CACHE key added to prevent MySQL from CACHING to queries.)If you want to group by date in MySQL then use the code below:Hope this saves some time for the ones who are going to find this thread. If you want to filter records for a particular year (e.g. 2000) then optimize the WHERE clause like this:Instead of:The results were generated against a table containing 300k rows and index on date column.As for the GROUP BY clause, I tested the three variants against the above mentioned table; here are the results:The last one is the winner.If you want to get a monthly statistics with row counts per month of each year ordered by latest month, then try this:The following query worked for me in Oracle Database 12c Release 12.1.0.1.0You can do this simply Mysql DATE_FORMAT() function in GROUP BY. You may want to add an extra column for added clarity in some cases such as where records span several years then same month occurs in different years.Here so many option you can customize this. Please read this befor starting. Hope it should be very helpful for you. Here is sample query for your understandingI prefer to optimize the one year group selection like so:This way you can just bind the year in once, e.g. \'2009\', with a named parameter and don\'t need to worry about adding \'-01-01\' or passing in \'2010\' separately.Also, as presumably we are just counting rows and id is never NULL, I prefer COUNT(*) to COUNT(id).Complete and simple solution with similarly performing yet shorter and more flexible alternative currently active:.... group by to_char(date, \'YYYY\') --> 1989.... group by to_char(date,\'MM\')     -->05.... group by to_char(date,\'DD\')   --->23.... group by to_char(date,\'MON\')  --->MAY.... group by to_char(date,\'YY\')   --->89
