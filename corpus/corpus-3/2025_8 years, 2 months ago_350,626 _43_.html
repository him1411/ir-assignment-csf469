In JavaScript, I\'ve created an object like so:Is it possible to add further properties to this object after it\'s initial creation if the properties name is not determined until run time? i.e.Yes.Yes it is possible. Assuming:Either:orThe first method is preferred. eval() has the obvious security concerns if you\'re using values supplied by the user so don\'t use it if you can avoid it but it\'s worth knowing it exists and what it can do.You can reference this with:ororI know that the question is answered perfectly, but I also found another way to add new properties and wanted to share it with you:You can use the function Object.defineProperty() Found on Mozilla Developer NetworkExample:ES6 for the win!A mix of string interpolation and the new dynamic property syntax.Here, using your notation:in addition to all the previous answers, and in case you\'re wondering how we\'re going to write dynamic property names in the Future using Computed Property Names ( ECMAScript 6 ), here\'s how:reference: Understanding ECMAScript 6 - Nickolas ZakasYou can add as many more properties as you like simply by using the dot notation:or:for dynamic keys.Just an addition to abeing\'s answer above. You can define a function to encapsulate the complexity of defineProperty as mentioned below.reference: http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#constructorpatternjavascriptYou can add properties dynamically using some of the options below:In you example:You can define a property with a dynamic value in the next two ways:orEven more..if your key is also dynamic you can define using the Object class with:where data is your object, key is the variable to store the key name and value is the variable to store the value.I hope this helps!The simplest and most portable way is.Based on #abeing answer!Here\'s how I solved the problem.Generates the following object:A nice way to access from dynamic string names that contain objects (for example object.subobject.property)Example:eval works for read value, but write value is a bit harder.A more advanced version (Create subclasses if they dont exists, and allows objects instead of global variables)Example:This is the same that o.object.subobject.propertyDefinitely.  Think of it as a dictionary or associative array.  You can add to it at any point.
