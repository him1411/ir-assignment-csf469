I\'ve spent a few months trying to grasp the concepts behind WCF and recently I\'ve developed my first WCF service application.\nI\'ve struggled quite a bit to understand all the settings in the config file.\nI am not convinced about the environment but it seems that you can do amazing stuff with it.\nThe other day I\'ve found out that Microsoft has come out with a new thing called ASP.NET Web API.\nFor what I can read it\'s a RESTful framework, very easy to use and implement.\nNow, I am trying to figure out what are the main differences between the 2 frameworks and if I should try and convert my old WCF service application with the new API.Could someone, please, help me to understand the differences and usage of each?The new ASP.NET Web API is a continuation of the previous WCF Web API project (although some of the concepts have changed).WCF was originally created to enable SOAP-based services. For simpler RESTful or RPCish services (think clients like jQuery) ASP.NET Web API should be good choice.For us, WCF is used for SOAP and Web API for REST. I wish Web API supported SOAP too. We are not using advanced features of WCF. Here is comparison from MSDN:ASP.net Web API is all about HTTP and REST based GET,POST,PUT,DELETE with well know ASP.net MVC style of programming and JSON returnable; web API is for all the light weight process and pure HTTP based components. For one to go ahead with WCF even for simple or simplest single web service it will bring all the extra baggage. For light weight simple service for ajax or dynamic calls always WebApi just solves the need. This neatly complements or helps in parallel to the ASP.net MVC.Check out the podcast : Hanselminutes Podcast 264 - This is not your father\'s WCF - All about the WebAPI with Glenn Block by Scott Hanselman for more information.In the scenarios listed below you should go for WCF:  WEB API is a framework for developing RESTful/HTTP services.There are so many clients that do not understand SOAP like Browsers, HTML5, in those cases WEB APIs are a good choice.  HTTP services header specifies how to secure service, how to cache the information, type of the message body and HTTP body can specify any type of content like HTML not just XML as SOAP services.WCF will give you so much of out the box, it\'s not even comparable to anything. Unless you want to do on your own implementation of (to name a few) authentication, authorization, encryption, queuing, throttling, reliable messaging, logging, sessions and so on. WCF is not [only] web services; WCF is a development platform for SOA.Since using both till now, I found many differnce between WCF and WEB Api.Both technologies stack suited well in different- differet scenario.So It is not possible to say which is more better, this depends on configuration and scenario.Note: The data is not only my view this is also collected from other official website.Business speaking, WebApi lacks of a WSDL, so the developers should document all manually.  And if, for example, the WebApi operation returns a list of objects then, the client should creates the objects manually, i.e. WebAPI is really prone to errors of definitions.The pro of Webapi is its more lightweight than WCF.There is a comparison on MSDN about thisWCF and ASP.NET Web APIFor me, the choice was about Who the clients are, and where are they located?Within the company Network and .NET based clients : Use WCF with TCP binding (Fast communication than HTTP)Outside the company Network, and use diverse technologies like PHP, Python etc: Use Web API with RESTRegarding the statement "WebApi lacks of WSDL" there are several ways to generate Rest client.  One popular approach is Swagger UI / (Swashbukkle Nuget).  This gives a rich interface to understand the REST end point\'s input and output schema and online tool to test the end points.JSON LD (Json Linked Documents) is another emerging standard which will further improve the JSON based REST developer experience by exposing the JSON schema with better semantics.With wcf we can configure and expose the same service support for multiple endpoints like tcp, http.if you want your service to be only  http based then it will be better to go with web API. Web API has very less configuration when compared to wcf and is bit faster than wcf. Wcf also supports restful services. If you have limitation of .Net framework 3.5 then your option is wcf.
