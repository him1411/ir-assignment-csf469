Is there a way to edit the log message of a certain revision in Subversion? I accidentally wrote the wrong filename in my commit message which could be confusing later.I\'ve seen How do I edit an incorrect commit message in Git?, but the solution to that question doesn\'t seem to be similar for Subversion (according to svn help commit).Essentially you have to have admin rights (directly or indirectly) to the repository to do this.  You can either configure the repository to allow all users to do this, or you can modify the log message directly on the server. See this part of the Subversion FAQ (emphasis mine):Log messages are kept in the\n  repository as properties attached to\n  each revision. By default, the log\n  message property (svn:log) cannot be\n  edited once it is committed. That is\n  because changes to revision properties\n  (of which svn:log is one) cause the\n  property\'s previous value to be\n  permanently discarded, and Subversion\n  tries to prevent you from doing this\n  accidentally. However, there are a\n  couple of ways to get Subversion to\n  change a revision property.The first way is for the repository\n  administrator to enable revision\n  property modifications. This is done\n  by creating a hook called\n  "pre-revprop-change" (see this section\n  in the Subversion book for more\n  details about how to do this). The\n  "pre-revprop-change" hook has access\n  to the old log message before it is\n  changed, so it can preserve it in some\n  way (for example, by sending an\n  email). Once revision property\n  modifications are enabled, you can\n  change a revision\'s log message by\n  passing the --revprop switch to svn\n  propedit or svn propset, like either\n  one of these:where N\n  is the revision number whose log\n  message you wish to change, and URL is\n  the location of the repository. If you\n  run this command from within a working\n  copy, you can leave off the URL.The second way of changing a log\n  message is to use svnadmin setlog.\n  This must be done by referring to the\n  repository\'s location on the\n  filesystem. You cannot modify a remote\n  repository using this command.where REPOS_PATH is the repository\n  location, N is the revision number\n  whose log message you wish to change,\n  and FILE is a file containing the new\n  log message. If the\n  "pre-revprop-change" hook is not in\n  place (or you want to bypass the hook\n  script for some reason), you can also\n  use the --bypass-hooks option.\n  However, if you decide to use this\n  option, be very careful. You may be\n  bypassing such things as email\n  notifications of the change, or backup\n  systems that keep track of revision\n  properties.When you run this command, and just in case you see this message:DAV request failed; it\'s possible that\n  the repository\'s pre-revprop-change\n  hook either failed or is non-existentIts because Subversion doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow you to modify log messages because they are unversioned and will be lost permanently.Go to the hooks directory on your Subversion server (replace ~/svn/reponame with the directory of your repository)Remove the extensionMake it executable (cannot do chmod +x!)SourceHere\'s a handy variation that I don\'t see mentioned in the faq. You can return the current message for editing by specifying a text editor.I was recently tasked with this as well.We wanted to allow our programmers to modify only their own commit messages, and restrict how far back they are allowed to do so. We decided they would be allowed to modify any log messages committed that day, to fix typo\'s etc.After looking at a couple other examples online I hacked this together, we are in a windows environment, so this is our contents of pre-revprop-change.bat:Edit: Original idea for this came from this thread:If you are using an IDE like eclipse, you can use this easy way.In that right click on the revision id for your commit and select \'Set commit properties\'.You can modify the message as you want from here.On Windows, using Tortoise SVN client:If it doesn\'t work it might because of the way SVN on server is setup, read other responses here.If your repository enables setting revision properties via the pre-revprop-change hook you can change log messages much easier.Or in TortoiseSVN, AnkhSVN and probably many other subversion clients by right clicking on a log entry and then \'change log message\'.The Subversion FAQ covers this, but uses a bunch of confusing undefined terms like REPOS_PATH without giving any actual examples.It might take a few tries to get it to work, so save your updated commit message in a file. Unlike with svn-commit.tmp files, Subversion won\xe2\x80\x99t preserve your typing if there\xe2\x80\x99s a problem.In your working directory, runsvn propedit -r N --revprop svn:logto edit the commit message. If that works, great! But it probably won\xe2\x80\x99t, because the svn:log revision property is unversioned and Subversion by default will stop you from overwriting it, either with the hook script pre-revprop-change, or an error message that you don\xe2\x80\x99t have such a hook.To change the hooks, you need access to the filesystem on which the repository is hosted. svn info will tell you the Repository Root. Suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s ~/svnrepo.Otherwise, on\nWindows, create a blank file called pre-revprop-change.bat. Here\xe2\x80\x99s one way to do that:Otherwise, on Unix, runIn the working copy, run svn propedit -r N --revprop svn:log again
