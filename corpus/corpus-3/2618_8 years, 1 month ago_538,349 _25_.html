I have some XML text that I wish to render in an HTML page. This text contains an ampersand, which I want to render in its entity representation: &amp;.How do I escape this ampersand in the source XML? I tried &amp;, but this is decoded as the actual ampersand character (&), which is invalid in HTML.So I want to escape it in such a way that it will be rendered as &amp; in the web page that uses the XML output. When your XML contains &amp;amp;, this will result in the text &amp;.When you use that in HTML, that will be rendered as &.As per \xc2\xa72.4 of the XML 1.0 spec, you should be able to use &amp;.I tried &amp; but this isn\'t allowed.Are you sure it isn\'t a different issue? XML explicitly defines this as the way to escape ampersands.The \'&\' character is itself an escape character in XML so the   solution is to concatenate it and a Unicode decimal equivalent for   \'&\' thus ensuring that there are no XML parsing errors. That is,   replace the character \'&\' with \'&#038;\'.CDATA tags?&amp; should work just fine, Wikipedia has a List of predefined entities in XML.In my case I had to change it to %26.I needed to escape & in a URL. So &amp; did not work out for me. \nThe urlencode function changes & to %26. This way neither XML nor the browser URL mechanism complained about the URL.I have tried &amp, but it didn\'t work. Based on Wim ten Brink\'s answer I tried &amp;amp and it worked. One of my fellow developers suggested me to use &#x26; and that worked regardless of how many times it may be rendered.How about using the unicode \\u0026?  Works for me in my android XML files.  If problems arise, someone let me know.<xsl:text disable-output-escaping="yes">&amp;&nbsp;</xsl:text> will do the trick.&amp; is the way to represent an ampersand in most sections of an XML document.If you want to have XML displayed within HTML, you need to first create properly encoded XML (which involves changing & to &amp;) and then use that to create properly encoded HTML (which involves again changing & to &amp;). That results in:For a more thorough explanation of XML encoding, see:What characters do I need to escape in XML documents?Consider if your XML looks like below.You cannot use the <> directly as it throws an error. In that case, you can use &#60;&#62; in replacement of that.Click here to see all the codes.A related issue is how to encode XML element content when such content contains an ampersand -- if the XML is part of a URI submitted with a GET action.  (Leaving aside the wisdom of such an API -- it was something I had to deal with today.)  I tried everything mentioned above, and the only thing that actually worked was %26amp; The %26 was needed to URL-encode the first character in the XML-encoding for ampersand.  The amp; following the %26 was needed because the XML portion of the URI was being loaded into an XML document server-side.  So in this fun scenario, it was necessary to staple both encoding methodologies together.
