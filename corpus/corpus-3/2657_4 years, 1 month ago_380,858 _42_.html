When using angular 1.2 instead of 1.07 the following piece of code is not valid anymore, why?the issue is in the injector configuration part (app.config):If I remember correctly this issue started with angular 1.1.6.The problem was caused by missing inclusion of ngRoute module. Since version 1.1.6 it\'s a separate part:my error disappeared by adding this \'()\' at the endOne more thing to add to the list as this is the first result that comes up with a google search of \'Error: [$injector:modulerr] angular\':If you have a mismatch between your app name in your \'index\'html\' and in your main javascript app definition this can also generate this error.For example if your HTML looks like this:And your JavaScript looks like this (i.e has a typo on app name - myWebCite instead of myWebSite):then the \'Error:[$injector:modulerr] angular\' error will be generated also.A noob error can be forgetting to include the module js files in the index.html at allIf you have this error in console ([$injector:nomod], MINERR_ASSET:22), make sure you are not including your application code before loading AngularJSI was doing that and once I fixed the order, the error went away.For those using frameworks that compress, bundle, and minify files, make sure you define each dependency explicitly as these frameworks tend to rename your variables. That happened to me while using ASP.NET BundleConfig.cs to bundle my app scripts together.BeforeAfterRead more here about Angular Dependency Annotation.I have just experienced the same error, in my case it was caused by the second parameter in angular.module being missing- hopefully this may help someone with the same issue.angular.module(\'MyApp\');angular.module(\'MyApp\', []);I had the same problem and tried all possible solution. But finally I came to know from the documentation that ngRoute module is now separated. Have a look to this linkSolution:\nAdd the cdn angular-route.js after angular.min.js scriptBesides below answer, if you have this error in console ([$injector:nomod], MINERR_ASSET:22), but everything seems to work fine, make sure that you don\'t have duplicate includes in your index.html. Because this error can also be raised if you have duplicate includes of the files, that use this module, and are included before the file with actual module declaration.Another trigger for this error is leaving the "." out before your "otherwise" or any other route in your route definition:Mortified by a full-stop, yet again. Gotta love JS!If you go through the official tutorial of angularjs https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_07Note: Starting with AngularJS version 1.2, ngRoute is in its own\n  module and must be loaded by loading the additional angular-route.js\n  file, which we download via Bower above.Also please note from ngRoute api https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngRouteInstallation First include angular-route.js in your HTML:  You can\n  download this file from the following places:Google CDN e.g.\n  //ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/X.Y.Z/angular-route.js Bower\n  e.g. bower install angular-route@X.Y.Z code.angularjs.org e.g.\n  "//code.angularjs.org/X.Y.Z/angular-route.js" where X.Y.Z is the\n  AngularJS version you are running.Then load the module in your application by adding it as a dependent\n  module:angular.module(\'app\', [\'ngRoute\']); With that you\'re ready to get\n  started!John Papa provided my issue on this rather obscure comment: Sometimes when you get that error, it means you are missing a file. Other times it means the module was defined after it was used. One way to solve this easily is to name the module files *.module.js and load those first.My problem was in the config.xml. Changing:tofixed it.Its an injector error. You may have use lots of JavaScript files so the injector may be missing. Some are here: Please check the injector you need to insert in your app.js
