What is the difference among col-lg-* , col-md-* and col-sm-* in Twitter Bootstrap 3?The Bootstrap 3 grid comes in 4 tiers (or "breakpoints")...These grid sizes enable you to control grid behavior on different widths. The different tiers are controlled by CSS media queries.So in Bootstrap\'s 12-column grid...col-sm-3 is 3 of 12 columns wide (25%) on a typical small device width (> 768 pixels)col-md-3 is 3 of 12 columns wide (25%) on a typical medium device width (> 992 pixels)The smallest tier you set (xs, sm or md) also defines the size for larger screen widths. So, for the same size column on all tiers, just set the width for the smallest viewport...<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-3">..</div> is the same as,<div class="col-sm-3">..</div>Because col-sm-3 means 3 units on sm and up, unless specifically overridden by a larger tier.xs(default) > overridden by sm > overridden by md > overridden by lgCombine the classes to use change column widths on different grid sizes. This creates a responsive layout.<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6">..</div>The sm, md and lg grids will all "stack" vertically on screens/viewports less than 768 pixels. This is where the xs grid fits in. Columns that use the col-xs-* classes will not stack vertically, and continue to scale down on the smallest screens.Resize your browser using this demo and you\'ll see the grid scaling effects.Update for Bootstrap 4 there is a new -xl- size, see this demo. Also the -xs- infix has been removed, so smallest columns are simply col-1, col-2.. col-12, etc.. Bootstrap 4 Beta Grid DemoAlso, this article explains more about the Bootstrap gridThe bootstrap docs do explain it, but it still took me a while to get it. It makes more sense when I explain it to myself in one of two ways:If you think of the columns starting out horizontally, then you can choose when you want them to stack.For example, if you start with columns:\nA   B   CYou decide when should they stack to be like this:ABCIf you choose col-lg, then the columns will stack when the width is < 1200px.If you choose col-md, then the columns will stack when the width is < 992px.If you choose col-sm, then the columns will stack when the width is < 768px.If you choose col-xs, then the columns will never stack.On the other hand, if you think of the columns starting out stacked, then you can choose at what point they become horizontal:If you choose col-sm, then the columns will become horizontal when the width is >= 768px.If you choose col-md, then the columns will become horizontal when the width is >= 992px.If you choose col-lg, then the columns will become horizontal when the width is >= 1200px.From Twitter Bootstrap documentation:I think the confusing aspect of this is the fact that BootStrap 3 is a mobile first responsive system and fails to explain how this affects the col-xx-n hierarchy in that part of the Bootstrap documentation. \nThis makes you wonder what happens on smaller devices if you choose a value for larger devices and makes you wonder if there is a need to specify multiple values. (You don\'t)I would attempt to clarify this by stating that...\nLower grain types (xs, sm) attempt retain layout appearance on smaller screens and larger types (md,lg) will display correctly only on larger screens but will wrap columns on smaller devices. \nThe values quoted in previous examples refer to the threshold as which bootstrap degrades the appearance to fit the available screen estate.What this means in practice is that if you make the columns col-xs-n then they will retain correct appearance even on very small screens, until the window drops to a size that is so restrictive that the page cannot be displayed correctly. \nThis should mean that devices that have a width of 768px or less should show your table as you designed it rather than in degraded (single or wrapped column form). \nObviously this still depends on the content of the columns and that\'s the whole point. If the page attempts to display multiple columns of large data, side by side on a small screen then the columns will naturally wrap in a horrible way if you did not account for it. Therefore, depending on the data within the columns you can decide the point at which the layout is sacificed to display the content adequately.e.g. If your page contains three col-sm-n columns bootstrap would wrap the columns into rows when the page width drops below 992px. \nThis means that the data is still visible but will require vertical scrolling to view it. If you do not want your layout to degrade, choose xs (as long as your data can be adequately displayed on a lower resolution device in three columns)If the horizontal position of the data is important then you should try to choose lower granularity values to retain the visual nature. If the position is less important but the page must be visible on all devices then a higher value should be used.If you choose col-lg-n then the columns will display correctly until the screen width drops below the xs threshold of 1200px.Device Sizes and class prefix:Grid options:Reference: Grid System
