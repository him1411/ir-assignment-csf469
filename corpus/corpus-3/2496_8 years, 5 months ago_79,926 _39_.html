I have a file a xyz.cpp. I want to open two instances of a this file in Visual studio (btw I am using 2005). Why would I want to do so? I want to compare two sections of the same file side by side. I know workarounds such as:Make a copy of the file. But the problem is that its not elegant and I dont want to  make copies everytime I faced with this. I can split the window into two. The problem with split it than I can split it horizontally only. The result of horizontal split is that right half my screen is white space. If I were able to split it vertically or open two instances of the same file, it would increase the number of lines of code I can compare. Here\'s how to do it ...Select the tab you want two copies ofSelect Window > New Window from the menu.    If New Window is not listed in the Window menu note that the command does exist, even as of Visual Studio 2017. Add it to the Window menu using Tools > Customize > Commands. At that point decide where to put the New Windowcommand and select Add Command.For Visual Basic, HTML and JScript and RDL Expression, the Window > New Window option mentioned in PaulB\'s answer is disabled.\nHowever an option can be changed in the Registry to enable the menu item.All other languages do not restrict to a single code window so you can use PaulB\'s answer without editing the registry.Enabling New Window in Windows Registry.[1] [2]Go to the following registry key. This example is for Basic (Visual Basic), but the key is also there for HTML, JScript and RDL Expression.Find the value Single Code Window Only and do one of the following:This will enable the "New Window" menu item, but it may still not be visible in the menu.  Adding Menu ItemTo actually see the New Window menu item I had to add it back into the menu:Restoring Registry Value\nCopy-paste this to notepad, save as a .reg file and import the file into your registry to restore the initial setting.Open the file (it you are using multiple tab groups, make sure your file is selected).Menu: Window --> Split\n(alternately, there\'s this tiny nub just above the editor\'s vertical scroll bar - grab it and drag down)This gives you two (horizontal) views of the same file. \nBeware that any edit-actions will reflect on both views.Once you are done, grab the splitter and drag it up all the way (or Menu: Window --> Remove Split)you can use the Windows \xe2\x80\x93> New Window option to duplicate the current window. - See more at: http://www.sadev.co.za/content/why-i-visual-studio-2010-undock-windows#sthash.UTUQg8au.dpufLuke\'s answer above didn\'t work for me, the \'New Window\' command was already listed in the customize settings but not showing up in .js tabs context menu, despite deleting the registry setting. So I used:Tools Cutomize... Keyboard... Scroll down to select Window.NewWindow    and I pressed and assigned the shortcut keys Ctrl+Shift+WThat worked for me.==== EDIT ====Well \'worked\' was too strong. My keyboard shortcut does indeed open another tab on the same JavaScript file, but rather unhelpfully it does not render the contents, it is just an empty white window! You may have better luck.Window menu, New Horizontal/Vertical Tab Group there will do, I think.For file types, where the same file can\'t be opened in a vertical tab group (for example .vb files) you canIf you save to disk in one instance though, you\'ll have to reload the file when you switch to the other. Also if you make edits in both instances, you\'ll have to resolve on the second save. Visual Studio prompts you in both cases with various options. You\'ll simplify your life a bit if you edit in only the one instance.When working with Visual Studio 2013 and VB I found that you can quite easily customize the menu and add the "New Window" command - no need to mess with the registry! God only knows why MS chose not to include the command for some languages...?I don\'t have a copy of VS 2005, but this process works on VS 2008:You should now have 2 instances of file in separate vertical tab groups.For newer versions (Such as VS 2017)
