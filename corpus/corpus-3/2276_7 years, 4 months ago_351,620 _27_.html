I am trying to return two values in JavaScript. Is that possible?  No, but you could return an array containing your values:Then you can access them like so:If you want to put "labels" on each of the returned values (easier to maintain), you can return an object:And to access them:You can\'t do this with standard Javascript (meaning \xe2\x80\x94 neither with ECMAScript 3rd nor 5th editions). However, Javascript 1.7 \xe2\x80\x94 language extension present in some implementations (e.g. Mozilla) \xe2\x80\x94 has so-called "destructuring assignments".(Note that this does not work, as of October 2014, in some browsers, such as Chrome or Opera. See compatibility table here.)It allows you to assign to 1+ variables simultaneously:And by the way, don\'t be fooled by the fact that ECMAScript allows you to return 1, 2, .... What really happens there is not what might seem. An expression in return statement \xe2\x80\x94 1, 2, 3 \xe2\x80\x94 is nothing but a comma operator applied to numeric literals (1 , 2, and 3) sequentially, which eventually evaluates to the value of its last expression \xe2\x80\x94 3. That\'s why return 1, 2, 3 is functionally identical to nothing more but return 3.Just return an object literal Ecmascript 6 includes "destructuring assignments" (as kangax mentioned) so in all browsers (not just Firefox) you\'ll be able to capture an array of values without having to make a named array or object for the sole purpose of capturing them.You can try it out in Firefox already!Another worth to mention newly introduced (ES6) syntax is use of object creation shorthand in addition to destructing assignment.This syntax can be polyfilled with babel or other js polyfiller for older browsers but fortunately now works natively with the recent versions of Chrome and Firefox.But as making a new object, memory allocation (and eventual gc load) are involved here, don\'t expect much performance from it. JavaScript is not best language for developing highly optimal things anyways but if that is needed, you can consider putting your result on surrounding object or such techniques which are usually common performance tricks between JavaScript, Java and other languages.Best way for this isThen usereturn 4in ES6 you can use this codeOther than returning an array or an object as others have recommended, you can also use a collector function (similar to the one found in The Little Schemer):I made a jsperf test to see which one of the three methods is faster. Array is fastest and collector is slowest.http://jsperf.com/returning-multiple-values-2You can also do:In JS, we can easily return a tuple with an array or object, but do not forget! =>  JS is a callback oriented language, and there is a little secret here for "returning multiple values" that nobody has yet mentioned, try this:becomes:)bam! This is simply another way of solving your problem.
