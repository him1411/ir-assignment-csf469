Is there a portable way to get the current user\'s username in Python (i.e., one that works under both Linux and Windows, at least).  It would work like os.getuid:I googled around and was surprised not to find a definitive answer (although perhaps I was just googling poorly).  The pwd module provides a relatively easy way to achieve this under, say, Linux, but it is not present on Windows.  Some of the search results suggested that getting the username under Windows can be complicated in certain circumstances (e.g., running as a Windows service), although I haven\'t verified that.Look at getpass moduleAvailability: Unix, Windowsp.s. Per comment below "this function looks at the values of various environment variables to determine the user name. Therefore, this function should not be relied on for access control purposes (or possibly any other purpose, since it allows any user to impersonate any other)."You best bet would be to combine os.getuid() with pwd.getpwuid():Refer to the pwd docs for more details:http://docs.python.org/library/pwd.htmlYou can also use:You can probably use:But it\'s not going to be safe because environment variables can be changed.These might work.  I don\'t know how they behave when running as a service.  They aren\'t portable, but that\'s what "os.name" and "if" statements are for.win32api.GetUserName()win32api.GetUserNameEx(...) See:\nhttp://timgolden.me.uk/python/win32_how_do_i/get-the-owner-of-a-file.htmlIf you are needing this to get user\'s home dir, below could be considered as portable (win32 and linux at least), part of a standard library.Also you could parse such string to get only last path component (ie. user name).See: os.path.expanduserTo me using os module looks the best for portability: Works best on both Linux and Windows.Output:Windows:User\'s home Dir: C:\\Users\\myuserusername: myuserLinux:User\'s home Dir: /rootusername: rootNo need of installing any modules or extensions. Combined pwd and getpass approach, based on other answers:For UNIX, at least, this works...edit:\nI just looked it up and this works on Windows and UNIX:On UNIX it returns your username, but on Windows, it returns your user\'s group, slash, your username.--I.E.UNIX returns: "username"Windows returns: "domain/username"--It\'s interesting, but probably not ideal unless you are doing something in the the terminal anyway... in which case you would probably be using os.system to begin with. For example, a while ago I needed to add my user to a group, so I did (this is in Linux, mind you)I feel like that is easier to read and you don\'t have to import pwd or getpass.I also feel like having "domain/user" could be helpful in certain applications in Windows.I wrote the plx module some time ago to get the user name in a portable way on Unix and Windows (among other things):\nhttp://www.decalage.info/en/python/plxUsage:(it requires win32 extensions on Windows)You can get the current username on Windows by going through the Windows API, although it\'s a bit cumbersome to invoke via the ctypes FFI (GetCurrentProcess \xe2\x86\x92 OpenProcessToken \xe2\x86\x92 GetTokenInformation \xe2\x86\x92 LookupAccountSid).I wrote a small module that can do this straight from Python, getuser.py. Usage:It works on both Windows and *nix (the latter uses the pwd module as described in the other answers).
