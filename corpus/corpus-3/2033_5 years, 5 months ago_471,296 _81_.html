I\'m new to GitHub. Today I met some issue when I was trying to push my code to GitHub.I have not pushed anything in the repository yet, so why do I need to pull something?If you do not wish to merge the remote branch into your local branch (see differences with git diff), and want to do a force push, use the push command with -fwhere origin is the name of your remote repo.Usually, the command refuses to update a remote ref that is not an ancestor of the local ref used to overwrite it. This flag disables the check. This can cause the remote repository to lose commits; use it with care.As the message tells you,Merge the remote changes (e.g. \'git pull\')Use git pull to pull the latest changes from the remote repository to your local repository. In this case, pulling changes will require a merge because you have made changes to your local repository. I\'ll provide an example and a picture to explain. Let\'s assume your last pull from origin/branch was at Commit B. You have completed and committed some work (Commit C). At the same time, someone else has completed their work and pushed it to origin/branch (Commit D). There will need to be a merge between these two branches.Because you are the one that wants to push, Git forces you to perform the merge. To do so, you must first pull the changes from origin/branch.After completing the merge, you will now be allowed to fast-forward origin/branch to Commit E by pushing your changes.         Git requires that you handle merges yourself, because a merge may lead to conflicts.Have you updated your code before pushing?Use git pull origin master before you push anything.I assume that you are using origin as a name for your remote.You need to pull before push, to make your local repository up-to-date before you push something (just in case someone else has already updated code on github.com). This helps in resolving conflicts locally. This normally happens when you git commit and try to git push changes before git pulling on that branch x where someone else has already made changes.The normal flow would be as below, STEP 1: git stash your local uncommitted changes on that branch.STEP 2: git pull origin branch_name -v to pull and merge to locally committed changes on that branch (give this merge some message, and fix conflicts if any.)STEP 3: git stash pop the stashed changes (Then you can make commits on popped files if you want or push already committed changes (STEP4) first and make new commit to files later.) STEP 4: git push origin branch_name -v the merged changes.Replace branch_name with master (for master branch).Sometimes we forgot the pulling and did lots of works in the local environment.If someone want to push without pull,is working. This is not recommended when working with other people, but when your work is a simple thing or a personal toy project, it will be a quick solution.Some of you may be getting this error because Git doesn\'t know which branch you\'re trying to push.If your error message also includesthen you may want to follow the handy tips from Jim Kubicek, Configure Git to Only Push Current Branch, to set the default branch to current.I mentioned this in my tutorial, How To Use GitHub: A tutorial for beginners.When you create a new repository on GitHub, GitHub may ask you to create a readme file. If you create a readme file directly on GitHub, then you will need to first make a \xe2\x80\x98pull\xe2\x80\x99 request before the \xe2\x80\x98push\xe2\x80\x99 request will be successful.\nThese commands will \xe2\x80\x98pull\xe2\x80\x99 the remote repository, merge it with your current files, and then \xe2\x80\x98push\xe2\x80\x99 all the files back to GitHub:In addition to the answers above, the following worked for me : -Scenario -Solution -I had a similar issue and it turned out that my workflow for keeping my branch up to date was at fault. I was doing the following:In my local \'master\'then back in my local branchThis worked well for a previous git flow but not with github. The git rebase was the problem here causing issues with syncing (and I\'ll admit that\'s something I\'ve had to accept without fully understanding) and unfortunately put me in a position where git push -f became probably the easiest option. Not good.My new flow is to update the branch directly using git merge as follows:In my local branchNo fast forward, as I will have made changes of course in the local branch.As you can probably tell, I\'m no git expert but I\'m reliably informed that this workflow will probably avoid the specific problems that I had.Just had the same issue but in my case I had typed the wrong branch on the remote.  So, it seems that is another source of this issue... double check you\'re pushing to the correct branch.I experienced the very same problem and it turned out I was on a different (local) branch than I thought I was AND the correct local branch was behind in commits from remote.My solution: checkout the correct branch, cherry-pick the commit from the other local branch, git pull and git pushI was getting a similar error while pushing the latest changes to a bare Git repository which I use for gitweb. In my case I didn\'t make any changes in the bare repository, so I simply deleted my bare repository and cloned again:I was getting the above mentioned error message when I tried to push my current branch foobar:It turns out I had two local branches tracking the same remote branch:It worked for me to push my current branch by using:... and to cleanup with git branch -dI have resolve this issue at my GIT repository. No need to rebase or force commit in this case. Use below steps to resolve this -hope it will help.In my case, I had "mybranch" checked out, and had done git pull, so I couldn\'t figure out why the push wasn\'t working. Eventually, I realized that I was pushing the wrong branch. I was typing git push origin master instead of git push origin mybranch.So if you\'ve already done git pull and still getting this message, make sure you\'re pushing the correct branch.Another solution is to advance the head of the remote by making another commit if you can. After you pull this advanced head into the local subtree then you will be able to push from it again. If no, you should checkout a new branch with the same name as the remote branch and try push it again.If you`re not in test branch, first switch to it.Then open a new branch and name it testing.Now, it`s time to push it:If you are certain that no one made changes to your git repository and that you are working on the latest version, git pull doesn\'t make sense as a solution in your heart...Then this is probably what happened, you used git commit --amendIt lets you combine staged changes with the previous commit instead of committing it as an entirely new snapshot. It can also be used to simply edit the previous commit message without changing its snapshot.ATLASSIAN tutorial: rewriting historyHowever, it is not recommended to perform git commit --amend if you have already pushed the commit to GitHub, this is because "amending doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just alter the most recent commit\xe2\x80\x94it replaces it entirely. To Git, it will look like a brand new commit" which means to other developer on your GitHub, history looks like A->B->C but to you it looks like A->B->D, if GitHub let you push, everyone else will have to manually fix their historyThis is the reason why you get the error message ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward), if you know that no one has pulled your latest change, you can do git push --force, this will alter the git history in your public repo. Otherwise...you can perform git pull, but I believe this will have the same result as you didn\'t go through git commit --amend,it will create a new commit (ie: git history after git pull: A->B->C->D)for more detail: How to change your latest commitgit push -f origin branchnameUse the above command only if you are sure that you don\'t need remote branch code otherwise do merge first and then push the codeProvided that nobody else is working with a branch, my guess is that you did the following:The step 4. is the cause of your problem, imho...Another cause of this problem (apparently not so common)...My server was behind ~12 hours when I did a pushI configured NTP on the server SYNC my clock. I executed a new git push which led the error discussed in this post.If you don\'t want to pull into your current project (and potentially face merge conflicts you don\'t care to solve) and you don\'t want to create another branch (This will be tedious to manage another branch), and you don\'t want to do any risky and permanent git force commands (which even after reading what they do I\'m often surprised about the implications of doing it).  Solution: You could simply, drag your folder\'s contents into another folder, pull the project into your now empty folder, drag the pulled contents to the trash, then drag your correct project back into the folder.  You should be able to push properly and get the desired results.  It literally takes me less than 10 seconds to do this.To the people that would tell me this is not proper without citing any consequences, or people telling me to use a command that causes me future annoyances, I say: "This method literally takes me less than 10 seconds."  If I encounter a git command that takes less than 10 seconds to implement and has the exact same effect, I will adopt that.  Until then, I\'m using this method. One downside of this method is that your commit history will appear linear when you actually merged in a branch without the merge being documented.  This might not be the best method when working with groups.  Work on branches in those cases!I was also getting the same error, and am not 100% sure if this works for all, but, for me, worked. The [.] did make some difference in my case.
