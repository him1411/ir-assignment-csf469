During git rebase origin/development following error message is shown from git:My git version is 2.9.0. Used to work fine in previous version. How can I continue this rebase allowing unrelated histories with the forced flag introduced in new release?The default behavior has changed since git 2.9:"git merge" used to allow merging two branches that have no common\n     base by default, which led to a brand new history of an existing\n     project created and then get pulled by an unsuspecting maintainer,\n     which allowed an unnecessary parallel history merged into the\n     existing project. The command has been taught not to allow this by\n     default, with an escape hatch --allow-unrelated-histories option\n     to be used in a rare event that merges histories of two projects\n     that started their lives independently.See the git release changelog for more information.You can use --allow-unrelated-histories to force the merge to happen.In my case, error was just fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories on every especially first pull request after remotely adding a git repo.Using --allow-unrelated-histories flag worked with pull request in this way:git pull origin branchname --allow-unrelated-historiesI got this error when I set up a local repository first. Then went to github and created a new repository. Then I ranWhen I tried to push/pull, I got the same fatal: unrelated_histories error.\nHere is how I fixed it:Try git pull --rebase developmentIf you try to push some code to your remote repository on github,when you pull the remote repository and here happen what you encounter.It just because megering your local repository and the remote repository is unallowed by default.You can try to write git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories to fix this problem.Hope to help you!I struggled with this as well but managed to find a workaround.When you run into the error above just cherry-pick the merge commit and then continue the rebase:One thing I want to add here, I was trying to push the commits of an old repo to a newly created one when I got the same error. I got around it. If the new repo has anyfile having same name as the old one, then u will get the error as me. I had same file named README.md in both the repos. Here is what I got the error while running git pull --rebase developmentAfter fixing the merge conflict mannually and commiting the changes, when I ran this git rebase --continue, I got:Then I ran git rebase --skip to move forward and again got the same error of merge conflict  for the README.md. For each time I commited to the README.md I got this error and each I time I had to remove the conflict manually, commit the changes and then run, git rebase --continue and git rebase --skip. Since, in my case the README.md was not that much updated, I got around with this. A quick workaroud would have been to rename all the colliding name files of new repo to something else and then run git pull --rebase development.
