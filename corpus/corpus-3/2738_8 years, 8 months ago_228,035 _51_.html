I want to output two different views (one as a string that will be sent as an email), and the other the page displayed to a user.Is this possible in ASP.NET MVC beta?I\'ve tried multiple examples:1. RenderPartial to String in ASP.NET MVC BetaIf I use this example, I receive the "Cannot redirect after HTTP\n  headers have been sent.".2. MVC Framework: Capturing the output of a viewIf I use this, I seem to be unable to do a redirectToAction, as it\n  tries to render a view that may not exist. If I do return the view, it\n  is completely messed up and doesn\'t look right at all.Does anyone have any ideas/solutions to these issues i have, or have any suggestions for better ones?Many thanks!Below is an example. What I\'m trying to do is create the GetViewForEmail method:Accepted answer from Tim Scott (changed and formatted a little by me):Example usageAssuming a call from the controller to get the order confirmation email, passing the Site.Master location.Here\'s what I came up with, and it\'s working for me. I added the following method(s) to my controller base class. (You can always make these static methods somewhere else that accept a controller as a parameter I suppose)MVC2 .ascx styleRazor .cshtml styleEdit: added Razor code.This answer is not on my way . This is originally from https://stackoverflow.com/a/2759898/2318354  but here I have show the way to use it with "Static" Keyword to make it common for all Controllers .For that you have to make static class in class file . (Suppose your Class File Name is Utils.cs )This example is For Razor.Utils.csNow you can call this class from your controller by adding NameSpace in your Controller File as following way by passing "this" as parameter to Controller.I hope this will be useful to you make code clean and neat.This works for me:I found a new solution that renders a view to string without having to mess with the Response stream of the current HttpContext (which doesn\'t allow you to change the response\'s ContentType or other headers).Basically, all you do is create a fake HttpContext for the view to render itself:This works on ASP.NET MVC 1.0, together with ContentResult, JsonResult, etc. (changing Headers on the original HttpResponse doesn\'t throw the "Server cannot set content type after HTTP headers have been sent" exception).Update: in ASP.NET MVC 2.0 RC, the code changes a bit because we have to pass in the StringWriter used to write the view into the ViewContext:This article describes how to render a View to a string in different scenarios:The solution/code is provided as a class called ViewRenderer. It is part of Rick Stahl\'s WestwindToolkit at GitHub.Usage (3. - WebAPI example):If you want to forgo MVC entirely, thereby avoiding all the HttpContext mess...This uses the awesome open source Razor Engine here:\nhttps://github.com/Antaris/RazorEngineI am using MVC 1.0 RTM and none of the above solutions worked for me.  But this one did:I saw an implementation for MVC 3 and Razor from another website, it worked for me:More on Razor render- MVC3 View Render to Stringyou are get the view in string using this wayWe are call this method in two way I met the same problem with creating report. After trying all above solution, I met some exception related to the HTTP header. It does not allow me to redirect to action or return any ActionResult later. However, I found another way to solve.\nPlease go to this article on my blog:\nhttp://trandangkhoa.blogspot.com/2009/05/asp-net-mvc-print-excel-file-using-aspx.htmlThe idea is very simple: using HttpClient to get HTML content from the view:Quick tipFor a strongly typed Model just add it to the ViewData.Model property before passing to RenderViewToString. e.gI would create a new View class deriving from the original view and overriding the ouput method. To repeat from a more unknown question, take a look at MvcIntegrationTestFramework.It makes saves you writing your own helpers to stream result and is proven to work well enough.  I\'d assume this would be in a test project and as a bonus you would have the other testing capabilities once you\'ve got this setup.  Main bother would probably be sorting out the dependency chain.Here is a class I wrote to do this for ASP.NETCore RC2. I use it so I can generate html email using Razor.I found a better way to render razor view page when I got error with the methods above, this solution for both web form environment and mvc environment.\nNo controller is needed.Here is the code example, in this example I simulated a mvc action with an async http handler:To render a view to a string in the Service Layer without having to pass ControllerContext around, there is a good Rick Strahl article here http://www.codemag.com/Article/1312081 that creates a generic controller. Code summary below:Then to render the View in the Service class:
