I\'m trying to use the Mongoid / Devise Rails 3.1 template (Mongoid and Devise), and I keep getting an error stating ExecJS cannot find a JavaScript runtime.  Fair enough when I didn\'t have any installed, but I\'ve tried installing Node.js, Mustang and the Ruby Racer, but nothing is working. I could not find a JavaScript runtime. See sstephenson/ExecJS (GitHub) for a list of available runtimes (ExecJS::RuntimeUnavailable).What do I need to do to get this working?I\'m on Ubuntu 11.04 and had similar issues. Installing Node.js fixed it.As of Ubuntu 13.04 x64 you only need to run:This will solve the problem.Just add ExecJS and the Ruby Racer in your gem file and run bundle install after.                 Everything should be fine after.In your Gem file, writeand then runEverything works fine for me :)I had a similar problem: my Rails 3.1 app worked fine on Windows but got the same error as the OP when running on Linux.  The fix that worked for me on both platforms was to add the following to my Gemfile:The trick is knowing that :platforms => :ruby actually means only use this gem with "C Ruby (MRI) or Rubinius, but NOT Windows."Other possible values for :platforms are described in the bundler man page.FYI: Windows has a builtin JavaScript engine which execjs can locate.  On Linux there is not a builtin although there are several available that one can install.  therubyracer is one of them.  Others are listed in the execjs README.md.Adding the following gem to my Gemfile solved the issue:Then bundle your new dependencies:An alternative way is to just bundle without the gem group that contains the things you don\'t have.So do:you don\'t have to modify the Gemfile at all, providing of course you are not doing asset chain stuff - which usually applies in non-development environments.  Bundle will remember your \'--without\' setting in the .bundle/config file.   Add following gems in your gem fileand runyou are done :)I used to add the Ruby Racer to the Gem file to fix it. But hey, Node.js works!Don\'t Use RubyRacer as it is bad on memory. installing Node.js as suggested by some people here is a better idea.This list of available runtimes that can be used by ExecJs Library also documents the use of Node.jshttps://github.com/sstephenson/execjs\\So, Node.js is not an overkill, and much better solution than using the rubyracer.FYI, this fixed the problem for me... it\'s a pathing problem:\nhttp://forums.freebsd.org/showthread.php?t=35539For amazon linux(AMI):I started getting this problem when I started using rbenv with Ruby 1.9.3 where as my system ruby is 1.8.7. The gem is installed in both places but for some reason the rails script didn\'t pick it up. But adding the "execjs" and "therubyracer" to the Gemfile did the trick.In your gem file\nUncomment this line.19 # gem \'therubyracer\', platforms: :rubyAnd run\nbundle installYou are ready to work. :)I had this same error but only on my staging server not my production environment.  nodejs was already installed on both environments.By typing:I found out that the node command was located in: /usr/bin/node on production \nbut: /usr/local/bin/node in staging.After creating a symlink on staging i.e. :the application then worked in staging. No muss no fuss.
