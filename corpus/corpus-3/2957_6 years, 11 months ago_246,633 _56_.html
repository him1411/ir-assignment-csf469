I added a table that I thought I was going to need, but now no longer plan on using it. How should I remove that table?I\'ve already run migrations, so the table is in my database. I figure rails generate migration should be able to handle this, but I haven\'t figured out how yet.I\'ve tried:\nrails generate migration drop_tablename,\nbut that just generated an empty migration.What is the "official" way to drop a table in Rails?You won\'t always be able to simply generate the migration to already have the code you want. You can create an empty migration and then populate it with the code you need.You can find information about how to accomplish different tasks in a migration here:http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Migration.htmlMore specifically, you can see how to drop a table using the following approach:First generate an empty migration with any name you\'d like. It\'s important to do it this way since it creates the appropriate date.This will generate a .rb file in /db/migrate/ like 20111015185025_drop_products_table.rbNow edit that file to look like this:The only thing I added was drop_table :products and raise ActiveRecord::IrreversibleMigration.Then run rake db:migrate and it\'ll drop the table for you.Write your migration manually. E.g. run rails g migration DropUsers.As for the code of the migration I\'m just gonna quote Maxwell Holder\'s post Rails Migration ChecklistWhile the answers provided here work properly, I wanted something a bit more \'straightforward\', I found it here: link\nFirst enter rails console:Then just type:Where :users is the table name. And done, worked for me!You need to to create a new migration file using following commandand write drop_table code in newly generated migration file (db/migration/xxxxxxx_drop_table_xyz) likeOr if you wanted to drop table without migration, simply open rails console byand execute following commandor you can use more simplified commandI think, to be completely "official", you would need to create a new migration, and put drop_table in self.up. The self.down method should then contain all the code to recreate the table in full. Presumably that code could just be taken from schema.rb at the time you create the migration.It seems a little odd, to put in code to create a table you know you aren\'t going to need anymore, but that would keep all the migration code complete and "official", right?I just did this for a table I needed to drop, but honestly didn\'t test the "down" and not sure why I would.Open you rails consoleyou can simply drop a table from rails console.\nfirst open the consolethen paste this command in consolereplace table_name with the table you want to delete.you can also drop table directly from the terminal. just enter in the root directory of your application and run this commandActiveRecord::Base.connection.drop_table :table_nameRun this command:-$ rails g migration drop_table_namethen:$ rake db:migrateor if you are using MySql database then:This is not best solution so far, if you are not in an early stage of development.Development ENV. You can delete migrated file from (db/migrate/name_of_migrated_file).You can roll back a migration the way it is in the guide:http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html#reverting-previous-migrationsGenerate a migration:Write the migration:This way you can also rollback and can use to revert any migrationThe simple and official way would be this:Now go to your db/migrate and look for your file which contains the drop_tablename as the filename and edit it to this.Then you need to runon your console.I needed to delete our migration scripts along with the tables themselves ...from terminal window run:orthe best way you can do is then  do the followingRunWhere <version> is the version number of your migration file you want to revert.Example:-
