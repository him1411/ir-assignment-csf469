I can now import these two files into another database for testing purposes without having to worry about manipulating 9GB of data or running out of disk space.for multiple databases:Another example for ignoring multiple tablesusing --ignore-table and create an array of tables, with syntaxs like database.tableLinks with information that will help youcompress output mysqldumpNote: tested in ubuntu server with mysql Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.5.55To exclude some table data, but not the table structure.
