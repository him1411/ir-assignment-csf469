I want to calculate/store some statistics information using JavaScript, the equivalent code in C# is below (features I need are -- key-value pair, string/int key value pair, manipulate values by keys, etc.), any ideas how to implement the same function in JavaScript? Looks like there is no built-in Dictionary or Hashtable?Use JavaScript objects as associative arrays.Associative Array: In simple words associative arrays use Strings instead of Integer numbers as index.Create an object with Javascript allows you to add properties to objects by using the following syntax:An alternate syntax for the same is:If you can also create key to value object maps with the following syntaxYou can iterate through an associative array using the for..in loop construct as followsIf you are coming from an object-oriented language you should check this article.Unless you have a specific reason not to, just use a normal object. Object properties in Javascript can be referenced using hashtable-style syntax:Both foo and bar elements can now then be referenced as:Of course this does mean your keys have to be strings.  If they\'re not strings they are converted internally to strings, so it may still work, YMMV.All modern browsers support a javascript Map object. There are a couple of reasons that make using a Map better than Object:Example:If you want keys that are not referenced from other objects to be garbage collected, consider using a WeakMap instead of a Map.Since every object in JS behaves like - and is generally implemented as - a hashtable, i just go with that...If you require your keys to be be any object rather than just strings then you could use my jshashtable.so in C# the code looks like:or in JavaScript C# dictionary object contains useful methods like dictionary.ContainsKey()\nin JavaScript we could use the hasOwnProperty likehttps://gist.github.com/alexhawkins/f6329420f40e5cafa0a4
