i.e. delete all the files it created and roll back any changes made? Not necessarily to the db, but more to the config files.E.g. automatically deleting all the resource mappings for the model/controller deleted in the routes.rb file and everywhere else that changes might have been made?Thanks.Rails 3.2 adds a new d shortcut to the command, so now you can write:It\'s worth mentioning the -p flag here (p for pretend). If you add this to the command it will simply do a "test" run and show you what files will be deleted without actually deleting them.If you\'re happy with it, run the command again without the -p flag.rails destroy controller Controller_name was returning a bunch of errors. To be able to destroy controller I had to remove related routes in routes.rb. P.S. I\'m using rails 3.1Are you using version control (subversion, git, whatever)? Just revert. If not - why not?!!This is prototype to generate or destroy a controller or model in rails.for example, if you need to generate User Controller orif want destroy User controller or revert to above action\nthen orYou could use rails d model/controller/migration ... to destroy or remove the changes generated by using the rails generate command.Example: rails g model Home name:string creates a model named home with attribute name. To remove the files and code generated from that command we can use the command rails d model Home.To delete the controller manually, in case the rails d controller command does not work:For controller welcomeYou can undo a rails generate in following ways:If you use rails, use rails d controller Usersand if you use zeus, use zeus d controller Users. On the other hand, if you are using git or SVN, revert your changes with the commit number. This is much faster.To reverse that, we just destroy it. Open Terminal application and go to project directory. Then, type this:Where CamelCase is a name of any model or controller.\nIt will remove model,migration and some of related test files. (You can see result on Terminal after you have run the command.) you can revert your rails g/generate controller/model/migration xxx output by using:All generations of rails have a destroy of them, so , if you create by generator a (for example) scaffold named "tasks", to destroy all the changes of that ganerate you will have to type:Hope it helps you.Before reverting rails generate please make sure rollback migration firstCase1: if you want to revert scaffold then run this command -rails destroy scaffold MODEL_NAMECase2: if you want to revert model then run this command -rails destroy model MODEL_NAMEcase3: if you want to revert controller then run this command -rails destroy controller CONTROLLER_NAMENote: you can also use shortcut d instead of destroyRemoved scaffolding for selected model
