When someone says "edit your .plist file" or "your .profile" or ".bash_profile" etc, this just confuses me. I have no idea where these files are, how to create them if I have to do that, etc, and also why there seem to be so many different ones (why? Do they do different things?)So could someone please explain very patiently to a previous Windows user (wanting desperately to become more familiar with the pleasant if initially somewhat confusing OS X world) how to do this step by step?I need the variables to be set both for GUI applications and command line applications, and at the moment it\'s for an ant script that needs the variables, but there will most likely be other needs as well.Please note that I have Lion too, since many of the answers you get Googling seem to be outdated for Lion...Also note that I have practically zero experience using the Terminal. I\'m willing to learn, but please explain for a novice...First, one thing to recognize about OS X is that it is built on Unix. This is where the .bash_profile comes in. When you start the Terminal app in OS X you get a bash shell by default. The bash shell comes from Unix and when it loads it runs the .bash_profile script. You can modify this script for your user to change your settings. This file is located at:Update for MavericksOS X Mavericks does not use the environment.plist - at least not for OS X windows applications. You can use the launchd configuration for windowed applications. The .bash_profile is still supported since that is part of the bash shell used in Terminal.Lion and Mountain Lion OnlyOS X windowed applications receive environment variables from the your environment.plist file. This is likely what you mean by the ".plist" file. This file is located at:If you make a change to your environment.plist file then OS X windows applications, including the Terminal app, will have those environment variables set. Any environment variable you set in your .bash_profile will only affect your bash shells.Generally I only set variables in my .bash_profile file and don\'t change the .plist file (or launchd file on Mavericks). Most OS X windowed applications don\'t need any custom environment. Only when an application actually needs a specific environment variable do I change the environment.plist (or launchd file on Mavericks).It sounds like what you want is to change the environment.plist file, rather than the .bash_profile.One last thing, if you look for those files, I think you will not find them. If I recall correctly, they were not on my initial install of Lion.Edit: Here are some instructions for creating a plist file.To edit the file, you can Control-click to get a menu and select Add Row. You then can add a key value pair. For environment variables, the key is the environment variable name and the value is the actual value for that environment variable.Once the plist file is created you can open it with Xcode to modify it anytime you wish.Your ".profile" or ".bash_profile" are simply files that are present in your "home" folder.  If you open a Finder window and click your account name in the Favorites pane ... you won\'t see them.  If you open a Terminal window and type "ls" to list files ... you still won\'t see them.  But you can find them by using "ls -a" in the terminal.  Or if you open your favorite text editor (say TextEdit since it comes with OS X) and do File->Open and then press Command+Shift+. and click on your account name (home folder) you will see them as well.  If you do not see them, then you can simply create one in your favorite text editor.Now, adding environment variables is fairly straightforward and remarkably similar to windows conceptually.  In your .profile just add, one per line, the variable name and its value as follows:etc.If you are modifying your "PATH" variable, be sure to include the system\'s default PATH that was already set for you:Now here is the quirky part, you can either open a new Terminal window to have the new variables take effect, or you will need to type ". .profile" or ". .bash_profile" to reload the file and have the contents be applied to your current Terminal\'s environment.You can check that your changes took effect using the "set" command in your Terminal.  Just type "set" (or "set | more" if you prefer a paginated list) and be sure what you added to the file is there.As for adding environment variables to GUI apps, that is normally not necessary and I\'d like to hear more about what you are specifically trying to do to better give you an answer for it.Here\'s a bit more information specifically regarding the PATH variable in Lion OS 10.7.x:If you need to set the PATH globally, the PATH is built by the system in the following order:These paths and variables are inherited by all users and applications, so they are truly global -- logging out and in will not reset these paths -- they\'re built for the system and are created before any user is given the opportunity to login, so changes to these require a system restart to take effect. BTW, a clean install of OS 10.7.x Lion doesn\'t have an environment.plist that I can find, so it may work but may also be deprecated.it prints current path valueThen do vim ~/.bash_profile and writehere you are appending to the old path, so preserves the old path and adds your new path to itthen do this will execute it and add the paththen again check withUnfortunately none of these answers solved the specific problem I had. Here\'s a simple solution without having to mess with bash. In my case, it was getting gradle to work (for Android Studio). Btw, These steps relate to OSX (Mountain Lion 10.8.5)Run the following command:sudo nano /etc/paths (or sudo vim /etc/paths for vim)Open a new terminal window then type:echo $PATHYou should see the new path appended to the end of the PATHI got these details from this post:http://architectryan.com/2012/10/02/add-to-the-path-on-mac-os-x-mountain-lion/#.UkED3rxPp3QI hope that can help someone elseThis post/question is kind of old, so I will answer a simplified version for OS X Lion users.\nBy default, OSX Lion does not have any of the following files:At most, if you\'ve done anything in the terminal you might see ~/.bash_historyYou must create the file to set your default bash commands (commonly in ~/.bashrc).  To do this, use any sort of editor, though it\'s more simple to do it within the terminal:The next time you quit and reload the terminal, it should load all your bash preferences.  For good measure, it\'s usually a good idea to separate your commands into useful file names.  For instance, from within ~/.bashrc, you should have a source ~/.bash_aliases and put all your alias commands in ~/.bash_aliases.What worked for me is to create a .launchd.conf with the variables I needed:This file is read by launchd at login. You can add a variable \'on the fly\' to the running launchd using:In fact, .launchd.cond simply contains launchctl commands.Variables set this way seem to be present in GUI applications properly.If you happen to be trying to set your LANG or LC_ variables in this way, and you happen to be using iTerm2, make sure you disable the \'Set locale variables automatically\' setting under the Terminal tab of the Profile you\'re using. That seems to override launchd\'s environment variables, and in my case was setting a broken LC_CTYPE causing issues on remote servers (which got passed the variable).(The environment.plist still seems to work on my Lion though. You can use the RCenvironment preference pane to maintain the file instead of manually editing it or required Xcode. Still seems to work on Lion, though it\'s last update is from the Snow Leopard era. Makes it my personally preferred method.)Open the Terminal program (this is in your Applications/Utilites folder by default).\nRun the following commandThis will open the file in the your default text editor.For ANDROID SDK as example :You need to add the path to your Android SDK platform-tools and tools directory. In my example I will use "/Development/android-sdk-macosx" as the directory the SDK is installed in. Add the following line:Save the file and quit the text editor.\nExecute your .bash_profile to update your PATH.Now everytime you open the Terminal program you PATH will included the Android SDK.This was pretty straight forward and worked for me, in terminal:A similar response was here: http://www.mac-forums.com/forums/os-x-operating-system/255324-problems-setting-path-variable-lion.html#post1317516I had problem with Eclipse (started as GUI, not from script) on Maverics that it did not take custom PATH. I tried all the methods mentioned above to no avail. Finally I found the simplest working answer based on hints from here:Go to /Applications/eclipse/Eclipse.app/Contents folderEdit Info.plist file with text editor (or XCode), add LSEnvironment dictionary for environment variable with full path. Note that it includes also /usr/bin etc:Reload parameters for app withRestart EclipseOpen Terminal:Apply changing to system (no need restart computer):(Also work with macOS Sierra 10.12.1)I took the idiot route.\nAdded these to the end of /etc/profilecreated a folder /etc/environments\ncreate a file in it called "oracle" or "whatever" and added the stuff I needed set globally to it./etc$ cat /etc/environments.d/OracleMore detail, which may perhaps be helpful to someone:Due to my own explorations, I now know how to set environment variables in 7 of 8 different ways.  I was trying to get an envar through to an application I\'m developing under Xcode. I set "tracer" envars using these different methods to tell me which ones get it into the scope of my application. From the below, you can see that editing the "scheme" in Xcode to add arguments works, as does "putenv". What didn\'t set it in that scope: ~/.MACOS/environment.plist, app-specific plist, .profile, and adding a build phase to run a custom script (I found another way in Xcode [at least] to set one but forgot what I called the tracer and can\'t find it now; maybe it\'s on another machine....)GPU_DUMP_DEVICE_KERNEL is 3GPU_DUMP_TRK_ENVPLIST is (null)GPU_DUMP_TRK_APPPLIST is (null)GPU_DUMP_TRK_DOTPROFILE is (null)GPU_DUMP_TRK_RUNSCRIPT is (null)GPU_DUMP_TRK_SCHARGS is 1GPU_DUMP_TRK_PUTENV is 1... on the other hand, if I go into Terminal and say "set", it seems the only one it gets is the one from .profile (I would have thought it would pick up environment.plist also, and I\'m sure once I did see a second tracer envar in Terminal, so something\'s probably gone wonky since then.  Long day....)Let me illustrate you from my personal example in a very redundant way. Sometimes macOS or Linux automatically sets up environment variable for you unlike Windows. But that\'s not the case always. So let\'s check it. \n\nThe line immediately after echo $JAVA_HOME would be empty if the environment variable is not set. It must be empty in your case. Now we need to check if we have bash_profile file. \n\nYou saw that in my case we already have bash_profile. If not we have to create a bash_profile file. Create a bash_profile file. \nCheck again to make sure bash_profile file is there. \nNow let\'s open bash_profile file. macOS opens it using it\'s default TextEdit program.\nThis is the file where environment variables are kept. If you have opened a new bash_profile file, it must be empty. In my case, it was already set for python programming language and Anaconda distribution. Now, i need to add environment variable for Java which is just adding the first line. YOU MUST TYPE the first line VERBATIM. JUST the first line. Save and close the TextEdit. Then close the terminal. \nOpen the terminal again. Let\'s check if the environment variable is set up. \n
