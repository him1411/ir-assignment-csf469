I\'m running 32 bit ActiveState 5.14.2 on Windows 7.  I wanted to mess around with a git pre-commit hook to detect programs being checked in with syntax errors.  (Somehow I just managed to do such a bad commit.)  So as a test program I randomly jotted this:However, it compiles and executes with no warnings, errorlevel is zero on exit.  How is this valid syntax?Perl has a syntax called "indirect method notation". It allowsto be written asSo that meansis the same asorNot only is it valid syntax, it doesn\'t result in a run-time error because the first thing executed is exit(0).I don\'t know why, but this is what Perl makes of it:It seems that the parser thinks you\'re calling the method Syntax on the error-object... Strange indeed!The reason you do not get an error is that the first executed code is Because you did not have a semicolon on the first line:The compiler will guess (incorrectly) that this is a subroutine call with a not operator ! thrown in. It will then execute the arguments to this subroutine, which happens to be exit(0), at which point the program exits and sets errorlevel to 0. Nothing else is executed, so no more runtime errors are reported.You will notice that if you change exit(0) to something like print "Hello world!" you do get an error:and your error level will be set:As noted above this is caused by the indirect method calling notation.  You can warn on this:Produces:This requires the indirect CPAN module.You can also use no indirect "fatal"; to cause the program to die (this is what I do)Try Perl 6, it seems to fulfill your expectations more readily:
