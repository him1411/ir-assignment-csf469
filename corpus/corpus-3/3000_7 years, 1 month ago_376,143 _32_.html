Does anyone know if it\'s possible to take a screenshot using Selenium WebDriver? (Note: Not Selenium RC)Yes, it is possible. The following example is in Java:Each WebDriver has a .save_screenshot(filename) method.  So for Firefox, it can be used like this:Confusingly, a .get_screenshot_as_file(filename) method also exists that does the same thing.There are also methods for: .get_screenshot_as_base64() (for embedding in html) and .get_screenshot_as_png()(for retrieving binary data).and Note that WebElements have a .screenshot() method that works similarly, but only captures the selected element.more file types and options are available and you can see them in takes_screenshot.rbI got this issue resolved. You can augment the RemoteWebDriver to give it all of the interfaces its proxied driver implements: Uses PHPUnit_Selenium extension version 1.2.7:I used this method for taking screen shot.You may use this method wherever required.You can capture the image from windows using python web driver. Use the code below which page need to capture the screenshotSeems to be missing here - taking screenshot of a specific element in Java:I could not get the accepted answer to work, but as per the current WebDriver documentation, the following worked fine for me with Java 7 on OS X 10.9:Other drivers...Requires NuGetPackages:Tested with .NETFramework v4.5.2It will save screenshot in same directory where script is saved.You can give a try to AShot API. Here\'s the github link for the same. https://github.com/yandex-qatools/ashotSome of the tests here... https://github.com/yandex-qatools/ashot/tree/master/src/test/java/ru/yandex/qatools/elementscompare/testsUsing these two methods you can take a screen shot with the date and time as well.Using RemoteWebDriver, after augmenting the Node with screenshot capability, I would store the screenshot like so:You may use this method wherever required.   Then, I assume you can customize the style sheet of maven-surefire-report-plugin at surefire-reports/html/custom.css  so that your reports include the link to the correct screenshot for each test?Hope this solves your problemC#You can use the following code snippet/function to take screenshot with the selenium:Thought I would give my full solution since there are two different ways of getting a screen shot. One is from the local browser, and one is from the remote browser. I even embed the image into the html reportHere is how the Selenide project does it, making easier than just about any other way of doing it:For Junit:For TestNG:
