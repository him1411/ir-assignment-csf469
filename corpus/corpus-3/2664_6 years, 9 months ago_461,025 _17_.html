This question already has an answer here:In Python, the only way I can find to concatenate two lists is list.extend, which modifies the first list. Is there any concatenation function that returns its result without modifying its arguments?Yes: list1+list2. This gives a new list that is the concatenation of list1 and list2.Depending on how you\'re going to use it once it\'s created itertools.chain might be your best bet:This creates a generator for the items in the combined list, which has the advantage that no new list needs to be created, but you can still use c as though it were the concatenation of the two lists:If your lists are large and efficiency is a concern then this and other methods from the itertools module are very handy to know.Note that this example uses up the items in c, so you\'d need to reinitialise it before you can reuse it. Of course you can just use list(c) to create the full list, but that will create a new list in memory.You can also use sum, if you give it a start argument:This works in general for anything that has the + operator:With the notable exception of strings:How about list1 + list2?you could always create a new list which is a result of adding two lists.Lists are mutable sequences so I guess it makes sense to modify the original lists by extend or append.Just to let you know:When you write list1 + list2, you are calling the __add__ method of list1, which returns a new list. in this way you can also deal with myobject + list1 by adding the __add__ method to your personal class.And if you have more than two lists to concatenate:It doesn\'t actually save you any time (intermediate lists are still created) but nice if you have a variable number of lists to flatten, e.g., *args.
