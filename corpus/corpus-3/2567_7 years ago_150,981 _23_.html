I am creating a sample ASP.NET MVC 3 site using Razor as view engine. The razor syntax starts with @ character e.g. @RenderBody(). If I write @test on my cshtml page it gives me parse errorCS0103: The name \'test\' does not exist in the current contextHow do I escape \'@\' character?@@ should do it.Razor @ escape char to symbols...oruse <text></text> or the easier way @:@Html.Raw("@") seems to me to be even more reliable than @@, since not in all cases @@ will escape.Therefore:would be:Instead of HTML entity I prefer the use of @Html.Raw("@")@@ is the escape character for @ in Razor views as stated above.Razor does however try to work out when an \'@\' is just an \'@\' and where it marks C# (or VB.Net) code. One of the main uses for this is to identify email addresses within a Razor view - it should not be necessary to escape the @ character in an email address. For the question about @RazorCodePart1 @@ @RazorCodePart2, you need to the sequence:I know, it looks a bit odd, but it works and will get you the literal character \'@\' between the code blocks.I just had the same problem. I declared a variable putting my text with the @.I tried all the options above and none worked. This is what I did that worked : I created a string varible and passed all the RegEx pattern code into it, then used the variable in the html, and Razor was cool with it.this work for meOr yoy can use:\n@@Alan_van_Buuren:DYou can use @@ for this purpose.\nLike var email = firstName + \'\\@@\' + domain;
