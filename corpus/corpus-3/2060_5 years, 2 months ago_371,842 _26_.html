I made a branch called \'f\' and did a checkout to master. When I tried the git pull command I got this message:When I try the git status, it gave me the following:What should I do?OK. The problem is your previous pull failed to merge automatically and went to conflict state. And the conflict wasn\'t resolved properly before the next pull. 1) Undo the merge and pull again.To undo a merge:git merge --abort  [Since git version 1.7.4] git reset --merge  [prior git versions]2) Resolve the conflict.3) Don\'t forget to add and commit the merge.4) git pull now should work fine.If you are sure that you already resolved all merge conflicts:And error will disappear.I think it\'s worth mentioning that there are numerous scenarios in which the message You have not concluded your merge (MERGE_HEAD exists) could occur, because many people have probably arrived at this page after searching for said message.

I think DIFFMERGE is available for all environments. Instructions are here: Install DIFF Merge on a MACI have this helpful resolving my conflicts: Git Basic-Merge-ConflictsThis worked for me:
