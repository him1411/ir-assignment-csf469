How can we get the current language selected in the Android device?If you want to get the selected language of your device, this might help you:I\'ve checked the Locale methods on my Android 4.1.2 device, and the results:You can \'extract\' the language from the current locale. You can extract the locale via the standard Java API, or by using the Android Context.  For instance, the two lines below are equivalent:What worked for me was:Resource.getSystem() return a global shared Resources object that provides access to only system resources (no application resources), and is not configured for the current screen (can not use dimension units, does not change based on orientation, etc).Because getConfiguration.locale has now been deprecated, the preferred way to get the primary locale in Android Nougat is:To guarantee compatibility with the previous Android versions a possible solution would be a simple check:To save others time and/or confusion I wanted to share that I have tried the two alternatives proposed by Johan Pelgrim above and on my device they are equivalent - whether or not the default location is changed. So my device\'s default setting is English(United Kindom) and in this state as expected both Strings in Johan\'s answer give the same result.  If I then change the locale in the phone settings (say to italiano(Italia)) and re-run then both Strings in Johan\'s answer give the locale as italiano(Italia).Therefore I believe Johan\'s original post to be correct and gregm\'s comment to be incorrect.As described in Locale reference the best way to get language is:this method returns string with language id according to ISO 639-1 standartYou can use thiswhen "xx" is any language code like "en", "fr", "sp", "ar" .... and so onTo add to Johan Pelgrim\'s answerare equivalent because android.text.format.DateFormat class uses both interchangeably, e.g.andYou can try to get locale from system resources:There are two languages.Default language of OS:Current language of Application: You can use this code to find out keyboard current Answers above don\'t distinguish between simple chinese and traditinal chinese.\nLocale.getDefault().toString() works which returns "zh_CN", "zh_TW", "en_US" and etc.  References to : https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Locale.html, ISO 639-1 is OLD.If you choose a language you can\'t type this Greek may be helpful.Now try it with GreekThe correct way of getting the language of your device is the following:Hope it helps.
