Why do I get the Waiting...Fatal error: watch ENOSPC when I run the watch task ? \nHow do I solve this issue?Thanks jonshf for your comments.After doing some research found the solution. Run the below command.Any time you need to run sudo something ... to fix something, you should be pausing to think about what\'s going on. While the accepted answer here is perfectly valid, it\'s treating the symptom rather than the problem. Sorta the equivalent of buying bigger saddlebags to solve the problem of: error, cannot load more garbage onto pony. Pony has so much garbage already loaded, that pony is fainting with exhaustion.An alternative (perhaps comparable to taking excess garbage off of pony and placing in the dump), is to run:Then go congratulate yourself for making pony happy.After trying grenade\'s answer you may use a temporary fix:This does the same thing as kds\'s answer, but without persisting the changes. This is useful if the error just occurs after some uptime of your system.I ran into this error after my client PC crashed, the jest --watch command I was running on the server persisted, and I tried to run jest --watch again.The addition to /etc/sysctl.conf described in the answers above worked around this issue, but it was also important to find my old process via ps aux | grep node and kill it.
