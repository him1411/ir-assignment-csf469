When should we prefer to use YAML over JSON and vice versa, considering the following things?I was planning to use one of these two in our embedded system to store configure files.Should I use YAML or JSON to store my Perl data?Technically YAML is a superset of JSON. This means that, in theory at least, a YAML parser can understand JSON, but not necessarily the other way around. See the official specs, in the section entitled "YAML: Relation to JSON".In general, there are certain things I like about YAML that are not available in JSON. In practice neither of these last two points will likely matter for things that you or I do, but in the long term, I think YAML will be a more robust and viable data serialization format. Right now, AJAX and other web technologies tend to use JSON. YAML is currently being used more for offline data processes. For example, it is included by default in the C-based OpenCV computer vision package, whereas JSON is not. You will find C libraries for both JSON and YAML. YAML\'s libraries tend to be newer, but I have had no trouble with them in the past. See for example Yaml-cpp. Differences:Observations:This answers the title, not the details as most just read the title from a search result on google like me so I felt it was necessary to explain from a web developer perspective.JavaScript so clearly dominates the web by a huge margin and JavaScript developers prefer using JSON as the data format overwhelmingly along with popular web APIs so it becomes difficult to argue using YAML over JSON when doing web programming in the general sense as you will likely be outvoted in a team environment. In fact, the majority of web programmers aren\'t even aware YAML exists, let alone consider using it.If you are doing any web programming, JSON is the default way to go because no translation step is needed when working with JavaScript so then you must come up with a better argument to use YAML over JSON in that case.I find YAML to be easier on the eyes: less parenthesis, ""  etc.  Although there is the annoyance of tabs in YAML... but one gets the hang of it.In terms of performance/resources, I wouldn\'t expect big differences between the two.Futhermore, we are talking about configuration files and so I wouldn\'t expect a high frequency of encode/decode activity, no?If you don\'t need any features which YAML has and JSON doesn\'t, I would prefer JSON because it is very simple and is widely supported (has a lot of libraries in many languages). YAML is more complex and has less support. I don\'t think the parsing speed or memory use will be very much different, and maybe not a big part of your program\'s performance.This question is 6 years old, but strangely, none of the answers really addresses all four points (speed, memory, expressiveness, portability).Obviously this is implementation-dependent, but because JSON is so widely used, and so easy to implement, it has tended to receive greater native support, and hence speed. Considering that YAML does everything that JSON does, plus a truckload more, it\'s likely that of any comparable implementations of both, the JSON one will be quicker.However, given that a YAML file can be slightly smaller than its JSON counterpart (due to fewer " and , characters), it\'s possible that a highly optimised YAML parser might be quicker in exceptional circumstances.Basically the same argument applies. It\'s hard to see why a YAML parser would ever be more memory efficient than a JSON parser, if they\'re representing the same data structure.As noted by others, Python programmers tend towards preferring YAML, JavaScript programmers towards JSON. I\'ll make these observations:It\'s hard to imagine a modern language without a JSON library. It\'s also hard to imagine a JSON parser implementing anything less than the full spec. YAML has widespread support, but is less ubiquitous than JSON, and each parser implements a different subset. Hence YAML files are less interoperable than you might think.JSON is the winner for performance (if relevant) and interoperability. YAML is better for human-maintained files. HJSON is a decent compromise although with much reduced portability.Technically YAML offers a lot more than JSON  (YAML v1.2 is a superset of JSON):anchors and inheritance - example of 3 identical items:Most of the time people will not use those extra features and the main difference is that YAML uses indentation whilst JSON uses brackets. This makes YAML more concise and readable (for the trained eye).Which one to choose?Since this question now features prominently when searching for YAML and JSON, it\'s worth noting one rarely-cited difference between the two: license. JSON purports to have a license which JSON users must adhere to (including the legally-ambiguous "shall be used for Good, not Evil"). YAML carries no such license claim, and that might be an important difference (to your lawyer, if not to you).Sometimes you don\'t have to decide for one other the other. In Go, for example, you can have both at the same time:I find both YAML and JSON to be very effective. The only two things that really dictate when one is used over the other for me is one, what the language is used most popularly with. For example, if I\'m using Java, Javascript, I\'ll use JSON. For Java, I\'ll use their own objects, which are pretty much JSON but lacking in some features, and convert it to JSON if I need to or make it in JSON in the first place. I do that because that\'s a common thing in Java and makes it easier for other Java developers to modify my code. The second thing is whether I\'m using it for the program to remember attributes, or if the program is receiving instructions in the form of a config file, in this case I\'ll use YAML, because it\'s very easily human read, has nice looking syntax, and is very easy to modify, even if you have no idea how YAML works. Then, the program will read it and convert it to JSON, or whatever is preferred for that language.\n\nIn the end, it honestly doesn\'t matter. Both JSON and YAML are easily read by any experienced programmer.
