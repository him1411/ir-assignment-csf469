Eclipse has that "+/-" on the left to expand and collapse blocks of code.I\'ve got tens of thousands of lines to go through and would really like to just collapse everything, and selectively expand blocks to look at them.There is a hotkey, mapped by default to Ctrl+Shift+NUM_KEYPAD_DIVIDE.You can change it to something else via Window -> Preferences, search for "Keys", then for "Collapse All".To open all code blocks the shortcut is Ctrl+Shift+NUM_KEYPAD_MULTIPLY.In the Eclipse extension PyDev, close all code blocks is \nCtrl + 9To open all blocks, is Ctrl + 0In addition to the hotkey, if you right click in the gutter where you see the +/-, there is a context menu item \'Folding.\'  Opening the submenu associated with this, you can see a \'Collapse All\' item.  this will also do what you wish.A "Collapse All" command exists in recent builds (e.g. 3.2 M6) and is bound to Ctrl+Shift+NUM_KEYPAD_DIVIDE by default.You can also configure it in Preferences->Editor->Keys.The question is a bit old, but let me add a different approach.  In addition to the above hot-key approaches, there are default preference settings that can be toggled.As of Eclipse Galileo (and definitely in my Eclipse Version: Indigo Service Release 2 Build id: 20120216-1857) language specific preferences can open up new files to edit which are already collapsed or expanded.Here is a link to Eclipse Galileo online docs showing the feature for C/C++:  http://help.eclipse.org/galileo/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_c_editor_folding.htm .In my Eclipse Indigo I can open the Folding Preferences window via : menu/ Window/ Preferences/ Java/ Editor/ Folding and set all options on so I can open files by default that are completely collapsed.Right click on the +/- sign and click collapse all or expand all.Ctrl + Shift + [Divide] and Ctrl + Shift + [Multiply] works great for Aptana Studio 3.\nApart from that you can always use Window > Preferences > Editors > Foldings to enable it If you are using PyDev in Eclipse, its Ctrl+0 and Ctrl+9 for collapse all and uncollapse all respectively. Ctrl+- and Ctrl+= to collapse individual methods when your cursor is on the line of the method declaration.Just to sum up:Right click on the circles +/- sign and under Foldings select Collapse AllI had the same problem and found out Folding can be enabled or disabled, and in my case got disabled somehow.To solve it, simply right click on the line numbers/breakpoint section (vertical bar in the left of the editor), then under the \'Folding\' section chose \'Enable folding\'. ctrl + shift + numpad_Divide should be working fine after.
