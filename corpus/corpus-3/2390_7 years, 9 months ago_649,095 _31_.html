I want to read all the files in a folder through Java.Files.walk API is available from Java 8.The example uses try-with-resources pattern recommended in API guide. It ensures that no matter circumstances the stream will be closed.In Java 8 you can do thiswhich will print all files in a folder while excluding all directories. If you need a list, the following will do:If you want to return List<File> instead of List<Path> just map it:You also need to make sure to close the stream! Otherwise you might run into an exception telling you that too many files are open. Read here for more information.All of the answers on this topic that make use of the new Java 8 functions are neglecting to close the stream. The example in the accepted answer should be:From the javadoc of the Files.walk method:The returned stream encapsulates one or more DirectoryStreams. If\n  timely disposal of file system resources is required, the\n  try-with-resources construct should be used to ensure that the\n  stream\'s close method is invoked after the stream operations are completed.In Java 7 you can now do it this way - http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/dirs.html#listdirYou can also create a filter that can then be passed into the newDirectoryStream method aboveOther filtering examples - http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/dirs.html#globJust walk through all Files using Files.walkFileTree (Java 7)If you want more options, you can use this function which aims to populate an arraylist of files present in a folder. Options are : recursivility and pattern to match.Best, Adriennice usage of java.io.FileFilter as seen on https://stackoverflow.com/a/286001/146745I think this is good way to read all the files in a folder and sub folder\'sSimple example that works with Java 1.7 to recursively list files in directories specified on the command-line:list down files from Test folder present inside class pathYou can filter any textfiles or any other extension ..just replace it with .MP3While I do agree with Rich, Orian and the rest for using:for some reason all the examples here uses absolute path (i.e. all the way from root, or, say, drive letter (C:\\) for windows..)I\'d like to add that it is possible to use relative path as-well.\nSo, if you\'re pwd (current directory/folder) is folder1 and you want to parse folder1/subfolder, you simply write (in the code above instead of ):Java 8 Files.walk(..) is good when you are soore it will not throw Avoid Java 8 Files.walk(..) termination cause of ( java.nio.file.AccessDeniedException ) .Here is a safe solution , not though so elegant as Java 8Files.walk(..) :Just to expand on the accepted answer I store the filenames to an ArrayList (instead of just dumping them to System.out.println) I created a helper class "MyFileUtils" so it could be imported by other projects:I added the full path to the file name. \nYou would use it like this:The ArrayList is passed by "value", but the value is used to point to the same ArrayList object living in the JVM Heap. In this way, each recursion call adds filenames to the same ArrayList (we are NOT creating a new ArrayList on each recursive call).to prevent Nullpointerexceptions on the listFiles() function and recursivly get all files from subdirectories too..Just pass your folder it will tell you main class about the method.
