I am finding it hard to understand the process of Naive Bayes, and I was wondering if someone could explain it with a simple step by step process in English. I understand it takes comparisons by times occurred as a probability, but I have no idea how the training data is related to the actual dataset.Please give me an explanation of what role the training set plays. I am giving a very simple example for fruits here, like banana for exampleYour question as I understand is divided in two parts. One being you need more understanding for Naive Bayes classifier & second being the confusion surrounding Training set. In general all of Machine Learning Algorithms need to be trained for supervised learning tasks like classification, prediction etc. or for unsupervised learning tasks like clustering.By training it means to train them on particular inputs so that later on we may test them for unknown inputs (which they have never seen before) for which they may classify or predict etc (in case of supervised learning) based on their learning. This is what most of the Machine Learning techniques like Neural Networks, SVM, Bayesian etc. are based upon.So in a general Machine Learning project basically you have to divide your input set to a Development Set (Training Set + Dev-Test Set) & a Test Set (or Evaluation set). Remember your basic objective would be that your system learns and classifies new inputs which they have never seen before in either Dev set or test set.The test set typically has the same format as the training set. However, it is very important that the test set be distinct from the training corpus: if we simply\nreused the training set as the test set, then a model that simply memorized its input, without learning how to generalize to new examples, would receive misleadingly high scores.In general, for an example, 70% can be training set cases. Also remember to partition the original set into the training and test sets randomly.Now I come to your other question about Naive Bayes.Source for example below: http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/naive-bayes-classifierTo demonstrate the concept of Na\xc3\xafve Bayes Classification, consider the example given below:As indicated, the objects can be classified as either GREEN or RED. Our task is to classify new cases as they arrive, i.e., decide to which class label they belong, based on the currently existing objects.Since there are twice as many GREEN objects as RED, it is reasonable to believe that a new case (which hasn\'t been observed yet) is twice as likely to have membership GREEN rather than RED. In the Bayesian analysis, this belief is known as the prior probability. Prior probabilities are based on previous experience, in this case the percentage of GREEN and RED objects, and often used to predict outcomes before they actually happen.Thus, we can write:Prior Probability of GREEN: number of GREEN objects / total number of objectsPrior Probability of RED: number of RED objects / total number of objectsSince there is a total of 60 objects, 40 of which are GREEN and 20 RED, our prior probabilities for class membership are:Prior Probability for GREEN: 40 / 60Prior Probability for RED: 20 / 60Having formulated our prior probability, we are now ready to classify a new object (WHITE circle in the diagram below). Since the objects are well clustered, it is reasonable to assume that the more GREEN (or RED) objects in the vicinity of X, the more likely that the new cases belong to that particular color. To measure this likelihood, we draw a circle around X which encompasses a number (to be chosen a priori) of points irrespective of their class labels. Then we calculate the number of points in the circle belonging to each class label. From this we calculate the likelihood:From the illustration above, it is clear that Likelihood of X given GREEN is smaller than Likelihood of X given RED, since the circle encompasses 1 GREEN object and 3 RED ones. Thus:Although the prior probabilities indicate that X may belong to GREEN (given that there are twice as many GREEN compared to RED) the likelihood indicates otherwise; that the class membership of X is RED (given that there are more RED objects in the vicinity of X than GREEN). In the Bayesian analysis, the final classification is produced by combining both sources of information, i.e., the prior and the likelihood, to form a posterior probability using the so-called Bayes\' rule (named after Rev. Thomas Bayes 1702-1761).Finally, we classify X as RED since its class membership achieves the largest posterior probability.I realize that this is an old question, with an established answer. The reason I\'m posting is that is the accepted answer has many elements of k-NN (k-nearest neighbors), a different algorithm. Both k-NN and NaiveBayes are classification algorithms. Conceptually, k-NN uses the idea of "nearness" to classify new entities. In k-NN \'nearness\' is modeled with ideas such as Euclidean Distance or Cosine Distance. By contrast, in NaiveBayes, the concept of \'probability\' is used to classify new entities. Since the question is about Naive Bayes, here\'s how I\'d describe the ideas and steps to someone. I\'ll try to do it with as few equations and in plain English as much as possible.Before someone can understand and appreciate the nuances of Naive Bayes\', they need to know a couple of related concepts first, namely, the idea of Conditional Probability, and Bayes\' Rule. (If you are familiar with these concepts, skip to the section titled Getting to Naive Bayes\')Conditional Probability in plain English: What is the probability that something will happen, given that something else has already happened.Let\'s say that there is some Outcome O. And some Evidence E. From the way these probabilities are defined: The Probability of having both the Outcome O and Evidence E is:\n   (Probability of O occurring) multiplied by the (Prob of E given that O happened)One Example to understand Conditional Probability:Let say we have a collection of US Senators. Senators could be Democrats or Republicans. They are also either male or female.If we select one senator completely randomly, what is the probability that this person is a female Democrat? Conditional Probability can help us answer that.Probability of (Democrat and Female Senator)= Prob(Senator is Democrat) multiplied by Conditional Probability of Being Female given that they are a Democrat.We could compute the exact same thing, the reverse way:Conceptually, this is a way to go from P(Evidence| Known Outcome) to P(Outcome|Known Evidence). Often, we know how frequently some particular evidence is observed, given a known outcome. We have to use this known fact to compute the reverse, to compute the chance of that outcome happening, given the evidence.P(Outcome given that we know some Evidence) = P(Evidence given that we know the Outcome) times Prob(Outcome), scaled by the P(Evidence)The classic example to understand Bayes\' Rule:Now, all this was just preamble, to get to Naive Bayes.So far, we have talked only about one piece of evidence. In reality, we have to predict an outcome given multiple evidence. In that case, the math gets very complicated. To get around that complication, one approach is to \'uncouple\' multiple pieces of evidence, and to treat each of piece of evidence as independent. This approach is why this is called naive Bayes.Many people choose to remember this as:Notice a few things about this equation:Just run the formula above for each possible outcome. Since we are trying to classify, each outcome is called a class and it has a class label. Our job is to look at the evidence, to consider how likely it is to be this class or that class, and assign a label to each entity.\nAgain, we take a very simple approach: The class that has the highest probability is declared the "winner" and that class label gets assigned to that combination of evidences.Let\'s try it out on an example to increase our understanding: The OP asked for a \'fruit\' identification example.Let\'s say that we have data on 1000 pieces of fruit. They happen to be Banana, Orange or some Other Fruit.\nWe know 3 characteristics about each fruit:This is our \'training set.\' We will use this to predict the type of any new fruit we encounter.We can pre-compute a lot of things about our fruit collection.The so-called "Prior" probabilities. (If we didn\'t know any of the fruit attributes, this would be our guess.) These are our base rates.Probability of "Evidence"Probability of "Likelihood"Let\'s say that we are given the properties of an unknown fruit, and asked to classify it. We are told that the fruit is Long, Sweet and Yellow. Is it a Banana? Is it an Orange? Or Is it some Other Fruit?We can simply run the numbers for each of the 3 outcomes, one by one. Then we choose the highest probability and \'classify\' our unknown fruit as belonging to the class that had the highest probability based on our prior evidence (our 1000 fruit training set):By an overwhelming margin (0.252 >> 0.01875), we classify this Sweet/Long/Yellow fruit as likely to be a Banana.Look at what it eventually comes down to. Just some counting and multiplication. We can pre-compute all these terms, and so classifying becomes easy, quick and efficient. Let z = 1 / P(evidence). Now we quickly compute the following three quantities.Assign the class label of whichever is the highest number, and you are done.Despite the name, Naive Bayes turns out to be excellent in certain applications. Text classification is one area where it really shines.Hope that helps in understanding the concepts behind the Naive Bayes algorithm.Ram Narasimhan explained the concept very nicely here below is an alternative explanation through the code example of Naive Bayes in action\nIt uses an example problem from this book on page 351\nThis is the data set that we will be using \nIn the above dataset if we give the hypothesis = {"Age":\'<=30\', "Income":"medium", "Student":\'yes\' , "Creadit_Rating":\'fair\'} then what is the probability that he will buy or will not buy a computer.\nThe code below exactly answers that question.\nJust create a file called named new_dataset.csv and paste the following content.Here is the code the comments explains everything we are doing here! [python]output:Hope it helps in better understanding the problem peaceNaive Bayes :\nNaive Bayes comes under supervise machine learning which used to make classifications of data sets.\nIt is used to predict things based on it\'s prior knowledge and independence assumptions.They call it naive because it\xe2\x80\x99s assumptions (it assumes that all of the features in the data set are equally important and independent) are really optimistic and rarely true in most real-world applications.It is classification algorithm which makes decision for unknown data set. It is based on Bayes Theorem which describe the probability of event based on it\'s prior knowledge.Below diagram shows how naive bayes worksFormula to predict NB:How to use Naive Bayes Algorithm ?Lets take an example of how N.B woksStep 1: First we find out Likelihood of table which shows probability of yes or no in below diagram.\nStep 2: Find posterior probability of each class.For more reference refer these blog.I try to explain the Bayes rule with an example. Suppose that you know that 10% of people are smokers.  You also know that 90% of smokers are men and 80% of them are above 20 years old.  Now you see someone who is a man and  15 years old. You want to know the chance that he be a smoker:As you know 10% of people are smokers your initial guess is 10% (prior probability, without knowing anything about the person) but the other evidences (that he is a man and he is 15) can contribute to this probability. Each evidence may increase or decrease this chance. For example the fact that he is a man may increase the chance that he is a smoker, providing that this percentage (being a man) among non-smokers is lower, for example, 40%. In other words being a man must be a good indicator of being a smoker rather than a non-smoker.We can show this contribution in another way. For each feature, you need to compare the commonness (probability) of that feature (f) independently against its probability under the given condition. (P(f) vs. P(f | x). For example, if we know that the probability of being a man is 90% in a society and 90% of smokers are also men, then knowing that someone is a man doesn\'t change anything (10% * (90% / 90%) = 10%). But if men contribute to 40% of the society, but 90% of the smokers, then being a man increases the chance of being an smoker (10% * (90% / 40%) = 22.5% ). In the same way, if the probability of being a man was 95% in a population, then regardless of the fact that the percentage of men among smokers is high (90%)!, the evidence of being a man decreases the chance of being an smoker! (10% * (90% / 95%) = 9.5%).So we have:Notice in this formula we assumed that being a man and being under 20 are independent features so we multiplied them, it means that knowing that someone is under 20 has no effect on guessing that he is man or woman. But it may not be true, for example maybe most adolescence  in a society are men...To use this formula in a classifierThe classifier is given some features (man and under 20) and it must decide if he is an smoker or not. It uses the above formula to find that. To gain the needed probabilities (90%, 10%, 80%...) it uses training set. for example it counts the people in the training set that are smokers and find they contribute 10% of the sample. Then for smokers checks how many of them are men or women .... how many are above 20 or under 20....
