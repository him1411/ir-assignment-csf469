I have this line of code which rounds my numbers to two decimal places. But I get numbers like this: 10.8, 2.4, etc. These are not my idea of two decimal places so how I can improve the following?I want numbers like 10.80, 2.40, etc. Use of jQuery is fine with me.To format a number using fixed-point notation, you can simply use the toFixed method:Note that toFixed() returns a string.IMPORTANT: Note that toFixed does not actually round, for 90% of the case, it will return the rounded value but for many cases it doesnt actually work. Try this in your console:2.005.toFixed(2)You will get the wrong answerThere is no natural way of getting a decimal rounding in javascript, you will need your own polyfill or use a library. You can look at mozilla\'s polyfill for this https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/roundThis is an old topic but still top-ranked Google results and the solutions offered share the same floating point decimals issue. Here is the (very generic) function I use, thanks to MDN:As we can see, we don\'t get these issues:This genericity also provides some cool stuff:Now, to answer the OP\'s question, one has to type:Or, for a more concise, less generic function:You can call it with:Various examples and tests (thanks to @t-j-crowder!):I usually add this to my personal library, and after some suggestions and using the @TIMINeutron solution too, and making it adaptable for decimal length then, this one fits best: will work for the exceptions reported.I don\'t know why can\'t I add a comment to a previous answer (maybe I\'m hopelessly blind, dunno), but I came up with a solution using @Miguel\'s answer:And its two comments (from @bighostkim and @Imre):My final solution is as follows:As you can see I had to add a little bit of "correction" (it\'s not what it is, but since Math.round is lossy - you can check it on jsfiddle.net - this is the only way I knew how to "fix" it). It adds 0.001 to the already padded number, so it is adding a 1 three 0s to the right of the decimal value. So it should be safe to use.After that I added .toFixed(decimal) to always output the number in the correct format (with the right amount of decimals).So that\'s pretty much it. Use it well ;)EDIT: added functionality to the "correction" of negative numbers.toFixed(n) provides n length after the decimal point; toPrecision(x)\n  provides x total length.Use this method belowAND if you want the number to be fixed useOne way to be 100% sure that you get a number with 2 decimals: If this causes rounding errors, you can use the following as James has explained in his comment:I didn\'t find an accurate solution for this problem, so I created my own:Examples:@heridev and I created a small function in jQuery.You can try next:HTMLjQuery\xe2\x80\x8b\nDEMO ONLINE:http://jsfiddle.net/c4Wqn/The trouble with floating point values is that they are trying to represent an infinite amount of (continuous) values with a fixed amount of bits. So naturally, there must be some loss in play, and you\'re going to be bitten with some values.When a computer stores 1.275 as a floating point value, it won\'t actually remember whether it was 1.275 or 1.27499999999999993, or even 1.27500000000000002. These values should give different results after rounding to two decimals, but they won\'t, since for computer they look exactly the same after storing as floating point values, and there\'s no way to restore the lost data. Any further calculations will only accumulate such imprecision.So, if precision matters, you have to avoid floating point values from the start. The simplest options are toFor example, when using integers to store the number of hundredths, the function for finding the actual value is quite simple:With strings, you\'ll need rounding, but it\'s still manageable:Note that this function rounds to nearest, ties away from zero, while IEEE 754 recommends rounding to nearest, ties to even as the default behavior for floating point operations. Such modifications are left as an exercise for the reader :)Here\'s a simple oneUse like alert(roundFloat(1.79209243929,4));JsfiddleRound your decimal value, then use toFixed(x) for your expected digit(s).CallparseDecimalRoundAndFixed(10.800243929,4)  =>  10.80\nparseDecimalRoundAndFixed(10.807243929,2)  =>  10.81Put the following in some global scope:and then try:Note that toFixed() can only work for the number of decimals between 0-20 i.e. a.getDecimals(25) may generate a javascript error, so to accomodate that you may add some additional check i.e.I\'m fix the problem the modifier.\nSupport 2 decimal only.That should yield: 10.20That should yield: 0.05That should yield: 4.04etc.this will return a random number from 1 to 100 rounded to 2 decimal places.This is very simple and works just as well as any of the others:Since toFixed() can only be called on numbers, and unfortunately returns a string, this does all the parsing for you in both directions.  You can pass a string or a number, and you get a number back every time!  Calling parseNumber(1.49) will give you 1, and parseNumber(1.49,2) will give you 1.50.  Just like the best of \'em!You could also use the  .toPrecision() method and some custom code, and always round up to the nth decimal digit regardless the length of int part.You could also make it a plugin for a better use.This worked for me: Rounding Decimals in JavaScriptUsing this response by reference: https://stackoverflow.com/a/21029698/454827I build a function to get dynamic numbers of decimals:here working example: https://jsfiddle.net/wpxLduLc/100% working!!!
