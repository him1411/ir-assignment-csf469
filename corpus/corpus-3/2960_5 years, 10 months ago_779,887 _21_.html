I want to eliminate all the whitespace from a string, on both ends, and in between words.I have this Python code:But that only eliminates the whitespace on both sides of the string. How do I remove all whitespace?If you want to remove leading and ending spaces, use str.strip(): If you want to remove all spaces, use str.replace():If you want to remove duplicated spaces, use str.split():To remove only spaces use str.replace:To remove all whitespace characters (space, tab, newline, and so on) you can use split then join:or a regular expression:If you want to only remove whitespace from the beginning and end you can use strip:You can also use lstrip to remove whitespace only from the beginning of the string, and rstrip to remove whitespace from the end of the string.If you also want to remove all the other strange whitespace characters that exist in unicode you can use re.sub with the re.UNICODE arguement:... because do you really want to keep these strange unicode characters?Whitespace includes space, tabs and CRLF. So an elegant and one-liner string function we can use is translate.(Surprised no one mentioned it!)  \' hello  apple\'.translate(None, \' \\n\\t\\r\')OR if you want to be thoroughFor removing whitespace from beginning and end, use strip.MaK already pointed out the "translate" method above. And this variation works with Python 3 (see this Q&A).Be careful:strip does a rstrip and lstrip (removes leading and trailing spaces, tabs, returns and form feeds but does not remove them in the middle of the string)if you only replace spaces and tabs you can end up with hidden CRLF that appear to match what you are looking for but are not the same
