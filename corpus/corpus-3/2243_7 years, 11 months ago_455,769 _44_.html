I\'m trying to have an image (as the background) on a button and add dynamically, depending on what\'s happening during run-time, some text above/over the image.If I use ImageButton I don\'t even have the possibility to add text.\nIf I use Button I can add text but only define an image with android:drawableBottom and similar XML attributes as defined here.However these attributes only combine text & image in x- and y-dimensions, meaning I can draw an image around my text, but not below/under my text (with the z-axis defined as coming out of the display).Any suggestions on how to do this? One idea would be to either extend Button or ImageButton and override the draw()-method. But with my current level of knowledge I don\'t really know how to do this (2D rendering). Maybe someone with more experience knows a solution or at least some pointers to start?You can call setBackgroundDrawable() on a Button to set the background of the button.Any text will appear above the background.If you are looking for something similar in xml there is:\nandroid:background attribute which works the same way.For users who just want to put Background, Icon-Image and Text in one Button from different files: Set on a Button background, drawableTop/Bottom/Rigth/Left and padding attributes.For more sophisticated arrangement you also can use RelativeLayout and make it clickable. Tutorial: Great tutorial that covers both cases: http://izvornikod.com/Blog/tabid/82/EntryId/8/Creating-Android-button-with-image-and-text-using-relative-layout.aspxThere\'s a much better solution for this problem.Just take a normal Button and use the drawableLeft and the gravity attributes.This way you get a button which displays a icon in the left side of the button and the text at the right site of the icon vertical centered.Just use a LinearLayout and pretend it\'s a Button - setting background and clickable is the key:just replace  withizz a pretty good trick.. ;)I took a different approach from the ones stated here, and it is working really well, so I wanted to share it.I\'m using a Style to create a custom button with image at the left and text at the center-right. Just follow the 4 "easy steps" below:I. Create your 9 patches using at least 3 different PNG files and the tool you have at: /YOUR_OWN_PATH/android-sdk-mac_x86/tools/./draw9patch. After this you should have:button_normal.9.png, button_focused.9.png and button_pressed.9.pngThen download or create a 24x24 PNG icon.ic_your_icon.pngSave all in the drawable/ folder on your Android project.II. Create a XML file called button_selector.xml in your project under the drawable/ folder. The states should be like this:III. Go to the values/ folder and open or create the styles.xml file and create the following XML code:ButtonNormalTextWithIcon is a "child style" because it is extending ButtonNormalText (the "parent style").Note that changing the drawableLeft in the ButtonNormalTextWithIcon style, to drawableRight,  drawableTop or drawableBottom you can place the icon in other position with respect to the text.IV. Go to the layout/ folder where you have your XML for the UI and go to the Button where you want to apply the style and make it look like this:And... voil\xc3\xa0! You got your button with an image at the left side.For me, this is the better way to do it! because doing it this way you can manage the text size of the button separately from the icon you want to display and use the same background drawable for several buttons with different icons respecting the Android UI Guidelines using styles.You can also create a theme for your App and add the "parent style" to it so all the buttons look the same, and apply the "child style" with the icon only where you need it.You can use drawableTop (also drawableLeft, etc) for the image and set text below the image by adding the gravity left|center_verticalhttp://www.mokasocial.com/2010/04/create-a-button-with-an-image-and-text-android/This code works for me perfectly                          Probably my solution will suit for a lot of users, I hope so.What I am suggesting it is making TextView with your style. It works for me perfectly, and has got all features, like a button. First of all lets make button style, which you can use everywhere...I am creating button_with_hover.xmlSecondly, \nLets create a textview button. And this is a result. Then style your custom button with any colors or any other properties and margins. Good luckYou can use this:in that i have put an image as background and also added text..!
