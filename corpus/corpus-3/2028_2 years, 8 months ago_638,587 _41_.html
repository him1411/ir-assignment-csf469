I\'m having trouble installing a Python package (specifically, JPype1 0.5.7) on my Windows machine, and would like to install it with Christoph Gohlke\'s Window binaries. (Which, to my experience, alleviated much of the fuss for many other package installations.)However, while Christoph used to provide .exe files in the past, recently it seems he\'s uploading .whl files instead.http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#jpypeBut how do I install .whl files?Notes:I just used the following which was quite simple. First open a console then cd to where you\'ve downloaded your file like some-package.whl and useNote: if pip.exe is not recognized, you may find it in the "Scripts" directory from where python has been installed. If pip is not installed, this page can help:\nHow do I install pip on Windows?Note: for clarification\nIf you copy the *.whl file to your local drive (ex. C:\\some-dir\\some-file.whl) use the following command line parameters --  To install from wheel, give it the directory where the wheel is downloaded. For example, to install package_name.whl:Make sure you have updated pip first to enable wheel support:I am in the same boat as the OP.Using a Windows command prompt, from directory:seemed to work.Changing directory to where the whl was located, it just tells me \'pip is not recognized\'. Going back to C:\\Python34\\Scripts>, then using the full command above to provide the \'where/its/downloaded\' location, it says Requirement \'scikit_image-...-win32.whl\' looks like a filename, but the filename does not exist.So I dropped a copy of the .whl in Python34/Scripts, ran the exact same command over again (with the --find-links= still going to the other folder), and this time it worked.You have to run pip.exe from the command prompt on my computer. \nI type C:/Python27/Scripts/pip2.exe install numpyOn Windows you can\'t just upgrade using pip install --upgrade pip, because the pip.exe is in use and there would be an error replacing it. Instead, you should upgrade pip like this:Then check the pip version:If it shows 6.x series, there is wheel support.Only then, you can install a wheel package like this:There are several file versions on the great Christoph Gohlke\'s site.Something I have found important when installing wheels from this site is to first run this from the Python console:so that you know which version you should install for your computer. Picking the wrong version may fail the installing of the package (especially if you don\'t use the right CPython tag, for example, cp27).To be able to install wheel files with a simple doubleclick on them you can do one the following:1) Run two commands in command line under administrator privileges:2) Alternatively, they can be copied into a wheel.bat file and executed with \'Run as administrator\' checkbox in the properties.PS pip.exe is assumed to be in the PATH.Update:(1) Those can be combined in one line:(2) Syntax for .bat files is slightly different:Also its output can be made more verbose:see my blog post for details.To avoid having to download such files, you can try:For more information, see this.I downloaded NumPy from here\n    https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpyPS.: I installed it on Windows 10.New Python users on Windows often forget to add Python\'s \\Scripts directory to the PATH variable during the installation. I recommend to use the Python launcher and execute pip as a script with the -m switch. Then you can install the wheels for a specific Python version (if more than one are installed) and the Scripts directory doesn\'t have to be in the PATH. So open the command line, navigate (with the cd command) to the folder where the .whl file is located and enter:Replace 3.6 by your Python version or just enter -3 if the desired Python version appears first in the PATH. And with an active virtual environment: py -m pip install your_whl_file.whl.Of course you can also install packages from PyPI in this way, e.g.You can install the .whl file, using pip install filename. Though to use it in this form, it should be in the same directory as your command line, otherwise specify the complete filename, along with its address like pip install C:\\Some\\PAth\\filename.Also make sure the .whl file is of the same platform as you are using, do a python -V to find out which version of Python you are running and if it is win32 or 64, install the correct version according to it.
