When I try to push to a shared git remote, I get the following error:\ninsufficient permission for adding an object to repository databaseThen I read about a fix here: Fix  This worked for the next push, since all of the files were of the correct group, but the next time someone pushed up a change it made a new item in the objects folder that had their default group as the group. The only thing I can think of is to change all of the developer\'s default group for items they check in, but that seems like a hack.  Any ideas? Thanks.After you have identified and fixed the underlying cause (see below), you\'ll want to repair the permissions:If you do not fix the underlying cause, the error will keep coming back and you\'ll have to keep re-running the above commands over and over again.The error could be caused by one of the following:The repository isn\'t configured to be a shared repository (see core.sharedRepository in git help config).  If the output of:is not group or true or 1 or some mask, try running:and then re-run the recursive chmod and chgrp (see "Repair Permissions" above).The operating system doesn\'t interpret a setgid bit on directories as "all new files and subdirectories should inherit the group owner".When core.sharedRepository is true or group, Git relies on a feature of GNU operating systems (e.g., every Linux distribution) to ensure that newly created subdirectories are owned by the correct group (the group that all of the repository\'s users are in).  This feature is documented in the GNU coreutils documentation:... [If] a directory\'s set-group-ID bit is set, newly created subfiles inherit the same group as the directory, and newly created subdirectories inherit the set-group-ID bit of the parent directory. ... [This mechanism lets] users share files more easily, by lessening the need to use chmod or chown to share new files.However, not all operating systems have this feature (NetBSD is one example).  For those operating systems, you should make sure that all of your Git users have the same default group.  Alternatively, you can make the repository world-writable by running git config core.sharedRepository world (but be carefulâ€”this is less secure).For Ubuntu (or any Linux)From project root,You can tell what yourname and yourgroup should be by looking at the permissions on the majority of the output from that ls -al commandNote: remember the star at the end of the sudo lineI just wanted to add my solution. I had a repo on OS X that had ownership of root on some directories and Home (which is my user directory) on others which caused the same error listed above.The solution was simple thankfully. From terminal:sudo chmod -R ug+w .;Basically, .git/objects file does not have write permissions. The above line grants permission to all the files and folders in the directory.A good way to debug this is the next time it happens, SSH into the remote repo, cd into the objects folder and do an ls -al.If you see 2-3 files with different user:group ownership than this is the problem.It\'s happened to me in the past with some legacy scripts access our git repo and usually means a different (unix) user pushed / modified files last and your user doesn\'t have permissions to overwrite those files. You should create a shared git group that all git-enabled users are in and then recursively chgrp the objects folder and it\'s contents so that it\'s group ownership is the shared git group. You should also add a sticky bit on the folder so that all the files created in the folder will always have the group of git.chmod g+s directory-nameUpdate: I didn\'t know about core.sharedRepository. Good to know, though it probably just does the above.Solved for me...\njust this:This can easily happen if you ran git init with a different user from the one you are planning to use when pushing changes.If you blindly follow the instructions on [1] this will happen as you probably created the git-user as root and then immediately moved on to git init without changing user in between.[1] http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-on-the-Server-Setting-Up-the-Server After you add some stuff... commit them and after all finished push it! BANG!! Start all problems... As you should notice there are some differences in the way both new and existent projects were defined. If some other person tries to add/commit/push same files, or content (git keep both as same objects), we will face the following error:To solve this problem you have to have something in mind operational system\'s permissions system as you are restricted by it in this case. Tu understand better the problem, go ahead and check your git object\'s folder (.git/objects). You will probably see something like that:*Note that those file\'s permissions were granted only for your users, no one will never can changed it... *SOLVING THE PROBLEMIf you have super user permission, you can go forward and change all permissions by yourself using the step two, in any-other case you will need to ask all users with objects created with their users, use the following command to know who they are:Now you and all file\'s owner users will have to change those files permission, doing:After that you will need to add a new property that is equivalent to --shared=group done for the new repository, according to the documentation, this make the repository group-writable, do it executing:https://coderwall.com/p/8b3ksgFor my case none of the suggestions worked. I\'m on Windows and this worked for me:I hit this same issue. Reading around here I realised it was file permissions the message was referring to. The fix , for me, was in:/etc/inetd.d/git-gpvIt was starting git-daemon as user \'nobody\' so lacked the write permission.(I doubt other call their inetd conf file git-gpv . Commonly it would be directly in /etc/inetd.conf) You need the sufficient write permissions on the directory that you are pushing to.In my case: Windows 2008 serverright click on git repo directory or parent directory.Properties > Sharing tab > Advanced Sharing > Permissions > make sure the user has appropriate access rights.I am getting this error when trying to push thru an IDE ( in this case, PHPStorm ) .\nWhen I tried to push using terminal ( OSX ) it did work ! So, it is clearly a permission issue.\nWhile I can\'t find how to permanently fix it, usingwill do the trickYou may have accidentally  nested git repositories! That is the most common source of this error.Linux, macOS:where name is your username and group is the group that your username belongs to.
