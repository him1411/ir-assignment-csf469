Is there a way to re-indent a block of code?  I\'m looking for something similar to Ctrl-Shift-F in Eclipse (Auto-Format/Indent).To be clear,I already know about NppAutoIndent - it won\'t work, as I\'m working with XML, HTML and CSS.Since I upgraded to 6.3.2, I use XML Tools. In older versions:\nmenu -> TextFX -> HTML Tidy -> Tidy: Reindent XML.Install Tidy2 plugin. I have Notepad++ v6.2.2, and Tidy2 works fine so far.For those who don\'t know, npp has a lot of support from plugins and other projects. You can download those plugins from SourceForge.You need XML Tools to format your text in n++After you have downloaded XML Tools .. Exit Notepad++Go To  C:\\Program File\\Notepad++ .... Your N++ installed folder.Restart and enjoy!!!Ctrl + Alt + Shft + B to format.It\'s been the third time that I install Windows and npp and after some time I realize the tidy function no longer work. So I google for a solution, come to this thread, then with the help of few more so threads I finally fix it. I\'ll put a summary of all my actions once and for all.Install TextFX plugin: Plugins -> Plugin Manager -> Show Plugin Manager. Select TextFX Characters and install. After a restart of npp, the menu \'TextFX\' should be visible. (credits: @remipod).Install libtidy.dll by pasting the Config folder from an old npp package: Follow instructions in this answer. After having a Config folder in your latest npp installation destination (typically C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Notepad++\\plugins), npp needs write access to that folder. Right click Config folder -> Properties -> Security tab -> select Users, click Edit -> check Full control to allow read/write access. Note that you need administrator privileges to do that.Restart npp and verify TextFX -> TextFX HTML Tidy -> Tidy: Reindent XML works.I had to update the proxy settings under Plugins -> Plugin Manager -> Show Plugin Manager -> Settings to see any PlugIns in the "Available" list.After that, installing "XML Tools" was easy and did the requested job as described above.To directly answer the OP, take a look at this guy\'s site:  Thomas Hunter Notepad++ Tidy for XML.  Simple steps to follow and you get very nice formatting of your XML right inside NPP.  So far the only anomaly I\'ve found is with nested self closing elements EG: Will be tidied up to: There may be a way to fix this, but for the time being, it\'s managed to reduce the number of lines in my document by 300k and this particular anomaly can be worked around.
