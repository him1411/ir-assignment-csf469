I\'m working with a git repository that needs a commit from another git repository that knows nothing of the first.Typically I would cherry-pick using the HEAD@{x} in the reflog, but because this .git knows nothing of this reflog entry (different physical directory), how can I cherry-pick this, or can I?I\'m using git-svn. My first branch is using git-svn of the trunk of a Subversion repo, and the next branch is using git-svn on a Subversion branch.You\'ll need to add the other repository as a remote, then fetch its changes. From there you see the commit and you can cherry-pick it.The answer, as given, is to use format-patch but since the question was how to cherry-pick from another folder, here is a piece of code to do just that:(explanation from @cong ma)The git format-patch command creates a patch from some_other_repo\'s\n  commit specified by its SHA (-1 for one single commit alone). This\n  patch is piped to git am, which applies the patch locally (-3 means\n  trying the three-way merge if the patch fails to apply cleanly). Hope\n  that explains.Here\'s an example of the remote-fetch-merge.Then you have a choice:or:You can do it, but it requires two steps.  Here\'s how:Replace <remote-git-url> with the url or path to the repository you want cherry-pick from.Replace <branch> with the branch or tag name you want to cherry-pick from the remote repository.You can replace FETCH_HEAD with a git SHA from the branch.Updated: modified based on @pkalinow\'s feedback.Here are the steps to add a remote, fetch branches, and cherry-pick a commitSource: https://coderwall.com/p/sgpkswSee How to create and apply a patch with Git. (From the wording of your question, I assumed that this other repository is for an entirely different codebase. If it\'s a repository for the same code base, you should add it as a remote as suggested by @CharlesB. Even if it is for another code base, I guess you could still add it as a remote, but you might not want to get the entire branch into your repository...)You can do it in one line as following. Hope you are in git repository which need the cherry-picked change and you have checked out to correct branch. git fetch [branch URL] [Branch to cherry-pick from] && git cherry-pick [commit ID]Yes. Fetch the repository and then cherry-pick from the remote branch.My situation was that I have a bare repo that the team pushes to, and a clone of that sitting right next to it. This set of lines in a Makefile work correctly for me:By keeping the master of the bare repo up to date, we are able to cherry-pick a proposed change published to the bare repo. We also have a (more complicated) way to cherry-pick multiple braches for consolidated review and testing.If "knows nothing" means "can\'t be used as a remote", then this doesn\'t help, but this SO question came up as I was googling around to come up with this workflow so I thought I\'d contribute back.Assuming A is the repo you want to cherry-pick from, and B is the one you want to cherry-pick to, you can do this by adding </path/to/repo/A/>/.git/objects to </path/to/repo/B>/.git/objects/info/alternates. Create this alternates files if it does not exist.This will make repo B access all git objects from repo A, and will make cherry-pick work for you.
