After git init, I added and committed a few files, made some changes, added and committed.  Set up the git daemon (running under Cygwin on WinXP) and cloned the repository once.\nNow, I get this error with the cloned repository:Is there any way to fix this, other than getting a new copy of the repository?If the problem is with the index as the staging area for commits (i.e. .git/index), you can simply remove the index (make a backup copy if you want), and then restore index to version in the last commit:On OSX/Linux:On Windows:(The reset command above is the same as  git reset --mixed HEAD)You can alternatively use lower level plumbing git read-tree instead of git reset.If the problem is with index for packfile, you can recover it using git index-pack.You may have accidentally corrupted the .git/index file with a sed on your project root (refactoring perhaps?) with something like:to avoid this in the future, just ignore binary files with your grep/sed:This sounds like a bad clone. You could try the following to get (possibly?) more information:In my case it was nested .git folder in web/ckeditor/kcfinderI had that problem, and I try ti fix with this:BUT it did not work. The solution?\nFor some reason I had others .git folders in sub directories. I delete those .git folders (not the principal) and git reset again. Once they were deleted, everything worked again.This issue can occur when there is a .git directory underneath one of the subdirectories.  To fix it, check if there are other .git directories there, and remove them and try again.Since the above solutions left me with continued problems, I used this dull solution:Did the trick. Btw, I did a sed on the project root as @hobs guessed. Learned my lesson.This worked for me.  Although i\'m curious of the reason I started getting the errors in the first place.  When I logged out yesterday, it was fine.  Log in this morning, it wasn\'t.  This is ridiculous but I just have rebooted my machine (mac) and the problem was gone like it has never happened. I hate to sound like a support guy...You can also try for restore to previous version of the file (if you are using windows os)
