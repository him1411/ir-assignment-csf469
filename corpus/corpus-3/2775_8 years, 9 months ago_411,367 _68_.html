According to HTML specs, the select tag in HTML doesn\'t have a readonly attribute, only a disabled attribute. So if you want to keep the user from changing the dropdown, you have to use disabled.The only problem is that disabled HTML form inputs don\'t get included in the POST / GET data.What\'s the best way to emulate the readonly attribute for a select tag, and still get the POST data?You should keep the select element disabled but also add another hidden input with the same name and value.If you reenable your SELECT, you should copy its value to the hidden input in an onchange event and disable (or remove) the hidden input.Here is a demo:You can re-enable the select object on submit.EDIT: i.e., normally disabling the select tag (with the disabled attribute) and then re-enabling it automatically just before submiting the form:Example with jQuery:To disable it:To re-enable it before submission so that GET / POST data is included:In addition, you could re-enable every disabled input or select:We could also use this Disable all except the selected option:This way the dropdown still works (and submits its value) but the user can not select another value.DemoTested and working in IE 6, 7 & 8b2, Firefox 2 & 3, Opera 9.62, Safari 3.2.1 for Windows and Google Chrome.Simple jQuery solutionanother way of doing a readOnly attribute to a select element is by using cssyou could do like :DEMOSimple CSS solution:This results in Select to be gray with nice "disable" cursor on hover\nand on select the list of options is "empty" so you can not change its value.Yet another more contemporary option (no pun intended) is to disable all the options of the select element other then the selected one. note however that this is an HTML 4.0 feature\nand ie 6,7,8 beta 1 seem to not respect this.http://www.gtalbot.org/BrowserBugsSection/MSIE7Bugs/OptionDisabledSupport.htmlThis is the best solution I have found:The code above disables all other options not selected while keeping the selected option enabled. Doing so the selected option will make it into the post-back data.Set the select disabled when you plan for it to be read-only and then remove the disabled attribute just before submitting the form.This is the simplest and best solution.\nYou will set a readolny attr on your select, or anyother attr like data-readonly, and do the followingIn addition to disabling the options that should not be selectable i wanted to actually make them dissapear from the list, but still be able to enable them should i need to later:This finds all select elements with a readonly attribute, then finds all options inside those selects that are not selected, then it hides them and disables them.It is important to separate the jquery query in 2 for performance reasons, because jquery reads them from right to left, the code: will first find all unselected options in the document and then filter those that are inside selects with a readonly attribute.If you disable a form field, this won\'t be send when form is submitted. \nSo if you need a readonly that works like disabled but sending values do this :After any change in readonly properties of an element.One simple server-side approach is to remove all the options except the one that you want to be selected. Thus, in Zend Framework 1.12, if $element is a Zend_Form_Element_Select:Easier still:\nadd the style attribute to your select tag:Following on from Grant Wagners suggestion; here is a jQuery snippet that does it with handler functions instead of direct onXXX attributes:I resolved it with jquery:If you are using jquery validate, you can do the following below, I used the disabled attribute without a problem:I know that it is far too late, but it can be done with simple CSS:The style hides all the options and the groups when the select is in readonly state, so the user can not change his selection.No JavaScript hacks needed.Rather than the select itself, you could disable all of the options except for the currently selected option.  This gives the appearance of a working drop-down, but only the option you want passed in is a valid selection.html solution:<select onfocus="this.blur();">javascript ones:selectElement.addEventListener("focus", selectElement.blur, true);\n  selectElement.attachEvent("focus", selectElement.blur); //thanks, IEto remove:selectElement.removeEventListener("focus", selectElement.blur, true);\n  selectElement.detachEvent("focus", selectElement.blur); //thanks, IEedit: added remove methodsSimply, remove the disabled attribute before submit the form.What I found works great, with plain javascript (ie: no JQuery library required), is to change the innerHTML of the <select> tag to the desired single remaining value.Before:Sample Javascript:After:This way, no visiual effect change, and this will POST/GET within the <FORM>.If the select dropdown is read-only since birth and does not need to change at all, perhaps you should use another control instead? Like a simple <div> (plus hidden form field) or an <input type="text">?Added: If the dropdown is not read-only all the time and JavaScript is used to enable/disable it, then this is still a solution - just modify the DOM on-the-fly.I was able to get this to work to create a readonly select options control using JavaScript.  I had to hide the select box and create a new hidden field.  I\'ve placed the code on my website for anyone to use as a reference.  HTML Readonly Select: http://www.codepug.com/readonlySelect.htmlCheers,\n--X\n.Below worked for me :I managed it by hiding the select box and showing a span in its place with only informational value. On the event of disabling the .readonly class, we need also to remove the .toVanish elements and show the .toShow ones.In IE I was able to defeat the onfocus=>onblur approach by double-clicking.\nBut remembering the value and then restoring it in the onchange event seems to handle that issue.You can do similar without expando properties by using a javascript variable.Here\'s an attempt to use a custom jQuery function to achieve the functionality (as mentioned here):
