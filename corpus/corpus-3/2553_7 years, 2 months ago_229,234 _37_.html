How to get the screen density programmatically in android? I mean How to find the screen dpi of the current device?You can get info on the display from the DisplayMetrics struct:Though Android doesn\'t use a direct pixel mapping, it uses a handful of quantized Density Independent Pixel values then scales to the actual screen size. So the metrics.densityDpi property will be one of the DENSITY_??? constants (120, 160, 213, 240, 320, 480 or 640 dpi).If you need the actual lcd pixel density (perhaps for an OpenGL app) you can get it from the metrics.xdpi and metrics.ydpi properties for horizontal and vertical density respectively.If you are targeting API Levels earlier than 4. The metrics.density property is a floating point scaling factor from the reference density (160dpi). The same value now provided by metrics.densityDpi can be calculatedThis also works:This will give you:0.75 - ldpi1.0 - mdpi1.5 - hdpi2.0 - xhdpi3.0 - xxhdpi4.0 - xxxhdpiref: densityThis will work in API lavel 4 or higher.Blundell\'s answer as a static helper method:Try this:To get dpi:The following answer is a small improvement based upon qwertzguy\'s answer. Actualy if you want to have the real display dpi the answer is somewhere in between\nif you query for display metrics:densityDpi * 160 will give you the values/suggestion which density you should useas specified in previous postsbut dm.xdpi won\'t give you always the REAL dpi of given display:\nExample:so maybe real dpi of the display should be Density*xdpi .. but i\'m not sure if this is the correct way to do!This should help on your activity ...OUTPUT : Here are the density constants, source:There are, in addition to the standard densities, 5 Intermediate ones. Taking into account this fact, the following code will be a complete working example:Alternatively using the densityDpi method:If you want to retrieve the density from a Service it works like this:This should work.Yet another answer:You Should Try This. Just Added a Method which will find and Show the Toast. That in Which Category the Device Falls.http://www.androidwarriors.com/2016/01/how-to-find-different-devices-screen.html
