I am getting date in the format as yyyy-mm-dd. I need to increment this by one day. How can I do this?Something like this should do the trick:Java does appear to be well behind the eight-ball compared to C#. This utility method shows the way to do in Java SE 6 using the Calendar.add method (presumably the only easy way).To add one day, per the question asked, call it as follows:I prefer to use DateUtils from Apache. Check this http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/javadocs/api-2.6/org/apache/commons/lang/time/DateUtils.html. It is handy especially when you have to use it multiple places in your project and would not want to write your one liner method for this. The API says: addDays(Date date, int amount) : Adds a number of days to a date returning a new object.Note that it returns a new Date object and does not make changes to the previous one itself.On Java 8 and later, the java.time package makes this pretty much automatic. (Tutorial)Assuming String input and output:Take a look at Joda-Time (http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/).Construct a Calendar object and use the method add(Calendar.DATE, 1);Please note that this line adds 24 hours:but this line adds one dayOn days with a daylight savings time change (25 or 23 hours) you will get different results!Java 8 added a new API for working with dates and times.With Java 8 you can use the following lines of code:you can use Simple java.util libThis will give tomorrow\'s date. c.add parameters could be changed from 1 to another number for appropriate increment.try this code:This takes the number of milliseconds since epoch from oldDate and adds 1 day worth of milliseconds then uses the Date() public constructor to create a date using the new value. This method allows you to add 1 day, or any number of hours/minutes, not only whole days.If you want to add a single unit of time and you expect that other fields to be incremented as well, you can safely use add method. See example below:Will Print:Apache Commons already has this DateUtils.addDays(Date date, int amount)     http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/apidocs/org/apache/commons/lang3/time/DateUtils.html#addDays%28java.util.Date,%20int%29 which you use or you could go with the JodaTime to make it more cleaner.Just pass date in String and number of next days  In java 8 you can use java.time.LocalDateYou can convert in into java.util.Date object as follows.You can formate LocalDate into a String as follows.Use the DateFormat API to convert the String into a Date object, then use the Calendar API to add one day. Let me know if you want specific code examples, and I can update my answer.Since Java 1.5 TimeUnit.DAYS.toMillis(1) looks more clean to me.If you are using Java 8, then do it like this.If you want to use SimpleDateFormat, then do it like this.If you are using Java 8, java.time.LocalDate and java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter can make this work quite simple.
