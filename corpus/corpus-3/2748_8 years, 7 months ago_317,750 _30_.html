So I can start from len(collection) and end in collection[0].EDIT: Sorry, I forgot to mention I also want to be able to access the loop index.Use the reversed() built-in function:To also access the original index:You can do:(Or whatever you want to do in the for loop.)The [::-1] slice reverses the list in the for loop (but won\'t actually modify your list "permanently").If you need the loop index, and don\'t want to traverse the entire list twice, or use extra memory, I\'d write a generator.  It can be done like this:So your guess was pretty close :) A little awkward but it\'s basically saying: start with 1 less than len(collection), keep going until you get to just before -1, by steps of -1.  Fyi, the help function is very useful as it lets you view the docs for something from the Python console, eg:help(range)The reversed builtin function is handy:The documentation for reversed explains its limitations.For the cases where I have to walk a sequence in reverse along with the index (e.g. for in-place modifications changing the sequence length), I have this function defined an my codeutil module:This one avoids creating a copy of the sequence. Obviously, the reversed limitations still apply.I like the one-liner generator approach:ORHow about without recreating a new list, you can do by indexing:ORUse list.reverse() and then iterate as you normally would.http://docs.python.org/tutorial/datastructures.htmlThe other answers are good, but if you want to do as \nList comprehension stylethe reverse function comes in handy here:use built-in function reversed() for sequence object,this method has the effect of all sequencesmore detailed reference linkTo use negative indices: start at -1 and step back by -1 at each iteration.You can also use a while loop:An easy approach is:for what ever it\'s worth you can do it like this too. very simple.
