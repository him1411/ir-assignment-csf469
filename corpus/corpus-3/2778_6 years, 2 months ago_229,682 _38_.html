I\'m having difficulty installing lxml with easy_install on Ubuntu 11.When I type $ easy_install lxml I get:It seems that libxslt or libxml2 is not installed. I\'ve tried following the instructions at http://www.techsww.com/tutorials/libraries/libxslt/installation/installing_libxslt_on_ubuntu_linux.php and http://www.techsww.com/tutorials/libraries/libxml/installation/installing_libxml_on_ubuntu_linux.php with no success.If I try wget ftp://xmlsoft.org/libxml2/libxml2-sources-2.6.27.tar.gz I getIf I try the other first, I\'ll get to ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/libxslt --with-libxml-prefix=/usr/local/libxml2 and that will fail eventually with:I\'ve tried both versions 2.6.27 and 2.6.29 of libxml2 with no difference.Leaving no stone unturned, I have successfully done sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev, but this changes nothing.Since you\'re on Ubuntu, don\'t bother with those source packages. Just install those development packages using apt-get.If you\'re happy with a possibly older version of lxml altogether though, you could tryand be done with it. :)I also had to install lib32z1-dev before lxml would compile (Ubuntu 13.04 x64).Or all the required packages together:As @Pepijn commented on @Druska \'s answer, on ubuntu 13.04 x64, there is no need to use lib32z1-dev, zlib1g-dev is enough:I installed lxml with pip in Vagrant, using Ubuntu 14.04 and had the same problem. Even though all requirements where installed, i got the same error again and again. Turned out, my VM had to little memory by default. With 1024 MB everything works fine. Add this to your VagrantFile and lxml should properly compile / install:Thanks to sixhobbit for the hint (see: can't installing lxml on Ubuntu 12.04).For Ubuntu 14.04sudo apt-get install python-lxmlworked for me.After installing the packages mentioned by AKX I still had the same problem. Solved it withFor Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS (Precise Pangolin) I had to do:(Note the "1" in libxslt1-dev)Then I just installed lxml with pip/easy_install.Step 1Install latest python updates using this command.sudo apt-get install python-devStep 2Add first dependency libxml2 version 2.7.0 or latersudo apt-get install libxml2-devStep 3Add second dependency libxslt version 1.1.23 or latersudo apt-get install libxslt1-devStep 4Install pip package management tool first. and run this command.pip install lxmlIf you have any doubt Click HereFirst install Ubuntu\'s python-lxml package and its dependencies:Then use pip to upgrade to the latest version of lxml for Python:
