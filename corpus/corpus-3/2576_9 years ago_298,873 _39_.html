I have a table story_category in my database with corrupt entries. The next query returns the corrupt entries:I tried to delete them executing:But I get the next error: #1093 - You can\'t specify target table \'story_category\' for update in FROM clause How can I overcome this?Update: This answer covers the general error classification. For a more specific answer about how to best handle the OP\'s exact query, please see other answers to this questionIn MySQL, you can\'t modify the same table which you use in the SELECT part.\nThis behaviour is documented at:\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/update.htmlMaybe you can just join the table to itselfIf the logic is simple enough to re-shape the query, lose the subquery and join the table to itself, employing appropriate selection criteria. This will cause MySQL to see the table as two different things, allowing destructive changes to go ahead.Alternatively, try nesting the subquery deeper into a from clause ...If you absolutely need the subquery, there\'s a workaround, but it\'s\nugly for several reasons, including performance:The nested subquery in the FROM clause creates an implicit temporary\ntable, so it doesn\'t count as the same table you\'re updating. ... but watch out for the query optimiserHowever, beware that from MySQL 5.7.6 and onward, the optimiser may optimise out the subquery, and still give you the error. Luckily, the  optimizer_switch variable can be used to switch off this behaviour; although I couldn\'t recommend doing this as anything more than a short term fix, or for small one-off tasks.Thanks to Peter V. M\xc3\xb8rch for this advice in the comments.Example technique was from Baron Schwartz, originally published at Nabble, paraphrased and extended here.NexusRex provided  a very good solution for deleting with join from the same table.If you do this:you a going to get an error.But if you wrap the condition in one more selectit would do the right thing!!The inner join in your sub-query is unnecessary.  It looks like you want to delete the entries in story_category where the category_id is not in the category table.Do this:Instead of that:Recently i had to update records in the same table i did it like below:This is what I did for updating a Priority column value by 1 if it is >=1 in a table and in its WHERE clause using a subquery on same table to make sure that at least one row contains Priority=1 (because that was the condition to be checked while performing update) :I know it\'s a bit ugly but it does works fine.If you can\'t do because it is the same table, you can trick and do :[update or delete or whatever]You could insert the desired rows\' ids into a temp table and then delete all the rows that are found in that table.which may be what @Cheekysoft meant by doing it in two steps.According to  the Mysql UPDATE Syntax linked by @CheekySoft, it says right at the bottom.Currently, you cannot update a table and select from the same table in a subquery.I guess you are deleting from store_category while still selecting from it in the union.If something does not work, when coming thru the front-door, then take the back-door:It\'s fast. The bigger the data, the better.Try to save result of Select statement in separate variable and then use that for delete query.how about this query hope it helps
