What is the equivalent of Java\'s final in C#?The final keyword has several usages in Java. It corresponds to both the sealed and readonly keywords in C#, depending on the context in which it is used.To prevent subclassing (inheritance from the defined class):Java C#Prevent overriding of a virtual method.JavaC#As Joachim Sauer points out, a notable difference between the two languages here is that Java by default marks all non-static methods as virtual, whereas C# marks them as sealed. Hence, you only need to use the sealed keyword in C# if you want to stop further overriding of a method that has been explicitly marked virtual in the base class.To only allow a variable to be assigned once:JavaC#As a side note, the effect of the readonly keyword differs from that of the const keyword in that the readonly expression is evaluated at runtime rather than compile-time, hence allowing arbitrary expressions.It depends on the context.What everyone here is missing is Java\'s guarantee of definite assignment for final member variables.For a class C with final member variable V, every possible execution path through every constructor of C must assign V exactly once - failing to assign V or assigning V two or more times will result in an error.C#\'s readonly keyword has no such guarantee - the compiler is more than happy to leave readonly members unassigned or allow you to assign them multiple times within a constructor.So, final and readonly (at least with respect to member variables) are definitely not equivalent - final is much more strict.Java class final and method final -> sealed.\nJava member variable final -> readonly for runtime constant, const for compile time constant.No equivalent for Local Variable final and method argument finalhttp://en.csharp-online.net/CSharp_FAQ:_What_are_the_differences_between_CSharp_and_Java_constant_declarationsC# constants are declared using the const keyword for compile time constants or the readonly keyword for runtime constants. The semantics of constants is the same in both the C# and Java languages. As mentioned, sealed is an equivalent of final for methods and classes.As for the rest, it is complicated.Summed up, C# has no direct equivalent of final. While Java lacks some nice features of C#, it is refreshing for me as mostly a Java programmer to see where C# fails to deliver an equivalent.sealed               "sealed and readonly" cannot used for variables. For variables use const keyword to get an equivalent effect.
