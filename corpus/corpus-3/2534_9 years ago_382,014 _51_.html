What is the fastest, easiest tool or method to convert text files between character sets?Specifically, I need to convert from UTF-8 to ISO-8859-15 and vice versa.Everything goes: one-liners in your favorite scripting language, command-line tools or other utilities for OS, web sites, etc.On Linux/UNIX/OS X/cygwin:Gnu iconv suggested by Troels Arvin is best used as a filter. It seems to be universally available. Example:As pointed out by Ben, there is an online converter using iconv.Gnu recode (manual) suggested by Cheekysoft will convert one or several files in-place. Example:This one uses shorter aliases:Recode also supports surfaces which can be used to convert between different line ending types and encodings:Convert newlines from LF (Unix) to CR-LF (DOS):Base64 encode file:You can also combine them.Convert a Base64 encoded UTF8 file with Unix line endings to Base64 encoded Latin 1 file with Dos line endings:On Windows with Powershell (Jay Bazuzi): PS C:\\> gc -en utf8 in.txt | Out-File -en ascii out.txt(No ISO-8859-15 support though; it says that supported charsets are unicode, utf7, utf8, utf32, ascii, bigendianunicode, default, and oem.)Do you mean iso-8859-1 support? Using "String" does this e.g. for vice versaNote: The possible enumeration values are "Unknown, String, Unicode, Byte, BigEndianUnicode, UTF8, UTF7, Ascii".Stand-alone utility approachIf you have vim you can use this:Not tested for every encoding.The cool part about this is that you don\'t have to know the source encodingBe aware that this command modify directly the fileUnder Linux you can use the very powerful recode command to try and convert between the different charsets as well as any line ending issues. recode -l will show you all of the formats and encodings that the tool can convert between. It is likely to be a VERY long list.iconv(1)Also there are iconv-based tools in many languages.The shortest version, if you can assume that the input BOM is correct:I\'ve put this into .bashrc:..to be able to convert files like so:On Windows I was able to use Notepad++ to do the conversion from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8. Click "Encoding" and then "Convert to UTF-8".PHP iconv()iconv("UTF-8", "ISO-8859-15", $input);The character encoding of all matching text files gets detected automatically and all matching text files are converted to utf-8 encoding:To perform these steps, a sub shell sh is used with -exec, running a one-liner with the -c flag, and passing the filename as the positional argument "$1" with -- {}. In between, the utf-8 output file is temporarily named converted.Whereby file -bi means:-b, --brief\nDo not prepend filenames to output lines (brief mode).-i, --mime\nCauses the file command to output mime type strings rather than the more traditional human readable ones.  Thus it may say \xe2\x80\x98text/plain; charset=us-ascii\xe2\x80\x99 rather than \xe2\x80\x9cASCII text\xe2\x80\x9d.The find command is very useful for such file management automation.Click here for more find galore.to write properties file (Java) normally I use this in linux (mint and ubuntu distributions):For example:PS: I writed Execution number one/two in portugues to force special characters.In my case, in first execution I received this message:When I installed the first option (gcj-5-jdk) the problem was finished.I hope this help someone.DOS/Windows: use Code pageCommand chcp can be used to change the code page. Code page 65001 is Microsoft name for UTF-8. After setting code page, the output generated by preceding commands will be of code page set.Yudit editor supports and converts between many different text encodings, runs on linux, windows, mac, etc.-AdamAs described on How do I correct the character encoding of a file? Synalyze It! lets you easily convert on OS X between all encodings supported by the ICU library.Additionally you can display some bytes of a file translated to Unicode from all the encodings to see quickly which is the right one for your file.
