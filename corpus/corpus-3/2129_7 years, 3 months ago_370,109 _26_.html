I want to be able to call the following method after a specified delay.\n In objective c there was something like:Is there an equivalent of this method in android with java?\nFor example I need to be able to call a method after 5 seconds.Better version:I couldn\'t use any of the other answers in my case.\nI used the native java Timer instead.Note: This answer was given when the question didn\'t specify Android as the context. For an answer specific to the Android UI thread look here.It looks like the Mac OS API lets the current thread continue, and schedules the task to run asynchronously. In the Java, the equivalent function is provided by the java.util.concurrent package. I\'m not sure what limitations Android might impose.For executing something in the UI Thread after 5 seconds:Thanks for all the great answers, I found a solution that best suits my needs.you can use Handler inside UIThread:If you have to use the Handler, but you are into another thread, you can use runonuithread to run the handler in UI thread. This will save you from Exceptions thrown asking to call Looper.Prepare()Looks quite messy, but this is one of the way.See this demo:I perfer to use View.postDelayed() method, simple code below:Here is my shortest solution: I suggest the Timer, it allows you to schedule a method to be called on a very specific interval. This will not block your UI, and keep your app resonsive while the method is being executed.The other option, is the wait(); method, this will block the current thread for the specified length of time. This will cause your UI to stop responding if you do this on the UI thread.I created simpler method to call this. To use it, just call : .CallWithDelay(5000, this, "DoSomething");Here is another tricky way: it won\'t throw exception when the runnable change UI elements.}You can call the animation like this:Animation can attach to any view.you can make it much cleaner by using the newly introduced lambda expressions:It\'s very easy using the CountDownTimer.\nFor more details https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/CountDownTimer.htmlA suitable solution in android: If you are using Android Studio 3.0 and above you can use lambda expressions. The method callMyMethod() is called after 2 seconds:
