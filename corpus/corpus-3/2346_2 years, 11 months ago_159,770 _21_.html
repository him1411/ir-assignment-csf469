While attempting to compile my C program, running the following command: Returns:Agreeing to the Xcode/iOS license requires admin privileges, please re-run as root via sudo.and my code does not compile.Why is this happening and how can I fix this problem?Open up Xcode, and accept the new user agreement.  This was happening because a new version of Xcode was downloaded and the new agreement was not accepted.will take care of it with no trouble on the command line.  Note that you\'ll have to manually scroll through the license, and agree to its terms at the end, unless you add "accept" to the command line :Got stuck as I was trying to a go get ... I think it was related to git.\nHere is how was able to fix it ...I entered the following in terminal:This will open the agreement. Go all the way to end and type "agree". That takes care of go get issues.It was quite interesting how unrelated things were.Opening XCode and accepting the license fixes the issue.You don\'t need to fiddle around with any command :) Once the XCode is updated, open the Xcode IDE program. Please accept terms and conditions. You are all set to go :))Follow these steps:Agreeing to the Xcode/iOS license requires admin privileges, please re-run as root via sudo.A new version of OSX or XCode was installed and Apple wants you to agree to their Terms and Conditions. So just launch Xcode and "Agree" to them.If you have similar issues in Intellij do as others said above me :And you are done.!!
