I just downloaded Java 7u17 on Mac OS 10.7.5 from here and then successfully installed it. In order to do some JNI programming, I need to know where Java installed on my Mac. I thought that inside the /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/ folder, there would be a folder called 1.7.0.jdk or something, but then I found that the folder is empty. This was confirmed by running ls /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/ in the Terminal. I\'ve tried searching for it to find out if it was installed somewhere else, but that doesn\'t seem to be turning anything up.Could someone please tell me where Java is installed on my Mac?Use /usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.7 command on a terminal shell to figure out where is your java 1.7 home directoryTurns out that I actually had the Java 7 JRE installed, not the JDK. The correct download link is here. After installing it, jdk1.7.0jdk appears in the JavaVirtualMachines directory.You could use echo $(/usr/libexec/java_home) command in your terminal to know the path where Java being installed. If you install just the JRE, it seems to be put at:Use unix find function to find javas installed...Java package structure of Mac OS is a bit different from Windows. Don\'t be upset for this as a developer just needs to set PATH and JAVA_HOME.So in .bash_profile set JAVA_HOME and PATH as below. This example is for Java 6:I have just installed the JDK for version 21 of Java SE 7 and found that it is installed in a different directory from Apple\'s Java 6. It is in /Library/Java... rather then in /System/Library/Java.... Running /usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.7 versus -v 1.6 will confirm this.Edited: Alias to current java version is /Library/Java/HomeFor more information: a linkI tried serkan\'s solution, it found java 7\'s location on OS X Mavericks.\nit is resided in "/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_51.jdk/"\nbut to make it the default JDK I had to set JAVA_HOME system variable in .bash_profile in home directory to "/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_51.jdk/Contents/Home/"\nso its up and running now thanks to serkan\'s ideajust write /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/\nin Go to Folder --> Go in Finder For : OS X : 10.11.6Java : 8 I confirm the answer of @Morrie . Try This, It\'s easy way to find java installed path,GoTO 1 ) /Library i.e Macintosh HD/Library2) Click on Library in that we find Java folder.3) So final path is Hope This is help for someone .You can find its settings and location details under System Preferences. Also the sudo find command via terminal as suggested by @abimaran will help you as well.The System Preferences then Java control panel then Java then View will show the exact location of the currently installed default JRE.
