I\'m setting up my PostgreSQL 9.1. I can\'t do anything with PostgreSQL: can\'t createdb, can\'t createuser; all operations return the error messageh9uest is my account name, and I sudo apt-get install PostgreSQL 9.1 under this account.\nSimilar error persists for the root account.You probably need to use the system user postgres to create your database - as long as you haven\'t set up (and given the necessary privileges to) a database user named "h9uest" that corresponds to your system user of the same name, so it is enabled by the default ident authentication method.Or the more modern form:As recommended here and here.Then try again.
