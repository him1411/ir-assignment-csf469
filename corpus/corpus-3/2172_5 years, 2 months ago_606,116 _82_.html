Why isn\'t there a fancy file element upload button for twitter bootstrap? it would be sweet if the blue primary button was implemented for the upload button. Is it even possible to finesse the upload button using CSS (seems like a native browser element that cant be manipulated) Here\'s a solution for Bootstrap 3 and 4.To make a functional file input control that looks like a button, you only need HTML:HTMLThis works in all modern browsers, including IE9+. If you need support for old IE as well, please use the legacy approach shown below.This techniques relies on the HTML5 hidden attribute. Bootstrap 4 uses the following CSS to shim this feature in unsupportive browsers. You may need to add if you\'re using Bootstrap 3.If you need support for IE8 and below, use the following HTML/CSS:HTMLCSSNote that old IE doesn\'t trigger the file input when you click on a <label>, so the The CSS "bloat" does a couple things to work around that:I\'ve posted more details about this method, as well as examples for how to show the user which/how many files are selected:http://www.abeautifulsite.net/whipping-file-inputs-into-shape-with-bootstrap-3/Im surprised there was no mention of the <label> element.Solution:No need for any JS, or funky css...Solution for including the filename:The solution above requires jQuery.With no additional plugin required, this bootstrap solution works great for me:demo: http://jsfiddle.net/haisumbhatti/cAXFA/1/ (bootstrap 2)http://jsfiddle.net/haisumbhatti/y3xyU/   (bootstrap 3)It\'s included in Jasny\'s fork of bootstrap.A simple upload button can be created usingWith the fileupload plugin you can create more advanced widgets. Have a look at\nhttp://jasny.github.io/bootstrap/javascript/#fileinputUpload buttons are a pain to style because it styles the input and not the button.but you can use this trick:http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/inputfile.htmlSummary:Take a normal <input type="file"> and put it in an element with position: relative. To this same parent element, add a normal <input> and an image, which have the correct styles. Position these elements absolutely, so that they occupy the same place as the <input type="file">. Set the z-index of the <input type="file"> to 2 so that it lies on top of the styled input/image. Finally, set the opacity of the <input type="file"> to 0. The <input type="file"> now becomes effectively invisible, and the styles input/image shines through, but you can still click on the "Browse" button. If the button is positioned on top of the image, the user appears to click on the image and gets the normal file selection window. (Note that you can\'t use visibility: hidden, because a truly invisible element is unclickable, too, and we need the  to remain clickable)Works for me: jQuery plugin style:With some inspiration from other posts above, here is a full solution that combines what looks like a form-control field with an input-group-addon for a clean file input widget that includes a link to the current file.This works perfectly for meSimplified answer using parts from other answers, primarily user2309766 and dotcomsuperstar.Features:Code:Please check out Twitter Bootstrap File Input.\nIt use very simple solution, just add one javascript file and and paste following code:A simple solution with acceptable outcome:And the style:The following code makes as above the pictureHtmlJavascript/*\n * Bootstrap 3 filestyle\n * http://dev.tudosobreweb.com.br/bootstrap-filestyle/\n *\n * Copyright (c) 2013 Markus Vinicius da Silva Lima\n * Update bootstrap 3 by Paulo Henrique Foxer\n * Version 2.0.0\n * Licensed under the MIT license.\n *\n */I use http://gregpike.net/demos/bootstrap-file-input/demo.html:orI have Created a Custom upload button to accept only images, which can be modified as per your requirement.Hope this helps!! :)(Used Bootstrap framework)Codepen-linkHTMLCSSJSthis is the best file upload style I like:you can get demo and more styles at:http://www.jasny.net/bootstrap/javascript/#fileinputbut using this, you should replace twitter bootstrap with jasny bootstrap files..regards.I modified @claviska answer and works as i like (Bootstrap 3, 4 not tested):No fancy shiz required:HTML:JS:CAUTION: The three form elements in question MUST be siblings of each other (.image-file-chosen, .image-file-button, .image-file)I have the same problem, and i try it like this.The CSSThe JSNote :\n  The button .btn-file must in the same tag as the input fileHope you found the best solution...Try following in the Bootstrap v.3.3.4A new file class for the file upload button has been implemented into BootStrap version 4-alpha which has just been released:\nhttp://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/forms/#file-browser\nVisit the site to see how it looks.
