When I load script/console, some times I want play with the output of a controller or a view helper method.Are there ways to:To call helpers, use the helper object:If you want to use a helper that\'s not included by default (say, because you removed helper :all from ApplicationController), just include the helper.As for dealing with controllers, I quote Nick\'s answer:An easy way to call a controller action from script/console and view/manipulate the response object is:The app object is an instance of ActionController::Integration::SessionThis works for me using Rails 2.1 and 2.3, I did not try earlier versions.If you need to test from the console (tested on Rails 3.1 and 4.1):Call Controller Actions:ApplicationController methods:Route Helpers:View Helpers:Render:ActiveSupport methods:Lib modules:Here\'s one way to do this through the console:Creating a new instance of ActionView::Base gives you access to the normal view methods that your helper likely uses.  Then extending YourHelperModule mixes its methods into your object letting you view their return values.Another way to do this is to use the rails debugger. There\'s a Rails Guide about debugging at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/debugging_rails_applications.htmlBasically, start the server with the -u option:And then insert a breakpoint into your script where you would like to have access to the controllers/helpers/etc..And when you make a request and hit that part in the code, the server console will return a prompt where you can then make requests, view objects, etc.. from a command prompt. When finished, just type \'cont\' to continue execution. There are also options for extended debugging, but this should at least get you started.If method is POST method then[ here parameters will be as per your applicability ]else if it is GET method thenYou can access your methods in Rails Console like followingHere is how to make an authenticated POST request, using Refinery as an example:You might find these useful too if you get an error:In rails 3, try this:Body will contain the HTML of the url.How to route and render (dispatch) from a model in Rails 3The earlier answers are calling helpers but the following will help for calling controller methods.  I have used this on rails 2.3.2.first add the following code to your .irbrc file (which can be in your home directory)then in the rails console you can type something like......and the html will be dumped to the console.One possible aproach for Helper method testing in rails console isStruct.new(:t).extend(YourHelper).your_method(*arg)and for reload and doreload!; Struct.new(:t).extend(YourHelper).your_method(*arg)
