How do I uninstall a .NET Windows Service, if the service files does not exists anymore?I installed a .NET Windows Service using InstallUtil. I have since deleted the files but forgot to runfirst. So the service is still listed in the Services MMC.Do I have to go into the registry? Or is there a better way?You have at least three options. I have presented them in order of usage preference.Method 1 -  You can use the SC tool (Sc.exe) included in the Resource Kit. \n(included with Windows 7/8)Open a Command Prompt and enterTool help snippet follows:Method 2 - use delservDownload and use delserv command line utility. This is a legacy tool developed for Windows 2000. In current Window XP boxes this was superseded by sc described in method 1.Method 3 - manually delete registry entries (Note that this backfires in Windows 7/8)Windows services are registered under the following registry key.Search for the sub-key with the service name under referred key and delete it.From the command prompt, use the Windows "sc.exe" utility.  You will run something like this:Notes on using "sc delete" in Windows 8:  1) Open a CMD window with elevated privileges.  [Windows Key-X to bring up a menu with the option; select "Command Prompt (Admin)".]\n2) Use the parenthetical name from the list in Services [for example, I used "sc delete gupdate" when, in Services, it read "Google Update (gupdate)"]Some people mentioning sc delete as an answer. This is how I did it, but it took me a while to find the <service-name> parameter.The command sc query type= service (note, it\'s very particular with formatting, use the quote exactly) will output a list of Windows services installed, compelete with their qualified name to be used with sc delete <service-name> command.The list is quite long so you may consider piping the output to a text file (ie >> C:\\test.txt) and then searching through that.The SERVICE_NAME is the one to use with sc delete <service-name> command.Remove Windows Service via RegistryIts very easy to remove a service from registry if you know the right path. Here is how I did that:Run Regedit or Regedt32Go to the registry entry "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services"Look for the service that you want delete and delete it. You can look at the keys to know what files the service was using and delete them as well (if necessary).Delete Windows Service via Command WindowAlternatively, you can also use command prompt and delete a service using following command:sc delete You can also create service by using following command sc create "MorganTechService" binpath= "C:\\Program Files\\MorganTechSPace\\myservice.exe"Note: You may have to reboot the system to get the list updated in service manager.If you wish to use a tool for it you could use Process HackerForm to create the service:Context menu on a service to delete it:I find Process Hacker a more convient tool to manage Windows processes and services than Windows\'s own Taskmgr.exe. Especially on Windows XP, where you can\'t access services at all from task manager.I needed to reinstall my tomcat service, which meant first removing it.  This worked for me:(edit the file t.txt, search through the list and find the tomcat service.  It\'s called Tomcat7)HOWEVER, the query command did not work the first time, because the tomcat service was not running.  It seems to only list services that are running.  I had to start the service and run the query command again.If the original Service .InstallLog and .InstallState files are still in the folder, you can try reinstalling the executable to replace the files, then use InstallUtil /u, then uninstall the program.  It\'s a bit convoluted, but worked in a particular instance for me.You can try running Autoruns, which would save you from having to edit the registry by hand. This is especially useful when you don\'t have the needed permissions.You can uninstall your windows service by command prompt also just write this piece of commandcd\\                                                                                      cd C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319(or version in which you developed your service)                                                                            installutil c:\\xxx.exe(physical path of your service) -d1st Step : Move to the Directory where your service is present Command : cd c:\\xxx\\yyy\\service2nd Step : Enter the below command Command : C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\InstallUtil.exe service.exe \\uHere service.exe is your service exe and \\u will uninstall the service. \nyou\'ll see "The uninstall has completed" message.If you wanna install a service, Remove \\u in the above command which will install your service We discovered that even if you run sc_delete, there can be an entry remaining in the registry for your service, so that reinstalling the service results in a corrupted set of registry entries (they don\'t match). What we did was to regedit and remove this leftover entry by hand.\nNote: ShipmunkService is still showing up after sc_delete!Then you can reinstall, and your service will run correctly. Best of luck to you all, and may the force be with you.
