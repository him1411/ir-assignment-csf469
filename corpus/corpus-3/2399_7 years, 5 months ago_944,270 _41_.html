Will this work for testing whether a value at position "index" exists or not, or is there a better way:All arrays in JavaScript contain array.length elements, starting with array[0] up until array[array.length - 1].  By definition, an array element with index i is said to be part of the array if i is between 0 and array.length - 1 inclusive.That is, JavaScript arrays are linear, starting with zero and going to a maximum, and arrays don\'t have a mechanism for excluding certain values or ranges from the array. To find out if a value exists at a given position index (where index is 0 or a positive integer), you literally just useHowever, it is possible for some array values to be null, undefined, NaN, Infinity, 0, or a whole host of different values.  For example, if you add array values by increasing the array.length property, any new values will be undefined.  To determine if a given value is something meaningful, or has been defined.  That is, not undefined, or null:orInterestingly, because of JavaScript\'s comparison rules, my last example can be optimised down to:Can\'t we just do this:Using only ".length" is not safe and will cause an error in some browsers. Here is a better solution:or, we can use:If you mean by \'Null\' -> Its elements are null or equals to \'\' , in this case : Check if the array is empty after filtering all \'null\' elementsOf course ,Add Clean  method before : I would recommend creating a function like this:You could call it like this:Forcing the developer to adhere to the isEmptyEl interface will catch input errors such as an undefined arrayName or indexVal variables.(It\'s generally good practice to program defensively when programming in Javascript.)You would get an error thrown like this if arrayName was not defined:Similar results for an undefined indexVal.You get an error if the array or index values do not exist.For valid input, you\'ll only get a true if arrayName[indexVal] is any of the following:It depends on what you mean with "empty".When you attempt to get the value of a property on an object which has no property with that name, you will get the value undefined.That\'s what happens with sparse arrays: not all indices between 0 and array.length-1 exist.So you could check if array[index] === undefined.However, the property index could exist with an undefined value. If you want to filter out this case, you can use the in operator or hasOwnProperty, as described in How do I check if an object has a property in JavaScript?If you want consider an existing property with an undefined or null value to not exist, you can use the loose comparison array[index] == undefined or array[index] == null.If you know the array is not sparse, you could compare index with array.length. But to be safe, you may want to ensure that index really is an array index, see Check if property name is array indextry this if array[index] is nullWith Lodash, you can do:if(_.has(req,\'documents\')) is to check whether our request object has a property named documents and if it has that prop, the next if (req.documents.length) is to validate if it is not an empty array, so the other stuffs like forEach can be proceeded. To check if it has never been defined or if it was deleted:also works with associative arrays and arrays where you deleted some indexTo check if it was never been defined, was deleted OR is a null or logical empty value (NaN, empty string, false):I ran into this issue using laravel datatables. I was storing a JSON value called properties in an activity log and wanted to show a button based on this value being empty or not.Well, datatables was interpreting this as an array if it was empty, and an object if it was not, therefore, the following solution worked for me:An object does not have a length property.You can use Loadsh library to do this more efficiently, like:if you have an array named "pets", for example:To check all array values for null or undefined values:Check more examples in http://underscorejs.org/
