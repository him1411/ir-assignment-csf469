I have a dictionary: keys are strings, values are integers.Example: I\'d like to get \'b\' as an answer, since it\'s the key with a higher value.I did the following, using an intermediate list with reversed key-value tuples:Is that one the better (or even more elegant) approach?You can use operator.itemgetter for that:And instead of building a new list in memory use stats.iteritems(). The key parameter to the max() function is a function that computes a key that is used to determine how to rank items.Please note that if you were to have another key-value pair \'d\': 3000 that this method will only return one of the two even though they both have the maximum value. I have tested MANY variants, and this is the fastest way to return the key of dict with the max value:To give you an idea, here are some candidate methods:The test dictionary:And the test results under Python 3.2:And under Python 2.7:You can see that f1 is the fastest under Python 3.2 and 2.7 (or, more completely, keywithmaxval at the top of this post)Here is another one:The function key simply returns the value that should be used for ranking and max() returns the demanded element right away.If you don\'t care about value (I\'d be surprised, but) you can do:I like the tuple unpacking better than a [0] subscript at the end of the expression.\nI never like the readability of lambda expressions very much, but find this one better than the operator.itemgetter(1) IMHO.If you need to know only a key with the max value you can do it without iterkeys or iteritems because iteration through dictionary in Python is iteration through it\'s keys.EDIT:From comments, @user1274878 :I am new to python. Can you please explain your answer in steps?Yep...max(iterable[, key])max(arg1, arg2, *args[, key])Return the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more arguments.The optional key argument describes how to compare elements to get maximum among them:Returned values will be compared.Python dict is a hash table. A key of dict is a hash of an object declared as a key. Due to performance reasons iteration though a dict implemented as iteration through it\'s keys.Therefore we can use it to rid operation of obtaining a keys list.A function defined inside another function is called a nested function. Nested functions can access variables of the enclosing scope.The stats variable available through __closure__ attribute of the lambda function as a pointer to the value of the variable defined in the parent scope.Given that more than one entry my have the max value. I would make a list of the keys that have the max value as their value.This will give you \'b\' and any other max key as well.Per the iterated solutions via comments in the selected answer... In Python 3:In Python 2:With collections.Counter you could doIf appropriate, you could simply start with an empty collections.Counter and add to itThanks, very elegant, I didn\'t remember that max allows a "key" parameter.BTW, to get the right answer (\'b\') it has to be:+1 to @Aric Coady\'s simplest solution. \nAnd also one way to random select one of keys with max value in the dictionary:I tested the accepted answer AND @thewolf\'s fastest solution against a very basic loop and the loop was faster than both:results:How about:
