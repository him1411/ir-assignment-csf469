What is the difference between application server and web server?Most of the times these terms Web Server and Application server are used interchangeably.Following are some of the key differences in features of Web Server and Application Server:Example of such configuration is Apache Tomcat HTTP Server and Oracle (formerly BEA) WebLogic Server. Apache Tomcat HTTP Server is Web Server and Oracle WebLogic is Application Server.In some cases the servers are tightly integrated such as IIS and .NET Runtime. IIS is web server. When equipped with .NET runtime environment, IIS is capable of providing application services.Both terms are very generic, one containing the other one and vice versa in some cases.Web server: serves content to the web using http protocol.Application server: hosts and exposes business logic and processes.I think that the main point is that the web server exposes everything through the http protocol, while the application server is not restricted to it.That said, in many scenarios you will find that the web server is being used to create the front-end of the application server, that is, it exposes a set of web pages that allow the user to interact with the business rules found into the application server.This is a detailed answer with some scenarios to clearly understand the difference,similarity and how both can work in conjunction and allApplication Server is a term that sometimes is mixed with a web server. While a web server handles mainly HTTP protocols, the application server deals with several different protocols, including, but not limited, to HTTP.The Web server\'s main job is to display the site content and the application server is in charge of the logic, the interaction between the user and the displayed content. The application server is working in conjunction with the web server, where one displays and the other one interacts.The information traveling back and forth between the server and its client is not restricted to simple display markup, but to interaction between the two.In most cases, the server creates this interaction through a component API, such as J2EE (Java 2 Platform), EJB (Enterprise JavaBean) and other different application software models.An example:The best way to understand the difference between the scenarios where an application server works with the web server versus a scenario where there isn\'t an application server is through an online store.Scenario 1: Web server without an application server you have an online store with only a web server and no application server. The site will provide a display where you can choose a product from. When you submit a query, the site performs a lookup and returns an HTML result back to its client. The web server sends your query directly to the database server (be patient, I will explain this one in our next nugget) and waits for a response. Once received, the web server formulates the response into an HTML file and sends it to your web browser. This back and forth communication between the server and database server happens every time a query is run.Scenario 2: Web server with an application serverif the query you want to run has already been done previously and no data has changed since then, the server will generate the results without having to send the request to the database server. This allows a real-time query where a second client can access the same info and receive real time, reliable information without sending another duplicate query to the database server. The server basically acts as an intermediate between the database server and the web server. This allows the information pulled to be reusable while in the first scenario, since this info is embedded in a particular and "customized" HTML page, this is not a reusable process. A second client will have to request the info again and receive another HTML embedded page with the info requested -highly inefficient. Not to mention that this type of server is very flexible due to its ability to manage its own resources, including security, transaction processing, messaging and resource pooling.To support such a variety of complex tasks this server must have a built in redundancy, great processing power and high amount of RAM to handle all the data it\'s pulling in real time.Hope this helps.As Rutesh and jmservera pointed out, the distinction is a fuzzy one.  Historically, they were different, but through the 90\'s these two previously distinct categories blended features and effectively merged.  At this point is is probably best to imagine that the "App Server" product category is a strict superset of the "web server" category.Some history.  In early days of the Mosaic browser and hyperlinked content, there evolved this thing called a "web server" that served web page content and images over HTTP. Most of the content was static, and the HTTP 1.0 protocol was just a way to ship files around.  Quickly the "web server" category evolved to include CGI capability - effectively launching a process on each web request to generate dynamic content.  HTTP also matured and the products became more sophisticated, with caching, security, and management features. As the technology matured, we got company-specific Java-based server-side technology from Kiva and NetDynamics, which eventually all merged into JSP.  Microsoft added ASP, I think in 1996, to Windows NT 4.0. The static web server had learned some new tricks, so that it was an effective "app server" for many scenarios. In a parallel category, the app server had evolved and existed for a long time. companies delivered products for Unix like Tuxedo, TopEnd, Encina that were philosophically derived from Mainframe application management and monitoring environments like IMS and CICS. Microsoft\'s offering was Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS), which later evolved into COM+. Most of these products specified "closed" product-specific communications protocols to interconnect "fat" clients to servers.  (For Encina, the comms protocol was DCE RPC; for MTS it was DCOM; etc.) In 1995/96, these traditional app server products began to embed basic HTTP communication capability, at first via gateways. And the lines began to blur.Web servers got more and more mature with respect to handling higher loads, more concurrency, and better features. App servers delivered more and more HTTP-based communication capability.  At this point the line between "app server" and "web server" is a fuzzy one.   But people continue to use the terms differently, as a matter of emphasis. When someone says "web server" you often think HTTP-centric, web UI, oriented apps. When someone says "App server" you may think "heavier loads, enterprise features, transactions and queuing, multi-channel communication (HTTP + more).  But often it is the same product that serves both sets of workload requirements.  As many have said before, web servers handle HTTP petitions, while application servers handle petitions for distributed components.\nSo, maybe the easiest way to understand the difference is to compare the two products in regards to programming environment they offer. IIS :                             ASP (.NET)Tomcat :                          ServletJetty :                            ServletApache :                          Php, CGI                                                    MTS :                                COM+WAS :                               EJBJBoss :                              EJBWebLogic Application Server :        EJBThe crucial difference is that application servers support some distributed component technology, providing features like remote invocation and distributed transactions, like EJB in Java world or COM+ on Microsoft platform. Http server often support some more simple programming environments, often scripting, like ASP (.NET) in case of Microsoft or Servlet--based, including JSP and many other in case of Java or PHP and CGI in case of Apache.Other capabilities like load-balancing, clustering, session-failover, connection pooling etc. that used to be in the realm of application servers, are becoming available on web servers as well directly or through some third party products.Finally, it is worth noting that the picture is further distorted with "lightweight containers" like Spring Framework, that often supplement the purpose of application servers in more simple manner and without the application server infrastructure. And since distribution aspect in applications is moving from distributed component towards service paradigm and SOA architecture, there is less and less space left for traditional application servers.Web serverRun python -m \'SimpleHTTPServer\' and go to http://localhost:8080. What you see is a web server at its workings. The server simply serves files over HTTP stored on your computer. The key point is that all this is done on top of the HTTP protocol. There also exist FTP servers for example which do exactly the same thing (serving stored files) but on top of a different protocol.Application serverSay we have a tiny application like below (snippet from Flask).The small example program maps the URL / to the function homepage() and the /about to the function about().To run this code we need an application server - a program or module that can listen for requests from a client and using our code, return something dynamically. In the example we simply return some very bad HTML.What\'s the business logic all the other people talk about? Well, since a URL maps to somewhere specifically in our codebase, we are hypothetically showing some logic about how our program works.Recappingweb server - serves files stored somewhere (most commonly .css, .html, .js). Common web servers are Apache, Nginx or even Python\'s SimpleHTTPServer.application server - serves files generated on the fly. Essentially most web servers have some sort of plugins or even come with built-in functionality to do that. There exist also strict application servers like Gunicorn (Python), Unicorn (Ruby), uWSGI (Python), etc.Notice that you can actually build a web server with the code of the application server. This is done in some cases during development where you do not want to have a gazillion of different servers running on your computer.A Web server exclusively handles HTTP/HTTPS requests. It serves content to the web using HTTP/HTTPS protocol.An application server serves business logic to application programs through any number of protocols, possibly including HTTP.  The application program can use this logic just as it would call a method on an object.  In most cases, the server exposes this business logic through a component API, such as the EJB (Enterprise JavaBean) component model found on Java EE (Java Platform, Enterprise Edition) application servers.\nThe main point is that the web server exposes everything through the http protocol, while the application server is not restricted to it.\nAn application server thus offers much more services than an web server which typically include:Most of the application servers have Web Server as integral part of them, that means App Server can do whatever Web Server is capable of.  Additionally App Server have components and features to support Application level services such as Connection Pooling, Object Pooling, Transaction Support, Messaging services etc. An application server can (but doesn\'t always) run on a web server to execute program logic, the results of which can then be delivered by the web server. That\'s one example of a web server/application server scenario.\nA good example in the Microsoft world is the Internet Information Server / SharePoint Server relationship. IIS is a web server; SharePoint is an application server. SharePoint sits "on top" of IIS, executes specific logic, and serves the results via IIS.\nIn the Java world, there\'s a similar scenario with Apache and Tomcat, for example.As web servers are well suited for static content and app servers for dynamic content, most of the production environments have web server acting as reverse proxy to app server. That means while service a page request, static contents such as images/Static html is served by web server that interprets the request. Using some kind of filtering technique (mostly extension of requested resource) web server identifies dynamic content request and transparently forwards to app server.Example of such configuration is Apache HTTP Server and BEA WebLogic Server. Apache HTTP Server is Web Server and BEA WebLogic is Application Server.\nIn some cases, the servers are tightly integrated such as IIS and .NET Runtime. IIS is web server. when equipped with .NET runtime environment IIS is capable of providing application servicesIn short a web server is a server that serves web pages to users via http.  An application server is a server that hosts the business logic for a system.  It often hosts both long running/batch processes and/or a interop services not meant for human consumption (REST/JSON services, SOAP, RPC, etc).A web server runs the HTTP protocol to serve web pages. An application server can (but doesn\'t always) run on a web server to execute program logic, the results of which can then be delivered by the web server. That\'s one example of a web server/application server scenario.A good example in the Microsoft world is the Internet Information Server / SharePoint Server relationship. IIS is a web server; SharePoint is an application server. SharePoint sits "on top" of IIS, executes specific logic, and serves the results via IIS.In the Java world, there\'s a similar scenario with Apache and Tomcat, for example.An application server is typically designed and deployed to facilitate longer running processes that will also be more resource intensive.A web server is used for short bursts that are not resource intensive, generally.  This is mostly to facilitate serving up web based traffic.In Java terms there\'s one more: web container (or more strictly, servlet container). It\'s, say, in between web server and application server. An web container is in Java terms an application server which basically only implements the JSP/Servlet part of Java EE and lacks several core parts of Java EE, such as EJB support. An example is Apache Tomcat.The border between these two are getting ever so thinner.Application servers exposes business logic to a client. So its like application server comprises of a set of methods(not necessarily though, can even be a networked computer allowing many to run software on it) to perform business logic. So it will simply output the desired results, not HTML content. (similar to a method call). So it is not strictly HTTP based.But web servers passes HTML content to web browsers (Strictly HTTP based). Web servers were capable of handling only the static web resources, but the emergence of server side scripting helped web servers to handle dynamic contents as well. Where web server takes the request and directs it to the script (PHP, JSP, CGI scripts, etc.) to CREATE HTML content to be sent to the client. Then web server knows how to send them back to client. BECAUSE that\'s what a web server really knows.Having said that, nowadays developers use both of these together.\nWhere web server takes the request and then calls a script to create the HTML, BUT script will again call an application server LOGIC (e.g. Retrieve transaction details) to fill the HTML content.So in this case both the servers were used effectively. Therefore ....\nWe can fairly safely say that in nowadays, in most of the cases, web servers are used as a subset of application servers. BUT theatrically it is NOT the case.I have read many articles about this topic and found this article quite handy.On a first hand, a web server serves web content (HTML and static content) over the HTTP protocol. On the other hand, an application server is a container upon which you can build and expose business logic and processes to client applications through various protocols including HTTP in a n-tier architecture. An application server thus offers much more services than an web server which typically include:AFAIK, ATG Dynamo was one of the very first application server in late 90\'s (according to the definition above). In early 2000, it was the reign of some proprietary application servers like ColdFusion (CFML AS), BroadVision (Server-side JavaScript AS), etc. But none really survived the Java application server era. An application server is a machine (an executable process running on some machine, actually) that "listens" (on any channel, using any protocol), for requests from clients for whatever service it provides, and then does something based on those requests.  (may or may not involve a respose to the client)A Web server is process running on a machine that "listens" specifically on TCP/IP Channel using one of the "internet" protocols, (http, https, ftp, etc..)  and does whatever it does based on those incoming requests... Generally, (as origianly defined), it fetched/generated and returned an html web page to the client, either fetched from a static html file on the server, or constructed dynamically based on parameters in the incoming client request.Biggest difference is a Web Server handles HTTP requests, while an Application server will execute business logic on any number of protocols.There is not necessarily a clear dividing line.  Nowadays, many programs combine elements of both - serving http requests (web server) and handling business logic (app server)A Web server can be either a computer program or a computer running a program that is responsible for accepting HTTP requests from clients, serving back HTTP responses along with optional data contents, which usually are web pages such as HTML documents and linked objects on it. An application server is the kind of software engine that will deliver various applications to another device. It is the kind of computer found in an office or university network that allows everyone in the network to run software off of the same machine.All of the above is just over-complicating something very simple. An application server contains a web server, an application server just has a couple more additions/extensions to it than standard web servers. If you look at TomEE as an example:You will see that Tomcat (Web container/server) is just another tool in the app servers arsenal. You can get JPA and the other tech in the web server as well if you want, but the application servers just package all of these things for your convenience. To be fully classified as an app server you essentially need to comply with a list of tools set forth by some standard.While there may be overlaps between the two (some web servers may even be used as application servers) the biggest difference IMHO is in the processing model and the session management:In Web server processing model, the focus is on handling requests; the notion of "session" is pretty much virtual. That  is to say that "session" is simulated by transferring the representation of state between client and server (hence REST) and/or serializing it to an external persistent storage (SQL Server, Memcached etc). In Application server the session is usually more explicit and often takes form of an object living in memory of the application server for the entire duration of the "session".Actually Apache is a web server and Tomcat is an application server. When as HTTP request comes to web server. Then static contents send back to browser by web server. Is there and logic do to done, then that request send to the application server. after processing the logic then response send to web server and send to the client.It depends on the specific architecture.  Some application servers may use web protocols natively (XML/RPC/SOAP over HTTP), so there is little technical difference.  Typically a web server is user-facing, serving a variety of content over HTTP/HTTPS, while an application server is not user-facing and may use non-standard or non-routable protocols.  Of course with RIA/AJAX, the difference could be further clouded, serving only non-HTML content (JSON/XML) to clients pumping particular remote access services.On a first hand, a web server serves web content (HTML and static content) over the HTTP protocol. On the other hand, an application server is a container upon which you can build and expose business logic and processes to client applications through various protocols including HTTP in a n-tier architecture.An application server thus offers much more services than an web server which typically include:Application server and web server in Java both are used to host Java web application. On  Java J2EE perspective main difference between web server and application server is support of EJB. In order to run EJB or host enterprise Java application (.ear) file you need an application server like JBoss, WebLogic, WebSphere or Glassfish, while you can still run your servlet and JSP or java web application (.war) file inside any web server like Tomcat or Jetty.\n Application Server supports distributed transaction and EJB. While Web Server only supports Servlets and JSP.\nIn terms of logical difference between web server and application server. web server is supposed to provide http protocol level service while application server provides support to web service and expose business level service e.g. EJB.Application server are more heavy than web server in terms of resource utilization.
