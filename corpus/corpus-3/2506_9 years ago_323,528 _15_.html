If I am given a MemoryStream that I know has been populated with a String, how do I get a String back out?This sample shows how to read and write a string to a MemoryStream. You can also useI don\'t think this is less efficient, but I couldn\'t swear to it.  It also lets you choose a different encoding, whereas using a StreamReader you\'d have to specify that as a parameter.Using a StreamReader to convert the MemoryStream to a String.use a StreamReader, then you can use the ReadToEnd method that returns a string.Previous solutions wouldn\'t work in cases where encoding is involved. Here is - kind of a "real life" - example how to do this properly... This sample shows how to read a string from a MemoryStream, in which I\'ve used a serialization (using DataContractJsonSerializer), pass the string from some server to client, and then, how to recover the MemoryStream from the string passed as parameter, then, deserialize the MemoryStream.I\'ve used parts of different posts to perform this sample.Hope that this helps.In this case, if you really want to use ReadToEnd method in MemoryStream with an easy way, you can use this Extension Method to achieve this:And you can use this method in this way:A slightly modified version of Brian\'s answer allows optional management of read start, This seems to be the easiest method.  probably not the most efficient, but easy to understand and use.Why not make a nice extension method on the MemoryStream type?Of course, be careful when using these methods in conjunction with the standard ones. :) ...you\'ll need to use that handy streamLock if you do, for concurrency.
