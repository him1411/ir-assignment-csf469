I saw a screencast where someone had gotten  to work. When I do it I get an error asking me if I meant something else.\nBeing a git newb, I need to know what you have to do to get this done?Basically you just need to add lines to ~/.gitconfigOr you can use the git config alias command:On unix, use single quotes if the alias has a space:On windows, use double quotes if the alias has a space or a command line argument:The alias command even accepts functions as parameters. Take a look at aliases.As others have said the appropriate way to add git aliases is in your global .gitconfig file either by editing ~/.gitconfig or by using the git config --global alias.<alias> <git-command> commandBelow is a copy of the alias section of my ~/.gitconfig file:Also, if you\'re using bash, I would recommend setting up bash completion by copying git-completion.bash to your home directory and sourcing it from your ~/.bashrc. (I believe I learned about this from the Pro Git online book.) On Mac OS X, I accomplished this with the following commands:Note: The bash completion will work not only for the standard git commands but also for your git aliases.Finally, to really cut down on the keystrokes, I added the following to my ~/.bash_aliases file, which is sourced from ~/.bashrc:I think the most useful gitconfig is like this,we always use the 20% function in git,you can try the "g ll",it is amazing,the details:You need the git config alias command. Execute the following in a Git repository:For global alias:This will create an alias st for status:git config --add alias.st statusThis worked for me:on:Follwing are the 4 git shortcuts or aliases youc an use to save time.Open the commandline and type these below 4 commands and use the shortcuts after.Now test them!You can alias both git and non-git commands. It looks like this was added in version 1.5. A snippet from the git config --help page on version 2.5.4 on my Mac shows:If the alias expansion is prefixed with an exclamation point, it will be treated as a shell command.For example, in your global .gitconfig file you could have:And then run them:It is given here Aliases.Even there are great answers here, I added this because \nit differs in windows and linuxJust to get the aliases even shorter than the standard git config way mentioned in other answers, I created an npm package mingit (npm install -g mingit) so that most commands would become 2 characters instead of 2 words.  Here\'s the examples:and other commands would be similarly short.  This also keeps bash completions.  The package adds a bash function to your dotfiles, works on osx, linux, and windows.  Also, unlike the other aliases, it aliases git -> g as well as the second parameter.You can also chain commands if you use the \'!\' operator to spawn a shell:This will both add all files and give you a status report with $ git aa.For a handy way to check your aliases, add this alias:Then a quick $ git alias gives you your current aliases and what they do.For those looking to execute shell commands in a git alias, for example:In my terminal will push force the current branch to my origin repo:Where the command returns the current branch.So this is a shortcut for manually typing the branch name:Another possibility for windows would be to have a directory filled with .bat files that have your shortcuts in them. The name of the file is the shortcut to be used. Simply add the directory to your PATH environment variable and you have all the shortcuts to your disposal in the cmd window.For example (gc.bat):Then you can execute the following command in the console:The reason I\'m adding this as an answer is because when using this you aren\'t limited to git ... only commands.If you want an alternative to the ~/.gitconfig option and open to digging in a little more, another option is to write entirely custom git commands by wrapping them in a global node package. In your package.json, you\'d define the root command (example: gt), and then filter the specific commands to execute the correct git commands. For example, git checkout my-branch could be gt co mybranch.The "christian-git" package on npm uses this method: https://github.com/alexmacarthur/christian-git
