After spending a whole day installing a fresh copy of Mac OS X v10.8 (Mountain Lion), Xcode 5, fixing provisioning profiles, certificates, creating new ones, I finally managed to get my applications running on my iPad again. The problem is that in Xcode 5 I don\'t have a menu item for Library - Provisioning Profiles, and I don\'t know what could have happened. I restarted the computer, tried some things, but I really have no idea what I could do. How can I fix this problem?These settings have now moved to Preferences > Accounts:If you like to manually manage your profiles (mostly to clean up):No longer supported ... you can also download Apple\'s iPhone Configuration Utility 3.5 for Mac OS X, it still has "Provisioning Profiles" and works with Xcode 5 -- it\'s now gone from Apples site but you can find an alternative download link in @suda\'s comment.Provisioning files are located in:Just remove the out-of-date files.Xcode 5 lost my Mac Provisioning Profile while the one for iOS was present. The tips elsewhere helped solve the problem; this is what I did, because I noticed the lists were too short and did not include *Mac Team Provisioning Profile: **Try this:Xcode >> Preferences >> AccountsYou can add account in the preference -> Accounts setting.It seems that you already configure xCode4, then I think you can select your\ncertificates for compiling in project-> Building Setting directly since your\ncertificates are already in your keychain.After searching a few times in google, i found one software for provisioning profiles.Install this iPhone configuration utility software and manage your all provisioning profiles in MAC. Stupid as it may sound but all "Provisioning Profiles" re-appear under "Organizer - Devices" once you connect a real device.For me, the refresh in xcode 5 prefs->accounts was doing nothing.  At one point it showed me three profiles so I thought I was one refresh away, but after the next refresh it went back to just one profile, so I abandoned this method.If anyone gets this far and is still struggling, here\'s what I did:When I did this, everything synced up perfectly. It even told me what it was downloading each step of the way like good software does.  After the sync completed, I closed xcode 4.6.2, re-opened xcode 5 and went to preferences->accounts and voila, all of my profiles are now available in xocde 5.
