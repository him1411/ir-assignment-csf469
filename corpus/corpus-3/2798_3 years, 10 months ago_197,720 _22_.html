This may be a really stupid question, but I just can\'t figure it out. I\'ve just started using Android Studio (IntelliJ), and I now look for the feature to find the occurrence of a string in any of the files in my project. For example: I want to find all the files that contain the string ".getUuid()"The search at the top right doesn\'t give me the correct results, and I don\'t think I can find this feature under Edit > Find..Could anybody point me at the right direction? Any help would be really really welcome!First of all, this IDEA has a nice "Find Usages" command. It can be found in the context menu, when the cursor is on some field, method, etc. It\'s context-aware, and as far as I know, is the best way to find class, method or field usage.Alternatively, you can use the Edit > Find > Find in path\xe2\x80\xa6dialog, which allows you to search the whole workspace.Also in IDEA 13 there is an awesome "Search Everywhere" option, by default called by double Shift. It allows you to search in project, files, classes, settings, and so on.Also you can search from Project Structure dialog with "Find in Path\xe2\x80\xa6". Just call it by right mouse button on concrete directory and the search will be scoped, only inside that directory and it\'s sub-directory.Enjoy!In Android Studio on a Windows or Linux based machine use shortcut Ctrl + Shift + F to search any string in whole project. It\'s easy to remember considering Ctrl + F is used to search in the current file. So just press the Shift as well.On OSX use the  Command key instead of  Ctrl Press Shift twice and a Search Everywhere dialog will appear.Use Ctrl + Shift + F combination for Windows and Linux to search everywhere, it shows preview also.Use Ctrl + F combination for Windows and Linux to search in current file.Use Shift + Shift (Double Tap Shift) combination for Windows and Linux to search Project File of Project.And for all of us who use Eclipse keymaps the shortcut is Ctrl+H. Expect limited options compared to eclipse or you will be disappointed.What you want to reach is that, I believe:Besides shift + cmd + f for find in path && double shift to search anywhere.\nPlay with those and you will know what satisfy your need.In Android Studio on a Windows or Linux based machine use shortcut Ctrl + Shift + R to search and replace any string in the whole project.Use Ctrl + Alt + F combination in Ubuntu.
