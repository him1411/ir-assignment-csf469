I have code that looks like this:I\'d like to use jQuery to add the following to the list:I tried this:But that adds the new li inside the last li (just before the closing tag), not after it.  What\'s the best way to add this li?This would do it:Two things:You can do it also in more \'object way\' and still easy-to-read:You don\'t have to fight with quotes then, but must keep trace of braces :)How about using "after" instead of "append".".after()" can insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements.If you are simply adding text in that li, you can use:You should append to the container, not the last element:The append() function  should\'ve probably been called add() in jQuery because it sometimes confuses people. You would think it appends something after the given element, while it actually adds it to the element.jQuery comes with the following options which could fulfil your need in this case:append is used to add an element at the end of the parent div specified in the selector:prepend is used to add an element at the top/start of the parent div specified in the selector:insertAfter lets you insert an element of your selection next after an element you specify.

It would look something like this:Happy coding :)This is another oneeasyThis is the shortest way you can do that Where blocks in an array. and you need to loop through the array.
