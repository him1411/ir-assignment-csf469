I\'m trying to scp a file from a remote server to my local machine. Only port 80 is accessible.I tried:but got this error: cp: 80: No such file or directoryHow do I specify the port number in a scp command?Unlike ssh, scp uses the uppercase P switch to set the port instead of the lowercase p:The lowercase p switch is used with scp for the preservation of times and modes.Here is an excerpt from scp\'s man page with all of the details concerning the two switches, as well as an explanation of why uppercase P was chosen for scp:-P port   Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host. Note that this option is written with a capital \'P\', because -p is already\n  reserved for preserving the times and modes of the file in rcp(1). -p           Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from the original file.I\'m using different ports then standard and copy files between files like this:This is only for occasional use, if it repeats itself based on a schedule you should use rsync and cron job to do it.One additional hint. Place the \'-P\' option after the scp command, no matter whether the machine you are ssh-ing into is the second one (aka destination). Example:You know what\'s cooler than -P? nothingIf you use this server more than a few times, setup/create a ~/.ssh/config file with an entry like:orThen you can use:scp username@www.myserver.com:/root/file.txt .orscp short:/root/file.txt .You can use anything on the "Host" line with ssh, scp, rsync, git & moreThere are MANY configuration option that you can use in config files, see:man ssh_configscp help tells us that port is specified by uppercase P. Hope this helps.Copying\xc2\xa0file\xc2\xa0to\xc2\xa0host:\nscp\xc2\xa0SourceFile\xc2\xa0remoteuser@remotehost:/directory/TargetFileCopying\xc2\xa0file\xc2\xa0from\xc2\xa0host:\nscp\xc2\xa0user@host:/directory/SourceFile\xc2\xa0TargetFileCopying\xc2\xa0directory\xc2\xa0recursively\xc2\xa0from\xc2\xa0host:\nscp\xc2\xa0-r\xc2\xa0user@host:/directory/SourceFolder\xc2\xa0TargetFolderNOTE:\xc2\xa0If\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0host\xc2\xa0is\xc2\xa0using\xc2\xa0a\xc2\xa0port\xc2\xa0other\xc2\xa0than\xc2\xa0port\xc2\xa022,\xc2\xa0you\xc2\xa0can\xc2\xa0specify\xc2\xa0it\xc2\xa0with\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0-P\xc2\xa0option:\nscp\xc2\xa0-P\xc2\xa02222\xc2\xa0user@host:/directory/SourceFile\xc2\xa0TargetFile
