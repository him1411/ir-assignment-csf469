I have a generic method with this (dummy) code (yes I\'m aware IList has predicates, but my code is not using IList but some other collection, anyway this is irrelevant for the question...)This gives me a build error "Cannot convert null to type parameter\n  \'T\' because it could be a value type.\n  Consider using \'default(T)\' instead."Can I avoid this error?Two options:You can just adjust your constraints:Then returning null is allowed.Add the class constraint as the first constraint to your generic type.Your other option would be to to add this to the end of your declaration:That way it will allow you to return null.If you have object then need to typecast    if you need to return null. solution of TheSoftwareJedi works,also you can archive it with using couple of value and nullable types:Take the recommendation of the error... and either user default(T) or new T.You will have to add in a comparison in your code to ensure that it was a valid match if you go that route.Otherwise, potentially consider an output parameter for "match found".Here\'s a working example for Nullable Enum return values:Below are the two option you can useor
