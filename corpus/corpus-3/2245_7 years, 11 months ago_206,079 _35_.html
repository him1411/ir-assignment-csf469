What is the best way to implement a Stack and a Queue in JavaScript?I\'m looking to do the shunting-yard algorithm and I\'m going to need these data-structures.taken from "9 javascript tips you may not know"Javascript has push and pop methods, which operate on ordinary Javascript array objects.For queues, look here:http://safalra.com/web-design/javascript/queues/Queues can be implemented in\n  JavaScript using either the push and\n  shift methods or unshift and pop\n  methods of the array object. Although\n  this is a simple way to implement\n  queues, it is very inefficient for\n  large queues \xe2\x80\x94 because the methods\n  operate on arrays, the shift and\n  unshift methods move every element in\n  the array each time they are called.Queue.js is a simple and efficient queue implementation for JavaScript whose dequeue function runs in amortised constant time. As a result, for larger queues it can be significantly faster than using arrays.Arrays.Stack:Queue:If you wanted to make your own data structures, you could build your own:And for queue:My implementation of Stack and Queue using Linked ListOr else you can use two arrays to implement queue data structure.If I pop the elements now then the output will be 3,2,1.\nBut we want FIFO structure so you can do the following.The regular Array structure in Javascript is a Stack (first in, last out) and can also be used as a Queue (first in, first out) depending on the calls you make.Check this link to see how to make an Array act like a Queue:QueuesNo Array(s)   Javascript array shift() is slow especially when holding many elements. I know two ways to implement queue with amortized O(1) complexity. First is by using circular buffer and table doubling. I have implemented this before. You can see my source code here \nhttps://github.com/kevyuu/rapid-queueThe second way is by using two stack. This is the code for queue with two stackThis is performance comparison using jsPerfCircularQueue.shift() vs Array.shift()http://jsperf.com/rapidqueue-shift-vs-array-shiftAs you can see it is significantly faster with large datasetHere is a fairly simple queue implementation with two aims:The stack implementation shares the second aim only.Here is the linked list version of a queue that also includes the last node, as suggested by @perkins and as is most appropriate.If you understand stacks with push() and pop() functions, then queue is just to make one of these operations in the oposite sense. Oposite of push() is unshift() and oposite of pop() es shift().\nThen:You can use your own customize class based on the concept, here the code snippet which you can use to do the stuffand to check this use your console and try these line one by one.Create a pair of classes that provide the various methods that each of these data structures has (push, pop, peek, etc).  Now implement the methods.  If you\'re familiar with the concepts behind stack/queue, this should be pretty straightforward. You can implement the stack with an array, and a queue with a linked list, although there are certainly other ways to go about it.  Javascript will make this easy, because it is weakly typed, so you don\'t even have to worry about generic types, which you\'d have to do if you were implementing it in Java or C#.
