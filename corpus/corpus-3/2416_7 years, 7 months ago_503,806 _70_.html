I can create an array and initialize it like this:How do I create a std::vector and initialize it similarly elegant?The best way I know is:Is there a better way?One method would be to use the array to initialize the vectorIf your compiler supports C++11, you can simply do:This is available in GCC as of version 4.4. Unfortunately, VC++ 2010 seems to be lagging behind in this respect.Alternatively, the Boost.Assign library uses non-macro magic to allow the following:Or:But keep in mind that this has some overhead (basically, list_of constructs a std::deque under the hood) so for performance-critical code you\'d be better off doing as Yacoby says.In C++0x you will be able to do it in the same way that you did with an array, but not in the current standard.With only language support you can use:If you can add other libraries you could try boost::assignment:To avoid hardcoding the size of an array:Just thought I\'d toss in my $0.02.  I tend to declare this:in a utility header somewhere and then all that\'s required is:But I can\'t wait for C++0x.  I\'m stuck because my code must also compile in Visual Studio. Boo.In C++11:Using boost list_of:Using boost assign:Conventional STL:Conventional STL with generic macros:Conventional STL with a vector initializer macro:Before C++ 11 : Method 1=>Method 2 =>C++ 11 onward below is also possibleStarting with:If you don\'t have a C++11 compiler and you don\'t want to use boost:If you don\'t have a C++11 compiler and can use boost:If you do have a C++11 compiler:The easiest way to do it is:If your compiler supports Variadic macros (which is true for most modern compilers), then you can use the following macro to turn vector initialization into a one-liner:With this macro, you can define an initialized vector with code like this:This would create a new vector of ints named my_vector with the elements 1, 2, 3, 4.If you don\'t want to use boost, but want to enjoy syntax likejust include this chunk of codeyou can do that using boost::assign.detail hereIn C++11:I build my own solution using va_arg. This solution is C98 compliant.DemoA more recent duplicate question has this answer by Viktor Sehr. For me, it is compact, visually appealing (looks like you are \'shoving\' the values in), doesn\'t require c++11 or a third party module, and avoids using an extra (written) variable. Below is how I am using it with a few changes. I may switch to extending the function of vector and/or va_arg in the future intead.For vector initialisation - can be done if you have c++11 compiler.Else, you can have an array of the data and then use a for loop.Apart from these, there are various other ways described above using some code. In my opinion, these ways are easy to remember and quick to write.Below methods can be used to initialize the vector in c++.int arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 6};\nvector<int> v(arr, arr + sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]));vector<int>v;\nv.push_back(1);\nv.push_back(2);\nv.push_back(3); and so onvector<int>v = {1, 3, 5, 7};The third one is allowed only in C++11 onwards. If you want something on the same general order as Boost::assign without creating a dependency on Boost, the following is at least vaguely similar:While I wish the syntax for using it was cleaner, it\'s still not particularly awful:To compile use: There are a lot of good answers here, but since I independently arrived at my own before reading this, I figured I\'d toss mine up here anyway...Here\'s a method that I\'m using for this which will work universally across compilers and platforms:Create a struct or class as a container for your collection of objects. Define an operator overload function for <<.You can create functions which take your struct as a parameter, e.g.:Then, you can call that function, like this:That way, you can build and pass a dynamically sized collection of objects to a function in one single clean line!"How do I create an STL vector and initialize it like the above? What is the best way to do so with the minimum typing effort?"The easiest way to initialize a vector as you\'ve initialized your built-in array is using an initializer list which was introduced in C++11.ivec is 3 elements in size after Assigning (labeled statement) is executed.Related, you can use the following if you want to have a vector completely ready to go in a quick statement (e.g. immediately passing to another function):example functionexample usethough be careful about the decltype, make sure the first value is clearly what you want.B. Stroustrup describes a nice way to chain operations in 16.2.10 Selfreference on page 464 in the C++11 edition of the Prog. Lang. where a function returns a reference, here modified to a vector. This way you can chain like v.pb(1).pb(2).pb(3); but may be too much work for such small gains.1\n  2\n  3
