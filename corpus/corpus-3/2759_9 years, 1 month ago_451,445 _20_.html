Without local access to the server, is there any way to duplicate/clone a MySQL db (with content and without content) into another without using mysqldump?I am currently using MySQL 4.0.I can see you said you didn\'t want to use mysqldump, but I reached this page while looking for a similar solution and others might find it as well. With that in mind, here is a simple way to duplicate a database from the command line of a windows server:mysqldump -h [server] -u [user] -p[password] db1 | mysql -h [server] -u [user] -p[password] db2Note: There is NO space between -p and [password]You can duplicate a table without data by running:(See the MySQL CREATE TABLE Docs)You could write a script that takes the output from SHOW TABLES from one database and copies the schema to another. You should be able to reference schema+table names like:As far as the data goes, you can also do it in MySQL, but it\'s not necessarily fast. After you\'ve created the references, you can run the following to copy the data:If you\'re using MyISAM, you\'re better off to copy the table files; it\'ll be much faster. You should be able to do the same if you\'re using INNODB with per table table spaces.If you do end up doing an INSERT INTO SELECT, be sure to temporarily turn off indexes with ALTER TABLE x DISABLE KEYS!EDIT Maatkit also has some scripts that may be helpful for syncing data. It may not be faster, but you could probably run their syncing scripts on live data without much locking. If you are using Linux, you can use this bash script:\n(it perhaps needs some additional code cleaning but it works ... and it\'s much faster then mysqldump|mysql)In PHP:Note there is a mysqldbcopy command as part of the add on mysql utilities....\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-utilities/1.5/en/utils-task-clone-db.htmlI don\'t really know what you mean by "local access".\nBut for that solution you need to be able to access over ssh the server to copy the files where is database is stored.I cannot use mysqldump, because my database is big (7Go, mysqldump fail)\nIf the version of the 2 mysql database is too different it might not work, you can check your mysql version using mysql -V.1) Copy the data from your remote server to your local computer (vps is the alias to your remote server, can be replaced by root@1.2.3.4) 2) Import the data copied on your local computerIf you have a different version, you may need to run
