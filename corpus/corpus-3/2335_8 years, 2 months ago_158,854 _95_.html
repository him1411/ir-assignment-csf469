So, I started learning to code in Python and later Django. The first times it was hard looking at tracebacks and actually figure out what I did wrong and where the syntax error was. Some time has passed now and some way along the way, I guess I got a routine in debugging my Django code. As this was done early in my coding experience, I sat down and wondered if how I was doing this was ineffective and could be done faster. I usually manage to find and correct the bugs in my code, but I wonder if I should be doing it faster?I usually just use the debug info Django gives when enabled. When things do end up as I thought it would, I break the code flow a lot with a syntax error, and look at the variables at that point in the flow to figure out, where the code does something other than what I wanted.But can this be improved? Are there some good tools or better ways to debug your Django code?There are a bunch of ways to do it, but the most straightforward is to simply \nuse the Python debugger. Just add following line in to a Django view function:If you try to load that page in your browser, the browser will hang and you get a prompt to carry on debugging on actual executing code.However there are other options suggested by others (I won\'t recommend them):But the Python Debugger (pdb) is highly recommended for all types of Python code. If you are already into pdb, you\'d also want to have a look at IPDB that uses ipython for debugging. Happy Coding.A useful reference provided by Seafangs : Using the Python debugger in DjangoI really like Werkzeug\'s interactive debugger. It\'s similar to Django\'s debug page, except that you get an interactive shell on every level of the traceback. If you use the django-extensions, you get a runserver_plus managment command which starts the development server and gives you Werkzeug\'s debugger on exceptions.Of course, you should only run this locally, as it gives anyone with a browser the rights to execute arbitrary python code in the context of the server.A little quickie for template tags:Now, inside a template you can do {{ template_var|pdb }} and enter a pdb session (given you\'re running the local devel server) where you can inspect element to your heart\'s content.It\'s a very nice way to see what\'s happened to your object when it arrives at the template. There are a few tools that cooperate well and can make your debugging task easier.Most important is the Django debug toolbar.Then you need good logging using the Python logging facility.  You can send logging output to a log file, but an easier option is sending log output to firepython.  To use this you need to use the Firefox browser with the firebug extension. Firepython includes a firebug plugin that will display any server-side logging in a Firebug tab.Firebug itself is also critical for debugging the Javascript side of any app you develop.  (Assuming you have some JS code of course).I also liked django-viewtools for debugging views interactively using pdb, but I don\'t use it that much.There are more useful tools like dozer for tracking down memory leaks (there are also other good suggestions given in answers here on SO for memory tracking).I use PyCharm (same pydev engine as eclipse).  Really helps me to visually be able to step through my code and see what is happening.Almost everything has been mentioned so far, so I\'ll only add that instead of pdb.set_trace() one can use ipdb.set_trace() which uses iPython and therefore is more powerful (autocomplete and other goodies). This requires ipdb package, so you only need to pip install ipdbI\'ve pushed django-pdb to PyPI.\nIt\'s a simple app that means you don\'t need to edit your source code every time you want to break into pdb.Installation is just...You can now run: manage.py runserver --pdb to break into pdb at the start of every view...And run: manage.py test --pdb to break into pdb on test failures/errors...The project\'s hosted on GitHub, contributions are welcome of course.The easiest way to debug python - especially for programmers that are used to Visual Studio - is using PTVS (Python Tools for Visual Studio). \nThe steps are simple: If you want to debug Django using PTVS, you need to do the following: I use pyDev with Eclipse really good, set break points, step into code, view values on any objects and variables, try it.From my perspective, we could break down common code debugging tasks into three distinct usage patterns:Ah, yes, the templates\' woes. The most common (to me and my colleagues) problem is a wrong context: either you don\'t have a variable, or your variable doesn\'t have some attribute. If you\'re using debug toolbar, just inspect the context at the "Templates" section, or, if it\'s not sufficient, set a break in your views\' code just after your context is filled up.So it goes.I highly recommend epdb (Extended Python Debugger).  https://bitbucket.org/dugan/epdbOne thing I love about epdb for debugging Django or other Python webservers is the epdb.serve() command.  This sets a trace and serves this on a local port that you can connect to.  Typical use case:I have a view that I want to go through step-by-step. I\'ll insert the following at the point I want to set the trace.Once this code gets executed, I open a Python interpreter and connect to the serving instance.  I can analyze all the values and step through the code using the standard pdb commands like n, s, etc.And tons more that you can learn about typing epdb help at any time.If you want to serve or connect to multiple epdb instances at the same time, you can specify the port to listen on (default is 8080).  I.e.host defaults to \'localhost\' if not specified.  I threw it in here to demonstrate how you can use this to debug something other than a local instance, like a development server on your local LAN.  Obviously, if you do this be careful that the set trace never makes it onto your production server!As a quick note, you can still do the same thing as the accepted answer with epdb (import epdb; epdb.set_trace()) but I wanted to highlight the serve functionality since I\'ve found it so useful.Sometimes when I wan to explore around in a particular method and summoning pdb is just too cumbersome, I would add:IPython.embed() starts an IPython shell which have access to the local variables from the point where you call it. I use PyCharm and stand by it all the way. It cost me a little but I have to say the advantage that I get out of it is priceless. I tried debugging from console and I do give people a lot of credit who can do that, but for me being able to visually debug my application(s) is great.I have to say though, PyCharm does take a lot of memory.  But then again, nothing good is free in life.  They just came with their latest version 3.  It also plays very well with Django, Flask and Google AppEngine.  So, all in all, I\'d say it\'s a great handy tool to have for any developer.If you are not using it yet, I\'d recommend to get the trial version for 30 days to take a look at the power of PyCharm.  I\'m sure there are other tools also available, such as Aptana.  But I guess I just also like the way PyCharm looks.  I feel very comfortable debugging my apps there.I just found wdb (http://www.rkblog.rk.edu.pl/w/p/debugging-python-code-browser-wdb-debugger/?goback=%2Egde_25827_member_255996401).  It has a pretty nice user interface / GUI with all the bells and whistles.  Author says this about wdb -"There are IDEs like PyCharm that have their own debuggers. They offer similar or equal set of features ...  However to use them you have to use those specific IDEs (and some of then are non-free or may not be available for all platforms). Pick the right tool for your needs."Thought i\'d just pass it on.Also a very helpful article about python debuggers:\nhttps://zapier.com/engineering/debugging-python-boss/Finally, if you\'d like to see a nice graphical printout of your call stack in Django, checkout:\nhttps://github.com/joerick/pyinstrument.  Just add pyinstrument.middleware.ProfilerMiddleware to MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES, then add ?profile to the end of the request URL to activate the profiler. Can also run pyinstrument from command line or by importing as a module.I use PyCharm and different debug tools. Also have a nice articles set about easy set up those things for novices. You may start here. It tells about PDB and GUI debugging in general with Django projects. Hope someone would benefit from them.If using Aptana for django development, watch this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQh-UQFltJQIf not, consider using it.Most options are alredy mentioned.\nTo print template context, I\'ve created a simple library for that.\nSee https://github.com/edoburu/django-debugtoolsYou can use it to print template context without any {% load %} construct:It uses a customized pprint format to display the variables in a <pre> tag.I like answers I can copy directly. And I like IPython:In your code:i highly suggest to use PDB.You can inspect all the variables values, step in to the function and much more.\nhttps://docs.python.org/2/library/pdb.htmlfor checking out the all kind of request,response and hits to database.i am using django-debug-toolbar\nhttps://github.com/django-debug-toolbar/django-debug-toolbarAs mentioned in other posts here - setting breakpoints in your code and walking thru the code to see if it behaves as you expected is a great way to learn something like Django until you have a good sense of how it all behaves - and what your code is doing.To do this I would recommend using WingIde. Just like other mentioned IDEs nice and easy to use, nice layout and also easy to set breakpoints evaluate / modify the stack etc. Perfect for visualizing what your code is doing as you step through it. I\'m a big fan of it.Also I use PyCharm - it has excellent static code analysis and can help sometimes spot problems before you realize they are there.As mentioned already django-debug-toolbar is essential - https://github.com/django-debug-toolbar/django-debug-toolbarAnd while not explicitly a debug or analysis tool - one of my favorites is SQL Printing Middleware available from Django Snippets at https://djangosnippets.org/snippets/290/This will display the SQL queries that your view has generated. This will give you a good sense of what the ORM is doing and if your queries are efficient or you need to rework your code (or add caching).I find it invaluable for keeping an eye on query performance while developing and debugging my application.  Just one other tip - I modified it slightly for my own use to only show the summary and not the SQL statement.... So I always use it while developing and testing. I also added that if the len(connection.queries) is greater than a pre-defined threshold it displays an extra warning.Then if I spot something bad (from a performance or number of queries perspective) is happening I turn back on the full display of the SQL statements to see exactly what is going on.  Very handy when you are working on a large Django project with multiple developers.For those that can accidentally add pdb into live commits, I can suggest this extension of #Koobz answer:An additional suggestion.  You can leverage nosetests and pdb together, rather injecting pdb.set_trace() in your views manually.  The advantage is that you can observe error conditions when they first start, potentially in 3rd party code.Here\'s an error for me today.Now, I know this means that I goofed the constructor for the form, and I even have good idea of which field is a problem.  But, can I use pdb to see what crispy forms is complaining about, within a template?Yes, I can.  Using the --pdb option on nosetests:tests$ nosetests test_urls_catalog.py --pdbAs soon as I hit any exception (including ones handled gracefully), pdb stops where it happens and I can look around.Now, it\'s clear that my choices argument to the crispy field constructor was as it was a list within a list, rather than a list/tuple of tuples.The neat thing is that this pdb is taking place within crispy\'s code, not mine and I didn\'t need to insert it manually.use pdb or ipdb. Diffrence between these two is ipdb supports auto complete.for pdbfor ipdbFor executing new line hit n key, for continue hit c key.\ncheck more options by using help(pdb)During development, adding a quickcan help diagnose problems in views or anywhere else, without the need to use a debugger.I find Visual Studio Code is awesome for debugging Django apps. The standard python launch.json parameters run python manage.py with the debugger attached, so you can set breakpoints and step through your code as you like.One of your best option to debug Django code is via wdb: \nhttps://github.com/Kozea/wdbwdb works with python 2 (2.6, 2.7), python 3 (3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5) and pypy. Even better, it is possible to debug a python 2 program with a wdb server running on python 3 and vice-versa or debug a program running on a computer with a debugging server running on another computer inside a web page on a third computer!\n  Even betterer, it is now possible to pause a currently running python process/thread using code injection from the web interface. (This requires gdb and ptrace enabled)\n  In other words it\'s a very enhanced version of pdb directly in your browser with nice features.Install and run the server, and in your code add:According to the author, main differences with respect to pdb are:For those who don\xe2\x80\x99t know the project, wdb is a python debugger like pdb, but with a slick web front-end and a lot of additional features, such as:It has a great browser-based user interface. A joy to use! :)
