I\'m trying to select input elements of all types except radio and checkbox.Many people have shown that you can put multiple arguments in :not, but using type doesn\'t seem to work anyway I try it.Any ideas?Why :not just use two :not:Yes, it is intentionalIf you\'re using SASS in your project, I\'ve built this mixin to make it work the way we all want it to:it can be used in 2 ways:Option 1: list the ignored items inlineOption 2: list the ignored items in a variable firstOutputted CSS for either optionI was having some trouble with this, and the "X:not():not()" method wasn\'t working for me.I ended up resorting to this strategy:It\'s not nearly as fun, but it worked for me when :not() was being pugnacious. It\'s not ideal, but it\'s solid.Starting from CSS 4 using multiple arguments in the :not selector becomes possible (see here).In CSS3, the :not selector only allows 1 selector as an argument. In level 4 selectors, it can take a selector list as an argument.Example: Unfortunately, browser support is limited. For now, it only works in Safari.
