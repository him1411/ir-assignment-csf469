I need to somehow pull the client\'s IP address using pure JavaScript; no server side code, not even SSI.I\'m not against using a free 3rd party script.I would use a web service that can return JSON (along with jQuery to make things simpler). Below are all the free active IP lookup services I could find and the information they return. If you know of any more, then please add a comment and I\'ll update this answer.Try it: api.db-ip.com/addrinfo?api_key=<your api key>&addr=<ip address>Returns:Limitations:Try it: freegeoip.net/json/Returns:Limitations:Try it: gd.geobytes.com/GetCityDetailsReturns:Limitations:Try it: www.geoplugin.net/json.gpReturns:Limitations:Try it: api.hackertarget.com/geoip/?q=<ip address>Returns:Limitations:Try it: ipapi.co/json/Returns:Limitations:Try it: ip-api.com/jsonReturns:Limitations:Try it: ipfind.co/me?auth=<your api key>Returns:Limitations:Try it: api.ipify.org/?format=jsonReturns:Limitations:Try it: api.ipinfodb.com/v3/ip-city/?key=<your api key>&format=jsonReturns:Limitations:Try it: ipinfo.io/jsonReturns:Limitations:Try it: jsonip.com/Returns:Limitations:Try it: ip.jsontest.com/Returns:Limitations:Try it: geoip.nekudo.com/api/<ip address>Returns:Limitations:Keep in mind that since these are all free services, your mileage may vary in terms of exceeding quota and uptime, and who knows when/if they will be taken offline down the road (exhibit A: Telize). Most of these services also offer a paid tier in case you want something more robust.Also, as skobaljic noted in the comments below, the request quotas are mostly academic since this is happening client-side and most end users will never exceed the quota.UPDATESYou can, relaying it via server side with JSONPAnd while googling to find one, found it here on SO Can I perform a DNS lookup (hostname to IP address) using client-side Javascript?Note : The telize.com API has permanently shut down as of November 15th, 2015.Update: I always wanted to make a min/ uglified version of the code, so here is a ES6 Promise code: Note: This new minifed code would return only single IP, if you want all the IPs of the user( which might be more depending on his network), use the original code...thanks to WebRTC, it is very easy to get local IP in WebRTC supported browsers( at least for now). I have modified the source code, reduced the lines, not making any stun requests since you only want Local IP not the Public IP, the below code works in latest Firefox and Chrome, just run the snippet and check for yourself:what is happening here is, we are creating a dummy peer connection, and for the remote peer to contact us, we generally exchange ice candidates with each other. And reading the ice candidates( from local session description and onIceCandidateEvent) we can tell the ip of the user.where I took code from --> SourceMost of the answers here "work around" the need for server-side code by... Hitting someone else\'s server. Which is a totally valid technique, unless you actually do need to get the IP address without hitting a server. Traditionally this wasn\'t possible without some sort of a plugin (and even then, you\'d likely get the wrong IP address if you were behind a NAT router), but with the advent of WebRTC it is actually possible to do this... If you\'re targeting browsers that support WebRTC (currently: Firefox, Chrome and Opera). Please read mido\'s answer for details on how you can retrieve useful client IP addresses using WebRTC.You can do an ajax call to hostip.info or a similar service...As a bonus, geolocalisation information is returned in the same call.You can\'t.  You\'d have to ask a server.Check out http://www.ipify.org/According to them:Here\'s a working JS example (instead of wondering why this answer has so few votes, try it yourself to see it in action):Too lazy to copy/paste? I like it. Here\'s a \xf0\x9f\x92\xbb demo Too lazy to click? :ONote: Turn off Adblock Plus / uBlock & co before running the demo .. otherwise, it just won\'t work.I have nothing to do with the IPify team. I just think it\'s ridiculously cool that someone would provide such a service for the general good.You can use my service http://ipinfo.io for this, which will give you the client IP, hostname, geolocation information and network owner. Here\'s a simple example that logs the IP:Here\'s a more detailed JSFiddle example that also prints out the full response information, so you can see all of the available details: http://jsfiddle.net/zK5FN/2/include this code in your page : <script type="text/javascript" src="http://l2.io/ip.js"></script>more doc here : http://l2.ioI would say Chad and Malta has great answer. However, theirs are complicated. So I suggest this code that I found from ads by country pluginNo ajax. Just plain javascripts. :DIf you go to http://j.maxmind.com/app/geoip.js you will see that it containsIt doesn\'t really answer the question yet becausehttp://j.maxmind.com/app/geoip.js doesn\'t contain the IP (although I bet it uses the IP to get the country).But it\'s so easy to make a PhP script that pop something likeMake that. Put on http://yourdomain.com/yourip.php.Then do The question specifically mention NOT to use third party script. There is no other way. Javascript cannot know your IP. But other servers that  can be accessed through javascript can which work just as well with no issue.With using Smart-IP.net Geo-IP API. For example, by using jQuery:Well, I am digressing from the question, but I had a similar need today and though I couldn\'t find the ID from the client using Javascript, I did the following.On the server side: -Using JavascriptI am using ASP.Net Ajax, but you can use getElementById instead of $get().What\'s happening is, I\'ve got a hidden div element on the page with the user\'s IP rendered from the server. Than in Javascript I just load that value.This might be helpful to some people with a similar requirement like yours (like me while I hadn\'t figure this out).Cheers!There\'s an easier and free approach that won\'t ask your visitor for any permission.It consists in submitting a very simple Ajax POST request to http://freegeoip.net/json. Once you receive your location information, in JSON, you react accordingly by updating the page or redirecting to a new one.Here is how you submit your request for location information:There are two interpretations to this question.  Most folks interpreted "Client IP" to mean the Public IP Address that Web server\'s see outside the LAN and out on the Internet.  This is not the IP address of the client computer in most cases, thoughI needed the real IP address of the computer that is running the browser that is hosting my JavaScript software (which is almost always a local IP address on a LAN that is behind something that NAT layer).  Mido posted a FANTASTIC answer, above, that seems to be the only answer that really provided the IP address of the client.Thanks for that, Mido!However, the function presented runs asynchronously.  I need to actually USE the IP address in my code, and with an asynchronous solution, I might try to use the IP address before it is retrieved/learned/stored.  I had to be able to wait on the results to arrive before using them.Here is a "Waitable" version of Mido\'s function.  I hope it helps someone else:Not possible in general unless you use some kind of external service.There isn\'t really a reliable way to get the client computer\'s IP address.This goes through some of the possibilities. The code that uses Java will break if the user has multiple interfaces.http://nanoagent.blogspot.com/2006/09/how-to-find-evaluate-remoteaddrclients.htmlFrom looking at the other answers here it sounds like you may want to get the client\'s public IP address, which is probably the address of the router they\'re using to connect to the internet. A lot of the other answers here talk about that. I would recommend creating and hosting your own server side page for receiving the request and responding with the IP address instead of depending on someone else\'s service that may or may not continue to work.Javascript / jQuery get Client\'s IP Address & Location (Country, City)You only need to embed a  tag with "src" link to the server. The server will return "codehelper_ip" as an Object / JSON, and you can use it right away.More information at Javascript Detect Real IP Address Plus CountryIf you are using jQUery, you can try:It will show you more information about returned object.If you want callback function, please try this:Appspot.com callback\'s service isn\'t available.  ipinfo.io seems to be working.I did an extra step and retrieved all geo info using AngularJS. (Thanks to Ricardo)  Check it out.Working page here: http://www.orangecountyseomarketing.com/projects/_ip_angularjs.htmlYou can use the userinfo.io javascript library.You can also use requirejs to load the script.It will give you the IP address of your visitor, as well as a few data on its location (country, city, etc.). It is based on maxmind geoip database.Disclaimer: I wrote this libraryI\'m going to offer a method that I use a lot when I want to store information in the html page, and want my javascript to read information without actually having to pass parameters to the javascript. This is especially useful when your script is referenced externally, rather than inline.It doesn\'t meet the criterion of "no server side script", however. But if you can include server side scripting in your html, do this:Make hidden label elements at the bottom of your html page, just above the end body tag.Your label will look like this: Be sure to make a class called hiddenlabel and set the visibility:hidden so no one actually sees the label. You can store lots of things this way, in hidden labels.Now, in your javascript, to retrieve the information stored in the label (in this case the client\'s ip address), you can do this:Now your variable "ip" equals the ip address. Now you can pass the ip to your API request.* EDIT 2 YEARS LATER *\nTwo minor refinements:I routinely use this method, but call the label class="data", because, in fact, it is a way to store data. Class name "hiddenlabel" is kind of a stupid name.The second modification is in the style sheet, instead of visibility:hidden:...is the better way of doing it.You could do this entirely client side and mostly in JavaScript by using a Flash object that the js can call. Flash can access the IP address of the local machine which might not be very useful.data.host is the ip address. Simply call this from your browser. http://smart-ip.net/geoip-json?callback=? [Without quotes] and get the ip.You can use web services like: http://ip-api.com/Example: I\'m no javascript guru, but if its possible you could open an iframe with http://www.whatismyip.com/automation/n09230945.asp as the source and read the content of the frame.Edit: this wont work because of the cross domain security.All the above answers have a server part, not pure client part. This should be provided by the web browser. At present, no web browser support this.However, with this addon for firefox:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ip-address/\nYou will have to ask your users to install this addon. (it\'s good from me, a 3rd party).you can test whether the user has installed it.you can get it with javascript, if it is installed, then\n    var ip=IP.getClient();\n    var IPclient=ip.IP;\n    //while ip.url is the urlmore information here: http://www.jackiszhp.info/tech/addon.IP.htmlI have my own api back end with laravel, so I usually just the following: For extra security, I provide an api key which is required to get results.It can\'t be done with Javascript alone (unless the clients have a browser plugin as described above). It can\'t be done with Flash on the client either. But it can be done on the client using a Java applet (and javascript can talk to that), although it will prompt for full permissions. e.g. See http://www.findmyrouter.netIf you use NGINX somewhere, you can add this snippet and ask your own server via any AJAX tool.
