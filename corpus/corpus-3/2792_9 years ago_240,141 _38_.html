It has always bothered me that the only way to copy a file in Java involves opening streams, declaring a buffer, reading in one file, looping through it, and writing it out to the other steam.  The web is littered with similar, yet still slightly different implementations of this type of solution.Is there a better way that stays within the bounds of the Java language (meaning does not involve exec-ing OS specific commands)?  Perhaps in some reliable open source utility package, that would at least obscure this underlying implementation and provide a one line solution?As toolkit mentions above, Apache Commons IO is the way to go, specifically FileUtils.copyFile(); it handles all the heavy lifting for you.And as a postscript, note that recent versions of FileUtils (such as the 2.0.1 release) have added the use of NIO for copying files; NIO can significantly increase file-copying performance, in a large part because the NIO routines defer copying directly to the OS/filesystem rather than handle it by reading and writing bytes through the Java layer.  So if you\'re looking for performance, it might be worth checking that you are using a recent version of FileUtils.I would avoid the use of a mega api like apache commons. This is a simplistic operation and its built into the JDK in the new NIO package. It was kind of already linked to in a previous answer, but the key method in the NIO api are the new functions "transferTo" and "transferFrom".http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/nio/channels/FileChannel.html#transferTo(long,%20long,%20java.nio.channels.WritableByteChannel)One of the linked articles shows a great way on how to integrate this function into your code, using the transferFrom:Learning NIO can be a little tricky, so you might want to just trust in this mechanic before going off and trying to learn NIO overnight. From personal experience it can be a very hard thing to learn if you don\'t have the experience and were introduced to IO via the java.io streams.Now with Java 7, you can use the following try-with-resource syntax:Or, better yet, this can also be accomplished using the new Files class introduced in Java 7:Pretty snazzy, eh?In Java 7 it is easy...Note that all of these mechanisms only copy the contents of the file, not the metadata such as permissions. So if you were to copy or move an executable .sh file on linux the new file would not be executable. In order to truly a copy or move a file, ie to get the same result as copying from a command line, you actually need to use a native tool. Either a shell script or JNI. Apparently, this might be fixed in java 7 - http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2008/07/03/jsr-203-new-file-apis.html. Fingers crossed!To copy a file and save it to your destination path you can use the method below.Google\'s Guava library also has a copy method:Warning: If to represents an existing file, that file\n will be overwritten with the contents of from. If to and\n from refer to the same file, the contents of that file\n will be deleted.\n\nParameters:from - the source fileto - the destination fileThrows:\nIOException - if an I/O error occurs\nIllegalArgumentException - if from.equals(to)Available as standard in Java 7, path.copyTo:\nhttp://openjdk.java.net/projects/nio/javadoc/java/nio/file/Path.html\nhttp://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/essential/io/copy.htmlI can\'t believe it took them so long to standardise something so common and simple as file  copying :(If you are in a web application which already uses Spring and if you do not want to include Apache Commons IO for simple file copying, you can use FileCopyUtils of the Spring framework.Three possible problems with the above code: This is why org.apache.tools.ant.util.ResourceUtils.copyResource is so complicated. Also note that while transferFrom is OK, transferTo breaks on JDK 1.4 on Linux (see Bug ID:5056395) \xe2\x80\x93 Jesse Glick Jan Here is three ways that you can easily copy files with single line of code!Java7:java.nio.file.Files#copyAppache Commons IO:FileUtils#copyFileGuava :Files#copyFast and work with all the versions of Java also Android:NIO copy with a buffer is the fastest according to my test.
