Is it possible to use jQuery selectors/DOM manipulation on the server-side using Node.js?Update: (late 2013) The official jQuery team finally took over the management of the jquery package on npm:Then:Yes you can, using a library I created called nodeQuery https://github.com/tblobaum/nodeQueryAt the time of writing there also is the maintained Cheerio.Fast, flexible, and lean implementation of core jQuery designed\n  specifically for the server.Using jsdom you now can. Just look at their jquery example in the examples directory.This is my formula to make a simple crawler in Node.js. It is the main reason for wanting to do DOM manipulation on the server side and probably it\'s the reason why you got here.First, use request to download the page to be parsed. When the download is complete, handle it to cheerio and begin DOM manipulation just like using jQuery.Working example:This example will print to the console all top questions showing on SO home page. This is why I love Node.js and its community. It couldn\'t get easier than that :-)Install dependencies:npm install request cheerioAnd run (assuming the script above is in file crawler.js):node crawler.jsSome pages will have non-english content in a certain encoding and you will need to decode it to UTF-8. For instance, a page in brazilian portuguese (or any other language of latin origin) will likely be encoded in ISO-8859-1 (a.k.a. "latin1"). When decoding is needed, I tell request not to interpret the content in any way and instead use iconv-lite to do the job.Working example:Before running, install dependencies:npm install request iconv-lite cheerioAnd then finally:node crawler.jsThe next step would be to follow links. Say you want to list all posters from each top question on SO. You have to first list all top questions (example above) and then enter each link, parsing each question\'s page to get the list of involved users.When you start following links, a callback hell can begin. To avoid that, you should use some kind of promises, futures or whatever. I always keep async in my toolbelt. So, here is a full example of a crawler using async:Before running:npm install request async cheerioRun a test:node crawler.jsSample output:And that\'s the basic you should know to start making your own crawlers :-)I believe the answer to this is now yes.\nhttps://github.com/tmpvar/jsdomin 2016 things are way easier. install jquery to node.js with your console:bind it to the variable $ (for example - i am used to it) in your node.js code: do stuff:also works for gulp as it is based on node.js.jQuery module can be installed using:Example:References of jQuery in Node.js** : WARNINGThis solution, as mentioned by Golo Roden is not correct. It is just a quick fix to help people to have their actual jQuery code running using a Node app structure, but it\'s not Node philosophy because the jQuery is still running on the client side instead of on the server side. I\'m sorry for giving a wrong answer.You can also render Jade with node and put your jQuery code inside. Here is the code of the jade file:npm install jquery --save #note ALL LOWERCASEnpm install jsdom --saveThe module jsdom is a great tool. But if you want to evaluate entire pages and do some funky stuff on them server side I suggest running them in their own context:So things like require / CommonJS on site will not blow your Node process itself.You can find documentation here. Cheers!No. It\'s going to be quite a big effort to port a browser environment to node.Another approach, that I\'m currently investigating for unit testing, is to create "Mock" version of jQuery that provides callbacks whenever a selector is called.This way you could unit test your jQuery plugins without actually having a DOM. You\'ll still have to test in real browsers to see if your code works in the wild, but if you discover browser specific issues, you can easily "mock" those in your unit tests as well.I\'ll push something to github.com/felixge once it\'s ready to show.My working code is:and then:or if the window is present, then:Not that I know of. The DOM is a client side thing (jQuery doesn\'t parse the HTML, but the DOM).Here are some current Node.js projects:http://wiki.github.com/ry/nodeAnd SimonW\'s djangode is pretty damn cool...An alternative is to use Underscore.js.  It should provide what you might have wanted server-side from JQuery.
