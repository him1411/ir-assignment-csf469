I have imported maven project in STS, when I run update update project I receive:Is there a workaround for this?This issue has been fixed in m2e 1.5.0 which is available for Eclipse Kepler (4.3) and Luna (4.4)Please see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=374332#c14The problem is caused by the fact that STS (the Spring IDE/Eclipse), as well Eclipse and other Eclipse based IDE\'s, use the m2e(clipse) plugin but that eclipse:eclipse has been probably been run on the project. When m2e encounters a "var" .classpath entry, it throws this error. The update sites are specified at the following url: \nhttp://eclipse.org/m2e/m2e-downloads.htmlIf you can\'t use m2e 1.5.0 for any reason, then : Disable the maven nature for the project (via the right-click menu)Run mvn eclipse:clean (while your project is open in STS/eclipse). Depending on the timing, you might need to do a refresh or two on the project before re-enabling the maven nature. You should be able to see that your project has lost it\'s Maven nature. (The eclipse:clean goal just deletes the .project, .classpath and .settings/ files/directories. You can also just remove those files (again while the project is open) instead of running mvn eclipse:clean.)Re-enable the maven nature.\n(Most of the time, this can be done by right-clicking on the project in question in the package explorer pane, and then choosing \'Configure\'-> \'Convert to Maven Project\') Right-click on your project, select Maven -> Remove Maven Nature.Open you terminal, go to your project folder and do mvn eclipse:cleanRight click on your Project and select \xe2\x80\x9cConfigure -> Convert into Maven Project\xe2\x80\x9dNow you got \xe2\x80\x9cUnsupported IClasspathEntry kind=4 Eclipse Scala\xe2\x80\x9d disappear.Sometimes, even re-importing the Maven project will not work. Updating the project correctly in eclipse is not a deterministic process.\nThe only 100% fail safe procedure I\'ve found is:Make sure that the version of the m2e(clipse) plugin that you\'re running is at least 1.1.0Close maven project - right click "Close Project"orHave you tried:Seeing all other answers. I found for me a simpler way.I just removed all lines in the .classpath (editing with eclipse) containing a var and used maven -> update project without an error.This error is also thrown if the update command is used on a project instrumented for code coverage with Clover.To resolve in this scenario:\nUn-instrument the project folders you wish to update.\nRun the maven update then instrument for code coverage again.I tried Marco\'s steps but no luck. Instead if you just get the latest m2e plugin from the link he provides and one by one right click on each project -> Maven -> Update Dependencies the error still pops up but the issue is resolved. That is to say the warnings disappear in the Markers view. I encountered this issue after importing some projects into SpringSource Tool Suite (STS). When I returned to my Eclipse Juno installation the warnings were displaying. Seeing that I had m2e 1.1 already installed I tried Marco\'s steps to no avail. Getting the latest version fixed it however.I couldn\'t get mvn eclipse:clean etc to work with Kepler. However I changed creating and extending variables to just using external jars in my eclipse classpath. This was reflected in no var\'s in my .classpath. This corrected the problem. I was able to do a Maven update.This issue (https://bugs.eclipse.org/394042) is fixed in m2e 1.5.0 which is available for Eclipse Kepler and Luna from this p2 repo : http://download.eclipse.org/technology/m2e/releases/1.5If you also use m2e-wtp, you\'ll need to install m2e-wtp 1.1.0 as well : http://download.eclipse.org/m2e-wtp/releases/luna/1.1Upgrading from Kepler to Luna worked for me.I had just added some components for Java 1.8 support. It seems that they where not as compatible as I would like or that I mixed the wrong ones. It really caused a lot of problems. Trying to update the system reported errors as they couldn\'t fulfill some dependencies. Maven upgrades didn\'t work. Tried a lot of things.So, if there is no reason to avoid the upgrade just add the luna repository to avalilable software sites (Luna  http://download.eclipse.org/releases/luna/  ) and "check for updates". It is better to have all the components with the same version and there are some nice new features. I tried all the steps mentioned here and on similar questions but couldn\'t solve this problem. I could neither solve problem nor update my m2eclipse. So I installed Eclipse Luna and it solved my problem... though it mean that I had to spend about 45 min to configure all the environment in my workspace. Try \nmvn clean install eclipse:eclipse -Dwtpversion=2.0 command on DOS command prompt.\nSuggesting you because , It worked for me!!I\'m using Eclipse 4.3.2 (Kepler) with M2E 1.4.x and felt over this problem several times!In my case the "mvn eclipse:eclipse" command also generates Checkstyle, PMD and Findbugs configuration so "mvn eclipse:clean" does not help me because it drops all those config files again.The best solution for me was to delete all ".classpath" files:and import the project into eclipse afterwards.
