How do you make git diff only show the difference between two commits, excluding the other commits in-between?you can simply pass the 2 commits to git diff like :Asking for the difference /between/ two commits without including the commits in-between makes little sense. Commits are just snapshots of the contents of the repository; asking for the difference between two necessarily includes them. So the question then is, what are you really looking for?As William suggested, cherry-picking can give you the delta of a single commit rebased on top of another. That is:This takes commit \'abcdef\', compares it to its immediate ancestor, then applies that difference on top of \'012345\'. This new difference is then shown - the only change is the context comes from \'012345\' rather than \'abcdef\'s immediate ancestor. Of course, you may get conflicts and etc, so it\'s not a very useful process in most cases.If you\'re just interested in abcdef itself, you can do:This compares abcdef to its immediate ancestor, alone, and is usually what you want.And of coursegives you all differences between those two commits.It would help to get a better idea of what you\'re trying to achieve - as I mentioned, asking for the difference between two commits without what\'s in between doesn\'t actually make sense.To compare two git commits 12345 and abcdef as patches one can use the diff command asExample:It shows the difference on that file between those commits.Suppose you want to see the difference between commits 012345 and abcdef.  The following should do what you want:Let\'s say you have thisAnd you want to make sure that A is the same as A0. This will do the trick:What about this:It\'s handy to just pipe it to less if you want to compare many different diffs on the fly.Actually I haven\'t found a really good solution for this to do automatically, but a hacky solution that gives you exactly what you want is this;
