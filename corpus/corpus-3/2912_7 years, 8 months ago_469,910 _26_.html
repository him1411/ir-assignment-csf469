What is the fastest way to replace all instances of a string/character in a string in Javascript? A while, a for-loop, a regular expression?The easiest would be to use a regular expression with g flag to replace all instances:This will replace all occurrences of foo with bar in the string str. If you just have a string, you can convert it to a RegExp object like this:Try this replaceAll:\nhttp://dumpsite.com/forum/index.php?topic=4.msg8#msg8It is very fast, and it will work for ALL these conditions\nthat many others fail on:Let me know if you can break it, or you have something better, but make sure it can pass these 4 tests.newString now is \'Thas as a strang\'Also you can try:Just thinking about it from a speed issue I believe the case sensitive example provided in the link above would be by far the fastest solution.newStr would be\n"This is a test of the emergency broadcast system."You can use the following:orThis is going to replace all the character that are not letter or numbers to (\'_\'). Simple change the underscore value for whatever you want to replace it.    What\'s the fastest I don\'t know, but I know what\'s the most readable - that what\'s shortest and simplest. Even if it\'s a little bit slower than other solution it\'s worth to use.So use:And enjoy good code instead of faster (well... 1/100000 sec. is not a difference) and ugly one. ;)I tried a number of these suggestions after realizing that an implementation I had written of this probably close to 10 years ago actually didn\'t work completely (nasty production bug in an long-forgotten system, isn\'t that always the way?!)... what I noticed is that the ones I tried (I didn\'t try them all) had the same problem as mine, that is, they wouldn\'t replace EVERY occurrence, only the first, at least for my test case of getting "test....txt" down to "test.txt" by replacing ".." with "."... maybe I missed so regex situation?  But I digress...So, I rewrote my implementation as follows.  It\'s pretty darned simple, although I suspect not the fastest but I also don\'t think the difference will matter with modern JS engines, unless you\'re doing this inside a tight loop of course, but that\'s always the case for anything...Hope that helps someone!I think the real answer is that it completely depends on what your inputs look like.  I created a JsFiddle to try a bunch of these and a couple of my own against various inputs.  No matter how I look at the results, I see no clear winner.This one I wrote seems fastest for small inputs and dense\nreplacements:Use Regex object like thisvar regex = new RegExp(\'"\', \'g\');\nstr = str.replace(regex, \'\\\'\');It will replace all occurrence of " into \'. Use the replace() method of the String object.As mentioned in the selected answer, the /g flag should be used in the regex, in order to replace all instances of the substring in the string.
