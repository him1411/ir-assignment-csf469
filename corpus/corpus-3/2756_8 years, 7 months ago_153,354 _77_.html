This must come up very often.When the user is editing preferences in an Android app, I\'d like them to be able to see the currently set value of the preference in the Preference summary.Example: if I have a Preference setting for "Discard old messages" that specifies the number of days after which messages need to be cleaned up. In the PreferenceActivity I\'d like the user to see:"Discard old messages" <- title"Clean up messages after x days" <- summary where x is the current Preference value Extra credit: make this reusable, so I can easily apply it to all my preferences regardless of their type (so that it work with EditTextPreference, ListPreference etc. with minimal amount of coding).There are ways to make this a more generic solution, if that suits your needs.For example, if you want to generically have all list preferences show their choice as summary, you could have this for your onSharedPreferenceChanged implementation:This is easily extensible to other preference classes.And by using the getPreferenceCount and getPreference functionality in PreferenceScreen and PreferenceCategory, you could easily write a generic function to walk the preference tree setting the summaries of all preferences of the types you desire to their toString representationHere is my solution... FWIWIf you use PreferenceFragment, this is how I solved it. It\'s self explanatory.Android documentation says one can use a String formatting marker in getSummary():If the summary has a String formatting marker in it (i.e. "%s" or "%1$s"), then the current entry value will be substituted in its place.Simply specifying android:summary="Clean up messages after %s days" in ListPreference xml declaration worked for me.Note: This only works for ListPreference.My option is to extend ListPreference and it\'s clean:Then you add in your settings.xml:After several hours I\'ve been spent to solve such problem I\'ve implemented this code:[UPDATE: the final version listing] That was the only solution that worked for me fine. Before I\'ve tried to subclass from ListPreferences and to implement android:summary="bla bla bla %s". Neither worked.You can override default Preference classes and implement the feature.Later in you xml you can use custom preference like This is the code you need to set the summary to the chosen value. It also sets the values on startup and respects the default values, not only on change. Just change "R.layout.prefs" to your xml-file and extend the setSummary-method to your needs. It actually is only handling ListPreferences, but it is easy to customize to respect other Preferences.koemMaybe like ListPreference: Modify getSummary to get what you want:And use this in your xml:So you are able to write a summary with %s instead of the actual value.Actually, CheckBoxPreference does have the ability to specify a different summary based on the checkbox value. See the android:summaryOff and android:summaryOn attributes (as well as the corresponding CheckBoxPreference methods).Thanks for this tip!I have one preference screen and want to show the value for each list preference as the summary.This is my way now:This works for me, but I\'m wondering what is the best solution (performance, stability, scalibility): the one Koem is showing or this one?If someone is still looking for answers to this, you should check out thirtythreefortys answer.Android will replace %s with the current string value of the preference, as displayed by the ListPreference\'s picker.Thanks, Reto, for the detailed explanation!In case this is of any help to anyone, I had to change the code proposed by Reto Meier to make it work with the SDK for Android 1.5The same change applies for the callback function onSharedPreferenceChanged(SharedPreferences sharedPreferences, String key) Cheers,ChrisI solved the issue with the following descendant of ListPreference: Seems to work fine for me in 1.6 up through 4.0.4.I\'ve seen all voted answers show how to set the summary with the exact current value, but the OP wanted also something like:"Clean up messages after x days"* <- summary where x is the current Preference value Here is my answer for achieving thatAs documentation says about ListPreference.getSummary():Returns the summary of this ListPreference. If the summary has a String formatting marker in it (i.e. "%s" or "%1$s"), then the current\n  entry value will be substituted in its place.However, I tried on several devices and it doesn\'t seem to work. With some research, I found a good solution in this answer. It simply consists of extending every Preference you use and override getSummary() to work as specified by Android documentation.If you only want to display the plain text value of each field as its summary, the following code should be the easiest to maintain. It requires only two changes (lines 13 and 21, marked with "change here"):Here\'s my solution:Create public class that PreferenceActivity and implements OnSharedPreferenceChangeListenerSimply:FYI:All the more reason to look at the very slick Answer of @ASD above (source found here) saying to use %s in android:summary for each field in preferences.xml. (Current value of preference is substituted for %s.)Here,all these are cut from Eclipse sample SettingsActivity.\nI have to copy all these too much codes to show how these android developers choose perfectly for more generalized and stable coding style.\nI left the codes for adapting the PreferenceActivity to tablet and greater API.xml/pref_general.xmlvalues/strings_activity_settings.xmlNOTE: Actually I just want to comment like "Google\'s sample for PreferenceActivity is also interesting". But I haven\'t enough reputation points.So please don\'t blame me.\n(Sorry for bad English)You have to use bindPreferenceSummaryToValue function on the onCreate method.Example:See lesson 3 on Udacity Android Course: https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud853/l-1474559101/e-1643578599/m-1643578601For EditTextPreference:I came to this solution, of course, just if you need particular edittextpreference but you could do this with every Preference:........................Then in onResume();In:My solution is to create a custom EditTextPreference, used in XML like this: <com.example.EditTextPreference android:title="Example Title" />EditTextPreference.java:-To set the summary of a ListPreference to the value selected in a dialog you could use this code:and reference the yourpackage.ListPreference object in your preferences.xml remembering to specify there your android:defaultValue as this triggers the call to onSetInitialValue().If you want you can then modify the text before calling setSummary() to whatever suits your application.Here is a working solution for all EditTextPreferences inside of a PreferenceFragment based on @tdeveaux answer:Because I\'m using a custom PreferenceDataStore, I can\'t add a listener to some SharedPreference so I\'ve had to write a somewhat hacky solution that listens to each preference:
