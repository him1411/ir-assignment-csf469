I have a variable which contains the value 1234567.I would like it to contain exactly 8 digits, i.e. 01234567.Is there a PHP function for that?Use sprintf :Alternatively you can also use str_pad:Given that the value is in $value:To echo it:printf("%08d", $value);To get it:$formatted_value = sprintf("%08d", $value);That should do the trickThough I\'m not really sure what you want to do you are probably looking for sprintf.This would be:sprintf is what you need.EDIT (somehow requested by the downvotes), from the page linked above, here\'s a sample "zero-padded integers":Simple answerI\'m not sure how to interpret the comment saying "It will never be more than 8 digits" and if it\'s referring to the input or the output. If it refers to the output you would have to have an additional substr() call to clip the string.To clip the first 8 digitsTo clip the last 8 digitsWhen I need 01 instead of 1, the following worked for me:If the input numbers have always 7 or 8 digits, you can also useI ran some tests and get that this would be up to double as fast as str_pad or sprintf.\nIf the input can have any length, then you could also useThis is not as fast as the other one, but should also be a little bit faster than str_pad and sprintf.Btw: My test also said that sprintf is a little faster than str_pad. I made all tests with PHP 5.6.I wrote this simple function to produce this format: 01:00:03Seconds are always shown (even if zero). \nMinutes are shown if greater than zero or if hours or days are required. \nHours are shown if greater than zero or if days are required. \nDays are shown if greater than zero. Examples:That works perpectly: $number = 13246; echo sprintf( \'%08d\', $number );
