I have created certificate to enable Push Services in my app, but every time I try to add certificate in my Keychain, after adding certificate it shows me following error:This certificate has an invalid issuerI think I\'ve figured this one out. I imported the new WWDR Certificate that expires in 2023, but I was still getting problems building and my developer certificates were still showing the invalid issuer error.After deleting the expired certificate from the login and System keychains, I was able to build for Distribution again.Confirm "Certificates" category is selected.Remove expired Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certificate Authority certificates from "login" tab and "System" tab.Here\'s Apple\'s answer.Thanks for bringing this to the attention of the community and apologies for the issues you\xe2\x80\x99ve been having. This issue stems from having a copy of the expired WWDR Intermediate certificate in both your System and Login keychains. To resolve the issue, you should first download and install the new WWDR intermediate certificate (by double-clicking on the file). Next, in the Keychain Access application, select the System keychain. Make sure to select \xe2\x80\x9cShow Expired Certificates\xe2\x80\x9d in the View menu and then delete the expired version of the Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certificate Authority Intermediate certificate (expired on February 14, 2016). Your certificates should now appear as valid in Keychain Access and be available to Xcode for submissions to the App Store.https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/37208This is not actually a development issue.
