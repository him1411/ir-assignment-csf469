Is there any way to \'undo\' the effects of a scaffold command in Rails?First, if you have already run the migrations generated by the scaffold command, you have to perform a rollback first.You can create scaffolding using:(or similar), and you can destroy/undo it using That will delete all the files created by generate, but not any additional changes you may have made manually.Rishav Rastogi is right, and with rails 3.0 or higher its:You can undo whatever you did withByFor example this applies generators to migration, scaffold, model...etcIf you just want to see the files a generator will create you can pass the generator --pretend or -p option.Best way is :For Scaffold:     Also, make sure you undo the migration you made either by rollback or to a particular version.for first time, you can check you database migration if you have generate scaffold.\nyou must destroy them to clean up your databasethenTo generate scaffolding :To revert scaffolding :Rails destroy nameyou need to roll back migrations too after destroying scaffold tooFor generating scaffold in rails -For undo scaffold in rails -So, Process you should follow to undo scaffolding in rails 4. Run Command as below:That\'s it!Cheers!use this First you will have to do the rake db:rollback for destroy the table\nif you have already run rake db:migrate and then you can runrails d scaffold ModelRecommend rollback First ,type in your Terminal.Add destroy scaffold (the \'d\' stands for \'destroy\')Enjoy your code.you need to rollback the migrations first by doing rake db:rollback if any\nAnd then destroy the scaffold byWhen we generate scaffold, following files will be created:Command: rails generate scaffold GameFiles created:If we have run the migration after this then we have to rollback the migration first as the deletion of scaffold will remove the migration file too and we will not able to revert that migration.Incase we have run the migration:and after this we can safely remove the scaffold by this commad.This command will remove all the files created by the scaffold in your project.Any time you run rails g, you can reverse it by running rails d (destroy) to remove what you\'ve generated. If you have already run rake db:migrate, you will need to run rake db:rollback before destroying :)Case 1: If you run only this command to generate scaffold -but till now you did not run any command for migration like then you should need to run only this command like -Case 2: If you already run(Scaffold and Migration) by below commands like -Then you should need to run first rollback migration command then destroy scaffold like below -So In this manner, we can undo scaffolding. Also we can use d for destroy and g for generate as a shortcut. Yes, the scaffold itself and all the things that amalgamate it.The destroy command is the opposite of generate and will undo one. Just pass it the name the same way did with generate and it\'ll be scrubbed from your project:To generate the scaffold:To revert this scaffold:If you have run the migration for it just rollback for generating andfor removingprovider another solution based on gitstart a new projectinitialize gitcreate a scaffoldrollback the scaffold
