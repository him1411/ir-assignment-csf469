How do I set up NSZombieEnabled and CFZombieLevel for my executable in Xcode 4?In Xcode 4.x press (or click Menubar > Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme) select the "Diagnostics" tab and click "Enable Zombie Objects": \nThis turns released objects into NSZombie instances that print console warnings when used again. This is a debugging aid that increases memory use (no object is really released) but improves error reporting. A typical case is when you over-release an object and you don\'t know which one:This Xcode setting is ignored when you archive the application for App Store submission. You don\'t need to touch anything before releasing your application. Pressing \xe2\x8c\xa5\xe2\x8c\x98R is the same as selecting Product > Run while keeping the Alt key pressed.\nClicking the "Enable Zombie Objects" checkbox is the same as manually adding "NSZombieEnabled = YES" in the section "Environment Variables" of the tab Arguments.Jano\'s answer is the easiest way to find it.. another way would be if you click on the scheme drop down bar -> edit scheme -> arguments tab and then add NSZombieEnabled in the Environment Variables column and YES in the value column...I find this alternative more convenient:As soon as a zombie is detected you then get a neat "Zombie Stack" that shows you when the object in question was allocated and where it was retained or released:Advantages compared to using the diagnostic tab of the Xcode Schemes:If you forget to uncheck the option in the diagnostic tab there no objects will be released from memory.You get a more detailed stack that shows you in what methods your corrupt object was allocated / released or retained.In Xcode 4.2or select Edit Scheme from Product > Scheme Menu select Enable Zombie Objects form the Diagnostics tabAs alternative, if you prefer .xcconfig files you can read this article https://therealbnut.wordpress.com/2012/01/01/setting-xcode-4-0-environment-variables-from-a-script/Cocoa offers a cool feature which greatly enhances your capabilities to debug such situations. It is an environment variable which is called NSZombieEnabled, watch this video  that explains setting up NSZombieEnabled in objective-CIn Xcode > 4.3:You click on the scheme drop down bar -> edit scheme -> arguments tab and then add NSZombieEnabled in the Environment Variables column and YES in the value column.Good Luck !!!
