In my ~/.gitconfig, I list my personal email address under [user], since that\'s what I want to use for Github repos.But, I\'ve recently started using git for work, too. My company\'s git repo allows me to commit, but when it sends out announcements of new changesets, it says they are from Anonymous because it doesn\'t recognize the email address in my .gitconfig - at least, that\'s my theory.Is it possible to specify multiple [user] definitions in .gitconfig? Or is there some other way to override the default .gitconfig for a certain directory? In my case, I check out all work code in ~/worksrc/ - is there a way to specify a .gitconfig for only that directory (and its subdirectories)?You can configure an individual repo to use a specific user / email address which overrides the global configuration.  From the root of the repo, runwhereas the default user / email is configured in your ~/.gitconfigOr you can add following information in your local .git/config fileSince git 2.13, it is possible to solve this using newly introduced Conditional includes.An example:Global config ~/.gitconfigWork specific config ~/work/.gitconfigAfter getting some inspiration from Orr Sella\'s blog post I wrote a pre-commit hook (resides in ~/.git/templates/hooks) which would set specific usernames and e-mail addresses based on the information inside a local repositorie\'s ./.git/config:You have to place the path to the template directory into your ~/.gitconfig:Then each git init or git clone will pick up that hook and will apply the user data during the next git commit. If you want to apply the hook to already exisiting repos then just run a git init inside the repo in order to reinitialize it.Here is the hook I came up with (it still needs some polishing - suggestions are welcome).\nSave it either as orand make sure it is executable: chmod +x ./post-checkout || chmod +x ./pre_commitEDIT:So I rewrote the hook as a hook and command in Python. Additionally it\'s possible to call the script as a Git command (git passport), too. Also it\'s possible to define an arbitrary number of IDs inside a configfile (~/.gitpassport) which are selectable on a prompt. You can find the project at github.com: git-passport - A Git command and hook written in Python to manage multiple Git accounts / user identities.If you do not want to have a default email address (email address links to a github user), you can configure that you want to be asked. How you can do that depends on the version of git you use, see below.The (intended) drawback is that you have to configure your email address (and your name) once for every repository. So, you cannot forget to do it.in your global configuration ~/.gitconfig as stated in a comment by Dan Aloni in Orr Sella\'s blog post. When trying to do the first commit in a repository, git fails with the nice message:The name is taken from the global config when the email address is set locally (the message is not perfectly accurate).The behaviour in versions < 2.7.0 was not intended and fixed with 2.7.0. You can still use a pre-commit hook as described in Orr Sella\'s blog post. This solution works also for other versions, but the other solutions not for this version.Dan Aloni added an option to achieve that behaviour (see release notes). Use it with:To make it work you may not give a name or email address in the global config. Then, at the first commit, you get an error messageSo the message is not very instructive, but since you set the option explicitly, you should know what to do. In contrast to the solution of versions < 2.7.0, you always have to set both name and email manually.One command github accounts switchThis solution takes the form of a single git alias. Once executed, the current project user will be attached to another accountGenerate ssh keysLink them to your GitHub / Bitbucket accountsStep 1. Automatic ssh key switching.We can configure ssh to send a use a specific encryption key depending on the host. The nice thing is that you can have several aliases for the same hostname.See this example ~/.ssh/config file:git remote configurationYou can now use these aliases in the git remotes by changing git@github.com by git@github_pro.You can either change your existing projects remotes (using something like git remote origin set-url git@github_pro:foo/bar.git) or adapt them directly when cloning them.using alias, it become:git clone git@github_pro:ArnaudRinquin/atom-zentabs.gitStep 2. Changing git user.emailGit config settings can be global or per project. In our case, we want a per project settings. It is very easy to change it:While this is easy, it takes way to long for the developers we are. We can write a very simple git alias for that.We are going to add it to the ~/.gitconfig file.Then, all we have to do is git setpromail to have our email changed for this project only.Step 3. One command switch please?!Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be nice to switch from default account to a specified one with a single parameter-less command? This is definitely possible. This command will have two steps:We already have a one command solution for the second step, but the first one is way harder.\nOne command remote host changeHere comes the solution in the form of another git alias command to add to your ~/.gitconfig:This allows changing all remotes from one host to another (the alias). See the example:Combine them allWe now just have to combine the two commands into one, this is quite easy. See how I also integrate bitbucket host switching.Source Link -Tutorial\nAnother option to get git to work with multiple names / emails is by aliasing git and using the -c flag to override the global and repository-specific config.For example, by defining an alias:To see whether it works, simply type git config user.email:Instead of an alias, you could also put a custom git executable within your $PATH.An advantage of these method over a repository-specific .git/config is that it applies to every git repository when the custom git program is active. In this way, you can easily switch between users/names without modifying any (shared) configuration.There is a simple solution that seems to work well for avoiding mistakes.Simply remove the [user] section from your ~/.gitconfig, which will prevent you from making any commits without setting user.name for each repository.In your ~/.bashrc, add some simple aliases for the user and email:git aliases (and sections in git configs) to the rescue!add an alias (from command line):then, set, for exampleand in a new or cloned repo you can run this command:This solution isn\'t automatic, but unsetting user and email in your global ~/.gitconfig would force git to remind you to set them manually in each new or cloned repo.GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL + local .bashrc.bashrc_local: don\'t track this file, put it only on your work computer:.bashrc: track this file, make it the same on both work and home computers:I\'m using https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick to sync my dotfiles.If only gitconfig would accept environment variables: Shell variable expansion in git configThis answer is partially inspired by the post by @Saucier, but I was looking for an automated way to set user.name and user.email on a per repo basis, based on the remote, that was a little more light weight than the git-passport package that he developed.  Also h/t to @John for the useConfigOnly setting.  Here is my solution:.gitconfig changes:post-checkout hook which should be saved to the following path: ~/.git-templates/hooks/post-checkout:I use different credentials for github and gitlab, but those references in the code above could be replaced or augmented with any service that you use.  In order to have the post-checkout hook automatically set the user name and email locally for a repo after a checkout make sure the service name appears in the remote url, add it to the services array in the post-checkout script and create a section for it in your .gitconfig that contains your user name and email for that service.  If none of the service names appear in the remote url or the repo doesn\'t have a remote the user name and email will not be set locally.  In these cases the user.useConfigOnly setting will be in play which will not allow you to make commits until the user name and email are set at the repo level, and will prompt the user to configure that information.Windows EnvironmentAdditional this can be modified from Git Extensions --> Settings --> Global Settings, if you have it installed in your systems.gitextensions-latest-releaseRight Click on a folder/directory in Windows Environment to access these settings.\nMay be it is simple hack, but it is useful. Just generate 2 ssh keys like below.Same way create one more for personal. So, you have 2 ssh keys, work and company. Copy work.pub, work, personal.pub, personal to ~/.ssh/ Directory. Then create shell script with the following lines and name it as crev.sh (Company Reverse) with following content. Same way, create one more called prev.sh (Personal Reverse) with the following content. in ~/.bashrc add aliases for those scripts like below When ever you wanna use company, just do crev, and if you wanna use personal do prev :-p. Add those ssh keys to your github accounts. Make sure, you don\'t have id_rsa generated perviously, because those scripts will overwrite id_rsa. If you have already generated id_rsa, use that for one of the account. Copy them as personal and skip generation of personal keys. With conditional includes in Git 2.13, it is now possible to have multiple user/email coexist on one machine with little work.user.gitconfig has my personal name and email. work-user.gitconfig has my work name and email. Both files are at ~ path.So my personal name/email applies by default. For c:/work/ dir, my work name/email is applied. For c:/work/github/ dir, my personal name/email is applied. This works as the last setting gets applied.gitdir is case-sensitive and gitdir/i is case-insensitive."gitdir/i:github/" would apply the conditional include for any directory with github in its path.Something like Rob W\'s answer, but allowing different a different ssh key, and works with older git versions (which don\'t have e.g. a core.sshCommand config).I created the file ~/bin/git_poweruser, with executable permission, and in the PATH:Whenever I want to commit or push something as "Power User", I use git_poweruser instead of git. It should work on any directory, and does not require changes in .gitconfig or .ssh/config, at least not in mine.To be able to update and commit to git projects from different organization, add another email to your ~/.gitconfig  file. If you don\'t have any such file, create one. The file should look like this:
