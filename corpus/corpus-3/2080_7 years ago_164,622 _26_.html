Is there a way to list all commits that changed a specific file?The --follow works for a particular fileDifference to other solutions givenNote that other solutions include git log path (without the --follow). That approach is handy if you want to track e.g. changes in a directory, but stumbles when files were renamed (thus use --follow filename).git log path should do what you want. From the git log man:Should be as simple as git log <somepath>, check the manpage (git-log(1)).Personally I like to use git log --stat <path> so I can see the impact of each commit on the file.Use the command below to get commits for a specific file:I have been looking at this closely and all these answers don\xe2\x80\x98t seem to really show me all the commits across all the branches.Here is what I have come up with by messing around with the gitk edit view options. This shows me all the commits for a file regardless of branch, local, reflog, and remote.As jackrabb1t pointed out, --follow is more robust since it continues listing the history beyond renames/moves. So, if you are looking for a file that is not currently in the same path or a file that has been renamed throughout various commits, --follow will track it.This can be a better option if you want to visualize the name/path changes:But if you want a more compact list with only what matters:or evenThe downside is that --follow only works for a single file.If you are trying to --follow a file deleted in a previous commit useAlternatively (since git 1.8.4), it is also possible to just get all the commits which has changed a specific part of a file. You can get this by passing the starting line and the ending line number. Result returned would be the list of commits that modified this particular part. Command goes like :where upperLimit is the start_line_number and lowerLimit is the ending_line_numberUse git log --all <filename> to view the commits influencing <filename> in all branches.Assuming the package "gitk" is already installed. If it is not installed, do this and then try the above command. It is for linux.. It might help linux users, if they want GUI.If you want to view all the commits that changed a file, in all the branches,Use thisif you want to look for all commit by filename and not by filepathIn linux you can use gitk for this.\nIt can be installed using "sudo apt-get install git-gui gitk".\nIt can be used to see commits of a specific file by  "gitk "Reference
