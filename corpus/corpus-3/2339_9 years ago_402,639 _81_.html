I\'m trying to figure out how to detect the type of credit card based purely on its number. Does anyone know of a definitive, reliable way to find this?The credit/debit card number is referred to as a PAN, or Primary Account Number.  The first six digits of the PAN are taken from the IIN, or Issuer Identification Number, belonging to the issuing bank (IINs were previously known as BIN \xe2\x80\x94 Bank Identification Numbers \xe2\x80\x94 so you may see references to that terminology in some documents).  These six digits are subject to an international standard, ISO/IEC 7812, and can be used to determine the type of card from the number.Unfortunately the actual ISO/IEC 7812 database is not publicly available, however there are unofficial lists, both commercial and free, including on Wikipedia.Anyway, to detect the type from the number, you can use a regular expression like the ones below: Credit for original expressionsVisa: ^4[0-9]{6,}$ Visa card numbers start with a 4.MasterCard: ^5[1-5][0-9]{5,}|222[1-9][0-9]{3,}|22[3-9][0-9]{4,}|2[3-6][0-9]{5,}|27[01][0-9]{4,}|2720[0-9]{3,}$ Before 2016, MasterCard numbers start with the numbers 51 through 55, but this will only detect MasterCard credit cards; there are other cards issued using the MasterCard system that do not fall into this IIN range.  In 2016, they will add numbers in the range (222100-272099).American Express: ^3[47][0-9]{5,}$ American Express card numbers start with 34 or 37.Diners Club: ^3(?:0[0-5]|[68][0-9])[0-9]{4,}$ Diners Club card numbers begin with 300 through 305, 36 or 38. There are Diners Club cards that begin with 5 and have 16 digits. These are a joint venture between Diners Club and MasterCard, and should be processed like a MasterCard.Discover: ^6(?:011|5[0-9]{2})[0-9]{3,}$ Discover card numbers begin with 6011 or 65.JCB: ^(?:2131|1800|35[0-9]{3})[0-9]{3,}$ JCB cards begin with 2131, 1800 or 35.Unfortunately there are a number of card types processed with the MasterCard system that do not live in MasterCard\xe2\x80\x99s IIN range (numbers starting 51...55); the most important case is that of Maestro cards, many of which have been issued from other banks\xe2\x80\x99 IIN ranges and so are located all over the number space.  As a result, it may be best to assume that any card that is not of some other type you accept must be a MasterCard.Important: card numbers do vary in length; for instance, Visa has in the past issued cards with 13 digit PANs and cards with 16 digit PANs.  Visa\xe2\x80\x99s documentation currently indicates that it may issue or may have issued numbers with between 12 and 19 digits.  Therefore, you should not check the length of the card number, other than to verify that it has at least 7 digits (for a complete IIN plus one check digit, which should match the value predicted by the Luhn algorithm).One further hint: before processing a cardholder PAN, strip any whitespace and punctuation characters from the input.  Why?  Because it\xe2\x80\x99s typically much easier to enter the digits in groups, similar to how they\xe2\x80\x99re displayed on the front of an actual credit card, i.e.is much easier to enter correctly thanThere\xe2\x80\x99s really no benefit in chastising the user because they\xe2\x80\x99ve entered characters you don\'t expect here.This also implies making sure that your entry fields have room for at least 24 characters, otherwise users who enter spaces will run out of room.  I\xe2\x80\x99d recommend that you make the field wide enough to display 32 characters and allow up to 64; that gives plenty of headroom for expansion.Here\'s an image that gives a little more insight:UPDATE (2014): The checksum method no longer appears to be a valid way of verifying a card\'s authenticity as noted in the comments on this answer.UPDATE (2016): Mastercard is to implement new BIN ranges starting Ach Payment.In javascript:Unit test:Updated: 15th June 2016 (as an ultimate solution currently)Please note that I even give vote up for the one is top voted, but to make it clear these are the regexps actually works i tested it with thousands of real BIN codes. The most important is to use start strings (^) otherwise it will give false results in real world!JCB ^(?:2131|1800|35)[0-9]{0,}$ Start with: 2131, 1800, 35 (3528-3589)American Express ^3[47][0-9]{0,}$ Start with: 34, 37Diners Club ^3(?:0[0-59]{1}|[689])[0-9]{0,}$ Start with: 300-305, 309, 36, 38-39Visa ^4[0-9]{0,}$ Start with: 4MasterCard ^(5[1-5]|222[1-9]|22[3-9]|2[3-6]|27[01]|2720)[0-9]{0,}$ Start with: 2221-2720, 51-55Maestro ^(5[06789]|6)[0-9]{0,}$ Maestro always growing in the range: 60-69, started with / not something else, but starting 5 must be encoded as mastercard anyway.

This is good when u assign it to an onkeyup event and it give result as soon as possible.Here you can play with it:http://jsfiddle.net/upN3L/69/For PHP use this function, this detects some sub VISA/MC cards too:Here is the function to check Credit card type using Regex , c#Check this out:http://www.breakingpar.com/bkp/home.nsf/0/87256B280015193F87256CC70060A01Brecently I needed such functionality, I was porting Zend Framework Credit Card Validator to ruby.\nruby gem: https://github.com/Fivell/credit_card_validations \nzend framework: https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/blob/master/library/Zend/Validator/CreditCard.phpThey both use INN ranges for detecting type. Here you can read about INNAccording to this you can detect credit card alternatively  (without regexps,but declaring some rules about prefixes and possible length)So we have next rules for most used cardsThen  by searching prefix and comparing length you can detect credit card brand. Also don\'t forget about luhn algoritm (it is descibed here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn).Here\'s Complete C# or VB code for all kinds of CC related things on codeproject.This article has been up for a couple years with no negative comments.Compact javascript versionHere is a php class function returns CCtype by CCnumber. \nThis code not validates the card or not runs  Luhn algorithm only try to find credit card type based on table in this page. basicly uses CCnumber length and CCcard prefix to determine CCcard type.Anatoliy\'s answer in PHP:Do not try to detect credit card type as part of processing a payment. You are risking of declining valid transactions.If you need to provide information to your payment processor (e.g. PayPal credit card object requires to name the card type), then guess it from the least information available, e.g.This implementation (using only the first two digits) is enough to identify all of the major (and in PayPal\'s case all of the supported) card schemes. In fact, you might want to skip the exception altogether and default to the most popular card type. Let the payment gateway/processor tell you if there is a validation error in response to your request.The reality is that your payment gateway does not care about the value you provide.The first numbers of the credit card can be used to approximate the vendor:In Card Range Recognition (CRR), a drawback with algorithms that use a series of regex or other hard-coded ranges, is that the BINs/IINs do change over time in my experience.  The co-branding of cards is an ongoing complication.  Different Card Acquirers / merchants may need you treat the same card differently, depending on e.g. geolocation.  Additionally, in the last few years with e.g. UnionPay cards in wider circulation, existing models do not cope with  new ranges that sometimes interleave with broader ranges that they supersede.\nKnowing the geography your system needs to cover may help, as some ranges are restricted to use in particular countries.  For example, ranges 62 include some AAA sub-ranges in the US, but if your merchant base is outside the US, you may be able to treat all 62 as UnionPay.\nYou may be also asked to treat a card differently based on merchant location.  E.g. to treat certain UK cards as debit domestically, but as credit internationally.  There are very useful set of rules maintained by one major Acquiring Bank.  E.g. https://www.barclaycard.co.uk/business/files/BIN-Rules-EIRE.pdf and https://www.barclaycard.co.uk/business/files/BIN-Rules-UK.pdf.  (Valid links as of June 2017, thanks to the user who provided a link to updated reference.) But be aware of the caveat that, while these CRR rules may represent the Card Issuing universe as it applies to their merchants, it does not include e.g. ranges identified as CUP/UPI.These comments apply to magnetic stripe (MagStripe) or PKE (Pan Key Entry) scenarios. The situation is different again in the ICC/EMV world.Update: Other answers on this page (and also the linked WikiPedia page) have JCB as always 16 long.  However, in my company we have a dedicated team of engineers who certify our POS devices and software across multiple acquiring banks and geographies.

Let me add few code snippets and show you how to use it. Firstly Include it to your web page asSecondly use the function cardType for detecting the card scheme.Here are the reference links for more examples and demos.I searched around quite a bit for credit card formatting and phone number formatting.  Found lots of good tips but nothing really suited my exact desires so I created this bit of code.  You use it like this:In swift you can create an enum to detect the credit card type.Call the method CreditCardType.cardTypeForCreditCardNumber("#card number") which returns CreditCardType enum value.Just a little spoon feeding:Here is an example of some boolean functions written in Python that return True if the card is detected as per the function name. The regular expression rules that match the respective card vendors:The first six digits of a card number (including the initial MII\n  digit) are known as the issuer identification number (IIN). These\n  identify the card issuing institution that issued the card to the card\n  holder. The rest of the number is allocated by the card issuer. The\n  card number\'s length is its number of digits. Many card issuers print\n  the entire IIN and account number on their card.Based on the above facts I would like to keep a snippet of JAVA code to identify card brand.Sample card typesCard PrefixesCheck to see if the input number has any of the given prefixes.Finally, The Utility methodReferenceI use https://github.com/bendrucker/creditcards-types/ to detect the credit card type from number. One issue I ran into is discover test number\n6011 1111 1111 1117from https://www.cybersource.com/developers/other_resources/quick_references/test_cc_numbers/\nwe can see it is a discover number because it starts by 6011. But the result I get from the creditcards-types is "Maestro". I opened the issue to the author. He replied me very soon and provide this pdf doc https://www.discovernetwork.com/downloads/IPP_VAR_Compliance.pdf\nFrom the doc we can see clearly that 6011 1111 1111 1117 does not fall into the range of discover credit card.
