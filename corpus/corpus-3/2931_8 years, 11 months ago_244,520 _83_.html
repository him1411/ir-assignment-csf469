I would like to determine the operating system of the host that my Java program is running programmatically (for example: I would like to be able to load different properties based on whether I am on a Windows or Unix platform). What is the safest way to do this with 100% reliability?You can use:P.S. You may find this code useful:All it does is print out all the properties provided by your Java implementations. It\'ll give you an idea of what you can find out about your Java environment via properties. :-)As indicated in other answers, System.getProperty provides the raw data.  However, the Apache Commons Lang component provides a wrapper for java.lang.System with handy properties like SystemUtils.IS_OS_WINDOWS, much like the aforementioned Swingx OS util.Oct. 2008:I would recommend to cache it in a static variable:That way, every time you ask for the Os, you do not fetch the property more than once in the lifetime of your application.February 2016: 7+ years later:There is a bug with Windows 10 (which did not exist at the time of the original answer).\nSee "Java\'s \xe2\x80\x9cos.name\xe2\x80\x9d for Windows 10?"some of the links in the answers above seem to be broken. I have added pointers to current source code in the code below and offer an approach for handling the check with an enum as an answer so that a switch statement can be used when evaluating the result:The helper class is:If you\'re interested in how an open source project does stuff like this, you can check out the Terracotta class (Os.java) that handles this junk here:And you can see a similar class to handle JVM versions (Vm.java and VmVersion.java) here:The following JavaFX classes have static methods to determine current OS (isWindows(),isLinux()...):Example:I find that the OS Utils from Swingx does the job.Below code shows the values that you can get from System API, these all things you can get through this API.Answers:-Taken from this project https://github.com/RishiGupta12/serial-communication-managerTry this,simple and easyLet\'s say you have a Util class for such utility functions. Then create public enums for each operating system type. Then you can easly invoke class from any class as follows,(P.S. Since the we declared os variable as static, it will consume time only once to identify the system type, then it can be used until your application halts. )and so on...I liked Wolfgang\'s answer, just because I believe things like that should be consts...so I\'ve rephrased it a bit for myself, and thought to share it :)This code for displaying all information about the system os type,name , java information and so on.You can just use sun.awt.OSInfo#getOSType() methodYou can get the OS type name by usingYou can get all the info related to OS by:It will output very much details-- listing properties --java.runtime.name=OpenJDK Runtime Environmentsun.boot.library.path=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0...java.vm.version=25.65-b01java.vm.vendor=Oracle Corporationjava.vendor.url=http://java.oracle.com/path.separator=:java.vm.name=OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VMfile.encoding.pkg=sun.iouser.country=USsun.java.launcher=SUN_STANDARDsun.os.patch.level=unknownjava.vm.specification.name=Java Virtual Machine Specificationuser.dir=/web/com/1502258867_87863java.runtime.version=1.8.0_65-b17java.awt.graphicsenv=sun.awt.X11GraphicsEnvironmentjava.endorsed.dirs=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0...os.arch=amd64java.io.tmpdir=/tmpline.separator=java.vm.specification.vendor=Oracle Corporationos.name=Linuxsun.jnu.encoding=UTF-8java.library.path=/home/cg/root/GNUstep/Library/Librari...java.specification.name=Java Platform API Specificationjava.class.version=52.0sun.management.compiler=HotSpot 64-Bit Tiered Compilersos.version=3.10.0-327.4.4.el7.x86_64user.home=/usr/share/httpduser.timezone=java.awt.printerjob=sun.print.PSPrinterJobfile.encoding=UTF-8java.specification.version=1.8user.name=apachejava.class.path=/home/cg/root/GNUstep/Library/Librari...java.vm.specification.version=1.8sun.arch.data.model=64java.home=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0...sun.java.command=MyFirstJavaProgramjava.specification.vendor=Oracle Corporationuser.language=enawt.toolkit=sun.awt.X11.XToolkitjava.vm.info=mixed modejava.version=1.8.0_65java.ext.dirs=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0...sun.boot.class.path=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0...java.vendor=Oracle Corporationfile.separator=/java.vendor.url.bug=http://bugreport.sun.com/bugreport/sun.cpu.endian=littlesun.io.unicode.encoding=UnicodeLittlesun.cpu.isalist=
