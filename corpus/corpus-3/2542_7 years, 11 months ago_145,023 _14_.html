What is the difference between the following two declarations?Is it okay to think of the first statement as a declaration of a static method, and the second statement as a declaration of an instance method?Yes, the first function has no relationship with an object instance of that constructor function, you can consider it like a \'static method\'.In JavaScript functions are first-class objects, that means you can treat them just like any object, in this case, you are only adding a property to the function object.The second function, as you are extending the constructor function prototype, it will be available to all the object instances created with the new keyword, and the context within that function (the this keyword) will refer to the actual object instance where you call it.Consider this example:When you create more than one instance of MyClass , you will still only have only one instance of publicMethod in memory but in case of privilegedMethod you will end up creating lots of instances and staticMethod has no relationship with an object instance.That\'s why prototypes save memory.Also, if you change the parent object\'s properties, is the child\'s corresponding property hasn\'t been changed, it\'ll be updated.For visual learners, when defining the function without .prototypeWith same code, if .prototype is added,  To make it clearer,  ****Note for the example above, someInstance.method() won\'t be executed as,\nExampleClass.method() causes error & execution cannot continue.\nBut for the sake of illustration & easy understanding, I\'ve kept this sequence.****Results generated from chrome developer console & JS Bin\nClick on the jsbin link above to step through the code.\nToggle commented section with ctrl+/
