We are writing a new application, and while testing, we will need a bunch of dummy data.  I\'ve added that data by using MS Access to dump excel files into the relevant tables.Every so often, we want to "refresh" the relevant tables, which means dropping them all, re-creating them, and running a saved MS Access append query.The first part (dropping & re-creating) is an easy sql script, but the last part makes me cringe.  I want a single setup script that has a bunch of INSERTs to regenerate the dummy data.I have the data in the tables now.  What is the best way to automatically generate a big list of INSERT statements from that dataset?I\'m thinking of something like in TOAD (for Oracle) where you can right-click on a grid and click Save As->Insert Statements, and it will just dump a big sql script wherever you want.The only way I can think of doing it is to save the table to an excel sheet and then write an excel formula to create an INSERT for every row, which is surely not the best way.I\'m using the 2008 Management Studio to connect to a SQL Server 2005 database.Microsoft should advertise this functionality of SSMS 2008. The feature you are looking for is built into the Generate Script utility, but the functionality is turned off by default and must be enabled when scripting a table.This is a quick run through to generate the INSERT statements for all of the data in your table, using no scripts or add-ins to SQL Management Studio 2008:You will then get the CREATE TABLE statement and all of the INSERT statements for the data straight out of SSMS.We use this stored procedure - it allows you to target specific tables, and use where clauses.  You can find the text here.For example, it lets you do this:\nTo generate INSERT statements for table \'titles\':As mentioned by @Mike Ritacco but updated for SSMS 2008 R2You will then get all of the INSERT statements for the data straight out of SSMS.EDIT 2016-10-25 SQL Server 2016/SSMS 13.0.15900.1Right click on the database nameChoose Tasks > Generate scriptsDepending on your settings the intro page may show or notChoose \'Select specific database objects\', Expand the tree view and check the relevant tablesClick NextClick AdvancedUnder General section, choose the appropriate option for \'Types of data to \nscript\'Click OKPick whether you want the output to go to a new query, the clipboard or a \nfileClick Next twiceYour script is prepared in accordance with the settings you picked aboveClick FinishYou can use SSMS Tools Pack (available for SQL Server 2005 and 2008). It comes with a feature for generating insert statements.http://www.ssmstoolspack.com/I\'m using SSMS 2008 version 10.0.5500.0.  In this version as part of the Generate Scripts wizard, instead of an Advanced button, there is the screen below.   In this case, I wanted just the data inserted and no create statements, so I had to change the two circled propertiesThis can be done using Visual Studio too (at least in version 2013 onwards).In VS 2013 it is also possible to filter the list of rows the inserts statement are based on, this is something not possible in SSMS as for as I know.Perform the following steps:This will create the (conditional) insert statements for the selected table to the active window or file.The "Filter" and "Script" buttons Visual Studio 2013:Jane Dallaway\'s stored procedure: http://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B_AkC4ZdTI9tNWVmZWU3NzAtMWY1My00NjgwLWI3ZjQtMTY1NDMxYzBhYzgx&hl=en_GB. \nDocumentation is a series of blog posts: https://www.google.com/search?q=spu_generateinsert&as_sitesearch=http%3A%2F%2Fjane.dallaway.comThe first link to sp_generate_inserts is pretty cool, here is a really simple version:On my system, I get this result:If you need a programmatic access, then you can use an open source stored procedure `GenerateInsert.INSERT statement(s) generatorJust as a simple and quick example, to generate INSERT statements for a table AdventureWorks.Person.AddressType execute following statements:This will generate the following script:Perhaps you can try the SQL Server Publishing Wizard\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=56E5B1C5-BF17-42E0-A410-371A838E570A&displaylang=enIt has a wizard that helps you script insert statements.My contribution to the problem, a Powershell INSERT script generator that lets you script multiple tables without having to use the cumbersome SSMS GUI.  Great for rapidly persisting "seed" data into source control.By default, the INSERT script generated will be "SeedData.sql" under the same folder as the script.You will need the SQL Server Management Objects assemblies installed, which should be there if you have SSMS installed.Don\'t use inserts, use BCPI used this script which I have put on my blog (How-to generate Insert statement procedures on sql server). So far has worked for me, although they might be bugs I have not discovered yet .  GenerateData is an amazing tool for this. It\'s also very easy to make tweaks to it because the source code is available to you. A few nice features:I use sqlite to do this. I find it very, very useful for creating scratch/test databases.sqlite3 foo.sqlite .dump   > foo_as_a_bunch_of_inserts.sqlwhy not just backup the data before your work with it, then restore when you want it to be refreshed?if you must generate inserts try: http://vyaskn.tripod.com/code.htm#insertsNot sure, if I understand your question correctly.If you have data in MS-Access, which you want to move it to SQL Server - you could use DTS.\nAnd, I guess you could use SQL profiler to see all the INSERT statements going by, I suppose.Do you have data in a production database yet?  If so, you could setup a period refresh of the data via DTS.  We do ours weekly on the weekends and it is very nice to have clean, real data every week for our testing.If you don\'t have production yet, then you should create a database that is they want you want it (fresh).  Then, duplicate that database and use that newly created database as your test environment.  When you want the clean version, simply duplicate your clean one again and Bob\'s your uncle.I have also researched lot on this, but I could not get the concrete solution for this. Currently the approach I follow is copy the contents in excel from SQL Server Managment studio and then import the data into Oracle-TOAD and then generate the insert statements
