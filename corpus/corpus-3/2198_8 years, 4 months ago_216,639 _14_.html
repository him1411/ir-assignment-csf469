Does somebody know the command to make less display line numbers in the left column?From the manual:-N or --LINE-NUMBERS\n            Causes  a  line  number to be displayed at the beginning of each\n            line in the display.You can also toggle line numbers without quitting less by typing -N.It is possible to toggle any of less\'s command line options in this way.You can also press = while less is open to just display (at the bottom of the screen) information about the current screen, including line numbers.You could filter the file through cat -n before piping to less:Or, if your version of less supports it, the -N option:You can set an enviroment variable to always have these options apply to all less\'d file:Command line flags -N or --LINE-NUMBERS Causes a line number to be displayed at the beginning of each line in the display.You can also toggle line numbers without quitting less by typing -N<return>. It it possible to toggle any of less\'s command line option in this way.If you hit = and expected to see line numbers, but only see byte counts, then line numbers are turned off. Hit -n to turn them on, and make sure $LESS doesn\'t include \'n\'.Turning off line numbers by default (eg. setting LESS=n) speeds up searches in very large files. Handy if you frequently search through big files but don\'t usually care which line you\'re on.I typically run with LESS=RSXin (escape codes enabled, long lines chopped, don\'t clear the screen on exit, ignore case on all lower case searches, no line number counting by default) and only use -n or -S from inside less as needed.
