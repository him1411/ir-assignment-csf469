Is that possible to use grep on a continuous stream?What I mean is sort of a tail -f <file> command, but with grep on the output in order to keep only the lines that interest me.I\'ve tried tail -f <file> | grep pattern but it seems that grep can only be executed once tail finishes, that is to say never.Turn on grep\'s line buffering mode.I use the tail -f <file> | grep <pattern> all the time.It will wait till grep flushes, not till it finishes (I\'m using Ubuntu).I think that your problem is that grep uses some output buffering. Try it will set output buffering mode of grep to unbuffered.In most cases, you can tail -f /var/log/some.log |grep foo and it will work just fine.If you need to use multiple greps on a running log file and you find that you get no output, you may need to stick the --line-buffered switch into your middle grep(s), like so:you may consider this answer as enhancement .. usually I am using -F is better in case of file rotate (-f will not work properly  if file rotated)-A and -B is useful to get lines just before and after the pattern occurrence .. these blocks will appeared between dashed line separatorsYes, this will actually work just fine. Grep and most Unix commands operate on streams one line at a time. Each line that comes out of tail will be analyzed and passed on if it matches.If you want to find matches in the entire file (not just the tail), and you want it to sit and wait for any new matches, this works nicely:The -c +0 flag says that the output should start 0 bytes (-c) from the beginning (+) of the file.sed would be the proper command (stream editor)tail -n0 -f <file> | sed -n \'/search string/p\'and then if you wanted the tail command to exit once you found a particular string:tail --pid=$(($BASHPID+1)) -n0 -f <file> | sed -n \'/search string/{p; q}\'Obviously a bashism: $BASHPID will be the process id of the tail command.  The sed command is next after tail in the pipe, so the sed process id will be $BASHPID+1.Use awk(another great bash utility) instead of grep where you dont have the line buffered option! It will continuously stream your data from tail.this is how you use grep This is how you would use awk
