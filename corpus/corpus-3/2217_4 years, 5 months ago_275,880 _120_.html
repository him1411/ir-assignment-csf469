I have been running into issues with the chrome autofill behavior on several forms. The fields in the form all have very common and accurate names, such as "email", "name", or "password", and they also have autocomplete="off" set. The autocomplete flag has successfully disabled the autocomplete behavior, where a dropdown of values appear as you start typing, but has not changed the values that Chrome auto-populates the fields as. This behavior would be ok except that chrome is filling the inputs incorrectly, for example filling the phone input with an email address. Customers have complained about this, so it\'s verified to be happening in multiple cases, and not as some some sort of result to something that I\'ve done locally on my machine. The only current solution I can think of is to dynamically generate custom input names and then extract the values on the backend, but this seems like a pretty hacky way around this issue. Are there any tags or quirks that change the autofill behavior that could be used to fix this?I\'ve just found that if you have a remembered username and password for a site, the current version of Chrome will autofill your username/email address into the field before any type=password field. It does not care what the field is called - just assumes the field before password is going to be your username.Old SolutionJust use <form autocomplete="off"> and it prevents the password prefilling as well as any kind of heuristic filling of fields based on assumptions a browser may make (which are often wrong). As opposed to using <input autocomplete="off"> which seems to be pretty much ignored by the password autofill (in Chrome that is, Firefox does obey it).Updated SolutionChrome now ignores <form autocomplete="off">. Therefore my original workaround (which I had deleted) is now all the rage.Simply create a couple of fields and make them hidden with "display:none". Example:Then put your real fields underneath.Remember to add the comment or other people on your team will wonder what you are doing!Update March 2016Just tested with latest Chrome - all good. This is a fairly old answer now but I want to just mention that our team has been using it for years now on dozens of projects. It still works great despite a few comments below. There are no problems with accessibility because the fields are display:none meaning they don\'t get focus. As I mentioned you need to put them before your real fields.If you are using javascript to modify your form, there is an extra trick you will need. Show the fake fields while you are manipulating the form and then hide them again a millisecond later. Example code using jQuery (assuming you give your fake fields a class):For new Chrome versions you can just put autocomplete="new-password" in your password field and that\'s it. I\'ve checked it, works fine.Got that tip from Chrome developer in this discussion:\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=370363#c7P.S. don\'t forget to use unique names for different fields to prevent autofilling.After months and months of struggle, I have found that the solution is a lot simpler than you could imagine:Instead of autocomplete="off" use autocomplete="false" ;)As simple as that, and it works like a charm in Google Chrome as well!Sometimes even autocomplete=off would not prevent to fill in credentials into wrong fields. So it fills some field, but not the one for user or nickname!?Fix: browser autofill in by readonly-mode and set writable on focus(focus = at mouse click and tabbing through fields)Update:\nMobile Safari sets cursor in the field, but does not show virtual keyboard. New Fix works like before but handles virtual keyboard:Live Demo https://jsfiddle.net/danielsuess/n0scguv6/// UpdateEndExplanation: Browser auto fills credentials to wrong text field?filling the inputs incorrectly, for example filling the phone input with an email addressSometimes I notice this strange behavior on Chrome and Safari, when there are password fields in the same form. I guess, the browser looks for a password field to insert your saved credentials. Then it autofills username into the nearest textlike-input field , that appears prior the password field in DOM (just guessing due to observation). As the browser is the last instance and you can not control it, This readonly-fix above worked for me.\nUpdate: Pure JavaScript, no need for jQuery.Try this. I know the question is somewhat old, but this is a different approach for the problem.I also noticed the issue comes just above the password field.I tried both the methods like<form autocomplete="off"> and <input autocomplete="off"> but none of them worked for me.So I fixed it using the snippet below - just added another text field just above the password type field and made it display:none.Something like this:Hope it will help someone.I don\'t know why, but this helped and worked for me.I have no idea why, but autocompelete="new-password" disables autofill. It worked in latest 49.0.2623.112 chrome version.For me, simpleDid it.Tested on multiple versions, last try was on 56.0.2924.87Here are my proposed solutions, since Google are insisting on overriding every work-around that people seem to make.Set the values of the inputs to an example for your user (e.g. your@email.com), or the label of the field (e.g. Email) and add a class called focus-select to your inputs:And here\'s the jQuery:I really can\'t see Chrome ever messing with values. That\'d be crazy. So hopefully this is a safe solution.Assuming you have two inputs, such as email and password, set the value of the email field to " " (a space) and add the attribute/value autocomplete="off", then clear this with JavaScript. You can leave the password value empty.If the user doesn\'t have JavaScript for some reason, ensure you trim their input server-side (you probably should be anyway), in case they don\'t delete the space.Here\'s the jQuery:I set a timeout to 15 because 5 seemed to work occasionally in my tests, so trebling this number seems like a safe bet.Failing to set the initial value to a space results in Chrome leaving the input as yellow, as if it has auto-filled it.Put this at the beginning of the form:CSS:Ensure you keep the HTML note so that your other developers don\'t delete it! Also ensure the name of the hidden input is relevant.It is so simple and tricky :)google chrome basically search for every first visible password element inside the <form>, <body> and <iframe> tags to enable auto refill for them, so to disable this you need to add a dummy password element as the following:if your password element inside a <form> tag you need to put the dummy element as the first element in your form immediately after <form> open tag if your password element not inside a <form> tag put the dummy element as the first element in your html page immediately after <body> open tag You need to hide the dummy element without using css display:none so basically use the following as a dummy password element.I\'m adding this bit for a different point of view. Why not honeypot it to stop Chrome from botting your fields? It appears to work cross-browser for me. Worth a shot:Place an input above your other fields you do not want filled. Set the style to display none and the end user will not ever know it\'s there. Also no yellow boxes.You have to add this attribute :Source Link : Full Article I\'ve found that adding this to a form prevents Chrome from using Autofill. Found here. https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=468153#hc41Really disappointing that Chrome has decided that it knows better than the developer about when to Autocomplete. Has a real Microsoft feel to it.adding readonly attribute to the tag along with the onfocus event removing it fixes the issueIf you\'re having issues with keeping placeholders but disabling the chrome autofill I found this workaround. ProblemHTMLhttp://jsfiddle.net/xmbvwfs6/1/The above example still produces the autofill problem, but if you use the required="required" and some CSS you can replicate the placeholders and Chrome won\'t pick up the tags. SolutionHTMLCSS http://jsfiddle.net/mwshpx1o/1/Mike Nelsons provided solution did not work for me in Chrome 50.0.2661.102 m.\nSimply adding an input element of the same type with display:none set no longer disables the native browser auto-complete. It is now necessary to duplicate the name attribute of the input field you wish to disable auto-complete on.Also, to avoid having the input field duplicated when they are within a form element you should place a disabled on the element which is not displayed. This will prevent that element from being submitted as part of the form action.Try the following jQuery code which has worked for me.As per Chromium bug report #352347 Chrome no longer respects autocomplete="off|false|anythingelse", neither on forms nor on inputs.The only solution that worked for me was to add a dummy password field:For username password combos this is an easy issue to resolve. Chrome heuristics looks for the pattern:followed by:Simply break this process by invalidating this:If you are implementing a search box feature, try setting the type attribute to search as follows:This is working for me on Chrome v48 and appears to be legitimate markup:https://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/input.search.htmlThe most recent solution of adding autocomplete="new-password" to the password field works great for preventing Chrome from autofilling it. However, as sibbl pointed out, this doesn\'t prevent Chrome from asking you to save the password after the form submission completes. As of Chrome 51.0.2704.106, I found that you can accomplish this by adding a invisible dummy password field that also has the attribute autocomplete="new-password". Note that "display:none" does not work in this case. e.g. Add something like this before the real password field:This only worked for me when I set the width to a non-zero value. Thanks to tibalt and fareed namrouti for the original answers.There\'s two pieces to this. Chrome and other browsers will remember previously entered values for field names, and provide an autocomplete list to the user based on that (notably, password type inputs are never remembered in this way, for fairly obvious reasons). You can add autocomplete="off" to prevent this on things like your email field.However, you then have password fillers. Most browsers have their own built-in implementations and there\'s also many third-party utilities that provide this functionality. This, you can\'t stop. This is the user making their own choice to save this information to be automatically filled in later, and is completely outside the scope and sphere of influence of your application.Here\'s a dirty hack - You have your element here (adding the disabled attribute):And then at the bottom of your webpage put some JavaScript:I really did not like making hidden fields, I think that making it like that will get really confusing really fast.On the input fields that you want to stop from auto complete this will work. Make the fields read only and on focus remove that attribute like this what this does is you first have to remove the read only attribute by selecting the field and at that time most-likely you will populated with your own user input and stooping the autofill to take over I\'ve faced same problem. And here is the solution for disable auto-fill user name & password on Chrome (just tested with Chrome only)Instead of "this is what worked for me" answers and other answers that look like complete hacks... This is currently how chrome (and the latest spec) will handle the autocomplete attributes on your input elements:https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ui/input/forms/label-and-name-inputs?hl=enTLDR: Add autocomplete=\'<value>\' on your inputs, where <value> should be any string that defines what the field is for. This works similarly to the name attribute. Use the suggested values on the link above where possible. Also, remove the autocomplete attribute from your formBy setting autocomplete to off should work here I have an example which is used by google in search page. I found this from inspect element.edit: \nIn case off isn\'t working then try false or nofill. In my case it is working with chrome version 48.0Previously entered values cached by chrome is displayed as dropdown select list.This can be disabled by autocomplete=off , explicitly saved address in advanced settings of chrome  gives autofill popup when an address field gets focus.This can be disabled by autocomplete="false".But it will allow chrome to display cached values in dropdown.On an input html field following will switch off both.Role="presentation" & autocomplete="off" While selecting input fields for address autofill Chrome ignores those input fields which don\'t have preceding label html element. To ensure chrome parser ignores an input field for autofill address popup a hidden button or image control can be added between label and textbox. This will break chrome parsing sequence of label -input pair creation for autofill.\nCheckboxes are ignored while parsing for address fieldsChrome also considers "for" attribute on label element. It can be used to break parsing sequence of chrome.The only way that works for me was:(jQuery required)Like Dvd Franco said, for me only puting automplete=\'off\' in all fields it worked. So I put this jquery rules in $(document).ready(); function on my main .js fileDifferent solution, webkit based. As mentioned already, anytime Chrome finds a password field it autocompletes the email. AFAIK, this is regardless of autocomplete = [whatever].To circumvent this change the input type to text and apply the webkit security font in whatever form you want.From what I can see this is at least as secure as input type=password, it\'s copy and paste secure. However it is vulnerable by removing the style which will remove asterisks, of course input type = password can easily be changed to input type = text in the console to reveal any autofilled passwords so it\'s much the same really.
