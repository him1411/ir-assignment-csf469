I\'ve downloaded, unzipped and setup Eclipse 3.4.2 with some plugins (noteable, EPIC, Clearcase, QuantumDB, MisterQ). Now I find when I\'m editing Java projects the code completion is not working.  If I type String. and press ctrl+space a popup shows "No Default Proposals" and the status bar at the bottom shows "No completions available".Any ideas?Try restoring the default options in \'Windows > Preferences > Java > Editor > Content Assist > Advanced\'An example of the kind of data you see in this preference screen, however not necessarily what you currently have.(From Vadim in this blog post " Content Assist Duplicates in Eclipse (Mylyn)":\nif have duplicate Mylyn entries, uncheck the duplicate entries that do not contain "(Mylyn)" in their name)The Eclipse help page defines the default list to restore:Select the proposal kinds contained in the \'default\' content assist list:I\'m adding an answer here in case someone else finds this on Google. Same symptoms; different problem. For me, the type caches had become corrupt.From http://mschrag.blogspot.co.nz/2009/01/open-type-cant-find-your-class.htmlFor those running Xfce + having IBus plugin activated, there might be keyboard shortcut conflict.See more info on my blog: http://peter-butkovic.blogspot.de/2013/05/keyboard-shortcut-ctrlspace-caught-in.html UPDATE:as suggested by @nhahtdh\'s comment, adding the some more info to answer directly: IBus plugin in Xfce uses by default Ctrl+Space shortcut for keyboard layout switching. To change it, go to: Options and change it to whatever else you prefer.Check the lib of your project. It may be that you have include two such jar files in which same class is available or say one class in code can be refrenced in two jar files. In such case also eclipse stops assisting code as it is totally confused.Better way to check this is go to the file where assist is not working and comment all imports there, than add imports one by one and check at each import if code-assist is working or not.You can easily find the class with duplicate refrences.None of these worked for me.I was experiencing this issue in only once particular class.  What finally worked for me was to delete the offending class and recreate it.  Problem solved... mystery not so much!If you have installed Google Toolbar for IE, may be you can face the same problem. Because, the toolbar capture the shortcut ctrl+Space.I faced this problem, and spent hours trying to figure out the issue. tried to follow the steps mentioned in the different answers above, the solution I found is on the same lines as Mona suggested, but slightly different. Tried to add as a comment to Mona\'s answer but no option was available.\nIssue with my eclipse was, classpath somehow got corrupted and all the jars and dependent projects were missing. after taking the latest .classpath from repository it worked fine.I had this problem and like @Marc, only on a particular class.  I discovered that I needed to designate Open With = Java Editor.  As a Eclipse newbie I hadn\'t even realized that I was just using a plain editor.In the package explorer, right-click the file and chose "Open With". I also face this issue but it is resolved in different way.\nSteps that I follow may be helpful for others.In case someone comes here and want to activate the autocomplete function, go toPreferences -> Java -> Editor -> Content Assist. Then in the Auto Activation section fill in Auto activation triggers for Java: Check that you did not filter out many options inside the Window > Preferences > Java > Appearance > Type FiltersItems in this list will not be appear in quick fix, be autocompleted, or appear in other various places like the Open Type dialog.Another solution which worked for me is to go to Java--> Appearence --> Type Filters and do disable allIn my case, Intellisense had only disappeared in a few classes in one project. It turned out this was because of a missing library on the build path (although it worked previously).So definitely check all the errors or problems in Eclipse and try to find if a library may be missingI ran into this and it ended up being I was opening the file with the text editor and not the java editor.I wanted to comment on https://stackoverflow.com/users/607470/elroy-flynn\nresponse but the add comment only works after I have a rating of 50? not sure WTF that is...Thanks,\nTomFor me the issue was a conflict between several versions of the same library. The Eclipse assist was using an older version than maven. I had to go to the .m2 directory and delete the unwanted lib version + restart eclipse.I experience problems on Eclipse Neon when editing a file which does not belong to the project directory. When I copy the same file to the project root directory, not even to the src directory, the completion starts working.When the file is opened from a different directory, only completion for JRE works. That is for example: java. completes, but junit. does not.Once you have you configuration checked and completion is still not working:Do you see the right icon beside the file?:It will tell you how the file will be treated by Eclipse:I am posting this answer as I had that story with with Maven webapp artifact. By default Maven-WebApp does not create folder for sources and I put my Java into resources, wondering for 5 minutes what was going on... :)
