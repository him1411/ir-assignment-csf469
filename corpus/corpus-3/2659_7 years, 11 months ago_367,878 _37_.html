Is there a way to make grep output "words" from files that match the search expression?If I want to find all the instances of, say, "th" in a number of files, I can do:but the output will be something like (bold is by me);What I want it to output, using the same search, is:Is this possible using grep? Or using another combination of tools?Try grep -oEdit: matching from Phil\'s commentFrom the docs:Cross distribution safe answer (including windows minGW?)If your using older versions of grep (like 2.4.2) which does not include the -o option. Use the above. Else use the simpler to maintain version below.Linux cross distribution safe answerTo summaries -oh outputs the regular expression matches to the file content (and not its filename), just like how you would expect regular expression to work in vim/etc... What word or regular expression you would be searching for then, is up to you! As long as you remain to POSIX and not perl syntax (refer below)More from the manual for grepThe reason why the original answer does not work for everyoneThe usage of \\w varies from platform to platform, as its an extended "perl" syntax. As such, those grep installation that is limited to work with POSIX character classes uses [[:alpha:]] and not its perl equivalent of \\w. See the Wikipedia page on regular expression for moreUltimately, the POSIX answer above will be alot more reliable regardless of platform (being the original) for grepAs for support of grep without -o option, the first grep outputs the relevant lines, the tr splits the spaces to new lines, the final grep filters only for the respective lines.(PS: I know most platforms by now, would have been patched for \\w.... but there are always those that lag behind)Credit for the "-o" workaround from @AdamRosenfield answerYou could translate spaces to newlines and then grep, e.g.:Just awk, no need combination of tools.I was unsatisfied with awk\'s hard to remember syntax but I liked the idea of using one utility to do this.It seems like ack (or ack-grep if you use Ubuntu) can do this easily:If you omit the -h flag you get:As a bonus, you can use the --output flag to do this for more complex searches with just about the easiest syntax I\'ve found:grep command for only matching and perlTo search all the words with start with "icon-" the following command works perfect. I am using Ack here which is similar to grep but with better options and nice formatting.You can also try pcregrep. There is also a -w option in grep, but in some cases it doesn\'t work as expected.From Wikipedia:I had a similar problem, looking for grep/pattern regex and the "matched pattern found" as output.At the end I used egrep (same regex on grep -e or -G didn\'t give me the same result of egrep) with the option -oso, I think that could be something similar to (I\'m NOT a regex Master) :It\'s more simple than you think. Try this:Where,You could pipe your grep output into Perl like this:Excerpt from grep man page:-w: Select only those lines containing matches that form whole words. The test is that the matching substring  must  either be at the beginning of the line, or preceded by a non-word constituent character.
