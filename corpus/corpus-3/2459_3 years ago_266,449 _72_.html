Say I have a string here:I want to split the string base on white space and assign the values to their respective variablesAlso, sometimes users might not have a last name.The Swift way is to use the global split function, like so:with Swift 2 In Swift 2 the use of split becomes a bit more complicated due to the introduction of the internal CharacterView type. This means that String no longer adopts the SequenceType or CollectionType protocols and you must instead use the .characters property to access a CharacterView type representation of a String instance. (Note: CharacterView does adopt SequenceType and CollectionType protocols).Just call componentsSeparatedByString method on your fullNameUpdate for Swift 3+The easiest method to do this is by using componentsSeparatedBy:For Swift 2:For Swift 3:Swift Dev. 4.0 (May 24, 2017)A new function split in Swift 4 (Beta).Output:Accessing values:Xcode 8.1 / Swift 3.0.1Here is the way multiple delimiters with array.Output:As an alternative to WMios\'s answer, you can also use componentsSeparatedByCharactersInSet, which can be handy in the case you have more separators (blank space, comma, etc.).With your specific input:Using multiple separators:Xcode 8.2.1 \xe2\x80\xa2 Swift 3.0.2If you just need to properly format a person name, you can use PersonNameComponentsFormatter.The NSPersonNameComponentsFormatter class provides localized\n  representations of the components of a person\xe2\x80\x99s name, as represented\n  by a NSPersonNameComponents object. Use this class to create localized\n  names when displaying person name information to the user.Generally, people reinvent this problem and bad solutions over and over. Is this a space? " " and what about "\\n", "\\t" or some unicode whitespace character that you\'ve never seen, in no small part because it is invisible. While you can get away with If you ever need to shake your grip on reality watch a WWDC video on strings or dates. In short, it is almost always better to allow Apple to solve this kind of mundane task. The way to do this correctly, IMHO, is to use NSCharacterSet since as stated earlier your whitespace might not be what you expect and Apple has provided a whitespace character set. To explore the various provided character sets check out Apple\'s NSCharacterSet developer documentation and then, only then, augment or construct a new character set if it doesn\'t fit your needs. Returns a character set containing the characters in Unicode General\n  Category Zs and CHARACTER TABULATION (U+0009).The slightly more concise version of this would beSwift 3.1Xcode 8.0 / Swift 3Long Way:I found an Interesting case, thatmethod 1When I used this command to split some symbol from the data that loaded from server, it can split while test in simulator and sync with test device, but it won\'t split in publish app, and Ad HocIt take me a lot of time to track this error, It might cursed from some Swift Version, or some iOS Version or neitherIt\'s not about the HTML code also, since I try to stringByRemovingPercentEncoding and it\'s still not workaddition 10/10/2015in Swift 2.0 this method has been changed to method 2When I used this command, it can split the same data that load from server correctlyConclusion, I really suggest to use the method 2 Or without closures you can do just this in Swift 2:Most of these answers assume the input contains a space - not whitespace, and a single space at that.  If you can safely make that assumption, then the accepted answer (from bennett) is quite elegant and also the method I\'ll be going with when I can.When we can\'t make that assumption, a more robust solution needs to cover the following siutations that most answers here don\'t consider:To cover these cases this solution uses regex to convert all whitespace (including recurring and Windows newline characters) to a single space, trims, then splits by a single space:Swift 3:I had a scenario where multiple control characters can be present in the string I want to split. Rather than maintain an array of these, I just let Apple handle that part.The following works with Swift 3.0.1 on iOS 10:Swift 3Xcode 7.2 (7C68)Swift 2.2\nError Handling & capitalizedString Added : This has Changed again in Beta 5. Weee! It\'s now a method on CollectionTypeOld: New: Apples Release NotesFor swift 2, XCode 7.1:As per Swift 2.2You just write 2 line code and you will get the split string.Enjoy. :)Here is an algorithm I just build, which will split a String by any Character from the array and if there is any desire to keep the substrings with splitted characters one could set the swallow parameter to true.Xcode 7.3 - Swift 2.2:Example:String handling is still a challenge in Swift and it keeps changing significantly, as you can see from other answers. Hopefully things settle down and it gets simpler. This is the way to do it with the current 3.0 version of Swift with multiple separator characters. Swift 3:Swift 4 makes it much easier to split characters, just use the new split function for Strings.Example:let s = "hi, hello"\ns.split(seperator: ",")\nNow you got an array with \'hi\' and \'hello\'.I haven\'t found the solution that would handle names with 3 or more components and support older iOS versions.Passed test cases:
