In a blog post I use the following PHP to set the content-type of a response:I just got a comment on that post saying that content-type needs to be capitalized, Content-type. Is this correct? It seems to work for me with all lower-case, and I assumed the HTTP headers were case-insensitive. Or does it just work because browsers are nice?From RFC 2616 - "Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1", Section 4.2, "Message Headers":Each header field consists of a name followed by a colon (":") and the field value. Field names are case-insensitive.The updating  RFC 7230 does not list any changes from RFC 2616 at this part.HTTP header names are case-insensitive, according to RFC 2616:4.2:Each header field consists of a name followed by a colon (":") and the field value. Field names are case-insensitive.(Field values may or may not be case-sensitive.)If you trust the major browsers to abide by this, you\'re all set.BTW, unlike most of HTTP, methods (verbs) are case sensitive:5.1.1 MethodThe Method  token indicates the\n  method to be performed on the\n  resource identified by the\n  Request-URI. The method is\n  case-sensitive.header(\'Content-type: image/png\') \ndid not work with PHP 5.5 serving IE11, as in the image stream was shown as textheader(\'Content-Type: image/png\') \nworked, as in the image appeared as an imageOnly difference is the capital \'T\'.tldr; both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 headers are case-insensitive. According to RFC 7230 (HTTP/1.1):Each header field consists of a case-insensitive field name\n  followed by a colon (":"), optional leading whitespace, the field\n  value, and optional trailing whitespace.https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2Also, RFC 7540 (HTTP/2):Just as in HTTP/1.x, header field names are strings of ASCII\n  characters that are compared in a case-insensitive fashion.https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-8.1.2The RFC for HTTP (as cited above) dictates that the headers are case-insensitive, however you will find that with certain browsers (I\'m looking at you, IE) that capitalizing each of the words tends to be best:vsThis isn\'t "HTTP" standard, but just another one of the browser quirks, we as developers, have to think about.
