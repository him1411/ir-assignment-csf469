In Python, what are the differences between the urllib, urllib2, and requests module? Why are there three? They seem to do the same thing...I know its been said already, but I\'d highly recommend the Requests python package:\nhttp://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.htmlIf you\'ve used languages other than python, you\'re probably thinking urllib and urllib2 are easy to use, not much code, and highly capable, that\'s how I used to think.  But the Requests package is so unbelievably useful and short that everyone should be using it.First, it supports a fully restful API, and is as easy as:Regardless of whether GET/POST you never have to encode parameters again, it simply takes a dictionary as an argument and is good to go.Plus it even has a built in json decoder (again, i know json.loads() isn\'t a lot more to write, but this sure is convenient):Or if your response data is just text, use:This is just the tip of the iceberg. This is the list of features from the requests site:urllib2 provides some extra functionality, namely the urlopen() function can allow you to specify headers (normally you\'d have had to use httplib in the past, which is far more verbose.) More importantly though, urllib2 provides the Request class, which allows for a more declarative approach to doing a request:Note that urlencode() is only in urllib, not urllib2.There are also handlers for implementing more advanced URL support in urllib2.  The short answer is, unless you\'re working with legacy code, you probably want to use the URL opener from urllib2, but you still need to import into urllib for some of the utility functions.Bonus answer\nWith Google App Engine, you can use any of httplib, urllib or urllib2, but all of them are just wrappers for Google\'s URL Fetch API. That is, you are still subject to the same limitations such as ports, protocols, and the length of the response allowed. You can use the core of the libraries as you would expect for retrieving HTTP URLs, though.urllib and urllib2 are both Python modules that do URL request related stuff but offer different functionalities.1) urllib2 can accept a Request object to set the headers for a URL request, urllib accepts only a URL.2) urllib provides the urlencode method which is used for the generation of GET query strings, urllib2 doesn\'t have such a function. This is one of the reasons why urllib is often used along with urllib2.Requests - Requests\xe2\x80\x99 is a simple, easy-to-use HTTP library written in Python.1) Python Requests encodes the parameters automatically so you just pass them as simple arguments, unlike in the case of urllib, where you need to use the method urllib.encode() to encode the parameters before passing them.2) It automatically decoded the response into Unicode.3) Requests also has far more convenient error handling.If your authentication failed, urllib2 would raise a urllib2.URLError, while Requests would return a normal response object, as expected. All you have to see if the request was successful by boolean response.okFor example reference - https://dancallahan.info/journal/python-requests/urllib2.urlopen accepts an instance of the Request class or a url, whereas urllib.urlopen only accepts a url.A similar discussion took place here:\nhttp://www.velocityreviews.com/forums/t326690-urllib-urllib2-what-is-the-difference.htmlI like the urllib.urlencode function, and it doesn\'t appear to exist in urllib2. One considerable difference is about porting Python2 to Python3. urllib2 does not exist for python3 and its methods ported to urllib.\nSo you are using that heavily and want to migrate to Python3 in future, consider using urllib.\nHowever 2to3 tool will automatically do most of the work for you.You should generally use urllib2, since this makes things a bit easier at times by accepting Request objects and will also raise a URLException on protocol errors. With Google App Engine though, you can\'t use either. You have to use the URL Fetch API that Google provides in its sandboxed Python environment.
