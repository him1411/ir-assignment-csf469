I accidentally committed to the wrong branch.\nHow do I delete that commit?Delete the most recent commit, keeping the work you\'ve done:Delete the most recent commit, destroying the work you\'ve done:Don\'t delete it: for just one commit git cherry-pick is enough.But if you had several commits on the wrong branch, that is where git rebase --onto shines:Suppose you have this:, then you can mark master and move it where you would want to be:, reset y branch where it should have been:, and finally move your commits (reapply them, making actually new commits)Do a git rebase -i FAR_ENOUGH_BACK and drop the line for the commit you don\'t want.If you want to move that commit to another branch, get the SHA of the commit in questionThen switch the current branchAnd cherry-pick the commit to other-branchFor your reference, I believe you can "hard cut" commits out of your current branch not only with git reset --hard, but also with the following command:In fact, if you don\'t care about checking out, you can set the branch to whatever you want with:This would be a programmatic way to remove commits from a branch, for instance, in order to copy new commits to it (using rebase).Suppose you have a branch that is disconnected from master because you have taken sources from some other location and dumped it into the branch.You now have a branch in which you have applied changes, let\'s call it "topic".You will now create a duplicate of your topic branch and then rebase it onto the source code dump that is sitting in branch "dump":Now your changes are reapplied in branch topic_duplicate based on the starting point of "dump" but only the commits that have happened since "master". So your changes since master are now reapplied on top of "dump" but the result ends up in "topic_duplicate".You could then replace "dump" with "topic_duplicate" by doing:Or withOr just by discarding the dumpPerhaps you could also just cherry-pick after clearing the current "topic_duplicate".What I am trying to say is that if you want to update the current "duplicate" branch based off of a different ancestor you must first delete the previously "cherrypicked" commits by doing a git reset --hard <last-commit-to-retain> or git branch -f topic_duplicate <last-commit-to-retain> and then copying the other commits over (from the main topic branch) by either rebasing or cherry-picking.Rebasing only works on a branch that already has the commits, so you need to duplicate your topic branch each time you want to do that.Cherrypicking is much easier:So the entire sequence will come down to:When your topic-duplicate branch has been checked out. That would remove previously-cherry-picked commits from the current duplicate, and just re-apply all of the changes happening in "topic" on top of your current "dump" (different ancestor). It seems a reasonably convenient way to base your development on the "real" upstream master while using a different "downstream" master to check whether your local changes also still apply to that. Alternatively you could just generate a diff and then apply it outside of any Git source tree. But in this way you can keep an up-to-date modified (patched) version that is based on your distribution\'s version while your actual development is against the real upstream master.So just to demonstrate:Hope this helps someone. I was meaning to rewrite this, but I cannot manage now. Regards.If you have a backup of your code (including .git folder), delete the .git folder from your latest codebase. Copy old .git folder to latest codebase. Execute git pull. Note: Please use this solution only if you are running out of time and are confused a lot.
