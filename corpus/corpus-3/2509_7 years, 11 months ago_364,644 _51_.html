What is the Ruby function to remove all white space? Kind of like php\'s trim()?If you want to remove only leading and trailing whitespace (like PHP\'s trim) you can use .strip, but if you want to remove all whitespace, you can use .gsub(/\\s+/, "") instead .And to emulate PHP\'s trim() function:Related answer:returnsDelete works faster =)You can use squish method. It removes white space on both ends of the string and groups multiple white space to single space.For eg.will result to: Check this reference from api.rubyonrails.org.EDIT:\nIt works only for ruby on railsIt\'s a bit late, but anyone else googling this page might be interested in this version -If you want to clean up a chunk of pre-formatted text that a user may have cut & pasted into your app somehow, but preserve the word spacing, try this:String#strip - remove all whitespace from the start and the end.String#lstrip - just from the start.String#rstrip - just from the end.String#chomp (with no arguments) - deletes line separators (\\n or \\r\\n) from the end.String#chop - deletes the last character.String#delete - x.delete(" \\t\\r\\n") - deletes all listed whitespace.String#gsub - x.gsub(/[[:space:]]/, \'\') - removes all whitespace, including unicode ones.Note: All the methods above return a new string instead of mutating the original. If you want to change the string in place, call the corresponding method with ! at the end.Ruby\'s .strip method performs the PHP equivalent to trim().To remove all whitespace:@Tass made me aware that my original answer removes duplicate letters in succession - YUCK! I\'ve since switched to the squish method which is smarter about such occurrences if using the Rails framework.Cite: http://apidock.com/rails/String/squishIt will removes left & right side spaces.\nThis code would give us: "Raheem Shaik"Also don\'t forget:split.join will blast all spaces anywhere in the string.It\'s easy to type and remember, so it\'s nice on the console and for quick hacking. Arguably not welcome in serious code though as it masks the intent.(Based on Piotr\'s comment in Justicle\'s answer above.)Use gsub or delete. The difference is gsub could remove tabs, while delete cannot. Sometimes you do have tabs in files which are added by the editors.My personal preference is using the method .tras in:Thanks to @FrankScmitt for pointing out that to make this delete all whitespace(not just spaces) you would need to write it as such:For behavior exactly matching PHP trim, the simplest method is to use the String#strip method, like so:Ruby also has an edit-in-place version, as well, called String.strip! (note the trailing \'!\').  This doesn\'t require creating a copy of the string, and can be significantly faster for some uses:Both versions produce this output:I created a benchmark to test the performance of some basic uses of strip and strip!, as well as some alternatives.  The test is this:These are the results:You Could try thisusing :space: removes non breaking space along with regular space.Ruby\'s .scan() and .join() methods of String can also help to overcome whitespace in string.scan(/\\w+/).join will remove all spaces and join the stringIt is also removing space from left and right part of the string. Means ltrim, rtrim and trim. Just in case if someone has background over C, FoxPro or Visual Basic and jump in Ruby.\n2.1.6 :002 > string = " White spaces in me ".scan(/\\w+/).join\n => "Whitespacesinme" \n2.1.6 :003 > string = " White spaces in me".scan(/\\w+/).join\n => "Whitespacesinme" \n2.1.6 :004 > string = "White spaces in me ".scan(/\\w+/).join\n => "Whitespacesinme" \n2.1.6 :005 >\nI was trying to do this as I wanted to use a records "title" as an id in the view but the titles had spaces.a solution is:I would use something like this:You can try this:in order to get this:or if you want a single string, just use:
