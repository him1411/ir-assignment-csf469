I have JSON data stored in the variable data.I want to write this to a text file for testing so I don\'t have to grab the data from the server each time.Currently, I am trying this:And am receiving the error: TypeError: must be string or buffer, not dictHow to fix this?You forgot the actual JSON part - data is a dictionary and not yet JSON-encoded. Write it like this:Note: Works on both 3.x and 2.x .To get utf8-encoded file as opposed to ascii-encoded in the accepted answer for Python 2 use:The code is simpler in Python 3:On Windows, the encoding=\'utf-8\' argument to open is still necessary.To avoid storing an encoded copy of the data in memory (result of dumps) and to output utf8-encoded bytestrings in both Python 2 and 3, use:The codecs.getwriter call is redundant in Python 3 but required for Python 2Readability and size:The use of ensure_acsii=False gives better readability and smaller size:Further improve readability by adding flags indent=4, sort_keys=True (as suggested by dinos66) to arguments of dump or dumps. This way you\'ll get a nicely indented sorted structure in the json file at the cost of a slightly larger file size.I would answer with slight modification with aforementioned answers and that is to write a prettified JSON file which human eyes can read better. For this, pass sort_keys as True and indent with 4 space characters and you are good to go. Also take care of ensuring that the ascii codes will not be written in your JSON file:Explanation of the parameters of json.dump:.jsonFor your application, the following might be important:See also: Comparison of data serialization formatsIn case you are rather looking for a way to make configuration files, you might want to read my short article Configuration files in PythonFor those of you who are trying to dump greek or other "exotic" languages such as me but are also having problems (unicode errors) with weird characters such as the peace symbol (\\u262E) or others which are often contained in json formated data such as Twitter\'s, the solution could be as follows (sort_keys is obviously optional):I don\'t have enough reputation to add in comments, so I just write some of my findings of this annoying TypeError here:Basically, I think it\'s a bug in the json.dump() function in Python 2 only - It can\'t dump a Python (dictionary / list) data containing non-ASCII characters, even you open the file with the encoding = \'utf-8\' parameter. (i.e. No matter what you do). But, json.dumps() works on both Python 2 and 3.To illustrate this, following up phihag\'s answer: the code in his answer breaks in Python 2 with exception TypeError: must be unicode, not str, if data contains non-ASCII characters. (Python 2.7.6, Debian):It however works fine in Python 3.Write a data in file using JSON use json.dump() or json.dumps() used.\nwrite like this to store data in file.this example in list is store to a file.Here is a useful structure to both read and write a file in Python 3.if you are trying to write a pandas dataframe into a file using a json format i\'d recommend this
