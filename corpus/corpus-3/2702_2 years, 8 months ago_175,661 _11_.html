This question already has an answer here:I\'m working with android studio 1.1 Preview 1And I noticed that when I create a new project I\'m getting next hierarchy:mipmap folders for diffrent DPIs, No more diffrent DPIs drawable folders.Should I put all my resources in the mipmap folders, or just the app icon?The mipmap folders are for placing your app/launcher icons (which are shown on the homescreen) in only. Any other drawable assets you use should be placed in the relevant drawable folders as before.According to this Google blogpost:It\xe2\x80\x99s best practice to place your app icons in mipmap- folders (not the drawable- folders) because they are used at resolutions different from the device\xe2\x80\x99s current density.When referencing the mipmap- folders ensure you are using the following reference:The reason they use a different density is that some launchers actually display the icons larger than they were intended. Because of this, they use the next size up.
