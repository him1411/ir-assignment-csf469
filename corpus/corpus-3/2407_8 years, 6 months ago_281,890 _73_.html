I am using WordPress on my live server which only uses SFTP using an SSH key.  I want to install and upgrade plugins, but it appears that you are required to enter your FTP login to install the plugins. Is there a way to install and upgrade plugins by manually uploading the files instead of having WordPress handle the entire process? WordPress will only prompt you for your FTP connection information while trying to install plugins or a WordPress update if it cannot write to /wp-content directly. Otherwise, if your web server has write access to the necessary files, it will take care of the updates and installation automatically. This method does not require you to have FTP/SFTP or SSH access, but it does require your to have specific file permissions set up on your webserver.It will try various methods in order, and fall back on FTP if Direct and SSH methods are unavailable.https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/4.2.2/wp-admin/includes/file.php#L912WordPress will try to write a temporary file to your /wp-content directory. If this succeeds, it compares the ownership of the file with its own uid, and if there is a match it will allow you to use the \'direct\' method of installing plugins, themes, or updates.Now, if for some reason you do not want to rely on the automatic check for which filesystem method to use, you can define a constant, \'FS_METHOD\' in your wp-config.php file, that is either \'direct\', \'ssh\', \'ftpext\' or \'ftpsockets\' and it will use that method. Keep in mind that if you set this to \'direct\', but your web user (the username under which your web server runs) does not have proper write permissions, you will receive an error.In summary, if you do not want to (or you cannot) change permissions on wp-content so your web server has write permissions, then add this to your wp-config.php file:Permissions explained here: As stated before none of the perm fixes work anymore. You need to change the perms accordingly AND put the following in your wp-config.php:Just wanted to add that you must NEVER set the wp-content permission or permission of any folder to 777. This is what I had to do to:1) I set the ownership of the wordpress folder (recursively) to the apache user, like so:# chown -R apache wordpress/2) I changed the group ownership of the wordpress folder (recursively) to the apache group, like so:# chgrp -R apache wordpress/3) give owner full privilege to the directory, like so:# chmod u+wrx wordpress/*And that did the job. My wp-content folder has 755 permissions, btw.TL;DR version:Worked on version 3.2.1Just a quick change to wp-config.phpThat\xe2\x80\x99s it, enjoy your wordpress updates without ftp!Alternate Method:There are hosts out there that will prevent this method from working\n  to ease your WordPress updating.  Fortunately, there is another way to\n  keep this pest from prompting you for your FTP user name and password.Again, after the MYSQL login declarations in your wp-config.php file,\n  add the following:In order to enable the use of SSH2 for your updates and theme uploads, you have to generate your SSH keys and have the PHP SSH module installed. Then WordPress will detect that you have SSH2 available and you\'ll see a different option (SSH2) displayed when doing an upload/upgrade.1.) Make sure you have the PHP module installed for debian it is:2.) Generate SSH keys, adding a passphrase is optional:3.) Change the permission so that WordPress can access those keys:Now you\'ll get the SSH2 option when doing an upload/upgrade/plugin.\n4.) For added ease you can setup the defaults in your wp-config.php and this will pre-populate the SSH credentials in the WordPress upload window.The \'passphrase\' is optional, if you don\'t setup a passphrase during ssh-kengen; then don\'t add it in wp-config.phpThis solved my issue. And I didn\'t have to do the chown at all. But I have seen this method referenced in other places.References:open wp-config.php file and add the following line:define(\'FS_METHOD\', \'direct\');Usually you can just upload your plugin to the wp-content\\plugins directory. If you don\'t have access to this directory via SFTP I\'m afraid you may be stuck.Execute the following code in terminalFor further detail visit \nWordpress on Ubuntu install plugins without FTP accessAdd the following code to wp-configFS_METHOD forces the filesystem method. It should only be direct, ssh2, ftpext, or ftpsockets. Generally, you should only change this if you are experiencing update problems. If you change it and it doesn\'t help, change it back/remove it. Under most circumstances, setting it to \'ftpsockets\' will work if the automatically chosen method does not.(Primary Preference) "direct" forces it to use Direct File I/O requests from within PHP, this is fraught with opening up security issues on poorly configured hosts, This is chosen automatically when appropriate.(Secondary Preference) "ssh2" is to force the usage of the SSH PHP Extension if installed(3rd Preference) "ftpext" is to force the usage of the FTP PHP Extension for FTP Access, and finally(4th Preference) "ftpsockets" utilises the PHP Sockets Class for FTP AccessFor more information visit: http://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#WordPress_Upgrade_ConstantsIf you\'re on Ubuntu, a quick solution that worked for me is giving ownership to the Apache user (www-data by default) like so:You can get it very easily by typing the following command on command promtWhere "your_folder_name" is the folder where your WordPress is installed inside this folder.WordPress 2.7 lets you upload a zip file directly (there\'s a link at the bottom of the plugins page) -- no FTP access needed.  This is a new feature in 2.7, and it works for plugins only (not themes yet).Resurrecting an old thread, but there\'s a fantastic new plugin called SSH SFTP Updater Support that adds in SFTP capabilities without needing to edit your wp-config.php file. Also, Wordpress\'s SFTP implementation relies on some somewhat obscure PHP modules that are often not enabled on servers; this plugin packages a different PHP SFTP plugin so you don\'t have to configure anything on the Apache side. I had run into tons of problems getting SFTP support to work - this plugin solved all of them and is just fantastic.I also recommend the SSH SFTP Updater Support plugin. Just solved all my problems too...especially in regards to getting plugins to delete through the admin. Just install it in the usual way, and the next time you\'re prompted by WordPress for FTP details, there\'ll be extra fields for you to copy/paste your private SSH key or upload your PEM file.Only problem I have is in getting it to remember the key (tried both methods). Don\'t like the idea of having to find and enter it every time I need to delete a plugin. But at least it\'s a solid fix for now.Try this1) In the wp-config.php add define(\'FS_METHOD\', \'direct\');2) Set the "wp-content" directory to 777 for writable.3) Now install the plugin.The answer from stereointeractive covers all the options. Just wanted to mention an alternate way of using FTP. I\'m guessing that the reason you are not allowing FTP access is for security. One way to address those security concerns is to run your FTP server listening only on 127.0.0.1 This allows you to use FTP from inside WordPress and you will be able to install plugins while not exposing it to the rest of the world. This can also be applied to other popular web applications such as Joomla! and Drupal. This is what we do with our BitNami appliances and cloud servers and works quite well.Yes, directly install the plugin in WordPress.other OptionIt is possible to use SFTP or SSH to auto update Plugins in WordPress, but you need to have ssh2 pecl extension. You can find out how to do it, using the following tutorialWe use SFTP with SSH (on both our development and live servers), and I have tried (not too hard though) to use the WordPress upload feature. I agree with Toby, upload your plugin(s) to the wp-content/plugins directory and then activate them from there.I saw a lot of people recommending to set permission to 777. I had same problem like 2 days ago and all I did was, add this to wp-contentand set permission to 775 for plugin folderThis solved my problem of asking FTP access login/password.Before that, I had to add plugin manually by adding .zip file to plugin folder and then go to wp-admin/plugins and had to installed it.1.change from php_mod to fastcgi with cgi & SuEXEC enabled\n,works for me don\'t forget if don\'t work try to change \n     2. change wp-content to 775\nas root \nchmod -R 775 ./wp-content \n3- add to wp-config.php \ndefine(\'FS_METHOD\', \'direct\');i hope it works
