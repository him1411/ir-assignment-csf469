I\'m trying to follow a very basic example.  Using the starter page and the grid system, I was hoping the following:...would produce centered text.However, it still appears on the far left. What am I doing wrong?For other types of content, see Flavien\'s answer.Update: Bootstrap 2.3.0+ AnswerThe original answer was for an early version of bootstrap. As of bootstrap 2.3.0, you can simply give the div the class .text-center.Original Answer (pre 2.3.0)You need to define one of the two classes, row or span12 with a text-align: center. See http://jsfiddle.net/xKSUH/ or http://jsfiddle.net/xKSUH/1/NOTE: this was removed in Bootstrap 3.Pre-Bootstrap 3, you could use the CSS class pagination-centered like this:Class pagination-centered is already in bootstrap.css (or bootstrap.min.css) and has the only one rule:With Bootstrap 2.3.0. just use class text-centerI guess most of the people here are actually searching for the way to center the whole div and not only the text content (which is trivial\xe2\x80\xa6).The second way (instead of using text-align:center) to center things in html is to have an element with a fixed width and auto margin (left and right). With bootstrap, the style defining auto margins is the "container" class.Take a look here for a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/D2RLR/7788/Bootstrap 3.1.1 has a .center-block class for centering divs. See: http://getbootstrap.com/css/#helper-classes-center.Center content blocks Set an element to display: block and center via margin. Available as a mixin and class.Or, as others have already said, use the .text-center class to centre text.The best way to do this is define a css style:Then where ever you need centered text you add it like so:or if you just want the p tag centered:The less inline css you use the better.As of February 2013, in some cases, I add a "centred" class to the "span" div:and to CSS:The reason for this is because the span* div\'s get floated to the left, and the "auto margin" centering technique works only if the div is not floated.Demo (on JSFiddle): http://jsfiddle.net/5RpSh/8/embedded/result/JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/5RpSh/8/The class .show-grid is applying center aligned text in the example in the link.You can always add style="text-align:center" to your row div or some other class I would think."Centered content" can mean many different things, and Bootstrap centering has changed a lot since the original post.Bootstrap 3Demo Bootstrap 3 Horizontal CenteringBootstrap 4mx-auto (auto x-axis margins) will center display:block or display:flex elements that have a defined width, (%, vw, px, etc..). Flexbox is used by default on grid columns, so there are also various flexbox centering methods.Demo Bootstrap 4 Horizontal CenteringNow that Bootstrap 4 is flexbox by default there are many different approaches to vertical alignment using: auto-margins, flexbox utils, or the display utils along with vertical align utils. At first "vertical align utils" seems obvious but these only work with inline and table display elements. Here are some Bootstrap 4 vertical centering options..1 - Vertical Center Using Auto Margins:Another way to vertically center is to use my-auto. This will center the element within it\'s container. For example, h-100 makes the row full height, and my-auto will vertically center the col-sm-12 column.Vertical Center Using Auto Margins Demomy-auto represents margins on the vertical y-axis and is equivalent to:2 - Vertical Center with Flexbox:Since Bootstrap 4 .row is now display:flex you can simply use align-self-center on any column to vertically center it...or, use align-items-center on the entire .row to vertically center align all col-* in the row...Vertical Center Different Height Columns Demo3 - Vertical Center Using Display Utils:Bootstrap 4 has display utils that can be used for display:table, display:table-cell, display:inline, etc.. These can be used with the vertical alignment utils to align inline, inline-block or table cell elements.Vertical Center Using Display Utils DemoIf you use bootstrap 3, it also has built-in css class named .text-center. That\'s what you want.please see the example in jsfiddle. http://jsfiddle.net/ucheng/Q4Fue/Bootstrap 2.3 has a text-center class. On my side I define new CSS styles ready to use and easy to remember:Is it a good idea? \nIs there any good practice for this?If you are using Bootstrap 2.0+This can make the div centered to the page.Any text-align utility class would do the trick. Bootstrap has been using .text-center class for centering text for a long time now.Or you can create your own utilities. Some variations I\'ve seen over the years:My preferred method for centering blocks of information while maintaining responsiveness (mobile compatibility) is to place two empty span1 divs before and after the content you wish to center.For Bootstrap Version 3.1.1 Above the best class for center the content it is .center-block Helper class.You need to adjust with the .span - example:Center-block is also an option not referred in above answersAll the class center-block does is to tell the element to have a margin of 0 auto, the auto being the left/right margins. However, unless the class text-center or css text-align:center; is set on the parent, the element does not know the point to work out this auto calculation from so will not center itself as anticipated.\nSo text-center is a better option.You can use any one of the below typesUse column offsetEx: <div class="col-md-offset-6 col-md-12"></div>I created this class to keep the  centered regardless of screen size while maintaining responsive features:Sometimes the answer is right in your face and you look here and there :)do not use container-fluid in the mainI tried two ways and it worked fine to center the div. Both the ways will align the divs in all screens.Way 1: Using Push: Way 2: Using Offset:Result:ExplanationBootstrap will designate to the left, the first column of specified screen-occupancy. If we use offset or push it will shift \'this\' column by \'those\' many columns. Though I faced some issues in responsiveness of offset, but push was awesome
