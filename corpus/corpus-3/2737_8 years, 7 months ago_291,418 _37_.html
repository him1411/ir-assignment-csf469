How do you set the cursor position in a text field using jQuery?  I\'ve got a text field with content, and I want the users cursor to be positioned at a certain offset when they focus on the field.  The code should look kind of like this:What would the implementation of that setCursorPosition function look like?  If you had a text field with the content abcdefg, this call would result in the cursor being positioned as follows: abcd**|**efg.Java has a similar function, setCaretPosition.  Does a similar method exist for javascript?Update: I modified CMS\'s code to work with jQuery as follows:I have two functions:Then you can use setCaretToPos like this:Live example with both a textarea and an input, showing use from jQuery:As of 2016, tested and working on Chrome, Firefox, IE11, even IE8 (see that last here; Stack Snippets don\'t support IE8).Here\'s a jQuery solution:With this, you can doThe solutions here are right except for the jQuery extension code.The extension function should iterate over each selected element and return this to support chaining. Here is the a correct version:I found a solution that works for me:Now you can move the focus to end of any element by calling:This worked for me on Safari 5 on Mac OSX, jQuery 1.4:I\'m using this: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jCaretSet the focus before you have inserted the text into the textarea thus?I do realize that this is a very old post, but I thought that I should offer perhaps a simpler solution to update it using only jQuery.Usage for using ctrl-enter to add a new line (like in Facebook):I am open to critique. Thank you.UPDATE: This solution does not allow normal copy and paste functionality to work (i.e. ctrl-c, ctrl-v), so I will have to edit this in the future to make sure that part works again. If you have an idea how to do that, please comment here, and I will be happy to test it out. Thanks.In IE to move cursor on some position this code is enough:Small modification to the code I found in bitbucketCode is now able to select/highlight with start/end points if given 2 positions.\nTested and works fine in FF/Chrome/IE9/Opera.The code is listed below, only a few lines changed:This works for me in chromeApparently you need a delay of a microsecond or more, because usually a user focusses on the text field by clicking at some position in the text field (or by hitting tab) which you want to override, so you have to wait till the position is set by the user click and then change it.Just remember to return false right after the function call if you\'re using the arrow keys since Chrome fricks the frack up otherwise.Based on this question, the answer will not work perfectly for ie and opera when there is new line in the textarea. \nThe answer explain how to adjust the selectionStart, selectionEnd before calling setSelectionRange.I have try the adjustOffset from the other question with the solution proposed by @AVProgrammer and it work.You can directly change the prototype if setSelectionRange does not exist.jsFiddle linkI had to get this working for contenteditable elements and jQuery and tought someone might want it ready to use:Usage $(selector).getCaret() returns the number offset and $(selector).setCaret(num) establishes the offeset and sets focus on element.Also a small tip, if you run $(selector).setCaret(num) from console it will return the console.log but you won\'t visualize the focus since it is established at the console window.Bests ;D
