I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a search field. Right now it searches for every keyup. So if someone types \xe2\x80\x9cWindows\xe2\x80\x9d, it will make a search with AJAX for every keyup: \xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cWi\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cWin\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cWind\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cWindo\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cWindow\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cWindows\xe2\x80\x9d.I want to have a delay, so it only searches when the user stops typing for 200 ms.There is no option for this in the keyup function, and I have tried setTimeout, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t work.How can I do that?I use this function for the same purpose, executing a function after the user has stopped typing for a specified amount of time:Usage:For something more sophisticated, give a look to the jQuery Typewatch plugin.If you want to search after the type is done use a global variable to hold the timeout returned from your setTimout call and cancel it with a clearTimeout if it hasn\'t yet happend so that it won\'t fire the timeout except on the last keyup eventOr with an anonymous function :You could also look at underscore.js, which provides utility methods like debounce:Another slight enhancement on CMS\'s answer. To easily allow for separate delays, you can use the following:If you want to reuse the same delay, just doIf you want separate delays, you can doBased on the answer of CMS, I made this :Put the code below after include jQuery :And simply use like this :Careful : the $(this) variable in the function passed as a parameter does not match inputThis worked for me where I delay the search logic operation and make a check if the value is same as entered in text field. If value is same then I go ahead and perform the operation for the data related to search value.Delay Multi Function Calls using LabelsThis is the solution i work with. It will delay the execution on ANY function you want. It can be the keydown search query, maybe the quick click on previous or next buttons ( that would otherwise send multiple request if quickly clicked continuously , and be not used after all). This uses a global object that stores each execution time, and compares it with the most current request. So the result is that only that last click / action will actually be called, because those requests are stored in a queue, that after the X milliseconds is called if no other request with the same label exists in the queue!You can set your own delay time ( its optional, defaults to 500ms). And send your function arguments in a "closure fashion".For example if you want to call the bellow function:To prevent multiple send_ajax requests, you delay them using:delay_method( "check date", function(){ send_ajax(2); } ,600);Every request that uses the label "check date" will only be triggered if no other request is made in the 600 miliseconds timeframe. This argument is optionalLabel independency (calling the same target function) but run both: Results in calling the same function but delay them independently because of their labels being differentI\'m surprised that nobody mention the problem with multiple input in CMS\'s very nice snipped.Basically, you would have to define delay variable individually for each input. Otherwise if sb put text to first input and quickly jump to other input and start typing, callback for the first one WON\'T be called!See the code below I came with based on other answers:This solution keeps setTimeout reference within input\'s delayTimer variable. It also passes reference of element to callback as fazzyx suggested.Tested in IE6, 8(comp - 7), 8 and Opera 12.11.This function extends the function from Gaten\'s answer a bit in order to get the element back:http://jsfiddle.net/Us9bu/2/Delay function to call up on every keyup.\njQuery 1.7.1 or up requiredUsage: $(\'#searchBox\').keyupDelay( cb );If someone like to delay the same function, and without external variable he can use the next script:Use where expression is the script to run and timeout is the time to wait in milliseconds before it runs - this does NOT hault the script, but simply delays execution of that part until the timeout is done.will reset/clear the timeout so it does not run the script in expression (like a cancel) as long as it has not yet been executed.This is a solution along the lines of CMS\'s, but solves a few key issues for me:Usage:The code is written in a style I enjoy, you may need to add a bunch of semicolons.Things to keep in mind:The solution I use adds another level of complexity, allowing you to cancel execution, for example, but this is a good base to build on.Based on the answer of CMS, it just ignores the key events that doesn\'t change value. Super simple approach, designed to run a function after a user has finished typing in a text field...Use the bindWithDelay jQuery plugin:Here is a suggestion I have written that takes care of multiple input in your form.This function gets the Object of the input field, put in your codeThis is the actual delayCall function, takes care of multiple input fieldsUsage:Combining CMS answer with Miguel\'s one yields a robust solution allowing concurrent delays.When you need to delay different actions independently, use the third argument.Take a look at the autocomplete plugin.  I know that it allows you to specify a delay or a minimum number of characters.  Even if you don\'t end up using the plugin, looking through the code will give you some ideas on how to implement it yourself.Well, i also made a piece of code for limit high frequency ajax request cause by Keyup / Keydown. Check this out:https://github.com/raincious/jQueueDo your query like this:And bind event like this:Saw this today a little late but just want to put this here in case someone else needed.  just separate the function to make it reusable.  the code below will wait 1/2 second after typing stop.
