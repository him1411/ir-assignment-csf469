I imported my working project on other computer so it started to download dependencies.  Apparently in the meantime my internet connection crashed. Now I get:Build errors for comics; org.apache.maven.lifecycle.LifecycleExecutionException:\n  Failed to execute goal on project comicsTest: Could not resolve dependencies for project comicsTest:comicsTest:war:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT:\n  The following artifacts could not be resolved:\n  org.springframework:spring-context:jar:3.0.5.RELEASE,\n  org.hibernate:hibernate-entitymanager:jar:3.6.0.Final,\n  org.hibernate:hibernate-core:jar:3.6.0.Final,\n  org.hibernate:hibernate-commons-annotations:jar:3.2.0.Final,\n  org.aspectj:aspectjweaver:jar:1.6.8,\n  commons-lang:commons-lang:jar:2.5,mysql:mysql-connector-java:jar:5.1.13: Failure to transfer org.springframework:spring-context:jar:3.0.5.RELEASE from http://repo1.maven.org/maven2 was cached in the local repository, resolution will not be reattempted until the update interval of central has elapsed or updates are forced.Original error: Could not transfer artifact org.springframework:spring-context:jar:3.0.5.RELEASE from central (http://repo1.maven.org/maven2): No response received after 60000And I have no idea how to force maven to update?-U means force update of snapshot dependencies.  Release dependencies can\'t not be updated this way.-U seems to force update of all dependencies. If you want to update a single dependency without clean or -U you could just remove it from your local repo and then build. The example below if for updating slf4j-api 1.7.1-SNAPSHOT:You can do effectively from Eclipse IDE. Of course if you are using it.All the answers here didn\'t work for me. I used the hammer method: That fixed the problem :-) If your local repository is somehow mucked up for release jars as opposed to snapshots (-U and --update-snapshots only update snapshots), you can purge the local repo using the following:You probably then want to clean and install again:Lots more info available at https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin/examples/purging-local-repository.htmlIf you\'re unsure what is inside your local repository, I recommend to fire a build with the option:That way you\'ll ensure to build in a cleanroom environment.In my case first I did\nmvn clean install -U \nstill it was showing same error then I closed project and agian reopened it.Finally worked.Just in case someone wants only update project\'s snapshot dependencies and doesn\'t want to install artifact:Don\'t forget to reimport dependencies in your IDE. In IDEA you need to right click on pom file and choose Maven -> ReimportI\'ve got the error in an other context.\nSo my solution might be useful to others who stumple upon the question:The problem:\nI\'ve copied the local repository to another computer, which has no connection to a special repository.\nSo maven tried to check the artifacts against the invalid repository.My solution:\nRemove the _maven.repositories files.This is one of the most annoying things about Maven. For me the following happens: If I add a dependency requesting more dependencies and more and more but have a slow connection, it seams to stop while downloading and timing out. While timing out all dependencies not yet fetched are marked with place holders in the .m2 cache and Maven will not (never) pick it up unless I remove the place holder entry from the cache (as other stated) by removing it.So as far as I see it, Maven or more precise the Eclipse Maven plugin has a bug regarding this. Someone should report this.Please check your settings.xml file under /conf directory.I\'ve got the same error with android-maps-utils dependency. Using aar type package in dependency section solve my problem. \nBy default type is jar so It might be checked what type of dependency in repository is downloaded. For fixing this issue from Eclipse:1) Add below dependency in Maven pom.xml and save the pom.xml file.2) Go to project >> Maven >> Update Projectselect the project and click OK.3) Optional step, if it\'s not resolved till step 2 then do below step after doing step-1Go to project >> Maven >> Update Project >> check in the checkbox \'Force Update of Snapshots/Releases\'select the project and click OK.It\'s important to add that the main difference of running mvn with -U and without -U is that -U will override your local SNAPSHOT jars with remote SNAPSHOT jars. Local SNAPSHOT jars created from local mvn install in cases where you have other modules of your proj that generate jars.I had this problem for a different reason.  I went to the maven repository https://mvnrepository.com looking for the latest version of spring core, which at the time was 5.0.0.M3/  The repository showed me this entry for my pom.xml:Naive fool that I am, I assumed that the comment was telling me that the jar is located in the default repository.  However, after a lot of head-banging, I saw a note just  below the xml saying "Note: this artifact it located at Alfresco Public repository (https://artifacts.alfresco.com/nexus/content/repositories/public/)"So the comment in the XML is completely misleading.  The jar is located in another archive, which was why Maven couldn\'t find it!I had the same error and running mvn install -U and then running mvn install worked for me.mvn clean install -U doesn\'t work. However mvn -U clean followed by mvn clean install does. We can force to get latest update of release and snapshot repository with below command :
