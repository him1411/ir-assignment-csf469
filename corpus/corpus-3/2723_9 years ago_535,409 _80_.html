Note: while the use-case described is about using submodules within a project, the same applies to a normal git clone of a repository over HTTP.I have a project under Git control.  I\'d like to add a submodule:But I getI have my HTTP_PROXY set up:I even have a global Git setting for the http proxy:Has anybody gotten HTTP fetches to consistently work through a proxy?  What\'s really strange is that a few project on GitHub work fine (awesome_nested_set for example), but others consistently fail (rails for example).You can also set the HTTP proxy that Git uses in global configuration property http.proxy:There\'s some great answers on this already. However, I thought I would chip in as some proxy servers require you to authenticate with a user Id and password. Sometimes this can be on a domain.So, for example if your proxy server configuration is as follows:Then, add to your .gitconfig file using the following command:Don\'t worry about https. As long as the specified proxy server supports http, and https, then one entry in the config file will suffice.You can then verify that the command added the entry to your .gitconfig file successfully by doing cat .gitconfig:At the end of the file you will see an entry as follows:That\'s it! What finally worked was setting the http_proxy environment variable.  I had set HTTP_PROXY correctly, but git apparently likes the lower-case version better.It looks like you\'re using a mingw compile of Git on windows (or possibly another one I haven\'t heard about).  There are ways to debug this: I believe all of the http proxy work for git is done by curl. Set this environment variable before running git:This should at least give you an idea of what is going on behind the scenes.When your network team does ssl-inspection by rewriting certificates, then using a http url instead of a https one, combined with setting this var worked for me.You could too edit .gitconfig file located in %userprofile% directory on Windows system (notepad %userprofile%.gitconfig) or in ~ directory on Linux system (vi ~/.gitconfig) and add a http section as below.Content of .gitconfig file :This is an old question but if you are on Windows, consider setting HTTPS_PROXY as well if you are retrieving via an https URL.  Worked for me!If you just want to use proxy on a specified repository, don\'t need on other repositories. The preferable way is the -c, --config <key=value> option when you git clone a repository. e.g.I find neither http.proxy nor GIT_PROXY_COMMAND work for my authenticated http proxy. The proxy is not triggered in either way. But I find a way to work around this. Create a authfile. The format for authfile is: user_name:password, and user_name, password is your username and password to access your proxy.   To create such a file, simply run command like this: echo "username:password" > ~/.ssh/authfile. Edit ~/.ssh/config, and make sure its permission is 644: chmod 644 ~/.ssh/configTake github.com as an example, add the following lines to ~/.ssh/config:Now whenever you do anything with git@github.com, it will use the proxy automatically. You can easily do the same thing to Bitbucket as well. This is not so elegant as other approaches, but it works like a charm.On Windows, if you don\'t want to put your password in .gitconfig in the plain text, you can useIt authenticates you against normal or even Windows NTLM proxy and starts localhost-proxy without authentication.In order to get it run:Point git to your new localhost proxy:For me what it worked was:Create a file inside your $BIN_PATH/gitproxy with:Dont forget to give it execution permissionsRun following commands to setup environment:Just to post this as it is the first result on Google, this blog post I found solves the problem for me by updated the curl certificates.http://www.simplicidade.org/notes/archives/2011/06/github_ssl_ca_errors.htmlFor me the git://  just doesn\'t work through the proxy although the https:// does.   This caused some bit of headache because I was running scripts that all used git:// so I couldn\'t just easily change them all.   However I found this GEMI had the same problem, with a slightly different fix: REBUILDING GIT WITH HTTP SUPPORTThe git: protocol did not work through my corporate firewall.For example, this timed out:curl github.com works just fine, though, so I know my http_proxy environment variable is correct. I tried using http, like below, but got an immediate error.I tried recompiling git like so: but still got the fatal error.Finally, after several frustrating hours, I read the configure file, \nand saw this: # Define CURLDIR=/foo/bar if your curl header and library files are in# /foo/bar/include and /foo/bar/lib directories.I remembered then, that I had not complied curl from source, and so went\nlooking for the header files.  Sure enough, they were not installed.   That was the problem.  Make did not complain about the missing header files.  So \nI did not realize that the --with-curl option did nothing (it is, in fact the default in my version of git).   I did the following to fix it:Added the headers needed for make:Removed git from /usr/local (as I want the new install to live there).I simply removed git* from /usr/local/share and /usr/local/libexec Searched for the include dirs containing the curl and expat header files, and then (because I had read through configure) added these to the environment like so:Ran configure with the following options, which, again, were described in the configure file itself, and were also the defaults but what the heck:And now http works with git through my corporate firewall:This worked to me.This isn\'t a problem with your proxy.  It\'s a problem with github (or git).  It fails for me on git-1.6.0.1 on linux as well.  Bug is already reported (by you no less).Make sure to delete your pasties, they\'re already on google.   Edit: Must\'ve been dreaming, i guess you can\'t delete them.  Use Gist instead?$http_proxy is for http://github.com.... \n$https_proxy is for https://github.com...For WindowsGoto --> C:/Users/user_name/gitconfigUpdate gitconfig file with below details[http][https][http]How to check your proxy and port number?Internet Explorer -> Settings -> Internet Options -> Connections -> LAN Settingsyou can use:Use proxychainsupdate: proxychains is discontinued, use proxychains-ng instead.I got around the proxy using https... some proxies don\'t even check https.The above answers worked for me when my proxy doesn\'t need authentication. If you are using proxy which requires you to authenticate then you may try CCProxy. I have small tutorial on how to set it up here,http://blog.praveenkumar.co.in/2012/09/proxy-free-windows-xp78-and-mobiles.htmlI was able to push, pull, create new repos. Everything worked just fine. Make sure you do a clean uninstall and reinstall of new version if you are facing issues with Git like I did.As this was answered by many but This is just for Winodws USER who is behind proxy with auth.Re-Installing(first failed, Don\'t remove).if you have any special char in user/pass use url_encodeas @user2188765 has already pointed out, try replacing the git:// protocol of the repository with http[s]://.
