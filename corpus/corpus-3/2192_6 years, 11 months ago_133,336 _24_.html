I forked someone\'s repository on GitHub and would like to update my version with commits and updates made in the original repository. These were made after I forked my copy.How can I pull in the changes that were made in the origin and incorporate them into my repository?You have to add the original repository (the one you forked) as a remote.From the GitHub fork man page:Once the clone is complete your repo will have a remote named \xe2\x80\x9corigin\xe2\x80\x9d that points to your fork on GitHub.\n  Don\xe2\x80\x99t let the name confuse you, this does not point to the original repo you forked from. To help you keep track of that repo we will add another remote named \xe2\x80\x9cupstream\xe2\x80\x9d:You have also a ruby gem which can facilitate those GitHub operations.See also "Git fork is git clone?".In addition to VonC\'s answer, you could tweak it to your liking even further.After fetching from the remote branch, you would still have to merge the commits. I would replacewith    since git pull is essentially git fetch + git merge.This video shows how to update a fork directly from GitHub Steps: Use:This will set your upstream to the repository you forked from.\nThen do this:This will fetch all the branches including master from the original repository. Merge this data in your local master branch:Push the changes to your forked repository i.e. to origin:Voila! You are done with the syncing the original repository.If you\'re using GitHub desktop app, there is a sync button on the top right corner. Click on it then Update from <original repo> near top left.If there are no changes to be synced, this will be inactive.Here are some screenshots to make this easy
