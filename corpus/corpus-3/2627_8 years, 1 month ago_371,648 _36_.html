How do I get the current username in .NET using C#?If you are in a network of users, then the username will be different:rather thanChoose the format you want.Try the property: Environment.UserName.Use:That will be the logon name.I totally second the other answers, but I would like to highlight one more method which saysThe above method returned me the username in the format: DomainName\\UserName.
