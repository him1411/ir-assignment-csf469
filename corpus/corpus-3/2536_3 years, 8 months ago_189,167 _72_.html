NodeJS interpreter name(node) on Ubuntu has been renamed to nodejs because of name conflict with another package. Here\'s what the readme.debian says:The upstream name for the Node.js interpreter command is "node".\n    In Debian the interpreter command has been changed to "nodejs".This was done to prevent a namespace collision: other commands use\n    the same name in their upstreams, such as ax25-node from the "node"\n    package.Scripts calling Node.js as a shell command must be changed to instead\n    use the "nodejs" command.However, using nodejs mucks up installing packages using npm. Package installation fails with the following error:How do I make npm understand that nodejs is already installed on the system but the interpreter name is different?TL;DR:First of all let me clarify the situation a bit. In summer 2012 Debian maintainers decided to rename Node.js executable to prevent some kind of namespace collision with another package. It was very hard decision for Debian Technical Committee, because it breaks backward compatibility.The following is a quote from Committee resolution draft, published in Debian mailing list:The nodejs package shall be changed to provide /usr/bin/nodejs, not    /usr/bin/node.  The package should declare a Breaks: relationship with\n  any packages in Debian that reference /usr/bin/node.The nodejs source package shall also provide a nodejs-legacy binary    package at Priority: extra that contains /usr/bin/node as a symlink to\n  /usr/bin/nodejs.  No package in the archive may depend on or recommend\n  the nodejs-legacy package, which is provided solely for upstream\n  compatibility.  This package declares shall also declare a Conflicts: \n  relationship with the node package.<...>Paragraph 2 is the actual solution for OP\'s issue. OP should try to install this package instead of doing symlink by hand. Here is a link to this package in Debian package index website.It can be installed using sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy.I have not found any information about adopting the whole thing by NPM developers, but I think npm package will be fixed on some point and nodejs-legacy become really legacy.Try linking node to nodejs. First find out where nodejs isThen soft link node to nodejsI am assuming /usr/bin is in your execution path. Then you can test by typing node or npm into your command line, and everything should work now.You can also install Nodejs using NVM or Nodejs Version Manager There are a lot of benefits to using a version manager. One of them being you don\'t have to worry about this issue. Once the prerequisite packages are installed, you can pull down the nvm installation script from the project\'s GitHub page. The version number may be different, but in general, you can download and install it with the following syntax:This will download the script and run it. It will install the software into a subdirectory of your home directory at ~/.nvm. It will also add the necessary lines to your ~/.profile file to use the file.To gain access to the nvm functionality, you\'ll need to log out and log back in again, or you can source the ~/.profile file so that your current session knows about the changes:Now that you have nvm installed, you can install isolated Node.js versions.To find out the versions of Node.js that are available for installation, you can type:As you can see, the newest version at the time of this writing is v0.11.14. You can install that by typing:Usually, nvm will switch to use the most recently installed version. You can explicitly tell nvm to use the version we just downloaded by typing:When you install Node.js using nvm, the executable is called node. You can see the version currently being used by the shell by typing:The comeplete tutorial can be found hereInstall nvm first using:Run command Now run this and this will show will all installed or other versions of packages:Installed packages will be in green. Install whatever version you want:Check where is not installed:Check current version:Combined the accepted answer with source ~/.profile from the comment that has been folded and some clean up commands before. Most likely you will also need to sudo apt-get install npm after.Here\'s another approach I use since I like n for easy switching between node versions.On a new Ubuntu system, first install the \'system\' node:Then install n module globally:Since the system node was installed first (above), the alternatives system can be used to cleanly point to the node provided by n. First make sure the alternatives system has nothing for node:Then add the node provided by n:Next add node provided by the system (the one that was installed with curl):Now select the node provided by n using the interactive menu (select /usr/local/bin/node from the menu presented by the following command):Finally, since /usr/local/bin usually has a higher precedence in PATH than /usr/bin, the following alias must be created (enter in your .bashrc or .zshrc) if the alternatives system node is to be effective; otherwise the node installed with n in /usr/local/bin takes always precedence:Now you can easily switch between node versions with n <desired node version number>.On Linux Mint 17, I tried both solutions (creating a symlink or using the nodejs-legacy package) without success. The only thing  that finally worked for me was using the ppa from Chris Lea: This installed node version 10.37 and npm 1.4.28. After that, I could install packages globally. As other folks already mention, I will suggest not to use "sudo apt-get" to install node or any development library. You can download required version from https://nodejs.org/dist/v6.9.2/ and setup you own environment.I will recommend tools like nvm and n, to manage you node version. It is very convenient to switch and work with these modules. \nhttps://github.com/creationix/nvm\nhttps://github.com/tj/nOr write basic bash to download zip/tar, extract move folder and create a soft link. Whenever you need to update, just point the old soft link to new downloaded version.\nLike I have created for my own, you can refer:\nhttps://github.com/deepakshrma/NodeJs-4.0-Reference-Guide/blob/master/nodejs-installer.shSimple solution from hereYou can specify version by changing setup_x.x value, for example to setup_5.xfor me problem was solved by,For me the fix was removing the node* packages and also the npm packages.Then a fresh install as:I fixed it unlinking /usr/sbin/node (which is linked to ax25-node package), then I have create a link to nodejs using this on command lineBecause package such as karma doesn\'t work with nodejs name, however changing the first line of karma script from node to nodejs, but I prefer resolve this issue once and for allUninstall whatever node version you haveinstall nvm (Node Version Manager) https://github.com/creationix/nvmNow you can install whatever version of node you want and switch between the versions.Your System is not ablre to detect the path node js binary.1.which node2.Then soft link node to nodejsI am assuming /usr/bin is in your execution path. Then you can test by typing node or npm into your command line, and everything should work now.you can create a link ln -s nodejs node in /usr/bin\nhope this solves your problem.Problem is not in installer\nreplace nodejs with node or change the path from /usr/bin/nodejs to /usr/bin/nodeYou can install nodejs in your Ubuntu Os by Following thisThis is the your node is not properly install, first you need to uninstall the node then install again.\nTo install the node this may help you \nhttp://array151.com/blog/nodejs-tutorial-and-set-up/after that you can  install the packages easily.
