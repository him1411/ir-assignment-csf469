According to http://simon.html5.org/html-elements, the "number" input type\'s "value attribute, if specified and not empty, must have a value that is a valid floating point number."Yet it is simply (in Chrome.latest, anyway), an "updown" control with integers, not floats:Is there   a floating point input element native to HTML5, or a way to make the number input type work with floats, not ints? Or must I resort to a jQuery UI plugin?The number type has a step value controlling which numbers are valid (along with max and min), which defaults to 1. This value is also used by implementations for the stepper buttons (i.e. pressing up increases by step).Simply change this value to whatever is appropriate. For money, two decimal places are probably expected:(I\'d also set min=0 if it can only be positive)If you\'d prefer to allow any number of decimal places, you can use step="any" (though for currencies, I\'d recommend sticking to 0.01). In Chrome & Firefox, the stepper buttons will increment / decrement by 1 when using any. (thanks to Michal Stefanow\'s answer for pointing out any, and see the relevant spec here)Here\'s a playground showing how various steps affect various input types: As usual, I\'ll add a quick note: remember that client-side validation is just a convenience to the user. You must also validate on the server-side!Via: http://blog.isotoma.com/2012/03/html5-input-typenumber-and-decimalsfloats-in-chrome/But what if you want all the numbers to be valid, integers and decimals alike? In this case, set step to \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9dWorks for me in Chrome, not tested in other browsers.you can use:hope to help, regardsBased on this answerMeaning :Char code :&& is AND , || is OR operator.if you try float with comma :Supported Chromium and Firefox (Linux X64)(other browsers I does not exist.)I do so then, I define min in 0.4 and max in 0.7 with step 0.01: 0.4, 0.41, 0,42 ... 0.7 I just had the same problem, and I could fix it by just putting a comma and not a period/full stop in the number because of French localization.So it works with:2 is OK2,5 is OK2.5 is KO (The number is considered "illegal" and you receive empty value).
