I have Using JavaScript, how might I get the last five characters or last character?You\'ll want to use the Javascript string method .substr() combined with the .length property.This gets the characters starting at id.length - 5 and, since the second argument for .substr() is omitted, continues to the end of the string.You can also use the .slice() method as others have pointed out below.If you\'re simply looking to find the characters after the underscore, you could use this:This splits the string into an array on the underscore and then "pops" the last element off the array (which is the string you want).Dont use .substr(). Use the .slice() method instead, its cross browser compatible (see IE).substr() with negative value not working in IEGetting the last character is easy, as you can treat strings as an array:To get a section of a string, you can use the substr function or the substring function:The difference between substr and substring is how the second (optional) parameter is treated. In substr, it\'s the amount of characters from the index (the first parameter). In substring, it\'s the index of where the character slicing should end.You can use the substr() method with a negative starting position to retrieve the last n characters. For example, this gets the last 5:Following script shows the result for get last 5 characters and last 1 character in a string  using JavaScript:Output :Tabs1 // Got 5 characters1 // Got 1 characterThere is no need to use substr method to get a single char of a string!taking the example of Jamon Holmgren we can change substr method and simply specify the array position:Check out the substring function.To get the last character:Assuming you will compare the substring against the end of another string and use the result as a boolean you may extend the String class to accomplish this:Allowing you to do the following:This one will remove the comma if it is the last character in the string..I actually have the following problem and this how i solved it by the help of above answer but different approach in extracting id form a an input element.I have attached input filed with an And , when that button clicked i want to extract the id(which is the number) or the php ID ($id) only.So here what i do .
