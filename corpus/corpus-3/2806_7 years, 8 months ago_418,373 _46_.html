I need to create a Set with initial values.Is there a way to do this in one command?There is a shorthand that I use that is not very time efficient, but fits on a single line:Again, this is not time efficient since you are constructing an array, converting to a list and using that list to create a set.When initializing static final sets I usually write it like this:Slightly less ugly and efficiency does not matter for the static initialization.Collection literals were scheduled for Java 7, but didn\'t make it in. So nothing automatic yet. You can use guava\'s Sets:Or you can use the following syntax, which will create an anonymous class, but it\'s hacky:In Java 8 I would use:This gives you a mutable Set pre-initialized with "a" and "b". Note that while in JDK 8 this does return a HashSet, the specification doesn\'t guarantee it, and this might change in the future. If you specifically want a HashSet, do this instead:There are a few ways:Double brace initializationThis is a technique which creates an anonymous inner class which has an instance initializer which adds Strings to itself when an instance is created:Keep in mind that this will actually create an new subclass of HashSet each time it is used, even though one does not have to explicitly write a new subclass.A utility methodWriting a method that returns a Set which is initialized with the desired elements isn\'t too hard to write:The above code only allows for a use of a String, but it shouldn\'t be too difficult to allow the use of any type using generics.Use a libraryMany libraries have a convenience method to initialize collections objects.For example, Google Collections has a Sets.newHashSet(T...) method which will populate a HashSet with elements of a specific type.You can do it in Java 6:But why?  I don\'t find it to be more readable than explicitly adding elements.If you have only one initial value in set this would be enough:We can make use of Stream in Java 8.In case values are stored in an array then:In case values are stored in a list (say List<String> stringList) thenI feel the most readable is to simply use google Guava: A generalization of coobird\'s answer\'s utility function for creating new HashSets:One of the most convenient ways is usage of generic Collections.addAll() method, which takes a collection and varargs:If the contained type of the Set is an enumeration then there is java built factory method (since 1.5):With Eclipse Collections there are a few different ways to initialize a Set containing the characters \'a\' and \'b\' in one statement.  Eclipse Collections has containers for both object and primitive types, so I illustrated how you could use a Set<String> or CharSet in addition to mutable, immutable, synchronized and unmodifiable versions of both.Eclipse Collections is compatible with Java 5 - 8.Note: I am a committer for Eclipse Collections.With Java 9 you can do the following:and you\'ll get an immutable Set containing the elements. For details see this link.A bit convoluted but works from Java 5:Use a helper method to make it readable:Just a small note, regardless of which of the fine approaches mentioned here you end up with, if this is a default that usually goes unmodified (like a default setting in a library you are creating), it is a good idea to follow this pattern:The benefit depends on the number of instances you create of that class and how likely it\'s that defaults will be changed.If you decide to follow this pattern, then you also get to pick the method of set initialization that\'s most readable. As the micro differences in efficiency between the different methods will probably not matter much as you will be initializing the set only once.or(ugly) Double Brace Initialization without side effects:But in some cases, if we mentioned that is a good smell to make final collections unmutable, it could be really useful:This is an elegant solution:Can use static block for initialization:
