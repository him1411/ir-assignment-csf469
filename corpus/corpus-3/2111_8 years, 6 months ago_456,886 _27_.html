I want to redirect both stdout and stderr of a process to a single file. How do I do that in Bash?Take a look here. Should be:(redirects both stdout and stderr to filename).This is going to redirect stderr to stdout and stdout to some_file and print it to stdout.You can redirect stderr to stdout and the stdout into a file:See http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/io-redirection.htmlEDIT: changed the order as pointed out in the commentsNow, simple echo will write to $LOG_FILE. Useful for daemonizing.To the author of the original post,It depends what you need to achieve. If you just need to redirect in/out of a command you call from your script, the answers are already given. Mine is about redirecting within current script which affects all commands/built-ins(includes forks) after the mentioned code snippet.Another cool solution is about redirecting to both std-err/out AND to logger or log file at once which involves splitting "a stream" into two. This functionality is provided by \'tee\' command which can write/append to several file descriptors(files, sockets, pipes, etc) at once: tee FILE1 FILE2 ... >(cmd1) >(cmd2) ...So, from the beginning. Let\'s assume we have terminal connected to /dev/stdout(FD #1) and /dev/stderr(FD #2). In practice, it could be a pipe, socket or whatever.The result of running a script having the above line and additionally this one:...is as follows:If you want to see clearer picture, add these 2 lines to the script:1>file.log instructs the shell to send STDOUT to the file file.log, and 2>&1 tells it to redirect STDERR (file descriptor 2) to STDOUT (file descriptor 1).Note: The order matters as liw.fi pointed out, 2>&1 1>file.log doesn\'t work.Curiously, this works:But this gives a syntax error:You have to use:It is related: Writing stdOut & stderr to syslog.It almost work, but not from xinted ;(  I wanted a solution to have the output from stdout plus stderr written into a log file and stderr still on console. So I needed to duplicate the stderr output via tee.This is the solution I found:For tcsh, I have to use the following command :If use command &> file , it will give "Invalid null command" error."Easiest" way (bash4 only): ls * 2>&- 1>&-.
