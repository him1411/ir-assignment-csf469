I am working on an iGoogle-like application. Content from other applications (on other domains) is shown using iframes. How do I resize the iframes to fit the height of the iframes\' content?I\'ve tried to decipher the javascript Google uses but it\'s obfuscated, and searching the web has been fruitless so far.Update: Please note that content is loaded from other domains, so the same-origin policy applies.We had this type of problem, but slightly in reverse to your situation - we were providing the iframed content to sites on other domains, so the same origin policy was also an issue. After many hours spent trawling google, we eventually found a (somewhat..) workable solution, which you may be able to adapt to your needs.There is a way around the same origin policy, but it requires changes on both the iframed content and the framing page, so if you haven\'t the ability to request changes on both sides, this method won\'t be very useful to you, i\'m afraid.There\'s a browser quirk which allows us to skirt the same origin policy - javascript can communicate either with pages on its own domain, or with pages it has iframed, but never pages in which it is framed, e.g. if you have:then home.html can communicate with framed.html (iframed) and helper.html (same domain). framed.html can send messages to helper.html (iframed) but not home.html (child can\'t communicate cross-domain with parent).The key here is that helper.html can receive messages from framed.html, and can also communicate with home.html. So essentially, when framed.html loads, it works out its own height, tells helper.html, which passes the message on to home.html, which can then resize the iframe in which framed.html sits. The simplest way we found to pass messages from framed.html to helper.html was through a URL argument. To do this, framed.html has an iframe with src=\'\' specified. When its onload fires, it evaluates its own height, and sets the src of the iframe at this point to helper.html?height=NThere\'s an explanation here of how facebook handle it, which may be slightly clearer than mine above!In www.foo.com/home.html, the following javascript code is required (this can be loaded from a .js file on any domain, incidentally..):In www.bar.net/framed.html:Contents of www.foo.com/helper.html:If you do not need to handle iframe content from a different domain, try this code, it will solve the problem completely and it\'s simple:https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.postMessagewindow.postMessage()window.postMessage is a method for safely enabling cross-origin communication. Normally, scripts on different pages are only allowed to access each other if and only if the pages which executed them are at locations with the same protocol (usually both http), port number (80 being the default for http), and host (modulo document.domain being set by both pages to the same value). window.postMessage provides a controlled mechanism to circumvent this restriction in a way which is secure when properly used.Summarywindow.postMessage, when called, causes a MessageEvent to be dispatched at the target window when any pending script that must be executed completes (e.g. remaining event handlers if window.postMessage is called from an event handler, previously-set pending timeouts, etc.). The MessageEvent has the type message, a data property which is set to the string value of the first argument provided to window.postMessage, an origin property corresponding to the origin of the main document in the window calling window.postMessage at the time window.postMessage was called, and a source property which is the window from which window.postMessage is called. (Other standard properties of events are present with their expected values.)The iFrame-Resizer library uses postMessage to keep an iFrame sized to it\'s content, along with MutationObserver to detect changes to the content and doesn\'t depend on jQuery.https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizerjQuery: Cross-domain scripting goodnesshttp://benalman.com/projects/jquery-postmessage-plugin/Has demo of resizing iframe window...http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-postmessage/examples/iframe/This article shows how to remove the dependency on jQuery...

This might not be what you want.may be a bit late, as all the other answers are older :-) but... here\xc2\xb4s my solution. Tested in actual FF, Chrome and Safari 5.0.css:javascript:Hope this will help anybody.Here is a simple solution using a dynamically generated style sheet served up by the same server as the iframe content.  Quite simply the style sheet "knows" what is in the iframe, and knows the dimensions to use to style the iframe.  This gets around the same origin policy restrictions.  http://www.8degrees.co.nz/2010/06/09/dynamically-resize-an-iframe-depending-on-its-content/So the supplied iframe code would have an accompanying style sheet like so...<link href="http://your.site/path/to/css?contents_id=1234&dom_id=iframe_widget" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />\xe2\x80\xa8\n<iframe id="iframe_widget" src="http://your.site/path/to/content?content_id=1234" frameborder="0" width="100%" scrolling="no"></iframe>This does require the server side logic being able to calculate the dimensions of the rendered content of the iframe.Finally I found some other solution for sending data to parent website from iframe using window.postMessage(message, targetOrigin);. Here I explain How I did.Site A = http://foo.com \nSite B = http://bar.comSiteB is loading inside the siteA websiteSiteB website have this lineorThen siteA have this following codeIf you want to add security connection you can use this if condition in eventer(messageEvent, function (e) {})For IEInside IFrame:Outside:This answer is only applicable for websites which uses Bootstrap. The responsive embed feature of the Bootstrap does the job. It is based on the width (not height) of the content.jsfiddle:  http://jsfiddle.net/00qggsjj/2/http://getbootstrap.com/components/#responsive-embedI\'m implementing ConroyP\'s frame-in-frame solution to replace a solution based on setting document.domain, but found it to be quite hard determining the height of the iframe\'s content correctly in different browsers (testing with FF11, Ch17 and IE9 right now).ConroyP uses:But that only works on the initial page load. My iframe has dynamic content and I need to resize the iframe on certain events.What I ended up doing was using different JS properties for the different browsers.getBrowserData() is browser detect function "inspired" by Ext Core\'s http://docs.sencha.com/core/source/Ext.html#method-Ext-applyThat worked well for FF and IE but then there were issues with Chrome. One of the was a timing issue, apparently it takes Chrome a while to set/detect the hight of the iframe. And then Chrome also never returned the height of the content in the iframe correctly if the iframe was higher than the content. This wouldn\'t work with dynamic content when the height is reduced.To solve this I always set the iframe to a low height before detecting the content\'s height and then setting the iframe height to it\'s correct value.The code is not optimized, it\'s from my devel testing :)Hope someone finds this helpful!TinyMCE does this and it is not obfuscated.iGoogle gadgets have to actively implement resizing, so my guess is in a cross-domain model you can\'t do this without the remote content taking part in some way. If your content can send a message with the new size to the container page using typical cross-domain communication techniques, then the rest is simple.When you want to zoom out a web page to fit it into the iframe size:Here is an example:Here\'s a jQuery approach that adds the info in json via the src attribute of the iframe.  Here\'s a demo, resize and scroll this window.. the resulting url with json looks like this... \nhttp://fiddle.jshell.net/zippyskippy/RJN3G/show/#{docHeight:5124,windowHeight:1019,scrollHeight:571}#Here\'s the source code fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/zippyskippy/RJN3G/Work with jquery on load (cross browser):on resize in responsive page:Using jQuery:parent.htmlchild.htmlThis is slightly tricky as you have to know when the iframe page has loaded, which is difficuly when you\'re not in control of its content. Its possible to add an onload handler to the iframe, but I\'ve tried this in the past and it has vastly different behaviour across browsers (not guess who\'s the most annoying...). You\'d probably have to add a function to the iframe page that performs the resize and inject some script into the content that either listens to load events or resize events, which then calls the previous function. I\'m thinking add a function to the page since you want to make sure its secure, but I have no idea how easy it will be to do.Something on the lines of this i belive should work.Load this with your body onload on the iframe content.I have an easy solution and requires you to determine the width and height in the link, please try (It works with most browsers):
