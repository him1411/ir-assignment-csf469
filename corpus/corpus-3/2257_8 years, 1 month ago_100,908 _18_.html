For some reason, when I initially did a pull from the repository for a git project of mine,\nI got a ton of files in my working copy that have no discernible changes made to them, but keep showing up in my unstaged changes area.  I\'m using Git Gui on Windows xp, and when I go to look at the file to see what has changed.\nAll I see is:Does anyone know what this means?  How can I get these files out of my list of unstaged changes? (Very annoying to have to go through 100\'s of files, just to pick out files I\'ve recently edited and want to commit).  That looks like unix file permissions modes to me (755=rwxr-xr-x, 644=rw-r--r--) - the old mode included the +x (executable) flag, the new mode doesn\'t.This msysgit issue\'s replies suggests setting core.filemode to false in order to get rid of the issue:Setting core.filemode to false does work. But you\'d make sure the settings in ~/.gitconfig aren\'t be overridden by those in .git/config.You could try\ngit reset --hard HEAD\nto reset the repo to the expected default state.It seems you have changed some permissions of the directory. I did the following steps to restore it.I had just the one troublesome file with the changed permissions.\nTo roll it back individually, I just deleted it manually with rm <file> and then did a checkout to pull a fresh copy. Luckily I had not staged it yet. If I had I could have run git reset -- <file> before running git checkout -- <file>This happens when you pull and all files were executable in the remote repository. Making them executable again will set everything back to normal again.You might need to do:instead, for files that was not set as executable and that was changed because of the above operation. There is a better way to do this but this is just a very quick and dirty fix.I\'ve encountered this problem when copying a git repo with working files from an old hard drive a couple times. The problem stems from the fact that the owner and permissions changed from the old drive/machine to the new one. The long and short of it is, run the following commands to straighten things out (thanks to this superuser answer):The former command will actually resolve the differences that git diff reported, but will revoke your ability to list the directories, so ls ./ fails with ls: .: Permission denied. To fix that:The bad news is that if you do have any files you want to keep executable, such as .sh scripts, you\'ll need to revert those. You can do that with the following command for each file:
