Using conditional comments it is easy to target Internet Explorer with browser-specific CSS rules:Sometimes it is the Gecko engine (Firefox) that misbehaves. What would be best way to target only Firefox with your CSS rules and not a single other browser? That is, not only should Internet Explorer ignore the Firefox-only rules, but also WebKit and Opera should.Note: I\'m looking for a \'clean\' solution. Using a JavaScript browser sniffer to add a \'firefox\' class to my HTML does not qualify as clean in my opinion. I would rather like to see something that depends on browser capabilities, much like conditional comments are only \'special\' to IE\xe2\x80\xa6OK, I\'ve found it. This is probably the most clean and easy solution out there and does not rely on JavaScript being turned on.It\'s based on yet another Mozilla specific CSS extension. There\'s a whole list for these CSS extensions right here: Mozilla CSS Extensions.Here is how to tackle three different browsers: IE, FF and ChromeFirst of all, a disclaimer. I don\'t really advocate for the solution I present below. The only browser specific CSS I write is for IE (especially IE6), although I wish it wasn\'t the case.Now, the solution. You asked it to be elegant so I don\'t know how elegant is it but it\'s sure going to target Gecko platforms only.The trick is only working when JavaScript is enabled and makes use of Mozilla bindings (XBL), which are heavily used internally in Firefox and all other Gecko-based products. For a comparison, this is like the behavior CSS property in IE, but much more powerful.Three files are involved in my solution:ff.htmlff.xmlff.cssUpdate:\nThe above solution is not that good. It would be better if instead of appending a new LINK element it will add that "firefox" class on the BODY element. And it\'s possible, just by replacing the above JS with the following:The solution is inspired by Dean Edwards\' moz-behaviors.Here is some browser hacks for targeting only the Firefox browser,This is gonna work on, Firefox 3.6 and LaterIf you need more information,Please visit browserhacksAnother solution you can use is:Using -engine specific rules ensures effective browser targeting.A variation on your idea is to have a server-side USER-AGENT detector that will figure out what style sheet to attach to the page.  This way you can have a firefox.css, ie.css, opera.css, etc.You can accomplish a similar thing in Javascript itself, although you may not regard it as clean.I have done a similar thing by having a default.css which includes all common styles and then specific style sheets are added to override, or enhance the defaults.The only way to do this is via various CSS hacks, which will make your page much more likely to fail on the next browser updates. If anything, it will be LESS safe than using a js-browser sniffer.
