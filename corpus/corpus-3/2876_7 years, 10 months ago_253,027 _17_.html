How do I break out of a jQuery each loop?I have tried: In the loop but this did not work. Any ideas?To break a $.each loop, you have to return false in the loop callback.Returning true skips to the next  iteration, equivalent to a continue in a normal loop.According to the documentation return false; should do the job. We can break the $.each() loop [..] by making the callback function\n  return false.Return false in the callback:BTW, continue works like this:Returning non-false is the same as a continue statement in a for loop; it will skip immediately to the next iteration.I created a Fiddle for the answer to this question because the accepted answer is incorrect plus this is the first StackOverflow thread returned from Google regarding this question.To break out of a $.each you must use return false;Here is a Fiddle proving it:http://jsfiddle.net/9XqRy/I came across the situation where I met a condition that broke the loop, however the code after the .each() function still executed. I then set a flag to "true" with an immediate check for the flag after the .each() function to ensure the code that followed was not executed. "each" uses callback function.\nCallback function execute irrespective of the calling function,so it is not possible to return to calling function from callback function.use for loop if you have to stop the loop execution based on some condition and remain in to the same function.
