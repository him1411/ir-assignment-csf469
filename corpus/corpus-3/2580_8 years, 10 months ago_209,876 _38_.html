I am writing an iframe based facebook app. Now I want to use the same html page to render the normal website as well as the canvas page within facebook. I want to know if I can determine whether the page has been loaded inside the iframe or directly in the browser?Browsers can block access to window.top due to same origin policy. IE bugs also take place. Here\'s the working code:top and self are both window objects (along with parent), so you\'re seeing if your window is the top window.window.frameElement Returns the element (such as <iframe> or <object>) in which the window is embedded, or null if the window is top-level. So identifying code looks likeThis is standard and rather new method. It exactly works in Chrome and Firefox. I can\'t recommend it as universal solution but it should be mentioned here I think.RoBorg is correct, but I wanted to add a side note.In IE7/IE8 when Microsoft added Tabs to their browser they broke one thing that will cause havoc with your JS if you are not careful.Imagine this page layout:Now in frame "baz" you click a link (no target, loads in the "baz" frame) it works fine.If the page that gets loaded, lets call it special.html, uses JS to check if "it" has a parent frame named "bar" it will return true (expected).Now lets say that the special.html page when it loads, checks the parent frame (for existence and its name, and if it is "bar" it reloads itself in the bar frame. e.g.So far so good. Now comes the bug.Lets say instead of clicking on the original link like normal, and loading the special.html page in the "baz" frame, you middle-clicked it or chose to open it in a new Tab.When that new tab loads (with no parent frames at all!) IE will enter an endless loop of page loading! because IE "copies over" the frame structure in JavaScript such that the new tab DOES have a parent, and that parent HAS the name "bar".The good news, is that checking:in that new tab does return true, and thus you can test for this odd condition.The accepted answer didn\'t work for me inside the content script of a Firefox 6.0 Extension (Addon-SDK 1.0): Firefox executes the content script in each: the top-level window and in all iframes. Inside the content script I get the following results: The strange thing about this output is that it\'s always the same regardless whether the code is run inside an iframe or the top-level window.On the other hand Google Chrome seems to execute my content script only once within the top-level window, so the above wouldn\'t work at all.What finally worked for me in a content script in both browsers is this:Without iframes this prints 0:0, in a top-level window containing one frame it prints 1:1, and in the only iframe of a document it prints 0:1.This allows my extension to determine in both browsers if there are any iframes present, and additionally in Firefox if it is run inside one of the iframes.I\'m using this:Since you are asking in the context of a facebook app, you might want to consider detecting this at the server when the initial request is made. Facebook will pass along a bunch of querystring data including the fb_sig_user key if it is called from an iframe.Since you probably need to check and use this data anyway in your app, use it to determine the the appropriate context to render.Use this javascript function as an example on how to accomplish this.I\'m not sure how this example works for older Web browsers but I use this for IE, Firefox and Chrome without and issue:If you want to know if the user is accessing your app from facebook page tab or canvas check for the Signed Request. If you don\'t get it, probably the user is not accessing from facebook.\nTo make sure confirm the signed_request fields structure and fields content.With the php-sdk you can get the Signed Request like this:You can read more about Signed Request here:https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/php/facebook-getSignedRequest/and here:https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/login/signed-request/It\'s an ancient piece of code that I\'ve used a few times:But only if number of iframes differs in your page and page who are loading you in iframe. Make no iframe in your page to have 100% guarantee of result of this codeWrite this javascript in each pageThen it will automatically redirects to home page.
