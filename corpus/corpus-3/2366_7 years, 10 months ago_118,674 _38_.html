I\'m just going over some Scala tutorials on the Internet and have noticed in some examples an object is declared at the start of the example.What is the difference between class and object in Scala?You can think of the object keyword as creating a singleton object of a class that is defined implicitly.Consider the exampleFrom the Scala view, this declaration This means A can be passed to functions expecting objects of type B or C, and method f can be called using A.f(...).There exist some special methods that can be defined for objects:A class is a definition, a description. It defines a type in terms of methods and composition of other types.An object is a singleton -- an instance of a class which is guaranteed to be unique. For every object in the code, an anonymous class is created, which inherits from whatever classes you declared object to implement. This class cannot be seen from Scala source code -- though you can get at it through reflection.There is a relationship between object and class. An object is said to be the companion-object of a class if they share the same name. When this happens, each has access to methods of private visibility in the other. These methods are not automatically imported, though. You either have to import them explicitly, or prefix them with the class/object name.For example:An object has exactly one instance (you can not call new MyObject). You can have multiple instances of a class.Object serves the same (and some additional) purposes as the static methods and fields in Java. As has been explained by many, object defines a singleton instance. The one thing in the answers here that I believe is left out is that object serves several purposes.It can be the companion object to a class/trait, containing what might be considered static methods or convenience methods.It can act much like a module, containing related/subsidiary types and definitions, etc.It can implement an interface by extending a class or one or more traits.It can represent a case of a sealed trait that contains no data. In this respect, it\'s often considered more correct than a case class with no parameters. The special case of a sealed trait with only case object implementors is more or less the Scala version of an enum.It can act as evidence for implicit-driven logic.It introduces a singleton type.It\'s a very powerful and general construct. What can be very confusing to Scala beginners is that the same construct can have vastly different uses. And an object can serve many of these different uses all at once, which can be even more confusing.The formal difference - 1) you can not provide constructor parameters and 2) it\'s not a type - you may not create an instance with new operator. But it can have fields, methods, extend a superclass and mix in traits. The difference in usage:To create a program you should use main method in object, not class.You also may use it as you use singleton object in java.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0     Defining an object in Scala is like defining a class in Java that has only static methods. However, in Scala an object can extend another superclass, implement interfaces, and be passed around as though it were an instance of a class. (So it\'s like the static methods on a class but better).The object keyword creates a new singleton type, which is like a class that only has a single named instance. If you\xe2\x80\x99re familiar with Java, declaring an object in Scala is a lot like creating a new instance of an anonymous class.Scala has no equivalent to Java\xe2\x80\x99s static keyword, and an object is often used in Scala where you might use a class with static members in Java.The object equals to the static class in Java to some extends, the static characteristics mean the static class need\'t to creat an object when putting to the JVM,it can be used by it\'s class name directlyObject is a class but it already has an instance, so you can not call new ObjectName. On the other hand, Class is just type and it can be an instance by calling new ClassName().Scala class same as Java Class but scala not gives you any entry method in class, like main method in java. The main method associated with object keyword. You can think of the object keyword as creating a singleton object of a class that is defined implicitly.more information check this article \nclass and object keyword in scala programmingA class is a blueprint for objects. Once you define a class, you can create objects from the class blueprint with the keyword new. Through the object, you can use all functionalities of the defined class.Diagram for better explanation:  SourceClass & object: a class is a definition which describes all attributes of entity or an object. And object is an instance of a class.
