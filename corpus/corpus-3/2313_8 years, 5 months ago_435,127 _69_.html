We all know that to select all columns from a table, we can useIs there a way to exclude column(s) from a table without specifying all the columns?The only way that I know is to manually specify all the columns and exclude the unwanted column. This is really time consuming so I\'m looking for ways to save time and effort on this, as well as future maintenance should the table has more/less columns.thanks!I agree with everyone... but if I was going to do something like this I might do it this way:No.Maintenance-light best practice is to specify only the required columns.At least 2 reasons:Edit (July 2011):If you drag from Object Explorer the Columns node for a table, it puts a CSV list of columns in the Query Window for you which achieves one of your goalsThe automated way to do this in SQL (SQL Server) is:You could create a view that has the columns you wish to select, then you can just select * from the view...If you don\'t want to write each column name manually you can use Script Table As by right clicking on table or view in SSMS like this:Then you will get whole select query in New Query Editor Window then remove unwanted column like this:DoneYes it\'s possible (but not recommended).Explanation of the code:Like the others have said there is no way to do this, but if you\'re using Sql Server a trick that I use is to change the output to comma separated, then do and cut the whole list of columns from the output window. Then you can choose which columns you want without having to type them all in.Basically, you cannot do what you would like - but you can get the right tools to help you out making things a bit easier.If you look at Red-Gate\'s SQL Prompt, you can type "SELECT * FROM MyTable", and then move the cursor back after the "*", and hit <TAB> to expand the list of fields, and remove those few fields you don\'t need.It\'s not a perfect solution - but a darn good one! :-) Too bad MS SQL Server Management Studio\'s Intellisense still isn\'t intelligent enough to offer this feature.......Marcno there is no way to do this. maybe you can create custom views if that\'s feasible in your situationEDIT May be if your DB supports execution of dynamic sql u could write an SP and pass the columns u don\'t want to see to it and let it create the query dynamically and return the result to you. I think this is doable in SQL Server atleastIn summary you cannot do it, but I disagree with all of the comment above, there "are" scenarios where you can legitimately use a * \nWhen you create a nested query in order to select a specific range out of a whole list (such as paging) why in the world would want to specify each column on the outer select statement when you have done it in the inner?In SQL Management Studio you can expand the columns in Object Explorer, then drag the Columns tree item into a query window to get a comma separated list of columns.If you are using SQL Server Management Studio then do as follows:Enjoy.Is there a way to exclude column(s) from a table without specifying\n  all the columns?Using declarative SQL in the usual way, no.I think your proposed syntax is worthy and good. In fact, the relational database language \'Tutorial D\' has a very similar syntax where the keywords ALL BUT are followed by a set of attributes (columns).However, SQL\'s SELECT * already gets a lot a flak (@Guffa\'s answer here is a typical objection), so I don\'t think SELECT ALL BUT will get into the SQL Standard anytime soon. I think the best \'work around\' is to create a VIEW with only the columns you desire then SELECT * FROM ThatView.If we are talking of Procedures, it works with this trick to generate a new query and EXECUTE IMMEDIATE it:I do not know of any database that supports this (SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL). It is definitely not part of the SQL standards so I think you have to specify only the columns you want.You could of course build your SQL statement dynamically and have the server execute it. But this opens up the possibility for SQL injection..Well, it is a common best practice to specify which columns you want, instead of just specifying *. So you should just state which fields you want your select to return.A colleage advised a good alternative:Done...This helped us a lot.I know this is a little old, but I had just run into the same issue and was looking for an answer. Then I had a senior developer show me a very simple trick.If you are using the management studio query editor, expand the database, then expand the table that you are selecting from so that you can see the columns folder.In your select statement, just highlight the referenced columns folder above and drag and drop it into the query window. It will paste all of the columns of the table, then just simply remove the identity column from the list of columns...Right click table in Object Explorer, Select top 1000 rowsIt\'ll list all columns and not *. Then remove the unwanted column(s). Should be much faster than typing it yourself.Then when you feel this is a bit too much work, get Red Gate\'s SQL Prompt, and type ssf from tbl, go to the * and click tab again.That what I use often for this case:@colnames looks like column1,column2,column5Sometimes the same program must handle different database stuctures. So I could not use a column list in the program to avoid errors in select statements.* gives me all the optional fields. I check if the fields exist in the data table before use. This is my reason for using * in select.This is how I handle excluded fields:The best way to solve this is using view you can create view with required  columns and retrieve data form itNo, there isn\'t any way to do that, and there is no good reason to do it.When selecting data you should never use *, you should always specify the fields that you want. The reason is that you want the query to work the same even if you later add another field to the table. Also you specify the order of the fields in the result so that rearranging fields in the table doesn\'t change the result.The same would of course apply to * except if it was possible to do.Depending on the size of your table, you can export it into Excel and transpose it to have a new table in which the columns of original table will be the rows in new table. Then take it back into your SQL database and select the rows according to the condition and insert them into another new table. Finally export this newer table to Excel and do another transpose to have your desired table and take it back to your SQL database.Not sure if tranpose can be done within SQL database, if yes then it will be even easier.JeffWouldn\'t it be simpler to do this:-Click on the \'Column_name\' column> Copy> Paste (creates a vertical list) into a New Query window and just type commas in front of each column value... comment out the columns you don\'t want... far less typing than any code offered here and still manageable.You can get SQL Complete from devart.com, which not just expands the * wildcard just like SQL Prompt from Red Gate does (as described  in cairnz\'s answer), but also provides a column picker drop down with checkboxes in which you can check all the columns that you want in the select list and they will be inserted automatically for you (and if you then uncheck a column it will be automatically removed from the select list).In SSMS there is an easier way with IntelliSense and Aliasing.  Try thisThis won\'t save time on loading from the database.  But, you could always unset the column you don\'t want in the array it\'s placed in.  I had several columns in a table but didn\'t want one particular. I was too lazy to write them all out in the SELECT statement.  I did it like this and it works just fine (version 5.5.41):I know this question is old, but I hope this can still be helpful.The answer is inspired by a discuss from SQL Server Forums1. You can make this a stored procedure. It can also be modified to add more than one except fields. The first column cannot be the exception though.After I posted above solution, I got a better idea:
