When is a space in a URL encoded to +, and when is it encoded to %20?From Wikipedia (emphasis and link added):When data that has been entered into HTML forms is submitted, the form field names and values are encoded and sent to the server in an HTTP request message using method GET or POST, or, historically, via email. The encoding used by default is based on a very early version of the general URI percent-encoding rules, with a number of modifications such as newline normalization and replacing spaces with "+" instead of "%20". The MIME type of data encoded this way is application/x-www-form-urlencoded, and it is currently defined (still in a very outdated manner) in the HTML and XForms specifications.So, the real percent encoding uses %20 while form data in URLs is in a modified form that uses +. So you\'re most likely to only see + in URLs in the query string after an ?.This confusion is because URL is still \'broken\' to this day.Take "http://www.google.com" for instance. This is a URL. A URL is a Uniform Resource Locator and is really a pointer to a web page (in most cases). URLs actually have a very well-defined structure since the first specification in 1994.We can extract detailed information about the "http://www.google.com" URL:If we look at a more complex URL such as:"https://bob:bobby@www.lunatech.com:8080/file;p=1?q=2#third"we can extract the following information:The reserved characters are different for each part.For HTTP URLs, a space in a path fragment part has to be encoded to "%20" (not, absolutely not "+"), while the "+" character in the path fragment part can be left unencoded.Now in the query part, spaces may be encoded to either "+" (for backwards compatibility: do not try to search for it in the URI standard) or "%20" while the "+" character (as a result of this ambiguity) has to be escaped to "%2B".This means that the "blue+light blue" string has to be encoded differently in the path and query parts:"http://example.com/blue+light%20blue?blue%2Blight+blue".From there you can deduce that encoding a fully constructed URL is impossible without a syntactical awareness of the URL structure.What this boils down to is:You should have %20 before the ? and + after.SourceI would recommend %20.Are you hard-coding them?This is not very consistent across languages, though.\nIf I\'m not mistaken, in PHP urlencode() treats spaces as + whereas Python\'s urlencode() treats them as %20.EDIT:It seems I\'m mistaken. Python\'s urlencode() (at least in 2.7.2) uses quote_plus() instead of quote() and thus encodes spaces as "+".\nIt seems also that the W3C recommendation is the "+" as per here: http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.1And in fact, you can follow this interesting debate on Python\'s own issue tracker about what to use to encode spaces: http://bugs.python.org/issue13866.EDIT #2:I understand that the most common way of encoding " " is as "+", but just a note, it may be just me, but I find this a bit confusing:A space may only be encoded to "+" in the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" content-type key-value pairs query part of an URL. This is a MAY, not a MUST. In the rest of URLs, it is encoded as %20.In my opinion, its better to always encode spaces as %20, not as "+", even in the query part of an URL, because it is the HTML specification (RFC-1866) that specified that space characters should be encoded as "+" in "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" content-type key-value pairs. (see paragraph 8.2.1. subparagraph 1.) This way of encoding form data is also given in later HTML specifications, for example, look for relevant paragraphs about application/x-www-form-urlencoded in HTML 4.01 Specification, and so on.Here is a sample string in URL where the HTML specification allows encoding spaces as pluses: "http://example.com/over/there?name=foo+bar". So, only after "?", spaces can be replaced by pluses, according to the HTML specification. In other cases, spaces should be encoded to %20. But since it\'s hard to correctly determine the context, it\'s the best practice to never encode spaces as "+".I would recommend to percent-encode all character except "unreserved" defined in RFC-3986, p.2.3The implementation depends on the programming language that you chose.If your URL contains national characters, first encode them to UTF-8 and then percent-encode the result.
