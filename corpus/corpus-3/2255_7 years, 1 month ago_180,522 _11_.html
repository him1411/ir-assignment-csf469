I want to know if there is a much cleaner way of doing this. Basically, I want to pick a random element from an array of variable length.  Normally, I would do it like this:Is there something that is more readable / simpler to replace the second line? Or is that the best way to do it. I suppose you could do myArray.shuffle.first, but I only saw #shuffle a few minutes ago on SO, I haven\'t actually used it yet.Just use Array#sample:It is available in Ruby 1.9.1+. To be also able to use it with an earlier version of Ruby, you could  require "backports/1.9.1/array/sample".Note that in Ruby 1.8.7 it exists under the unfortunate name choice; it was renamed in later version so you shouldn\'t use that.Although not useful in this case, sample accepts a number argument in case you want a number of distinct samples.myArray.sample(x) can also help you to get x random elements from the array.Personally, I would prefer the method item = myArray.random_element. UPDATE: If you aren\'t using rails (active support) you\'ll need to define the method yourself. See Marc-Andr\xc3\xa9 Lafortune\'s answer for a more modern view.  You could also define the Array#sample method similar to this, if you are using ruby version < 1.9.1.will return 1 random value.will also return 1 random value.
