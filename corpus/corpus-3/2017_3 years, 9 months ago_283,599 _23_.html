I want to translate a List of objects into a Map using Java 8\'s streams and lambdas.This is how I would write it in Java 7 and below.I can accomplish this easily using Java 8 and Guava but I would like to know how to do this without Guava.In Guava:And Guava with Java 8 lambdas.Based on Collectors documentation it\'s as simple as:If your key is NOT guaranteed to be unique for all elements in the list, you should convert it to a Map<String, List<Choice>> instead of a Map<String, Choice>Use getName() as the key and choice itself as the value of the map:Here\'s another one in case you don\'t want to use Collectors.toMap()If you don\'t mind to use a 3rd party lib (Vavr(formerly known as Javaslang)) you could use powerful new immutable collections:There are also many methods to convert Java collections forth and back.Please read more about the new collections here.Disclaimer: I\'m the creator of Vavr.If you don\'t mind using 3rd party libraries, AOL\'s cyclops-react lib (disclosure I am a contributor) has extensions for all JDK Collection types, including List and Map.I was trying to do this and found that, using the answers above, when using Functions.identity() for the key to the Map, then I had issues with using a local method like this::localMethodName to actually work because of typing issues.Functions.identity() actually does something to the typing in this case so the method would only work by returning Object and accepting a param of ObjectTo solve this, I ended up ditching Functions.identity() and using s->s instead.So my code, in my case to list all directories inside a directory, and for each one use the name of the directory as the key to the map and then call a method with the directory name and return a collection of items, looks like:One more option in simple wayI use this syntaxHere is solution by StreamExYou can create a Stream of the indices using an IntStream and then convert them to a Map :Even  serves this purpose for me,
