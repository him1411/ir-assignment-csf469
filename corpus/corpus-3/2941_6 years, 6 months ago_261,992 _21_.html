Why doesn\'t a TRUNCATE on mygroup work?\nEven though I have ON DELETE CASCADE SET I get:ERROR 1701 (42000): Cannot truncate a table referenced in a foreign key constraint (mytest.instance, CONSTRAINT instance_ibfk_1 FOREIGN KEY (GroupID) REFERENCES mytest.mygroup (ID))You cannot TRUNCATE a table that has FK constraints applied on it (TRUNCATE is not the same as DELETE).To work around this, use either of these solutions. Both present risks of damaging the data integrity.Option 1:Option 2: suggested by user447951 in their answerYes you can:With these statements, you risk letting in rows into your tables that do not adhere to the FOREIGN KEY constraints.I would simply do it with :As per mysql documentation, TRUNCATE cannot be used on tables with foreign key relationships. There is no complete alternative AFAIK.Dropping the contraint still does not invoke the ON DELETE and ON UPDATE.\nThe only solution I can ATM think of is to either:It would seem TRUNCATE in MySQL is not a complete feature yet (it also does not invoke triggers).\nSee commentWhile this question was asked more than 5 years ago and I don\'t know this facility existed in MySql back then but now if you use phpmyadmin you can simply open the database and then select the table(s) you want to truncate. At the bottom there is a drop down with many options listed. Open it and select Empty option under the heading Delete data or table. It takes you to the next page automatically where there is an option in checkbox called Enable foreign key checks. Just unselect it and press Yes button and the selected table(s) will be truncated. May be it internally runs the query suggested in user447951\'s answer. But it is very convenient to use from phpmyadmin interface.you can doAnswer is indeed the one provided by zerkms, as stated on Option 1:Option 1: which does not risk damage to data integrity:The tricky part is Removing constraints, so I want to tell you how, in case someone needs to know how to do that:Run SHOW CREATE TABLE  <Table Name> query to see what is your FOREIGN KEY\'s name (Red frame in below image):Run ALTER TABLE <Table Name> DROP FOREIGN KEY <Foreign Key Name>. This will remove the foreign key constraint.Drop the associated Index (through table structure page), and you are done.
