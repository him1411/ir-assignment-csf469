I would like my JSON output in Ruby on Rails to be "pretty" or nicely formatted. Right now, I call to_json and my JSON is all on one line.  At times this can be difficult to see if there is a problem in the JSON output stream.Is there way to configure or a method to make my JSON "pretty" or nicely formatted in Rails?Use the pretty_generate() function, built into later versions of JSON. For example:Which gets you:Thanks to Rack Middleware and Rails 3 you can output pretty JSON for every request without changing any controller of your app. I have written such middleware snippet and I get nicely printed JSON in browser and curl output.The above code should be placed in app/middleware/pretty_json_response.rb of your Rails project.\nAnd the final step is to register the middleware in config/environments/development.rb:I don\'t recommend to use it in production.rb. The JSON reparsing may degrade response time and throughput of your production app. Eventually extra logic such as \'X-Pretty-Json: true\' header may be introduced to trigger formatting for manual curl requests on demand.(Tested with Rails 3.2.8-5.0.0, Ruby 1.9.3-2.2.0, Linux)The <pre> tag in HTML, used with JSON.pretty_generate, will render the JSON pretty in your view. I was so happy when my illustrious boss showed me this:If you want to:Then ... replace the ActionController::Renderer for JSON! Just add the following code to your ApplicationController:Dumping an ActiveRecord object to JSON (in the Rails console):Check out awesome_print.  Parse the JSON string into a Ruby Hash, then display it with awesome_print like so:With the above, you\'ll see:awesome_print will also add some color that Stack Overflow won\'t show you :)If you (like I) find that the pretty_generate option built into Ruby\'s JSON library is not "pretty" enough, I recommend my own NeatJSON gem for your formatting.To use it gem install neatjson and then use JSON.neat_generate instead of JSON.pretty_generate.Like Ruby\'s pp it will keep objects and arrays on one line when they fit, but wrap to multiple as needed. For example:It also supports a variety of formatting options to further customize your output. For example, how many spaces before/after colons? Before/after commas? Inside the brackets of arrays and objects? Do you want to sort the keys of your object? Do you want the colons to all be lined up?Here is a middleware solution modified from this excellent answer by @gertas.  This solution is not Rails specific--it should work with any Rack application.The middleware technique used here, using #each, is explained at ASCIIcasts 151: Rack Middleware by Eifion Bedford.This code goes in app/middleware/pretty_json_response.rb:To turn it on, add this to config/environments/test.rb and config/environments/development.rb:As @gertas warns in his version of this solution, avoid using it in production.  It\'s somewhat slow.Tested with Rails 4.1.6.Here\'s my solution which I derived from other posts during my own search.This allows you to send the pp and jj output to a file as needed.I have used the gem CodeRay and it works pretty well. The format includes colors and it recognises a lot of different formats.I have used it on a gem that can be used for debugging rails APIs and it works pretty well.By the way, the gem is named \'api_explorer\' (http://www.github.com/toptierlabs/api_explorer)If you\'re looking to quickly implement this in a Rails controller action to send a JSON response:Using <pre> html code and pretty_generate is good trick:I use the following as I find the headers, status and JSON output useful as\na set. The call routine is broken out on recommendation from a railscasts presentation at: http://railscasts.com/episodes/151-rack-middleware?autoplay=trueIf you are using RABL you can configure it as described here to use JSON.pretty_generate:A problem with using JSON.pretty_generate is that JSON schema validators will no longer be happy with your datetime strings. You can fix those in your config/initializers/rabl_config.rb with:
