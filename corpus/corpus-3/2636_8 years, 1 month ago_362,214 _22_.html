I am having trouble coming up with the right combination of semicolons and/or braces. I\'d like to do this, but as a one-liner from the command line:By the way, if you type it as a multiline (as you are showing) at the command prompt and then call the history with arrow up, you will get it on a single line, correctly punctuated.It\'s also possible to use sleep command in while\'s condition. Making one-liner looking more clean imho.Colon is always "true":You can use semicolons to separate statements:You can also make use of until command:Note that in contrast to while, until would execute the commands inside the loop as long as the test condition has an exit status which is not zero.Using a while loop:Using a for loop:Another way using until:I like to use the semicolons only for the WHILE statement,\nand the && operator to make the loop do more than one thing...So I always do it like thisA very simple infinite loop.. :)Fr your question it would be:For simple process watching use watch insteadIf I can give two practical examples (with a bit of "emotion").This writes the name of all files ended with ".jpg" in the folder "img":This deletes them:Just trying to contribute.You can try this too If you want the while loop to stop after some condition, and your foo command returns non-zero when this condition is met then you can get the loop to break like this:For example, if the foo command is deleting things in batches, and it returns 1 when there is nothing left to delete.
