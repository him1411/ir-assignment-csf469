I managed to find the containers under directory /var/lib/docker/containers, but I can\'t find the images.What are the directories and files under /var/lib/docker?The contents of the /var/lib/docker directory vary depending on the driver Docker is using for storage. By default this will be aufs but can fall back to overlay, overlay2, btrfs, devicemapper or zfs depending on your kernel support. In most places this will be aufs but the RedHats went with devicemapper.You can manually set the storage driver with the -s or --storage-driver= option to the Docker daemon. In the case of aufs:In the case of devicemapper:When using Docker for Mac Application, it appears that the containers are stored within the VM located at:In the special case of Mac OS X or Windows, using boot2docker, your Docker images are stored within a VirtualBox VM managed by boot2docker.This VM will be stored in normal place of VirtualBox images:      OS X: ~/VirtualBox VMs/boot2docker-vm      Windows: %USERPROFILE%/VirtualBox VMs/boot2docker-vmYou can reset it by running (WARNING: This will destroy all images you\'ve built and downloaded so far):This is especially useful if you kept tons of intermediate images when building / debugging a build without the useful --rm options, I quote them here for reference:\nUse:instead of:The images are stored in /var/lib/docker/graph/<id>/layer.Note that images are just diffs from the parent image. The parent ID is stored with the image\'s metadata /var/lib/docker/graph/<id>/json.When you docker run an image. AUFS will \'merge\' all layers into one usable file system.For someone who is using Docker toolbox (that uses docker-machine), the answers concerning boot2docker on Mac OS X is not valid. The docker-machine VM is called "default" and it exists in the /Users/<username>/.docker/machine/machines/default/ directory. Actually, Docker images are stored in two files as shown by following commandData file: /var/lib/docker/devicemapper/devicemapper/dataMetadata file: /var/lib/docker/devicemapper/devicemapper/metadataOn the newly released \'Docker for Windows\', which uses Hyper-V, data is located in the Docker virtual hard disk: You can also open the \'Hyper-V Manager\' for access to the Docker / MobyLinuxVM.On Ubuntu you can "play" with images running Actually, images are stored within /var/lib/docker/aufs/diffIf you are using Docker for MAC (not boot2docker) then the location is /Users/<UserName>/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/In Docker for Windows (native Windows) the default container storage is at:As answered here, if you\'re on Mac, it is located at I use the boot2docker for Docker on Mac OSX, so the images is stored into the /Users/<USERNAME>/VirtualBox VMs/boot2docker-vm/boot2docker-vm.vmdk.In Docker for Windows, the logs are here: %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\DockerI can answer this question only for Ubuntu users:The root directory of docker can be found when you run the command docker infoDocker directory will be given in this line: "Docker Root Dir: /var/lib/docker"About the docker images, they are stored inside the docker directory: \n/var/lib/docker/aufs/diff/Remember these things are not same in all version of docker. Currently, I am using 1.12.3.Expanding on Tristan\'s answer, in Windows with Hyper-V you can move the image with these steps from matthuisman:On Fedora, Docker uses LVM for storage if available. On my system docker info shows:In that case, to increase storage, you will have to use LVM command line tools or compatible partition managers like blivet.And if you want to see what images you have locally, you have to run docker in interactive with the bash command(I think that\'s the command) to get the normal linux $ prompt. Then run docker images. Inside the mobylinux.vhdx, in the /var/lib/docker/ is where the local cache is stored.
