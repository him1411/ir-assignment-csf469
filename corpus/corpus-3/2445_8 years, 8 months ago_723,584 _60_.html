I have a windows forms app with a textbox control that I want to only accept integer values. In the past I\'ve done this kind of validation by overloading the KeyPress event and just removing characters which didn\'t fit the specification. I\'ve looked at the MaskedTextBox control but I\'d like a more general solution that could work with perhaps a regular expression, or depend on the values of other controls.Ideally this would behave such that pressing a non numeric character would either produce no result or immediately provide the user with feedback about the invalid character.Two options:Use a NumericUpDown instead. NumericUpDown does the filtering for you, which is nice. Of course it also gives your users the ability to hit the up and down arrows on the keyboard to increment and decrement the current value.Handle the appropriate keyboard events to prevent anything but numeric input. I\'ve had success with this two event handlers on a standard TextBox:You can remove the check for \'.\' (and the subsequent check for more than one \'.\') if your TextBox shouldn\'t allow decimal places. You could also add a check for \'-\' if your TextBox should allow negative values.If you want to limit the user for number of digit, use: textBox1.MaxLength = 2; // this will allow the user to enter only 2 digitsAnd just because it\'s always more fun to do stuff in one line...NOTE: This DOES NOT prevent a user from Copy / Paste into this textbox. It\'s not a fail safe way to sanitize your data.I am assuming from context and the tags you used that you are writing a .NET C# app. In this case, you can subscribe to the text changed event, and validate each key stroke.Here is a simple standalone Winforms custom control, derived from the standard TextBox, that allows only System.Int32 input (it could be easily adapted for other types such as System.Int64, etc.). It supports copy/paste operations and negative numbers:Update 2017: My first answer has some defaults:So I came up with another version that\'s more generic, that still supports copy/paste, + and - sign, etc.For Int32, you can either derive from it, like this:or w/o derivation, use the new TextValidating event like this:but what\'s nice is it works with any string, and any validation routine.This is exactly what the Validated/Validating events were designed for.Here\'s the MSDN article on the topic: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.control.validating.aspxThe TL;DR version: check the .Text property in the Validating event and set e.Cancel=True when the data is invalid.When you set e.Cancel=True, the user can\'t leave the field, but you will need to give them some kind of feedback that something\'s wrong. I change the box\'s background color to light red to indicate a problem. Make sure to set it back to SystemColors.Window when Validating is called with a good value.Try a MaskedTextBox. It takes a simple mask format so you can limit the input to numbers or dates or whatever.You can use the TextChanged eventI\'ve been working on a collection of components to complete missing stuff in WinForms, here it is: Advanced FormsIn particular this is the class for a Regex TextBoxSimply adding something like myNumbericTextBox.RegexString = "^(\\\\d+|)$"; should suffice.I have made something for this on CodePlex.It works by intercepting the TextChanged event. If the result is a good number it will be stored. If it is something wrong, the last good value will be restored. The source is a bit too large to publish here, but here is a link to the class that handles the core of this logic.This might be useful. It allows "real" numeric values, including proper decimal points and preceding plus or minus signs. Call it from within the related KeyPress event.simply use this code in textbox :In our webpage with the definition of textbox we can add an onkeypress event for accepting only numbers. It will not show any message but it will prevent you from wrong input. It worked for me, user could not enter anything except number.you could use TextChanged/ Keypress event, use a regex to filter on numbers and take some action.try this is very simpleTake a look at Input handling in WinFormI have posted my solution which uses the ProcessCmdKey and OnKeyPress events on the textbox. The comments show you how to use a Regex to verify the keypress and block/allow appropriately.Hi you can do something like this in the textchanged event of the textbox. here is a demoIt seems like many of the current answers to this question are manually parsing the input text. If you\'re looking for a specific built-in numeric type (e.g. int or double), why not just delegate the work to that type\'s TryParse method? For example:If you want something more generic but still compatible with Visual Studio\'s Designer:And finally, if you want something fully generic and don\'t care about Designer support:Sorry to wake the dead, but I thought someone might find this useful for future reference.Here is how I handle it.  It handles floating point numbers, but can easily be modified for integers.Basically you can only press 0 - 9 and .You can only have one 0 before the .All other characters are ignored and the cursor position maintained.Here is a quickly modified int version:I would handle it in the KeyDown event. This one works with copy and paste, drag and drop, key down, prevents overflow and is pretty simpleI was also looking for the best way to check only numbers in textbox and problem with keypress was it does not support copy paste by right click or clipboard so came up with  this code which validates the when cursor leaves the text field and also it checks for empty field. (adapted version of newguy)3 solution1)2)\nan another solution from msdn}source  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.control.keypress(v=VS.90).aspx3)  using the MaskedTextBox: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.maskedtextbox.aspxIn button click you can check text of textbox by for loop:Simpler answer:FAIL-SAFE and simple "recursive" method, which can be used with multiple textboxes.It blocks the wrong keyboard typed characters and also pasted values etc. It only accepts integer numbers, and the maximum number length is the maximum length of a string type (which is int, really long!)i like terse codeDo not forget that a user can paste an invalid text in a textbox. if you want to restrict that, follow the below code:
