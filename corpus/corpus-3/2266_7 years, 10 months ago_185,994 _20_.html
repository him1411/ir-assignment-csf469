I have two branches. Commit a is the head of one, while the other has b, c, d, e and f on top of a. I want to move c, d, e and f to first branch without commit b. Using cherry pick it is easy: checkout first branch cherry-pick one by one c to f and rebase second branch onto first. But is there any way to cherry-pick all c-f in one command?Here is a visual description of the scenario (thanks JJD):Git 1.7.2 introduced the ability to cherrypick a range of commits. From the release notes:git cherry-pick" learned to pick a range of commits\n  (e.g. "cherry-pick A..B" and "cherry-pick --stdin"), so did "git\n  revert"; these do not support the nicer sequencing control "rebase\n  [-i]" has, though.Including important comments (credits to respective authors)Note 1: In the "cherry-pick A..B" form, A should be older than B. If they\'re the wrong order the command will silently fail. \xe2\x80\x93 damian Note 2: Also, this will not cherry-pick A, but rather everything after A up to and including B. \xe2\x80\x93 J. B. RainsbergerNote 3: To include A just type git cherry-pick A^..B  \xe2\x80\x93 sschaef The simplest way to do this is with the onto option to rebase. Suppose that the branch which current finishes at a is called mybranch and this is the branch that you want to move c-f onto.Or the requested one-liner:You can use a serial combination of git rebase and git branch to apply a group of commits onto another branch. As already posted by wolfc the first command actually copies the commits. However, the change is not visible until you add a branch name to the top most commit of the group.Please open the picture in a new tab ...To summarize the commands in text form:This should clarify things:Afterwards, you could use git checkout feature && git reset --hard b to delete the commits c till f from the feature branch.In addition to this answer, I wrote a blog post which describes the commands in another scenario which should help to generally use it.To apply J. B. Rainsberger and sschaef\'s comments to specifically answer the question... To use a cherry-pick range on this example:or
