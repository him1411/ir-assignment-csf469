I\'m trying to undo all changes since my last commit. I tried git reset --hard and git reset --hard HEAD after viewing this post. I responds with head is now at 18c3773... but when I look at my local source all the files are still there. What am I missing?This will unstage all files you might have staged with git add:This will revert all local uncommitted changes (should be executed in repo root):You can also revert uncommitted changes only to particular file or directory:Yet another way to revert all uncommitted changes (longer to type, but works from any subdirectory):This will remove all local untracked files, so only git tracked files remain:WARNING: -x  will also remove all ignored files!To sum it up: executing commands below is basically equivalent to fresh git clone from original source (but it does not re-download anything, so is much faster):Typical usage for this would be in build scripts, when you must make sure that your tree is absolutely clean - does not have any modifications or locally created object files or build artefacts, and you want to make it work very fast and to not re-clone whole repository every single time.If you wish to "undo" all uncommitted changes simply run:If you have any untracked files (check by running git status), these may be removed by running:git stash creates a new stash which will become stash@{0}. If you wish to check first you can run git stash list to see a list of your stashes. It will look something like:Each stash is named after the previous commit messsage.  there is also git stash - which "stashes" your local changes and can be reapplied at a later time or dropped if is no longer requiredmore info on stashingI\'m using source tree.... You can do revert all uncommitted changes with 2 easy steps:1) just need to reset the workspace file status\n2) select all unstage files (command +a), right click and select removeIt\'s that simple :DFor those who reached here searching if they could undo git clean -f -d , by which a file created in eclipse was deleted, You can do the same from the UI using "restore from local history"  for ref:Restore from local historyBased on my research, I had below summary.STATES TRANSITIONING FROM ONE COMMIT TO NEW COMMITACTION FOR STATE TRANSITIONING:CHECK DIFF:REVERT TO LAST COMMIT:EQUIVALENT OF GIT CLONE, WITHOUT RE-DOWNLOADING ANYTHING
