I have cloned project from master branch from remote repository remote_repo. I create new branch and I commit to that branch. Other programmers pushed to remote_repo to master branch. I need now to rebase my branch RB with remote_repo master. How to do this ? What commands to type to terminal ?First fetch the new master from the upstream repository, then rebase your work branch on that:Update: Please see Paul Draper\'s answer for a more concise way to do the same - recent Git versions provide a simpler way to do the equivalent of the above two commands.After changes committed to your branch, checkout master and pull to get the changes from the repo:Then checkout your branch and rebase your changes on master :or last two commands in one line:// Assuming that there are no commits and changes to be made on YourBranch at this point// Pulls all changes made by other developers working on your branch and rebases your changes on top of it.// Resolve any conflicts that presents.// Pulls all the latest changes from master and rebases master on latest master.// resolve any conflicts that presents.// rebase on master happens\n// resolve conflicts // Merge your branch into master if done with changes. Which makes YourBranch up-to-date with master when you wanted to work on same branch later.
