I have the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] I\'d like to make it into [1, 2, 3, 4]. How do I go about this? Python Listlist.pop(index)del list[index]These both modify your original list.Others have suggested using slicing:Also, if you are performing many pop(0), you should look at collections.dequeSlicing:Which would actually return a subset of the original but not modify it.More on this here.you would just do thisor l = l[1:]Pros and ConsUsing pop you can retrieve the valuesay x = l.pop(0)\nx would be 0With list slicing, see the Python tutorial about lists for more details:Then just delete it:You can also use list.remove(a[0]) to pop out the first element in the list.You can use list.reverse() to reverse the list, then list.pop() to remove the last element, for example:
