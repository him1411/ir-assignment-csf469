This question already has an answer here:The code below (also available as a demo on JS Fiddle) does not position the text in the middle, as I ideally would like it to. I cannot find any way to vertically centre text in a div, even using the margin-top attribute. How can I do this?Create a container for your text content, a span perhaps.JSFiddleAndres Ilich has it right. Just in case someone misses his comment...A.)

Thanks Ben (from comments) for pointing out, didn\'t have time to update.A good guy named Mahendra posted a very working solution hereThe following class should make the element horizontally and vertically centered to its parent.This is an old thread but the accepted answer doesn\'t work for multi-line text and this is top result in google. I updated the jsfiddle to show css multiline text vertical align as explained hereit also works with <br> in "yet another..."Try this:HTMLCSSThis is simply supposed to work:  Tried it on your demo.This is the simplest way to do it if you need multiple lines. Wrap you span\'d text in another span and specify its height with line-height. The trick to multiple lines is resetting the inner span\'s line-height.DEMOOf course the outer span could be a div or whathaveyouAdd a vertical align to the css #column-content strong too:Also see your updated example.=== UPDATE ===With a span around the other text and another vertical align:html:css: Also see the next example.To make Omar\'s (or Mahendra\'s) solution even more universal, the block of code relative to FireFox should be replaced by the following:The problem with Omar\'s code, otherwise operative, arises when you want to center the box in the screen or in it\'s immediate ancestor. This centering is done either by setting its position toposition: relative; or position:static; (not with position:absolute nor fixed).and then margin: auto; or margin-right:auto; margin-left:auto;Under this box center aligning environment, Omar\'s suggestion does not work. Doesn\'t work either in IE8 (yet 7.7% market share). So for IE8 (and other browsers), a workaround as seen in other above solutions should be considered.I know it\xe2\x80\x99s totally stupid and you normally really shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t use tables when not creating tables but: Table cells can align multiple lines of text vertically centered and even do this by default. So a solution which works quite fine could be something like this:html:css: (make the table item always fit to the box div)see here:\nhttp://www.cssdesk.com/LzpeV
