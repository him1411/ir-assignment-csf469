I ran "git status" and listed below are some files that were modified/or under the heading "changes not staged for commit".\nIt also listed some untracked files that I want to ignore (I have a ".gitignore" file in these directories).I want to put the modified files in staging so I can commit them.  When I ran "git add .", it added the modified files AND the files I want to ignore to staging.How do I add only the modified files and ignore the untracked files if presented with the git status below.Also, are my ".gitignore" files working properly?Ideally your .gitignore should prevent the untracked ( and ignored )files from being shown in status, added using git add etc. So I would ask you to correct your .gitignoreYou can do git add -u so that it will stage the modified and deleted files.You can also do git commit -a to commit only the modified and deleted files.Note that if you have Git of version before 2.0 and used git add ., then you would need to use git add -u . (See "Difference of \xe2\x80\x9cgit add -A\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgit add .\xe2\x80\x9d").This worked for me:Or even better: You didn\'t say what\'s currently your .gitignore, but a .gitignore with the following contents in your root directory should do the trick.I happened to try this so I could see the list of files first:execute:Edit: (see comments)\nThis could be achieved in one step:
