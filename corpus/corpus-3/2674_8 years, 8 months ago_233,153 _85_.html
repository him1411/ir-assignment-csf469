How can I set the maximum amount of characters in a UITextField on the iPhone SDK when I load up a UIView?While the UITextField class has no max length property, it\'s relatively simple to get this functionality by setting the text field\'s delegate and implementing the following delegate method:Objective-CSwiftBefore the text field changes, the UITextField asks the delegate if the specified text should be changed. The text field has not changed at this point, so we grab it\'s current length and the string length we\'re inserting (either through pasting copied text or typing a single character using the keyboard), minus the range length. If this value is too long (more than 25 characters in this example), return NO to prohibit the change.When typing in a single character at the end of a text field, the range.location will be the current field\'s length, and range.length will be 0 because we\'re not replacing/deleting anything. Inserting into the middle of a text field just means a different range.location, and pasting multiple characters just means string has more than one character in it.Deleting single characters or cutting multiple characters is specified by a range with a non-zero length, and an empty string. Replacement is just a range deletion with a non-empty string.As is mentioned in the comments, there is a bug with UITextField that can lead to a crash.If you paste in to the field, but the paste is prevented by your validation implementation, the paste operation is still recorded in the application\'s undo buffer. If you then fire an undo (by shaking the device and confirming an Undo), the UITextField will attempt to replace the string it thinks it pasted in to itself with an empty string. This will crash because it never actually pasted the string in to itself. It will try to replace a part of the string that doesn\'t exist.Fortunately you can protect the UITextField from killing itself like this. You just need to ensure that the range it proposes to replace does exist within its current string. This is what the initial sanity check above does.Hope it\'s helpful to you.Thank you august! (Post)This is the code that I ended up with which works:To complete August answer, an possible implementation of the proposed function  (see UITextField\'s delegate).I did not test domness code, but mine do not get stuck if the user reached the limit, and it is compatible with a new string that comes replace a smaller or equal one.You can\'t do this directly - UITextField has no maxLength attribute, but you can set the UITextField\'s delegate, then use:Edit2: Changed checkMaxLength as to not delete the entire UITextField.text property when the maxLimit is reached, instead truncating the string and not allowing extra input. The changes are based on this answer, which has a leak by using a global array.Edit: memory leak issue fixed.Often you have multiple input fields with a different length.The best way would be to set up a notification on the text changing. In your -awakeFromNib of your view controller method you\'ll want:Then in the same class add:Then link up the outlet myTextField to your UITextField and it will not let you add any more characters after you hit the limit. Be sure to add this to your dealloc method:I created this UITextFieldLimit subclass:Grab the UITextFieldLimit.h and UITextFieldLimit.m from this GitHub repository:https://github.com/JonathanGurebo/UITextFieldLimitand begin to test!Mark your storyboard-created UITextField and link it to my subclass using the Identity Inspector:Then you can link it to an IBOutlet and set the limit(default is 10).Your ViewController.h file should contain: (if you wan\'t to modify the setting, like the limit)Your ViewController.m file should @synthesize textFieldLimit.Set the text length limit in your ViewController.m file:Hope the class helps you. Good luck!This should be enough to solve the problem (replace 4 by the limit u want). Just make sure to add delegate in IB.Using Interface builder you can link and get the event for "Editing changed" in any of your function.\nNow there you can put check for the lengthI simulate the actual string replacement that\'s about to happen to calculate that future string\'s length:Swift 3 version\n//***** This will NOT work with Swift 2.x! *****//First create a new Swift file : TextFieldMaxLength.swift,\nand then add the code below:and then you will see in Storyboard a new field (Max Length) when you select any TextFieldif you still have more questions check out this link: http://www.globalnerdy.com/2016/05/18/ios-programming-trick-how-to-use-xcode-to-set-a-text-fields-maximum-length-visual-studio-style/To make it work with cut & paste of strings of any length, I would suggest changing the function to something like: The following code is similar to sickp\'s answer but handles correctly copy-paste operations. If you try to paste a text that is longer than the limit, the following code will truncate the text to fit the limit instead of refusing the paste operation completely.This is the correct way to handle max length on UITextField, it allows the return key to exit the resign the textfield as first responder and lets the user backspace when they reach the limitThere is generic solution for setting max length in Swift.\nBy IBInspectable you can add new Attribute in Xcode Attribute Inspector.Swift 2.0 +First of all create a class for this process. Lets call it StringValidator.swift.Then just paste the following code inside it.Now save the class.....Usage..Now goto your viewController.swift class and make your textfield\'s outlets as..Now goto the textfield\'s shouldChangeCharactersInRange method and use like the following.Don\'t forget to set the delegate protocol/methods of textfields.Let me explain about this... I am using the simple extension process of string which I wrote inside an another class. Now I am just calling those extension methods from another class where I need them by adding check and maximum value.Features...Types...containsOnlyCharactersIn //Accepts only Characters.containsCharactersIn    //Accepts combination of charactersdoesNotContainsCharactersIn  //Will not accept charactersHope this helped....\nThanks..For Xamarin:Other answers do not handle the case where user can paste a long string from clipboard. If I paste a long string it should just be truncated but shown.\nUse this in your delegate:Got it down to 1 line of code :)Set your text view\'s delegate to "self" then add the <UITextViewDelegate> in your .h and the following code in your .m .... you can adjust the number "7" to be whatever you want your MAXIMUM number of characters to be. This code accounts for typing new characters, deleting characters, selecting characters then typing or deleting, selecting characters and cutting, pasting in general, and selecting characters and pasting.Done!Alternatively, another cool way to write this code with bit-operations would beI have open sourced a UITextField subclass, STATextField, that offers this functionality (and much more) with its maxCharacterLength property.now how many characters u want just give valuesUse this code here RESTRICTED_LENGTH is length you want to restrict for textfield.I did this in Swift for an 8 character limit when using a number pad.I had to test for string != "" to allow the delete button to work on the number pad, otherwise it wouldn\'t allow deleting characters in the text field after it reached its max.I have implemented a UITextField Extension to add a maxLength property to it.It\'s based on Xcode 6 IBInspectables, so you can set the maxLength limit on the Interface builder.Here is the implementation:UITextField+MaxLength.hUITextField+MaxLength.mThis code is working fine when you are paste string more than your character limits.Thanks for your votes. :)The Problem with some of the answer given above is, For example I have a text field and I have to set a limit of 15 characters input, then it stops after entering 15th Character. but they Don\'t allow to delete. That is the delete button also don\'t work. As I was facing the same problem. Came out with the solution , Given Below. Works Perfect for MeI am having a text field, whose tag I have set "6"\nand I have restricted the max char limit = 30 ;\nworks fine in every case This limits the number of characters, but also make sure that you can paste in the field until the maximum limit.Slightly beyond answering the original question, and expanding on Frouo\'s answer, here are extensions to trim a String of whitespace and to a max length, and to utilize those String extensions to trim a UITextField to a max length:trimAndLimitToMaxLength() could be used in UITextFieldDelegate\'s textFieldDidEndEditing(_:) so that a user could enter or paste in a longer than acceptable string and then shorten it vs. just cutting off the input at the max length. In doing this, I would also set attributed text styles to indicate any portion of the text that goes beyond the acceptable length (e.g., [NSBackgroundColorAttributeName : UIColor.redColor(), NSForegroundColorAttributeName : UIColor.whiteColor(), NSStrikethroughStyleAttributeName : NSNumber(int: 1)]
