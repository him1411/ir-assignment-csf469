I am trying to sort by multiple columns in SQL, and in different directions. column1 would be sorted descending, and column2 ascending.How can I do this?This sorts everything by column1 (descending) first, and then by column2 (ascending, which is the default) whenever the column1 fields for two rows are equal. The other answers lack a concrete example, so here it goes:Given the following People table:If you execute the query below:The result set will look like this:multiple column ordering depends on both columns corresponding values:\nhere is my table example where are two columns named with Alphabet and Numbers and the values in these two columns are acs and desc orders.Now I perform Order By in these two columns by executing below command:Now again I insert new values in these two columns, where Alphabet value in ACS order:and the columns in Example table look like this.\nNow again perform the same operation:you can see the values in the first column are in desc order but second column is not in ASC order.You can use multiple ordering on multiple condition,
