I\'m having a problem centering an element that has the attribute position set to absolute.\nDoes anyone know why the images are not centered?Without knowing the width/height of the positioned1 element, it is still possible to align it as follows:EXAMPLE HEREIt\'s worth noting that CSS Transform is supported in IE9 and above. (Vendor prefixes omitted for brevity)Adding top/left of 50% moves the top/left margin edge of the element to the middle of the parent, and translate() function with the (negative) value of -50% moves the element by the half of its size. Hence the element will be positioned at the middle.This is because a percentage value on top/left properties is relative to the height/width of the parent element (which is creating a containing block).While a percentage value on translate() transform function is relative to width/height of the element itself (Actually it refers to the size of bounding box).For unidirectional alignment, go with translateX(-50%) or translateY(-50%) instead.1. An element with a position other than static. I.e. relative, absolute, fixed values.Centering something absolutely positioned is rather convoluted in CSS.Change margin-left to (negative) half the width of the element you are trying to center.Div vertically and horizontally aligned center Note : Elements should have width and height to be setA simple CSS trick, just add:This works on both images and text.If you want to center an absolute elementIf you want a container to be centered left to right, but not with top to bottomIf you want a container to be centered top to bottom, regardless of being left to rightUpdate as of December 15, 2015Well I learnt this another new trick few months ago. Assuming that you have a relative parent element.Here goes your absolute element.With this, I think it\'s a better answer than my old solution. Since you don\'t have to specify width AND height. This one it adapts the content of the element itself.to center a a position:absolute attribute you need to set left:50% and margin-left: -50% of the width of the div.for vertical center absolute you need to do the same thing bud not with left just with top.\n( NOTE: html and body must have min-height 100%; )and can be combined for bothsee demo on: http://jsfiddle.net/MohammadDayeh/HrZLC/ text-align: center; works with a position: absolute element when adding left: 0; right: 0;The simpler, the best:Then you need to insert your img tag into a tag that sports position:relative property, as follows:If you don\'t know the width of the element you can use this code:Demo at fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/wrh7a21r/Source: https://stackoverflow.com/a/1777282/1136132I\'m not sure what you want to accomplish, but in this case just adding width: 100%; to your ul#slideshow li will do the trick.The img tags are inline-block elements. This means that they flow inline like text, but also have a width and height like block elements. In your css there are two text-align: center; rules applied to the <body> and to the #slideshowWrapper (which is redundant btw) this makes all inline and inline-block child elements to be centered in their closest block elements, in your code these are li tags. All block elements have width: 100% if they are the static flow (position: static;), which is default. The problem is that when you tell li tags to be position: absolute;, you take them out of normal static flow, and this causes them to shrink their size to just fit their inner content, in other words they kind of "lose" their width: 100% property.Using \nleft: calc(50% - Wpx/2); where W is the width of the element works for me.An absolute object inside a relative object is relative to its parent, the problem here is that you need  a static width for the container #slideshowWrapper , and the rest of the solution is like the other users sayshttp://jsfiddle.net/ejRTU/10/This worked for me:Here is easy and best solution for center element with \xe2\x80\x9cposition: absolute\xe2\x80\x9d Position absolute takes it out of the flow, and places it at 0x0 to the parent ( Last block element to have a position absolute or position relative ).I\'m not sure what exactly you what you are trying to accomplish, It might be best to set the li to a position:relative and that will center them. Given your current CSSCheck out http://jsfiddle.net/rtgibbons/ejRTU/ to play with itYour images are not centered because your list items are not centered; only their text is centered. You can achieve the positioning you want by either centering the entire list or centering the images within the list. A revised version of your code can be found at the bottom. In my revision I center both the list and the images within it.The truth is you cannot center an element that has a position set to absolute.Note: These instructions will work with any DOM block element, not just img.1) Surround your image with a div or other tag (in your case a li).Note: The names given to these elements are not special.2) Alter your css or scss to give the div absolute positioning and your image centered.Try this out:I hope this was helpful. Good luck!I don\'t remember where I saw the centering method listed above, using negative top, right, bottom, left values. \nFor me, this tehnique is the best, in most situations. When I use the combination from above, the image behaves like a background-image with the following settings: \nMore details about the first example can be found here:\n Maintain the aspect ratio of a div with CSSWhat seems to be happening is there are two solutions; centered using margins and centered using position. Both work fine, but if you want to absolute position an element relative to this centered element, you need to use the absolute position method, because the absolute position of the second element defaults to the first parent that is positioned. Like so:Until I\'d read this posting, using the margin:0 auto technique, to build a menu to the left of my content I had to build a same-width column to the right to balance it out. Not pretty. Thanks!Use margin-left: x%; where x is the half of the width of the element.
