Anybody seen this error and know what to do?I\'m using the terminal, I\'m in the root, the GitHub repository exists and I don\'t know what to do now.GitHub isn\'t able to authenticate you.  So, either you aren\'t setup with an SSH key, because you haven\'t set one up on your machine, or your key isn\'t associated with your GitHub account.You can also use the HTTPS URL instead of the SSH/git URL to avoid having to deal with SSH keys.  This is GitHub\'s recommended method.Further, GitHub has a help page specifically for that error message, and explains in more detail everything you could check.You need to generate an SSH key (if you don\'t have one) and associate the public key with your Github account.  See Github\'s own documentation.This happened to me. For some reason my origin got messed up without my realizing it: Check if your settings are still correct the url needs to be something like ssh://git@github.com/YourDirectory/YourProject.git; \nif you don\'t see git@github.com, useto set it right. Or you could use the github app to check and set the Primary Remote Repository url in the settings panel of your particular repository.Did you create a config file in your ~/.ssh directory?  It should have contents like these:Assuming that you created an ssh key named github_rsaand uploaded it to GitHub...NOTE: You must follow this way of explicit configuration if you have more than 1 key (2 and more) in your ~/.ssh/ directory. If you don\'t specify key this way, then first key in order is taken and used for github authentication, so it depends on the key file name then.First, we need to check for existing ssh keys on your computer. Open up Terminal and run:and that will lists the files in your .ssh directoryAnd finally depending on what you see (in my case was):Just try setting up your RSA and hopefully that will solve your "git push origin" issues$ ssh-keygen -lf ~/.ssh/github_rsa.pubNOTE: RSA certificates are keys-paired so you will have a private and a public certificate, private will not be accessible for you since it belongs to github (in this case) but the public is the one you might be missing when this error happens (at least that was my case, my github account or repo got messed up somehow and i had to "link" the public key, previously generated)I know this problem. After add ssh key, add you ssh key to ssh agent too (from oficial docs https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/)After it, all work fine, git can view proper key, before coudn\'t.Assuming you are connecting GitHub over SSH, you can run below command to confirm this. If you get a result has following format git@github.com:xxx/xxx.github.com.git, then you should do the following.Generate a SSH key(or use existing one). if you had one, you just need to add your key to the ssh-agent (step 2)and to your GitHub account(step 3).below are for those who don\'t have SSH key.Step 1 Generating public/private rsa key pair.You\'ll be asked to confirm where to save the SSH key and what passphrase you want to use.Step 2 Add your key to the ssh-agentEnsure ssh-agent is enabled$eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"Add your SSH key to the ssh-agent:$ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsaStep 3 Add your SSH key to your account$sudo apt-get install xclip$xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pubThen add the copied key to GitHubGo to Settings->SSH keys(Personal settings side bar)->Add SSH key->fill out form(key is on your clipboard, just use ctrl+v)->Add keyAfter going through above steps, you should solve the permission problem.Reference Link: \nGenerating SSH keys.I was getting this error.  Turns out I had just upgraded OSX to Sierra and my old key was no longer registered.  At first I thought it was "Upgrading to macOS Sierra will break your SSH keys and lock you out of your own servers"But I had sidestepped that one.  Turns out I just had to re-register my existing key:ssh-add -KAnd type the passphrase... done!Make sure ssh-add -l shows a fingerprint of an SSH key that\'s present in the list of SSH keys in your Github account.If the output is empty, but you know you have a private SSH key that works with your github account, run ssh-add on this key (found in ~/.ssh. It\'s named id_rsa by default, so you\'ll likely run ssh-add id_rsa).Else, follow these instructions to generate an SSH key pair .In case you are not accessing your own repository, or cloning inside a cloned repository (using some "git submodule... " commands):In the home directory of your repository:1. Open ".gitmodules", and you will find something like this:Change the last line to be the HTTPS of the repository you need to pull:Save ".gitmodules", and run the command for submodules, and ".git" will be updated.2. Open ".git", go to "config" file, and you will find something like this:Change the last line to be the HTTPS of the repository you need to pull:So, in this case, the main problem is simply with the url. HTTPS of any repository can be found now on top of the repository page.I was using github earlier for one of my php project. While using github, I was using ssh instead of https. I had my machine set up like that and every time I used to commit and push the code, it would ask me my rsa key password.After some days, I stopped working on the php project and forgot my rsa password. Recently, I started working on a java project and moved to bitbucket. Since, I had forgotten the password and there is no way to recover it I guess, I decided to use the https(recommended) protocol for the new project and got the same error asked in the question.How I solved it?Ran this command to tell my git to use https instead of ssh:Remove any remote if any Redo everything from git init to git push and it works!PS: I also un-installed ssh from my machine during the debug process thinking that, removing it will fix the problem. Yes I know!! :)you can use Https url to logini guess you are trying to login with ssh url \nwhen you say git push if it as asking only password consider you are connecting through ssh.better you use http url.I think i have the best answer for you, your git apps read your id_rsa.pub in root user directoryThat\'s why your key in /home/your_username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub can\'t be read by git. So you need to create the key in /home/root/.ssh/Then copy the key in your github account.\nIt\'s worked for me. You can try it.I had the same issue recently. This might help if you need a fix immediately, but this needs to be done every time you re-start your systemFrom terminal, run : ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsaEnter your system password and that should work.I would like to add some of my findings:If you are using GitBash, then make sure the SSH key is stored in ~/.ssh/id_rsa. By Default GitBash searches for ~/.ssh/id_rsaas default path for SSH key.Even the file name id_rsa matters. If you save your SSH key in another filename or path, it will throw the Permission Denied(publickey)error.If you are using the GitHub for Mac UI, check preferences to make sure you\'re logged in. I was getting same error during \'git push\'. In client side I had two origin and master. I removed one, then it worked fine.Also in ubuntu, even though there was already SSH key entered in settings in BitBucket, I got this problem. The reason was, I was trying the following:Not sure why, but it got solved by usingNo sudo used. If you have already created an SSH key and are still getting the error it is because you need to give the user permissions to read and write to the folder you are cloning into. To do this, sudo chmod 777 <your_folder_name_here>".\nOf course, this is after you have generated an SSH key and you are still getting this error. Hope this helps future users. EditTo add on to this use admin in Windows if you\'re using the git bash Once scenario where this will happen is when you follow GitHub instructions after you create your repository. Git will instruct you to add your remote with something like this.git remote add origin git@github.com:<user>/<project>.gitReplace what\'s in <> with values related to your account.The solution is to remove the .git suffix. Add the remote as follows:git remote add origin git@github.com:<user>/<project>Another solution :create the SSH keys, type ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com". This will create both id_rsa and id_rsa.pub files.Add the id_rsa to ssh list on local computer: ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa.After generating the keys get the pubkey using :you will get something like :copy this key (value) and go to github.com and under the setting (ssh and pgp key) add your public key.Maybe your ssh-agent is not enable\nYou can try ithttp://git-scm.com/Install itEnable ssh-agentC:\\Program Files\\Git\\cmdstart-ssh-agentFor me I tried this - then I run and for generating the key you can run this will generate the pair of keys (Public and private).you can store this key to github for more read this Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub accountI hope it will help others :)Go to your GitHub account dashboard, find your project repository, click Settings tab - under Deploy keys you\'ll have to add your SSH key. Open Terminal and type: This will copy the key from your id_rsa.pub file. So just go back to GitHub dashboard, paste it, click Add Key and that\'s it. The same solution applies to Bitbucket accounts. I was having a similar problem to @Batman. However, because I was running this under /usr/local/src/projectname, running without sudo was not an option.Just add the -E flag to preseve the environment (your ~/.ssh/ path).$ sudo -E git clone git@your_repoFrom man sudo:-E, --preserve-env\n                   Indicates to the security policy that the user wishes to pre\xe2\x80\x90\n                   serve their existing environment variables.  The security\n                   policy may return an error if the user does not have permis\xe2\x80\x90\n                   sion to preserve the environment.I had 2 Github identity files loaded in the ssh agent.  My personal key and another for a client project. I removed the key that was causing confusion:ssh-add -d id_rsa_github_somekeyyou can try this way...choose another  links
