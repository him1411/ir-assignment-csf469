Using C#, how can I delete all files and folders from a directory, but still keep the root directory?Yes, that\'s the correct way to do it. If you\'re looking to give yourself a "Clean" (or, as I\'d prefer to call it, "Empty" function), you can create an extension method.This will then allow you to do something like..The following code will clear the folder recursively:We can also show love for LINQ:Note that my solution here is not performant, because I am using Get*().ToList().ForEach(...) which generates the same IEnumerable twice. I use an extension method to avoid this issue:This is the extension method:Based on the hiteshbiblog, you probably should make sure the file is read-write.The simplest way:Be aware that this may wipe out some permissions on the folder. Every method that I tried, they have failed at some point with System.IO errors. The following method works for sure, even if the folder is empty or not, read-only or not, etc.In Windows 7, if you have just created it manually with Windows Explorer, the directory structure is similar to this one:And running the code suggested in the original question to clean the directory C:\\AAA, the line di.Delete(true) always fails with IOException "The directory is not empty" when trying to delete BBB. It is probably because of some kind of delays/caching in Windows Explorer.The following code works reliably for me:The following code will clean the directory, but leave the root directory there (recursive). Using just static methods with File and Directory instead of FileInfo and DirectoryInfo will perform faster. (see accepted answer at What is the difference between File and FileInfo in C#?). Answer shown as utility method.This version does not use recursive calls, and solves the readonly problem.use DirectoryInfo\'s GetDirectories method.    It\'s not the best way to deal with the issue above. But it\'s an alternative one...this will show how we delete the folder and check for it we use Text box  Call from mainAdd  this method To delete the folder, this is code using Text box and  a button using System.IO; :The following example shows how you can do that. It first creates some directories and a file and then removes them via Directory.Delete(topPath, true);:It is taken from https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fxeahc5f(v=vs.110).aspx.The only thing you should do is to set optional recursive parameter to True. Directory.Delete("C:\\MyDummyDirectory", True)Thanks to .NET. :)You don\'t need more than that
