(Note I originally copied that here.)Edit: commenters pointed out, and are correct, that str_replace is better than preg_replace if you really just want to remove the space character.  The reason to use preg_replace would be to remove all whitespace (including tabs, etc.).If you know the white space is only due to spaces, you can use:But if it could be due to space, tab...you can use:str_replace will do the trick thusly
