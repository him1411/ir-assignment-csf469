What is a callback function?Developers are often confused by what a callback is because of the name of the damned thing.A callback function is a function which is:Once its parent function completes, the function passed as an argument is then called.Pseudocode:Result if you called event():Callbacks are so-called due to their usage with pointer languages. If you don\'t use one of those, don\'t labour over the name \'callback\'. Just understand that it is just a name to describe a method that\'s supplied as an argument to another method, such that when the parent method is called (whatever condition, such as a button click, a timer tick etc) and its method body completes, the callback method is then invoked, or in other words "called at the back" of the other function.A callback function is a function you provide to another piece of code, allowing it to be called by that code.Why would you want to do this? Let\'s say there is a service you need to invoke. If the service returns immediately, you just:For example, suppose the service were the factorial function. When you want the value of 5!, you would invoke factorial(5), and the following steps would occur:Your current execution location is saved (on the stack, but that\'s not important)Execution is handed over to factorialWhen factorial completes, it puts the result somewhere you can get to itExecution comes back to where it was in [1]Now suppose factorial took a really long time, because you\'re giving it huge numbers and it needs to run on some supercomputing cluster somwhere. Let\'s say you expect it to take 5 minutes to return your result. You could:Keep your design and run your program at night when you\'re asleep, so that you\'re not staring at the screen half the timeDesign your program to do other things while factorial is doing its thingIf you choose the second option, then callbacks might work for you.In order to exploit a callback pattern, what you want is to be able to call factorial in the following way:The second parameter, what_to_do_with_the_result, is a function you send along to factorial, in the hope that factorial will call it on its result before returning. Yes, this means that factorial needs to have been written to support callbacks.Now suppose that you want to be able to pass a parameter to your callback. Now you can\'t, because you\'re not going to be calling it, factorial is. So factorial needs to be written to allow you to pass your parameters in, and it will just hand them over to your callback when it invokes it. It might look like this:Now that factorial allows this pattern, your callback might look like this:and your call to factorial would be What if you want to return something from logIt? Well, you can\'t, because factorial isn\'t paying attention to it.Well, why can\'t factorial just return what your callback returns?Since execution is meant to be handed over to the callback when factorial is finished, it really shouldn\'t return anything to its caller. And ideally, it would somehow launch its work in another thread / process / machine and return immediately so that you can continue, maybe something like this:This is now an "asynchronous call", meaning that when you call it, it returns immediately but hasn\'t really done its job yet. So you do need mechanisms to check on it, and to obtain its result when its finished, and your program has gotten more complex in the process. And by the way, using this pattern the factorial_worker_task can launch your callback asynchronously and return immediately.The answer is to stay within the callback pattern. Whenever you want to writeand f is to be called asynchronously, you will instead writewhere g is passed as a callback. This fundamentally changes the flow-topology of your program, and takes some getting used to. Your programming language could help you a lot by giving you a way to create functions on-the-fly. In the code immediately above, the function g might be as small as print (2*a+1). If your language requires that you define this as a separate function, with an entirely unnecessary name and signature, then your life is going to get unpleasant if you use this pattern a lot. If, on the other hand, you language allows you to create lambdas, then you are in much better shape. You will then end up writing something likewhich is so much nicer.How would you pass the callback function to factorial? Well, you could do it in a number of ways. If the called function is running in the same process, you could pass a function pointerOr maybe you want to maintain a dictionary of fn name --> fn ptr in your program, in which case you could pass the nameMaybe your language allows you to define the function in-place, possible as a lambda! Internally it is creating some kind of object and passing a pointer, but you don\'t have to worry about that.Perhaps the function you are calling is running on an entirely separate machine, and you are calling it using a network protocol like HTTP. You could expose your callback as an HTTP-callable function, and pass its URL.You get the idea.In this web era we have entered, the services we invoke are often over the network. We often do not have any control over those services i.e. we didn\'t write them, we don\'t maintain them, we can\'t ensure they\'re up or how they\'re performing.But we can\'t expect our programs to block while we\'re waiting for these services to respond. Being aware of this, the service providers often design APIs using the callback pattern.JavaScript supports callbacks very nicely e.g. with lambdas and closures. And there is a lot of activity in the JavaScript world, both on the browser as well as on the server. There are even JavaScript platforms being developed for mobile.As we move forward, more and more of us will be writing asynchronous code, for which this understanding will be essential.Note that callback is one word.The wikipedia callback page explains it very well.quote from wikipedia page:In computer programming, a callback is a reference to executable code, or a piece of executable code, that is passed as an argument to other code. This allows a lower-level software layer to call a subroutine (or function) defined in a higher-level layer.A layman response would be that it is a function that is not called by you but rather by the user or by the browser after a certain event has happened or after some code has been processed.I believe this "callback" jargon has been mistakenly used in a lot of places. My definition would be something like:A callback function is a function that you pass to someone and let\n  them call it at some point of time.I think people just read the first sentence of the wiki definition:a callback is a reference to executable code, or a piece of\n  executable code, that is passed as an argument to other code.I\'ve been working with lots of APIs, see various of bad examples. Many people tend to name a function pointer (a reference to executable code) or anonymous functions(a piece of executable code) "callback", if they are just functions why do you need another name for this?Actually only the second sentence in wiki definition reveals the differences between a callback function and a normal function:This allows a lower-level software layer to call a subroutine (or\n  function) defined in a higher-level layer.so the difference is who you are going to pass the function and how your passed in function is going to be called. If you just define a function and pass it to another function and called it directly in that function body, don\'t call it a callback. The definition says your passed in function is gonna be called by "lower-level" function.I hope people can stop using this word in ambiguous context, it can\'t help people to understand better only worse.A callback function is one that should be called when a certain condition is met. Instead of being called immediately, the callback function is called at a certain point in the future.Typically it is used when a task is being started that will finish asynchronously (ie will finish some time after the calling function has returned).For example, a function to request a webpage might require its caller to provide a callback function that will be called when the webpage has finished downloading.Callbacks are most easily described in terms of the telephone system. A function call is analogous to calling someone on a telephone, asking her a question, getting an answer, and hanging up; adding a callback changes the analogy so that after asking her a question, you also give her your name and number so she can call you back with the answer. -- Paul Jakubik, "Callback Implementations in C++"Let\'s keep it simple. What is a call back function?Example by Parable and AnalogyI have a secretary. Everyday I ask her to: (i) drop off the firm\'s outgoing mail at the post office, and after she\'s done that, to do: (ii) whatever task I wrote for her on one of those sticky notes. Now, what is the task on the sticky-note? The task varies from day to day.Suppose on this particular day, I require her to print off some documents. So I write that down on the sticky note, and I pin it on her desk along with the outgoing mail she needs to post.In summary:The call back function is that second task: printing off those documents. Because it is done AFTER the mail is dropped off, and also because the sticky note telling her to print the document is given to her along with the mail she needs to most.Let\'s now tie this in with programming vocabularyThat\'s all it is. Nothing more. I hope that cleared it up for you - and if not, post a comment and I\'ll do my best to clarify.A callback function is a function you specify to an existing function/method, to be invoked when an action is completed, requires additional processing, etc.In Javascript, or more specifically jQuery, for example, you can specify a callback argument to be called when an animation has finished.In PHP, the preg_replace_callback() function allows you to provide a function that will be called when the regular expression is matched, passing the string(s) matched as arguments.Call After would be a better name than the stupid name, callback. When or if condition gets met within a function, call another function, the Call After function, the one received as argument. Rather than hard-code an inner function within a function, one writes a function to accept an already-written Call After function as argument. The Call After might get called based on state changes detected by code in the function receiving the argument.This makes callbacks sound like return statements at the end of methods.I\'m not sure that\'s what they are.I think Callbacks are actually a call to a function, as a consequence of another function being invoked and completing.I also think Callbacks are meant to address the originating invocation, in a kind of "hey! that thing you asked for? I\'ve done it - just thought I would let you know - back over to you".The simple answer to this  question is that a callback function is a function that is called through a function pointer. If you pass the pointer (address) of a function as an argument to another, when that pointer is used to call the function it points to it is said that a call back is madeAssume we have a function sort(int *arraytobesorted,void (*algorithmchosen)(void)) where it can accept a function pointer as its argument which can be used at some point in sort()\'s implementation . Then , here the code that is being addressed by the function pointer algorithmchosen is called as callback function .And see the advantage is that we can choose any algorithm like:Which were, say,have been implemented with the prototype:This is a concept used in achieving Polymorphism in Object Oriented Programminglook at the image :)Main program calls library function (which might be system level function also) with callback function name. This callback function might be implemented in multiple way. The main program choose one callback as per requirement. Finally, the library function calls the callback function during execution.\xe2\x80\x9cIn computer programming, a callback is a reference to executable code, or a piece of executable code, that is passed as an argument to other code. This allows a lower-level software layer to call a subroutine (or function) defined in a higher-level layer.\xe2\x80\x9d - WikipediaCallback in C using Function PointerIn C, callback is implemented using Function Pointer. Function Pointer - as the name suggests, is a pointer to a function.For example, int (*ptrFunc) ();Here, ptrFunc is a pointer to a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer. DO NOT forget to put in the parenthesis, otherwise the compiler will assume that ptrFunc is a normal function name, which takes nothing and returns a pointer to an integer.Here is some code to demonstrate the function pointer.Now let us try to understand the concept of Callback in  C using function pointer.The complete program has three files: callback.c, reg_callback.h and  reg_callback.c.If we run this program, the output will beThis is a program demonstrating function callback\ninside register_callback\ninside my_callback\nback inside main programThe higher layer function calls a lower layer function as a normal call and the callback mechanism allows the lower layer function to call the higher layer function through a pointer to a callback function.Callback in Java Using InterfaceJava does not have the concept of function pointer\nIt implements Callback mechanism through its Interface mechanism\nHere instead of a function pointer, we declare an Interface having a method which will be called when the callee finishes its taskLet me demonstrate it through an example:The Callback InterfaceThe Caller or the Higher  Level ClassThe Callee or the lower layer functionCallback Using EventListener patternThis pattern is used to notify 0 to n numbers of Observers/Listeners that a particular task has finishedThe difference between Callback mechanism and EventListener/Observer mechanism is that in callback, the callee notifies the single caller, whereas in Eventlisener/Observer, the callee can notify anyone who is interested in that event (the notification may go to some other parts of the application which has not triggered the task)Let me explain it through an example.The Event InterfaceClass WidgetClass ButtonClass CheckboxActivity Classpackage com.som_itsolutions.training.java.exampleeventlistener;Other ClassMain ClassAs you can see from the above code, that we have an interface called events which basically lists all the events that may happen for our application. The Widget class is the base class for all the UI components like Button, Checkbox. These UI components are the objects that actually receive the events from the framework code. Widget class implements the Events interface and also it has two nested interfaces namely OnClickEventListener & OnLongClickEventListenerThese two interfaces are responsible for listening to events that may occur on the Widget derived UI components like Button or Checkbox. So if we compare this example with the earlier Callback example using Java Interface, these two interfaces work as the Callback interface. So the higher level code (Here Activity) implements these two interfaces. And whenever an event occurs to a widget, the higher level code (or the method of these interfaces implemented in the higher level code, which is here Activity) will be called.Now let me discuss the basic difference between Callback and Eventlistener pattern. As we have mentioned that using Callback, the Callee can notify only a single Caller. But in the case of EventListener pattern, any other part or class of the Application can register for the events that may occur on the Button or Checkbox. The example of this kind of class is the OtherClass. If you see the code of the OtherClass, you will find that it has registered itself as a listener to the ClickEvent that may occur in the Button defined in the Activity. Interesting part is that, besides the Activity ( the Caller), this OtherClass will also be notified whenever the click event occurs on the Button. One important usage area is that you register one of your function as a handle (i.e. a callback) and then send a message / call some function to do some work or processing. Now after the processing is done, the called function would call our registered function (i.e. now call back is done), thus indicating us processing is done.  This wikipedia link explains quite well graphically. A callback function, also known as a higher-order function, is a function that is passed to another function as a parameter, and the callback function is called (or executed) inside the parent function.Here we have pass a function as a parameter to the click method. And the click method will call (or execute) the callback function we passed to it.What is callback?Phone Analogy: A telephone call made to return one that someone has called us.  A callback is a piece of executable code that is passed as an argument to other code, which is expected to call back (execute) the argument at some convenient time.  For more about callback on wiki What is a callback function?A callback function is a function that is passed to another function (let\'s call this other function otherFunction) as a parameter, and the callback function is called (or executed) inside the otherFunction.
