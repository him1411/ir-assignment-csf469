I\'d like to \'fake\' a 404 page in Rails. In PHP, I would just send a header with the error code as such:How is that done with Rails?Don\'t render 404 yourself, there\'s no reason to; Rails has this functionality built in already. If you want to show a 404 page, create a render_404 method (or not_found as I called it) in ApplicationController like this: Rails also handles AbstractController::ActionNotFound, and ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound the same way.This does two things better: 1) It uses Rails\' built in rescue_from handler to render the 404 page, and\n2) it interrupts the execution of your code, letting you do nice things like:without having to write ugly conditional statements.As a bonus, it\'s also super easy to handle in tests.  For example, in an rspec integration test:And minitest:To return a 404 header, just use the :status option for the render method.If you want to render the standard 404 page you can extract the feature in a method.and call it in your actionIf you want the action to render the error page and stop, simply use a return statement.Also remember that Rails rescues some ActiveRecord errors, such as the ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound displaying the 404 error page.It means you don\'t need to rescue this action yourselfUser.find raises an ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound when the user doesn\'t exist. This is a very powerful feature. Look at the following codeYou can simplify it by delegating to Rails the check. Simply use the bang version.The newly Selected answer submitted by Steven Soroka is close, but not complete.  The test itself hides the fact that this is not returning a true 404 - it\'s returning a status of 200 - "success".  The original answer was closer, but attempted to render the layout as if no failure had occurred.  This fixes everything:Here\'s a typical test set of mine for something I expect to return 404, using RSpec and Shoulda matchers:This healthy paranoia allowed me to spot the content-type mismatch when everything else looked peachy :) I check for all these elements: assigned variables, response code, response content type, template rendered, layout rendered, flash messages.I\'ll skip the content type check on applications that are strictly html...sometimes. After all, "a skeptic checks ALL the drawers" :)http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/1998-01-20/FYI: I don\'t recommend testing for things that are happening in the controller, ie "should_raise". What you care about is the output.  My tests above allowed me to try various solutions, and the tests remain the same whether the solution is raising an exception, special rendering, etc.The selected answer doesn\'t work in Rails 3.1+ as the error handler was moved to a middleware (see github issue).Here\'s the solution I found which I\'m pretty happy with.In ApplicationController:and in application.rb:And in my resources (show, edit, update, delete):This could certainly be improved, but at least, I have different views for not_found and internal_error without overriding core Rails functions. You could also use the render file:Where you can choose to use the layout or not.Another option is to use the Exceptions to control it:these will help you...Application Controller Errors controllerviews/errors/error_404.html.hamlTo test the error handling, you can do something like this:If you want to handle different 404s in different ways, consider catching them in your controllers. This will allow you to do things like tracking the number of 404s generated by different user groups, have support interact with users to find out what went wrong / what part of the user experience might need tweaking, do A/B testing, etc.I have here placed the base logic in ApplicationController, but it can also be placed in more specific controllers, to have special logic only for one controller.The reason I am using an if with ENV[\'RESCUE_404\'], is so I can test the raising of AR::RecordNotFound in isolation. In tests, I can set this ENV var to false, and my rescue_from would not fire. This way I can test the raising separate from the conditional 404 logic.just add this to the page you want to render to the 404 error page and you are done.
