What is the difference between dependencyManagement and dependencies?\nI have seen the docs at Apache Maven web site.\nIt seems that a dependency defined under the dependencyManagement can be used in it\'s child modules without specifying the version. For example:A parent project (Pro-par) defines a dependency under the dependencyManagement:Then in the child of Pro-par, I can use the junit :However I wonder if it is necessary to define junit in the parent pom? Why not define it directly in the needed module?Dependency Management allows to consolidate and centralize the management of dependency versions without adding dependencies which are inherited by all children. This is especially useful when you have a set of projects (i.e. more than one) that inherits a common parent.Another extremely important use case of dependencyManagement is the control of versions of artifacts used in transitive dependencies. This is hard to explain without an example. Luckily, this is illustrated in the documentation.I\'m fashionably late to this question, but I think it\'s worth a clearer response than the accepted one (which is correct, but doesn\'t emphasize the actual important part, which you need to deduce yourself). In the parent POM, the main difference between the <dependencies> and <dependencyManagement> is this:Artifacts specified in the <dependencies> section will ALWAYS be included as a dependency of the child module(s).Artifacts specified in the <dependencyManagement> section, will only be included in the child module if they were also specified in the <dependencies> section of the child module itself. Why is it good you ask? because you specify the version and/or scope in the parent, and you can leave them out when specifying the dependencies in the child POM. This can help you use unified versions for dependencies for child modules, without specifying the version in each child module.It\'s like you said; dependencyManagementis used to pull all the dependency information into a common POM file, simplifying the references in the child POM file. It becomes useful when you have multiple attributes that you don\'t want to retype in under multiple children projects.Finally, dependencyManagement can be used to define a standard version of an artifact to use across multiple projects.The documentation on the Maven site is horrible. What dependencyManagement does is simply move your dependency definitions (version, exclusions, etc) up to the parent pom, then in the child poms you just have to put the groupId and artifactId. That\'s it (except for parent pom chaining and the like, but that\'s not really complicated either - dependencyManagement wins out over dependencies at the parent level - but if have a question about that or imports, the Maven documentation is a little better). After reading all of the \'a\', \'b\', \'c\' garbage on the Maven site and getting confused, I re-wrote their example. So if you had 2 projects (proj1 and proj2) which share a common dependency (betaShared) you could move that dependency up to the parent pom. While you are at it, you can also move up any other dependencies (alpha and charlie) but only if it makes sense for your project. So for the situation outlined in the prior sentences, here is the solution with dependencyManagement in the parent pom:If the dependency was defined in the top-level pom\'s dependencyManagement element, the child project did not have to explicitly list the version of the dependency. if the child project did define a version, it would override the version listed in the top-level\nPOM\xe2\x80\x99s dependencyManagement section. That is, the dependencyManagement version is only\nused when the child does not declare a version directly.There are few answers oulining differences between <depedencies>/<dependencyManagement> tags with maven.However, few points elaborated below in a concise way:In Eclipse, there is one more feature in the dependencyManagement. When dependencies is used without it, the unfound dependencies are noticed in the pom file. If dependencyManagement is used, the unsolved dependencies remain unnoticed in the pom file and errors appear only in the java files. (imports and such...)If you have JUnit test cases defined in all child modules and you are using STS or eclipse then with just defining  eclipse will give errors for test cases.You need to add dependencies for junit outside  tag in parent module, so that you don\'t get any errors for test cases in eclipse. Although maven will still compile without having this sort of tag
