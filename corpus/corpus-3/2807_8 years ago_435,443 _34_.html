You can try thiswhen you useThis will not work in Chrome and Safari if the first option value is null.I preferbecause it can work in all browsers.Changing the value of the select input or adjusting the selected attribute can overwrite the default selectedOptions property of the DOM element, resulting in an element that may not reset properly in a form that has had the reset event called.  Use jQuery\'s prop method to clear and set the option needed:One subtle point I think I\'ve discovered about the top voted answers is that even though they correctly change the selected value, they do not update the  element that the user sees (only when they click the widget will they see a check next to the updated element).Chaining a .change() call to the end will also update the UI widget as well.(Note that I noticed this while using jQuery Mobile and a  box on Chrome desktop, so this may not be the case everywhere).If you have disabled option, you may add not([disabled]) to prevent selecting them which result into the following:Another way to reset the values (for multiple selected elements) could be this:I\'ve found that just setting attr selected doesn\'t work if there\'s already a selected attribute. The code I use now will first unset the selected attribute, then select the first option.$(\'#newType option:first\').prop(\'selected\', true)Simple like that: I know this question has been answered, but here is how I would do itAlthough the each function probably isn\'t necessary ...works for me.If you going to use the first option as a default likeThen you can just use. Nice and simple.use $("#selectbox option:first").val()Please find the working simple jsfiddlealert($( "#target option:first" ).text());On the back of James Lee Baker\'s reply, I prefer this solution as it removes the reliance on browser support for :first :selected ...It only worked for me using a trigger(\'change\') at the end, like this:worked fine in chromeIf you\'re storing the jQuery object of the select element:Check this best approach using jQuery with ES2015:Regards, NichollsFor me it only worked when I added the following code:.change();For me it only worked when I added the following code:\nAs I wanted to "reset" the form, that is, select all the first options of all the selects of the form, I used the following code:$(\'form\').find(\'select\').each(function(){\n     $(this).val($("select option:first").val());\n     $(this).change();\n });
