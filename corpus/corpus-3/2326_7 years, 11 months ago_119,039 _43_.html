Is there a way in Visual Studio 2008 to go from a closing brace to its opening brace?  I\'ve found a fair amount of stuff about highlighting the brace, but nothing about moving the cursor to it.I found this for you: Jump between braces in Visual StudioPut your cursor before or after the brace (your choice) and then press CTRL + ]. It works with either curly or round braces.  From now on you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to play Where\xe2\x80\x99s Waldo? to find that brace.Use CTRL + ] to switch between them. Place the cursor at one of the braces when using it.I use Visual Studio 2008, and you can customize what you want this shortcut to be.Click menu Tools -> Options -> Environment -> Keyboard. Then look for Edit.GotoBrace.This will tell you what key combination is currently assigned for this. I think you can change this if you want, but it\'s useful if the Ctrl + ] doesn\'t work.Note: It also works for #if / #elif / #endif matching. The caret must be on the #.On my French keyboard, it\'s CTRL + ^.If for some reason this is NOT working for you, something may have messed up your keyboard bindings (it didn\'t work for me).  You can re-enable the binding easy enough though - at least so I thought:I tried this procedure:I tried it, and it still didn\'t work. I restarted Visual Studio, and it still didn\'t work - well it ONLY worked for .cs files, but I need it to work for .vb files and text files, and...well ALL files!On a German keyboard it\'s Ctrl + \xc2\xb4.On a Spanish keyboard it is CTRL + \xc2\xbf (or CTRL + \xc2\xa1).On my Danish keyboard it\'s CTRL + \xc3\x85.On a Turkish keyboard, it is Ctrl + \xc3\xbc.For completeness sake, on a Swedish keyboard it\'s  CTRL  +  \xc3\xa5 .Also, I guess logical, but worth mentioning  CTRL  + shift +  \xc3\xa5  (for capital \xc3\x85), selects everything inside the braces and goes to the matching one.On my Portuguese keyboard and SO with EN VS, it\'s CTRL + \xc2\xab to navigate to matching brace and CTRL + SHIFT + \xc2\xab if you intend to select the inner code.On my Italian keyboard, it\'s CTRL + ^.On my pt-BR (Brazilian Portuguese) keyboard it is actually CTRL + [.And Ctrl + Shift + ] will select all of the text.On my Slovenian keyboard it is ALT    + \xc4\x90On my Dutch (Belgian) keyboard, it\'s CTRL + ^.Goto Tools > Options > Environment > Fonts and Colors, select the "Brace Matching (Rectangle)" and change the "Item Background" to e.g. Yellow. This worked for the C# parentheses () {} and [].On a Hungarian keyboard it is Ctrl + \xc3\xba.On the Swiss-French keyboard : use CTRL + SHIFT + ^On Spanish (Spain) keyboard with VS2012 is Ctrl + \xc2\xa1 as stated by @Keith but if you use Ctrl + \xc2\xbf (typed as Ctrl + Shift + \xc2\xa1) then goes to Matching Brace plus selects all the code within the two braces and then you can\'t go again to the other brace.A bit relevant, but for HTML tags: (since there is no built-in solution, Ctrl + J doesn\'t work for HTML tags : )Here is the answer as a macro which I\'ve built which does it (toggle), including go to focus:Here is the demo:And here is the code. Enjoy!On a German keyboard it\'s ctrl+shift+^.In Visual Studio Code on german keyboard it\'s ctrl+shift+^But you have to open a file with correct extension - it\'s not working in new unsaved files for example.In my case it\'s ctrl+shift+\\.The setting can be found in:File/Preferences/Keyboard ShortcutI am using Visual Studio Code 1.8.0Hope this helps someone. On a Mac use command+shift+\\.Source: a comment on this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/37877082/3345085.\nTested in Visual Studio Code version 1.10.2.
