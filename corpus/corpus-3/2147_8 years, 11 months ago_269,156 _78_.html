My current solution for renaming the project folder is:Is there any better way?TFS users: If you are using source control that requires you to warn it before your rename files/folders then look at this answer instead which covers the extra steps required.To rename a project\'s folder, file (.*proj) and display name in visual studio:Note: Other suggested solutions that involve removing and then re-adding the project to the solution will break project references.If you perform these steps then you might also consider renaming the following to match:Also consider modifying the values of the following assembly attributes:You may wish to vote for the Visual Studio team to automate this procedure. There is another way doing this, using the *.sol, *csproj files.it will be like this (relative to the *.sol file): Project("{FAE04EC0-301F-11D3-BF4B-00C04F79EFBC}") = "Shani.Commands.Impl", "Shani.Commands.Impl\\Shani.Commands.Impl.csproj", "{747CFA4B-FC83-419A-858E-5E2DE2B948EE}"and just change the first part to the new diretory for example:Impl\\Shani.Commands.Impl\\Shani.Commands.Impl.csprojof course don\'t forget to move the whole project to that directoryHave fun.Man, have I struggled with this. Unfortunately there isn\'t a one click solution in Visual Studio, but if you\'re running Visual Studio 2012 and your project is under source control with Team Foundation Server, here is how I got it to work, while keeping the source history:(Make sure you read @mjv\'s comment below, as he notes that you can skip step 5-10)The above guide worked for me. If it doesn\'t work for you, try and delete your local solution completely, and remove the folder mapping in your workspace. Restart Visual Studio just in case. Make sure you actually deleted the whole solution from your computer. Now readd the solution mapping to your workspace and get the latest version. Now try the above steps. The same applies if something goes wrong while following the above steps. Just delete your solution locally and get the latest source, and you\'ll have a clean slate to work with.If you\'re still having problems, make sure that you haven\'t changed anything manually in the solution file, or trying other \'tricks\' before trying the above steps. If you have changed something and checked it in, you might want to consider doing a rollback to the point just before you started messing with the renaming of the project.Of course, you\'d also want to rename the project itself, in Solution Explorer. You can do this before the steps above, but in that case, make sure you check in that change before applying the steps above. You can also do it afterwards, but make sure you follow all the steps above first, and check in your changes before trying to rename the project name in Solution Explorer. I don\'t recommend trying to mix the above steps with a rename of the project name in Solution Explorer. It might work though, but I would recommand doing it in 2 separate changesets.This is straight forward in VS 2015 (possibly works in older versions)Currently, no. Well, actually you can click the broken project node and in the properties pane look for the property \'Path\' then click the small browse icon and select the new path.Voila :)The simpler solution is the following:There are 4 needed steps but 7 recommended. At the end of the day though the project is renamed completely. Technically, the folder name for the project doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to match the project itself, so even that step is optional, but it can be confusing if they don\xe2\x80\x99t match. Same for the assembly and namespace names.In andersjanmyr\'s answer its easier to rename the project first.Also, after those steps are carried out you might want to rename other references to your old project name.In project properties, update the Assembly Name and Default Namespace.\nThis will update the following in the project file......and will get rid of the error "Namespace does not correspond to file location, should be: \'SomeProjectName\'"Rename your root namespace (if you have resharper right click the Namespace and go Refactor -> Rename).Change all occurences of your old project name in AssemblyInfo.csI just had to do this myself (using VS2010). As some folks have answered, the simplest step seems to be:See item 3 in linked article. \nIt worked for me.For VS2017 you can use my visual studio extensionhttps://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KuanyshNabiyev.FullRenameProjectIt will rename project in:Proven solution for Visual Studio extension for Data Tools for Business Intelligence (SSDT-BI 2013):Tested 100% and worked flawlessly on my case.NOTE: Can\'t confirm if it works under different project templates a/o Visual Studio versions. As always, do backup everything beforehand.@andersjanmyr\'s Solution: you may press Alt+Enter to bring up the Properties Page for the unavailable project and set the "File Path" property there; since it is not available in the right-click_context-menu of the unavailable project (in VS2008).I have written a small tool that automates all these steps. Also supports subversion for now. Information about current releases can be found here Visual Studio Project Renamer InfosLatests releases can now be downloaded from the Visual Studio Project Renamer Download PageFeedback is much appreciated.NOTE: This fix is for Visual Studio 2008, but should work here.DONE.When using TFS step 2 is actually to rename the folder in source control and then get the latest before reopening the solution.We recently uploaded a beta of an free VS extension which does this stuff for you.\nHave a look at VS Gallery: \nGallery DownloadWell I did it my wayAfter changing the folder name, open the .sln file in notepad and change the path to new path.Similar issues arise when a new project has to be created, and you want a different project folder name than the project name.When you create a new project, it gets stored atLet\'s assume you wanted to have it directly in the ject folder:My workaround to accomplish this is to create the project with the last part of the path as its name, so that it doesn\'t create an additional directory:When you now rename the project from within Visual Studio, you achieve the goal without having to leave VS:The downside of this approach is that you have to adjust the default namespace and the name of the Output binary as well, and that you have to update namespaces in all files that are included within the project template.I use VS 2013 and TFS 2013.I did it like this:There\'s a simpler approach which was tested in VS 2013 Update 1 and applicable for TFS-connected projects:The simplest way is to go to the property of the window change name of default namespaces then the rename is done 1-Rename the project outside VS.\n2-edit your_project_name.sln with a text editor, rename the path to the new pathI did the following:Rename the project from within vs2013. (optional/not needed)Export the project as a template. Close the solution.Reopen the solution Create a project from the saved template and use the name you like.Delete from the solution explorer the previous project.  In this point I tried to compile the new solution and to do so i had to manually copy some resources and headers to the new project folder from the old project folder. Do this until it compiles without errors. Now this new project saved the ".exe" file to the previous folder.* So ->Go to windows explorer and manually copy the solution file from the old project folder to the new project folder.Close the solution, and open the solution from within the new project.Changed the configuration back to (x64) if needed.Delete the folder of the project with the old name from the folder of the solution.Although this question has already been answered I wanted to share my approach to solving this problem. I often had the same problem of renaming a project in VS and editing the folder name, project name and .sln file in order to accomplish that. I just wrote a VBScript that accomplishes all that. You have to be careful with the strings you choose for replacing.EDIT: You just have to put the .vbs file in the same directory as the .sln file of the solution.
