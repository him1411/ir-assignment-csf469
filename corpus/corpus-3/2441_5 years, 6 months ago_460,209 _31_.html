I have a byte array filled with hex numbers and printing it the easy way is pretty pointless because there are many unprintable elements. What I need is the exact hexcode in the form of: 3a5f771cFrom the discussion here, and especially this answer, this is the function I currently use:My own tiny benchmarks (a million bytes a thousand times, 256 bytes 10 million times) showed it to be much faster than any other alternative, about half the time on long arrays.  Compared to the answer I took it from, switching to bitwise ops --- as suggested in the discussion --- cut about 20% off of the time for long arrays. (Edit: When I say it\'s faster than the alternatives, I mean the alternative code offered in the discussions. Performance is equivalent to Commons Codec, which uses very similar code.)The Apache Commons Codec library has a Hex class for doing just this type of work.Use DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(). You can read its documentation in http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/xml/bind/DatatypeConverter.htmlFor example:Will result in:As you can see this will retrieve the hexadecimal string representing the array of bytes with leading zeros.This answer is basically the same as in the question In Java, how do I convert a byte array to a string of hex digits while keeping leading zeros?Simplest solution, no external libs, no digits constants:This simple oneliner works for me\n    String result = new BigInteger(1, inputBytes).toString(16);  \nEDIT - Using this will remove the leading zeros, but hey worked for my use-case. Thanks @Voicu for pointing it outA Guava solution, for completeness:Now hex is "48656c6c6f20776f726c64".I found three different ways here:\nhttp://www.rgagnon.com/javadetails/java-0596.htmlThe most elegant one, as he also notes, I think is this one:Use DataTypeConverter classjavax.xml.bind.DataTypeConverterString hexString = DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(bytes[] raw);At the minor cost of storing the lookup table this implementation is simple and very fast.How about this?I would use something like this for fixed length, like hashes:I prefer to use this:It is slightly more flexible adaptation of the accepted answer.\nPersonally, I keep both the accepted answer and this overload along with it, usable in more contexts.I usually use the following method for debuf statement, but i don\'t know if it is the best way of doing it or notOk so there are a bunch of ways to do this, but if you decide to use a library I would suggest poking about in your project to see if something has been implemented in a library that is already part of your project before adding a new library just to do this.  For example if you don\'t already have org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Hexmaybe you do have...org.apache.xerces.impl.dv.util.HexBinA small variant of the solution proposed by @maybewecouldstealavan, which lets you visually bundle N bytes together in the output hex string:That is:// Shifting bytes is more efficient\n// You can use this one too If you\'re looking for a byte array exactly like this for python, I have converted this Java implementation into python.
