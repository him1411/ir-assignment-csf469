I\'m trying out Git on Windows. I got to the point of trying "git commit" and I got this error:Terminal is dumb but no VISUAL nor\n  EDITOR defined. Please supply the\n  message using either -m or -F option.So I figured out I need to have an environment variable called EDITOR. No problem. I set it to point to Notepad. That worked, almost. The default commit message opens in Notepad. But Notepad doesn\'t support bare line feeds. I went out and got Notepad++, but I can\'t figure out how to get Notepad++ set up as the %EDITOR% in such a way that it works with Git as expected.I\'m not married to Notepad++. At this point I don\'t mind what editor I use. I just want to be able to type commit messages in an editor rather than the command line (with -m).Those of you using Git on Windows: What tool do you use to edit your commit messages, and what did you have to do to make it work?Update September 2015 (6 years later)The last release of git-for-Windows (2.5.3) now includes:By configuring git config core.editor notepad, users can now use notepad.exe as their default editor.\n  Configuring git config format.commitMessageColumns 72 will be picked up by the notepad wrapper and line-wrap the commit message after the user edits it.See commit 69b301b by Johannes Schindelin (dscho).Original answerI just tested it with git version 1.6.2.msysgit.0.186.gf7512 and Notepad++5.3.1I prefer to not have to set an EDITOR variable, so I tried:That always gives:If I define a npp.bat including:and I type:It just works from the DOS session, but not from the git shell.\n(not that with the core.editor configuration mechanism, a script with "start /WAIT..." in it would not work, but only open a new DOS window)Bennett\'s answer mentions the possibility to avoid adding a script, but to reference directly the program itself between simple quotes:Or if you are in a 64 bit system:But I prefer using a script (see below): that way I can play with different paths or different options without having to register again a git config.The actual solution (with a script) was to realize that:\nwhat you refer to in the config file is actually a shell (/bin/sh) script, not a DOS script.So what does work is:with C:/prog/git/npp.bat:orWith that setting, I can do \'git config --global --edit\' from DOS or Git Shell, or I can do \'git rebase -i ...\' from DOS or Git Shell.\nBot commands will trigger a new instance of notepad++ (hence the -multiInst\' option), and wait for that instance to be closed before going on.Note that I use only \'/\', not \\\'. And I installed msysgit using option 2. (Add the git\\bin directory to the PATH environment variable, but without overriding some built-in windows tools)The fact that the notepad++ wrapper is called .bat is not important.\nIt would be better to name it \'npp.sh\' and to put it in the [git]\\cmd directory though (or in any directory referenced by your PATH environment variable).See also:lightfire228 adds in the comments:For anyone having an issue where N++ just opens a blank file, and git doesn\'t take your commit message, see "Aborting commit due to empty message": change your .bat or .sh file to say:That will tell notepad++ to open the temp commit file, rather than a blank new one.Building on Darren\'s answer, to use Notepad++ you can simply do this (all on one line):On 32 bit OS:\ngit config --global core.editor "\'C:/Program Files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe\' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"On 64 bit OS\ngit config --global core.editor "\'C:/Program Files (x86)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe\' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"Obviously the C:/Program Files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe part should be the path to the Notepad++ executable on your system. For example, on Windows 7 it\'s likely to be C:/Program Files (x86)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe . Thanks to the commenters for pointing this out.Works like a charm for me.Anyway, I\'ve just been playing around with this and found the following to work nicely for me:I don\'t think CMD likes single-quotes so you must use double quotes "to specify the space embedded string argument".Cygwin (which I believe is the underlying platform for Git\'s Bash) on the other hand likes both \' and "; you can specify a CMD-like paths, using / instead of \\, so long as the string is quoted i.e. in this instance, using single-quotes.The -m overrides/indicates the use of multiple editors and there is no need for a %* tacked on the end.Edit: After updating to vim 7.3, I\'ve come to the conclusion that the cleanest and easiest way to do this is:Add Vim\'s main folder to your path (Right click on My Computer -> Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables)Run this:git config --global core.editor "gvim --nofork \'%*\'"If you do it this way, then I am fairly sure it will work with cygwin as well. Original answer:Even with a couple of vim-related answers, I was having trouble getting this to work with gvim under Windows (while not using a batch file or %EDITOR% or cygwin).What I eventually arrived at is nice and clean, and draws from a few of the solutions here:One gotcha that took me a while is these are not the Windows-style backslashes, they are normal forward slashes.Notepad++ works just fine, although I choose to stick with Notepad, -m, or even sometimes the built-in "edit."The problem you are encountering using Notepad++ is related to how git is launching the editor executable.  My solution to this is to set EDITOR to a batch file, rather than the actual editor executable, that does the following:/WAIT tells the command line session to halt until the application exits, thus you will be able to edit to your heart\'s content while git happily waits for you.  %* passes all arguments to the batch file through to Notepad++.Wordpad! I\'m happy using vim, but since I\'m trying to introduce Git to the company I wanted something that we\'d all have, and found that Wordpad seems to work okay (i.e. Git does wait until you\'re finished editing and close the window).That\'s using Git Bash on msysgit; I\'ve not tried from the Windows command prompt (if that makes any difference).I also use Cygwin on Windows, but with gvim (as opposed to the terminal-based vim).To make this work, I have done the following:With this done, git commit, etc. will correctly invoke the gvim executable.NOTE 1: The --nofork option to gvim insures that it blocks until the commit message has been written.NOTE 2: The quotes around the path to gvim is required if you have spaces in the path.NOTE 3: The quotes around "%*" are needed just in case git passes a file path with spaces.Thanks to the SO community ... and a little research I was able to get my favorite editor,  EditPadPro,\nto work as the core editor with msysgit 1.7.5.GIT and TortoiseGit v1.7.3.0 over WinXP SP3 ... Following the advice above I added the path to a bash script for the code editor ... However after several failed attempts at the above mentioned solutions ... I was finally able to get this working. Per EditPadPro\'s documentation, adding the \'/newinstance\' flag would allow the shell to wait for the editor input ....     The \'/newinstance\' flag was the key in my case  ... Vim/Gvim works well for me.This is the 1 symptom of greater issues. Notably that you have something setting TERM=dumb. Other things that don\'t work properly are the less command which says you don\'t have a fully functional terminal. It seems like this is most commonly caused by having TERM set to something in your global windows environment variables. For me, the issue came up when I installed Strawberry Perl some info about this is on the msysgit bug for this problem as well as several solutions.The first solution is to fix it in your ~/.bashrc by adding:You can do this from the Git BASH prompt like so:The other solution which ultimately is what I did because I don\'t care about Strawberry Perl\'s reasons for adding TERM=dumb to my environment settings is to go and remove the TERM=dumb as directed in this comment on the msysgit bug report.Control\n  Panel/System/Advanced/Environment\n  Variables... (or similar, depending on\n  your  version of Windows) is where\n  sticky environment variables are set\n  on Windows. By  default, TERM is not\n  set. If TERM is set in there, then you\n  (or one of the programs  you have\n  installed - eg. Strawberry Perl) has\n  set it. Delete that setting, and you \n  should be fine.Similarly if you use Strawberry Perl and care about the CPAN client or something like that, you can leave the TERM=dumb alone and use unset TERM in your ~/.bashrc file which will have a similar effect to setting an explicit term as above.Of course all the other solutions are correct that you can use git config --global core.editor $MYFAVORITEEDITOR to make sure that git uses your favorite editor when it needs to launch one for you.I had PortableGit 1.6 working fine but after upgrading to PortableGit-1.7 windows release had problems. Some of the git commands opens up Notepad++.exe fine but some don\'t, especially git rebase behaves differently. Problem is some commands run windows cmd process some use unix cmd process. I want to give startup attributes to Notepad++ editor so need to have a customized script. My solution is this.1) Create a script to run an appropriate text editor. Script looks weird but handles both windows and unix variation.\nc:/PortableGit/cmd/git-editor.bat2) Set global core.editor variable\nScript was saved to git/cmd folder so its already in a gitconsole path, this is mandatory as full path may not work properly.Now I can run git commit -a and git rebase -i master commands. Give it a try if you have problems in Git windows tool.I use git on multiple platforms, and I like to use the same git settings on all of them. (In fact, I have all my configuration files under release control with git, and put a git repository clone on each machine.) The solution I came up with is this:I set my editor to giteditorThen I create a symbolic link called giteditor which is in my PATH. (I have a personal bin directory, but anywhere in the PATH works.) That link point to my current editor of choice. On different machines and different platforms, I use different editors, so this means that I don\'t have to change my universal git configuration (.gitconfig), just the link that giteditor points to.Symbolic links are handled by every operating system I know of, though they may use different commands. For Linux, you use ln -s. For Windows, you use the cmd built-in mklink. They have different syntaxes (which you should look up), but it all works the same way, really.This is my setup to use Geany as an editor for git:with the following content in geany.bat :It works in both DOS console and msysgit.I\'ve had difficulty getting git to cooperate with wordpad, KomodoEdit and pretty much every other editor I give it. Most open for editing, but git clearly doesn\'t wait for the save/close to happen. As a crutch, I\'ve just been doing i.e.to keep things moving. Tends to keep my commit messages a little shorter than they probably should be, but clearly there\'s some work to be done on the Windows version of git.The GitGUI also isn\'t that bad. It takes a little bit of orientation, but after that, it works fairly well.I use Cygwin on Windows, so I use:The -nw is for no-windows, i.e. tell Emacs not to try and use X11.The Emacs keybindings don\'t work for me from a Windows shell, so I would only use this from a Cygwin shell... (rxvt recommended.)Based on VonC suggestion above, this worked for me (was driving me crazy):Omitting -wait can cause problems especially if you are working with gerrit and change ids that have to be manually copied to the bottom of your commit messageFor Atom you can doand similar for VSCodewhich will open up an Atom or VSCode window for you to commit through, or for SublimeIt seems as if Git won\'t find the editor if there are spaces in the path. So you will have to put the batch file mentioned in Patrick\'s answer into a non-whitespace path.I prefer to use emacs.  Getting it set up can be a little tricky.Git will now open files within an existing emacs process.  You will have to run that existing process manually from c:\\emacs\\bin\\runemacs.exe.Edit .gitconfig file in c:\\Users\\YourUser folder and add:I\'ve just had the same problem and found a different solution. I was getting I\'ve got VISUAL=ec, and a batch file called ec.bat on my path that contains one line:This lets me edit files from the command line with ec <filename>, and having visual set means most unixy programs pick it up too. Git seems to search the path differently to my other commands though -  when I looked at a git commit in ProcMon I saw it look in every folder on the path for ec and for ec.exe, but not for ec.bat. I added another environment variable  (GIT_EDITOR=ec.bat) and all was fine.I managed to get the environment version working by setting the EDITOR variable using quotes and /:I\'m using GitHub for Windows which is a nice visual option. But I also prefer the command line, so to make it work when I open a repo in a Git shell I just set the following:which works great.This works for Powershell and cmder-1.2 (when used with powershell). In ~/.gitconfigHow can I make Sublime Text the default editor for Git?Resurrecting an old thread, but I found a a beautifully simple solution posted here - although there may be a mistake in the path in which you have to copy over the "subl" file given by the author. I am running Win 7 x64 and I had to put the "subl" file in my /Git/cmd/ folder to make it work. It works like a charm though.Typed this in the git bash:git config --global core.editor C:/Users/YOURNAMEUSER/AppData/Local/atom/app-1.7.4/atom.exe"Note: I changed all \\ for / . I created a .bashrc at my home directory and used / to set my home directory and it worked, so i assumed / will be the way to go.  atom-editor git git-bash windows-10When using a remotely mounted homedrive (samba share, nfs, ...) your ~/.git folder is shared acros all systems which can lead to several problems. Thus I prefer a script to determine the right editor for the right system:One might consider a plain shell script but I used perl as is perl is shipped with msysgit und your unixoid systems will provide one as well.\nPutting the script in /home/username/bin, which should be added to PATH in .bashrc or .profile. Once added with git config --global core.editor giteditor.pl you have the right editor, wherever you are.This is working for me using Cygwin and Textpad 6 (EDIT: also working with Textpad 5 as long as you make the obvious change to the script), and presumably the model could be used for other editors as well:~/.gitconfig:~/script/textpad.shThis one-liner works as well:~/script/textpad.sh (option 2):Here is a solution with Cygwin:If no path, pass no pathIf path is empty, pass empty pathIf path is not empty, convert to Windows format.Then I set these variables:EDITOR allows script to work with GitGIT_EDITOR allows script to work with Hub commandsSourceI just use TortoiseGit straight out the box. Integrates beautifully with my PuTTY public keys. Has a perfect editor for commit messages.
