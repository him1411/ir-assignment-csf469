What\'s the best tool for viewing and editing a merge in Git? I\'d like to get a 3-way merge view, with "mine", "theirs" and "ancestor" in separate panels, and a fourth "output" panel.Also, instructions for invoking said tool would be great. (I still haven\'t figure out how to start kdiff3 in such a way that it doesn\'t give me an error.)My OS is Ubuntu.Meld is a good diff/merge tool.Here\'s how to install it on:You can configure your own merge tool to be used with "git mergetool".Example:And while you are at it, you can also set it up as your difftool for "git difftool":Note that in Unix/Linux you don\'t want the $BASE to get parsed as a variable by your shell - it should actually appear in your ~/.gitconfig file for this to work.Beyond Compare 3, my favorite, has a merge functionality in the Pro edition. The good thing with its merge is that it let you see all 4 views: base, left, right, and merged result. It\'s somewhat less visual than P4V but way more than WinDiff. It integrates with many source control and works on Windows/Linux. It has many features like advanced rules, editions, manual alignment...The Perforce Visual Client (P4V) is a free tool that provides one of the most explicit interface for merging (see some screenshots). Works on all major platforms. My main disappointement with that tool is its kind of "read-only" interface. You cannot edit manually the files and you cannot manually align.PS: P4Merge is included in P4V. Perforce tries to make it a bit hard to get their tool without their client.SourceGear Diff/Merge may be my second free tool choice. Check that merge screens-shot and you\'ll see it\'s has the 3 views at least.Meld is a newer free tool that I\'d prefer to SourceGear Diff/Merge: Now it\'s also working on most platforms (Windows/Linux/Mac) with the distinct advantage of natively supporting some source control like Git. So you can have some history diff on all files much simpler. The merge view (see screenshot) has only 3 panes, just like SourceGear Diff/Merge. This makes merging somewhat harder in complex cases.PS: If one tool one day supports 5 views merging, this would really be awesome, because if you cherry-pick commits in Git you really have not one base but two. Two base, two changes, and one resulting merge.My favorite visual merge tool is SourceGear DiffMergeI hear good things about kdiff3, seems to be between that and meld (which another poster already suggested).You can try P4Merge.Visualize the differences between file versions with P4Merge. Resolve conflicts that result from parallel or concurrent development via color coding.The features includes:vimdiffOnce you have have learned vim (and IMHO you should), vimdiff is just one more beautiful little orthogonal concept to learn.  To get online help in vim:If you\'re stuck in the dark ages of mouse usage, and the files you\'re merging aren\'t very large, I recommend meld.  Diffuse is my favourite but of course I am biased. :-)  It is very easy to use:Diffuse is a small and simple text merge tool written in Python. With Diffuse, you can easily merge, edit, and review changes to your code. Diffuse is free software.Araxis Merge http://www.araxis.com/\nI\'m using it on Mac OS X but I\'ve used it on windows... it\'s not free... but it has some nice features... nicer on windows though.If you are just looking for a diff tool beyond compare is pretty nice: http://www.scootersoftware.com/moreinfo.phpYou can change the tool used by git mergetool by passing git mergetool -t=<tool> or --tool=<tool>. To change the default (from vimdiff) use git config merge.tool <tool>.IntelliJ IDEA has a sophisticated merge conflict resolution tool with the Resolve magic wand, which greatly simplifies merging:You can install ECMerge diff/merge tool on your Linux, Mac or Windows. It is pre-configured in Git, so just using git mergetool will do the job.If you do use visual studio, Team Explorer built in tool is a very nice tool  to resolve git merge conflicts.So for the git merge, you can try:DiffMerge to visually compare and merge files on Windows, OS X and Linux.Meld, is a visual diff and merge tool.gitx http://gitx.frim.nl/Some bugs when working with large commit sets but great for browsing through changes and picking different changes to stage and then commit.
