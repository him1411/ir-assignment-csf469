How do I make the background of a Textview about 20% transparent (not fully transparent), where there is a color in the background (i.e. white)?Make the color have 80% in the alpha channel. For example, for red use #CCFF0000:In the example, CC is the hexadecimal number for 255 * 0.8 = 204. Note that the first two hexadecimal digits are for the alpha channel. The format is #AARRGGBB, where AA is the alpha channel, RR is the red channel, GG is the green channel and BB is the blue channel.I\'m assuming that 20% transparent means 80% opaque. If you meant the other way, instead of CC use 33 which is the hexadecimal for 255 * 0.2 = 51.In order to calculate the proper value for an alpha transparency value you can follow this procedure:You can take a look at the Android documentation for colors.Use the below code for black:Now if I want to use opacity then you can use the below code:  And below for opacity code:Use a color with an alpha value like #33------, and set it as background of your editText using the XML attribute android:background=" ".255 * 0.2 = 51 \xe2\x86\x92 in hex 33You can manage color opacity changing the first 2 characters in the color definition:#99000000    You can try to do something like:Here you can set the opacity between 0 (fully transparent) to 255 (completely opaque). The 51 is exactly the 20% you  want.In Android Studio there is a built-in tool to adjust the color and alpha/opacity value:I have taken three Views. In the first view I set full (no alpha) color, on the second view I set half (0.5 alpha) color, and on the third view I set light color (0.2 alpha).You can set any color and get color with alpha by using the below code:DoneThere is an XML value alpha that takes double values. Since API 11+ the range is from 0f to 1f (inclusive), 0f being transparent and 1f being opaque:android:alpha="0.0" thats invisibleandroid:alpha="0.5" see-throughandroid:alpha="1.0" full visibleThat\'s how it works.Alpha ranges between 0(transparent) and 1(opaque) in Android API 11+Here\'s a programmatic solution from @Aromero\'s answer to calculate the hexadecimal value for the alpha channel. :)See Popularity below textView using this        XMLDynamicallybtn.getBackground().setAlpha(128);  // 50% transparenttv_name.getBackground().setAlpha(128);  // 50% transparentandroid:alpha="0.38"
