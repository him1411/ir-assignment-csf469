What is the difference between the Builder design pattern and the Factory design pattern? Which one is more advantageous and why ? How do I represent my findings as a graph if I want to test and compare/contrast these patterns ?With design patterns, there usually is no "more advantageous" solution that works for all cases. It depends on what you need to implement.From Wikipedia: Wikipedia entry for factory design pattern:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_patternWikipedia entry for builder design pattern:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_patternThe Factory pattern can almost be seen as a simplified version of the Builder pattern.In the Factory pattern, the factory is in charge of creating various subtypes of an object depending on the needs.The user of a factory method doesn\'t need to know the exact subtype of that object. An example of a factory method createCar might return a Ford or a Honda typed object.In the Builder pattern, different subtypes are also created by a builder method, but the composition of the objects might differ within the same subclass.To continue the car example you might have a createCar builder method which creates a Honda-typed object with a 4 cylinder engine, or a Honda-typed object with 6 cylinders. The builder pattern allows for this finer granularity.Diagrams of both the Builder pattern and the Factory method pattern are available on Wikipedia.A factory is simply a wrapper function around a constructor (possibly one in a different class). The key difference is that a factory method pattern requires the entire object to be built in a single method call, with all the parameters pass in on a single line. The final object will be returned.A builder pattern, on the other hand, is in essence a wrapper object around all the possible parameters you might want to pass into a constructor invocation. This allows you to use setter methods to slowly build up your parameter list. One additional method on a builder class is a build() method, which simply passes the builder object into the desired constructor, and returns the result.In static languages like Java, this becomes more important when you have more than a handful of (potentially optional) parameters, as it avoids the requirement to have telescopic constructors for all the possible combinations of parameters. Also a builder allows you to use setter methods to define read-only or private fields that cannot be directly modified after the constructor has been called.Basic Factory ExampleBasic Builder ExampleIt may be worth comparing the code samples from these two wikipedia pages:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_patternThe builder design pattern describes an object that knows how to craft another object of a specific type over several steps.  It holds the needed state for the target item at each intermediate step. Think what StringBuilder goes through to produce a final string.The factory design pattern describes an object that knows how to create several different but related kinds of object in one step, where the specific type is chosen based on given parameters. Think of the serialization system, where you create your serializer and it constructs the desired in object all in one load call.Constructing a complex object step by step : builder patternA simple object is created by using a single method : factory method patternCreating Object by using multiple factory method : Abstract factory patternBoth are Creational patterns, to create Object.1) Factory Pattern - Assume, you have one super class and N number of sub classes.\n    The object is created depends on which parameter/value is passed.2) Builder pattern - to create complex object.First some general things to follow my argumentation:The main challenge in designing big software systems is that they have to be flexible and uncomplicated to change. For this reason, there are some metrics like coupling and cohesion. To achieve systems that can be easily altered or extended in its functionality without the need to redesign the whole system from scratch, you can follow the design principles (like SOLID, etc.). After a while some developer recognized that if they follow those principles there are some similar solutions that worked well to similar problems. Those standard solutions turned out to be the design patterns.So the design patterns are to support you to follow the general design principles in order to achieve loosely coupled systems with high cohesion.Answering the question:By asking the difference between two patterns you have to ask yourself what pattern makes your system in which way more flexible. Each pattern has its own purpose to organize dependencies between classes in your system.The Abstract Factory Pattern:\nGoF: \xe2\x80\x9cProvide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.\xe2\x80\x9dWhat does this mean:\nBy providing an interface like this the call to the constructor of each of the family\xe2\x80\x99s product is encapsulated in the factory class. And because this is the only place in your whole system where those constructors are called you can alter your system by implementing a new factory class. If you exchange the representation of the factory through another, you can exchange a whole set of products without touching the majority of your code.The Builder Pattern:\nGoF: \xe2\x80\x9cSeparate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.\xe2\x80\x9dWhat does this mean:\nYou encapsulate the process of construction in another class, called the director (GoF). This director contains the algorithm of creating new instances of the product (e.g. compose a complex product out of other parts). To create the integral parts of the whole product the director uses a builder. By exchanging the builder in the director you can use the same algorithm to create the product, but change the representations of single parts (and so the representation of the product). To extend or modify your system in the representation of the product, all you need to do is to implement a new builder class.So in short:\nThe Abstract Factory Pattern\xe2\x80\x99s purpose is to exchange a set of products which are made to be used together. The Builder Pattern\xe2\x80\x99s purpose is to encapsulate the abstract algorithm of creating a product to reuse it for different representations of the product.In my opinion you can\xe2\x80\x99t say that the Abstract Factory Pattern is the big brother of the Builder Pattern. YES, they are both creational patterns, but the main intent of the patterns is entirely different.One striking difference between Builder & factory which I could make out was the followingsuppose we have a carIn the above interface we can get car by the following way :but what if, some exception happens while creating the Seats ???\nYOU WILL NOT GET THE OBJECT AT ALL //\nBUTsuppose you have implementation like the following Now you can create like this Here in the second case , even if one operation fails you would still get the Car.May be that car does not works perfectly later but , you would have the object.Because Factory Method gives you the Car in single call , whereas the Builder builds one by one.Although, It depends on the needs of the deign which one to go for.This is a creational pattern as it is used to control class instantiation. The builder pattern is used to create complex objects with constituent parts that must be created in the same order or using a specific algorithm. An external class, known as the director, controls the construction algorithm.Sample Abstract Factory & Builder pattern are both Creational patterns but with different intent.Abstract Factory Pattern emphasizes object creation for families of related objects where:Builder pattern focuses on constructing a complex object step by step. \nIt decouples the representation from the process of constructing the complex object, so that the same construction process can be used for different representations.Builder and Abstract Factory have meant for different purposes. Depending on right use case, you have to select suitable design pattern. Builder salient features:Factory (simple Factory) salient features:Often, designs start out using Factory Method (less complicated, more customizable, subclasses proliferate) and evolve toward Abstract Factory, Prototype, or Builder (more flexible, more complex) Have a look at related SE documentation linksbuilder-pattern-in-java-with-compositionfactory-example-by-implementing-factory-methodYou can refer to below articles for more details:sourcemakingjournaldevBoth are very much similar , but if you have a large number of parameters for object creation with some of them optional with some default values , go for Builder pattern.Build pattern emphasizes on complexity  of creating object (solved by "steps")Abstract pattern emphasizes "just" on "abstraction" of (multiple but related) objects.Difference is clear\n In builder pattern, builder will create specific type of object for you. You have to tell what\nbuilder has to build.\n In factory pattern , using abstract class you are directly building the specific object.Here builder class acts as mediator between main class and specific type classes.\n More abstraction.I believe, the usage of and the difference between Factory & Builder patterns can be understood/clarified easier in a certain time period as you worked on the same code base and changing requirements. From my experience, usually, you start with a Factory pattern including couple of static creator methods. As your object hierarchy gets more complex (or as you add more types), you probably end up with having your methods populated with more parameters and not to mention you gonna have to recompile your Factory module. All those stuff, increases the complexity of your creator methods, decreases the readability and makes the creation module more fragile.This point possibly will be the transition point. Transition from Factory to Builder pattern. By doing so, you create a wrapper module around the construction parameters and then you will be able represent new (similar) objects by adding some more abstractions(perhaps) and implementations without touching actual your creation logic. So you\'ve had less complex logic and re-compiled source codeFrankly, referring to something sort of "having an object created in one-step or multiple steps is the difference" as the sole diversity factor was not sufficient for me to distinguish them since I could use both ways for almost all cases I faced up to now without experiencing any benefit. So this is what I\'ve finally thought about it.Abstract factory is similar to builder in that it too may construct complex objects.  The primary difference is that the Builder pattern focuses on constructing a complex object step by step.  Abstract factor\'s emphasis is on families of product objects(either simple or complex).  Builder and Abstract FactoryThe Builder design pattern is very similar, at some extent, to the Abstract Factory pattern. That\'s why it is important to be able to make the difference between the situations when one or the other is used. In the case of the Abstract Factory, the client uses the factory\'s methods to create its own objects. In the Builder\'s case, the Builder class is instructed on how to create the object and then it is asked for it, but the way that the class is put together is up to the Builder class, this detail making the difference between the two patterns.Common interface for productsIn practice the products created by the concrete builders have a structure significantly different, so if there is not a reason to derive different products a common parent class. This also distinguishes the Builder pattern from the Abstract Factory pattern which creates objects derived from a common type.From: http://www.oodesign.com/builder-pattern.htmlIn my opinion \nBuilder pattern is used when you want to create an object from a bunch of other objects and creation of part needs to be independent of the object you want to create. It helps to hide the creation of part from the client to make builder and client independent. It is used for complex objects creation (objects which may consists of complicated properties)While factory pattern specifies that you want to create objects of a common family and you want it to be cerated at once. It is used for simpler objects. Factory pattern creates a concrete implementation of a class at runtime, i.e its main intention is to use polymorphism to allow subclasses decide which class to instantiate. This means at compile time we dont know the exact class that will be created, while Builder pattern is mainly concerned with solving the problem of telescoping constructors antipattern, which arises due to a large number of optional fields of a class. In builder pattern there is no notion of polymorphism, as we know what object we are trying to construct at compile time.The only common theme of these two patterns is the hiding of constructors and object creation behind factory methods, and the build method, for improved object construction.Factory pattern let you create an object at once at once while builder pattern let you break the creation process of an object. In this way, you can add different functionality during the creation of an object. Both patterns come for the same necessity: Hide from some client code the construction logic of a complex object...but what makes "complex" (or, sometimes, complicate) an object? Mainly, it\'s due to dependencies, or rather the state of an object composed by more partial states. You can inject dependencies by constructor to set the initial object state, but an object may require a lot of them, some will be in a default initial state (just because we should have learned that set a default dependecy to null is not the cleanest way) and some other set to a state driven by some condition. Moreover, there are object properties that are some kind of "oblivious dependencies" but also them can assume optional statesthere are two well known ways to dominate that complexity:Nothing prevents to mix these two approaches. A family of product could abstract object creation done with a builder, a builder could use factories to determine which component object instantiateAn example1) using abstract factory:2) using builder:As there is no WindowsButton class, he (the builder) must be in charge of correctly building the button, ie: button.setOS = windows.It is similar to comparing TPH vs TPT in db design.
