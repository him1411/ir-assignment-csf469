I don\'t know why this question is bugging me, but time after time I come back to the thought - why not make websites in C++? So far I know of none (except a rumor about Yahoo). Most use PHP, Java or ASP.NET. Some are built on Ruby or Python, but even those are minorities.At the same time, looking at StackOverflow, it seems that C++ is still a very popular language with many projects written in it. Why not for webpages?So - what do you know about this subject? Are there any websites written in C++? Are there any frameworks/libraries that help doing this? Have YOU ever done it? If yes, did you run into any fundamental problems and would you recommend this to others?I am primarily a C++ programmer, so I don\'t intend it as a slam on C++ when I say C# and Java are much more modern languages, better suited for 99% of application development you want to do.  The downside of C#/Java/etc. is that the users need big bulky runtimes installed on their PCs, and if your users don\'t have them then they will have to install them.  So it is usually better to write consumer apps in C++, where there will be few dependencies and Grandma won\'t have to figure out how to install .NET framework 3.0.For web applications, your user will just be using a web browser so you can write in whatever language platform you want.  So why not write in a modern, better language?(again, before C++ programmers jump all over me, let me say that I have been a primarily C++ programmer for 15+ years.  It\'d be silly to ignore that modern languages are far easier and better for most application development.)Simply, I have gained a lot of interest in C++ after realizing the performance problem with PHP. (I am primarily a PHP programmer).The advantages I sawClose to hardware language (which adds to performance).Supports OOP greatly (Yes, you just need to read better books to explain this to you.)Extremely Light, needs lesser server resources (Saves you a lot of cost)Regarding Memory Management, thats really not an issue. There are things in C++ that lets you manage memory automatically (smart pointers & share_ptr specifically).I have started with CppCMS Web Development Framework.It took me a bit learning curve in getting used to C++, but finally I am there :)It (C++) just takes you to be a bit more organized. Yeah, more organized than Java, because you can\'t be careless here about creating objects, you need to delete them. But as already mentioned, smart pointers in C++ helps you do this automatically.If these seems too much, its worth it. Assuming you are planning to use C++ Web Development thinking the long term aspects. For short term objectives, languages like PHP (or any web-dev language) serves the purpose.About CppCMS:Supports constructs like interchanging between C++ and HTML Code, like using of <?php ?> tags between html. You can use your Plain html text between the templating language of this framework. This is primary advantageous when you give your code to UI designers.Supports separate compilation of views, so a change to views, will not require you compile the entire project, similar, changes only to core Business Logic files, will not require you to re-compile view files. Its like the concept of Servlets and JSP files of Java.Its cross-platform :)my2c.I recommend to use the C++ webtoolkit Wt (pronounced Witty), at http://www.webtoolkit.eu/.This framework (with integrated application server) lets you design web applications in terms of widgets and signal/slot connections, and leaves much of the web cruft in the hands of the library. The resulting applications are object-oriented, strictly typed, and perfectly maintainable. The library autodetects the browser\'s capabilities and uses the proper way to render the site, avoiding browser bugs.It is not my intention to start a language war, but Wt is written in a modern C++ style, which doesn\'t need to lead to memory leaks and other mishaps that have always been associated with C++ applications. I agree with the validity of your statement: why not write web applications in C++? C++ is as good as any other language around. It is not a matter of performance, it is a matter of style.A lot of web development boils down to database querying and string manipulation.  Both of these are easier to do in a dynamic language than in C++.  The main reason to use C++ would be for efficiency, though most sites don\'t need that much efficiency.Web sites might be written in other languages but call components written in C++, say for number crunching.  But the main logic of a site is seldom written in C++.I think the only reason for not building a web app in C++ is a lack of libraries for it (well-known libraries that is). I don\'t see what kind of string manipulation, networking or database access that could not be done in C++.One big advantage of choosing C++ is that if you already have a lot of C/C++ code in your company, it avoids introducing yet another language, which comes with its own IDE, standard library, custom written libraries, programming language quirks and limitations, library quirks, profilers, etc...   I had a conversation about two years ago with an ex Yahoo engineer on this very subject as I had heard the same rumour.He said that historically the attitude of Yahoo was to build very optimised applications in C++ while their competitors (Facebook, Google) would tend to use which ever high level language would let them get the job done quickest.The upside of this was that the system he built used 10 servers while the equivalent Google system required 100+ (this was his claim I have no way of verifying it). The downside was that their time to market was much longer and it was much harder to get programmers up to speed with the system and introduce new features and all the coders had to be absolutely A1 grade to be able to work on the system.His opinion was that failing to recognise the rule of "He who iterates fastest wins" was one of the reasons why Yahoo were loosing ground.C++ has poor support for text manipulation (in terms of built-in support) and it is all about manipulating and formatting text on the web. Also the performance bottleneck is in most cases database and network so it doesn\'t matter much if you write in a speedier language.I made a webpage in C which does some image processing on uploaded images long time ago. It was pretty performant but thinking now, I could have been more productive seperating the image processing stuff as a cli utility which is called from php/perl/whatever you have in hand.Also people do not want to manage memory themselves. Almost like the Pavlov\'s dogs, most of us are trained to cry when we hear the word "pointer" throughout our programming lives. So manual memory management is just "bad" for web programming. It is not such a great issue for plain old CGI though. Your CGI will probably need all the memory it allocated for the whole of its short life and just let the OS release it. It may not be the case for an application container (depends on implementation anyway).Culture around C++ is more varied than relatively newer languages used on web (such as python, ruby, newer versions of php, notable exception is perl which is about doing things differently) thanks to its general scope and age, there is not an obvious "it should be done like this" way which a newbie can pick up quickly and get started.There is of course things to make web programming with C++ easier, but they are mainly focused on embedded systems. You don\'t have much choice anyway if you are programming for an small embedded system than manual memory management and squeeze out the last available cycles.Pointers are quite simple when time is spent on them. Simply put, pointers allow to avoid copying large objects over and over. It is a huge improvement to performance and it can be easy to follow if implemented correctly.Form here: http://www.jroller.com/craiger/entry/where_are_all_the_cCraig Tataryn wrote:\n  Hi Bjarne, I\'m professionaly a Java programmer and was wondering\n  something. In the Java world, we have Sun, and Sun (or a commitee) \n   produces specifications for things which would benefit the Java\n  eco-system (if I may use this kitchy terminology).

They \n  either a) don\'t write web applications b) wrote their own framework \n  (http://labs.wexussoftware.com/) or c) use Ruby on Rails. \n  The last option was described to me as "use the right tool for the job"I guess the answer I am looking for is, why hasn\'t C++ penetrated the \n  web application frontier?  Is it lacking an entity to write a\n  specification for such a thing?  In my googling, I can\'t even find \n  commericial web application frameworks for C++.  I just don\'t get it \n  because it would produce some pretty  fast, resource savvy webapps.You have the answer in the first line "Java has Sun" or maybe more \ncorrectly "Sun has Java". That is, there was an organization willing to\npay dozens of millions of dollars for development supported by more dozens\nof dollars for marketing. The C++ community never had that. Instead, many\norganizations  built tools for areas they found important for their own\ncustomers.In consequence, the C++ community don\'t have massive frameworks (unless \nyou count CORBA), just applications (usually massive applications, such\nas amazon, google, ebay, and amadeus).There is a lot of C++ "behind the scenes", e.g. financial software,\nembedded systems, games, infrastructure (e.g. CORBA, JVM), OS. See my\napplications page. There just isn\'t a mechanism for that to be seen (like \nJava\'s little coffee cup).Here are a few web sites that might interest you:http://cppcms.com/wikipp/en/page/mainhttp://www.webtoolkit.eu/wthttp://binarytiers.org/http://www.micronovae.com/CSP.htmlhttp://www.seastar-project.org/http://developer.capeclear.com/gsoaphttp://www.roguewave.com/products-services/hydraexpresshttp://www.linuxpromagazine.com/online/news/web_application_with_c_and_fastcgi?category=13426Googling on "C++ web applications" will help you.Good luckThere is so much disinformation regarding C++ in these posts.  First, if you use constructors, destructors, and stack allocation properly, you almost never have to deal with memory issues - it\'s really not that bad at all.  Second, C++ Boost libraries are fricken awesome.  Boost is easy to use, the libraries are well designed, and there are libraries written for pretty much any need.Third, C++ is more modern than most of the alternatives.  Really, the only languages that can compete on a per feature basis are Python and Haskell(best language yet).  As an example, Java is just now getting real support for closures.  Well ok, there\'s a large distinction between compile time and dynamic features, but I digress.I would say the only thing holding c++ back is that, initially, it takes a bit of mental effort; that, and 15 year old biases based on old versions of an ever-evolving language.So having said that, I would go with Python for web development.edit: It\'s also worth mentioning that C++ has the best debugger in the business with Visual Studio.Also there is another library POCO C++ libraries . I used it for one of my college project, its pretty good. There is also good documentation to get started with, u can find it hereC++ is a general purpose language... but ASP, PHP, etc were DESIGNED to make websites, so they grew to be really popular languages for the web.  Many people that "grew up" with ASP (and maybe PHP) moved to ASP.NET (so VB.Net and C#).I am not a Java guy, so I\'m not sure why that particular language grew to be popular with the web.  I\'m thinking because it was (and is) popular in universities and because Java was one of the first languages to get some real good toolkits for the web.I suspect these days, C++ might be used in embedded web servers; such as you might find in a router. I have noticed one C++ web development framework called Wt.Aside from Google\'s search website, Amazon\'s original setup ("Tradition #1": best link I can find) or eBay from \'97 to 2002 (PDF, pages 9-14), it\'s not common at all.  Because, as already pointed out, it wasn\'t really designed for this.  But it\'s not a bad idea to use C++ to implement some web services (although without built-in XML support, you\'ll likely send data over the wire in other formats) which your site can then call to.If you\'re on IIS, you can use ATL Server.If you wanted to do it anyway, you\'d need a template system (Google ctemplate, from above), and a database access layer.  You\'d also want to read up on how to hook into your web server (using ISAPI on IIS, Apache modules) if you\'re going to pass parameters as part of the URI (that is, as "part/of/the/path/to/the/command").  You can use CGI if you\'re with passing parameters only via GET or POST.You can do anything in any language.  Its a question of using the correct tool for the job.  Since websites are mostly about string processing, it makes sense to use a language that has string processing as a strength.  Another drawback is that there aren\'t any/many C++ tools to help.\nThat said, there is nothing wrong with writing some back-end, number crunching code in C++, and then using another language to interface it to the web.  We do this with some heavy-duty, parallel simulation that run on 100 to 10000 node clusters.Frankly, there are better languages to use in relation to web application development. Some are based on C/C++ (PHP comes to mind) but basically they are an abstraction above C/C++. There isn\'t anything stopping you from using C++ in a CGI environment, but it\'s a lot more difficult. It would be much easier to use a language that has the features needed for web application development built in (such as session/cookie handling and request/response generation).With that being said, I have written a C based application to interact with a third party database that supported a PHP based web application. They had APIs in PHP and C, but the PHP API was entirely way to slow so I wrote a C application that was called by the PHP.now you have another choice: node.native .it\'s a port for node.jsexample code looks like:We used it at my last job almost exclusively.  It worked well, though we used our own home-grown web page engine (like ASP or PHP, but our own concoction), which I probably wouldn\'t use in the future for a variety of reasons.  Those sites are live around the world, and there\'s a good chance you\'ve used one before (I can\'t give many more details due to NDA).To answer your question, though, C++ is an excellent all-purpose language, and that includes the creation of a webserver.  In order to create dynamic content, you might have to do some gruntwork, but I wouldn\'t be surprised if there are existing C++ web app frameworks out there for you to use.From my reading, the reason C++ isn\'t used is because there aren\'t many good options for quickly launching a c++ script. CGI is notoriously slow and it usually takes away any performance benefit that might be had from using C++. Additionally, modern languages have either VMs (.NET, Java, etc) or interpreters which are effectively always running and able to dispatch new program instances quickly and without kernel supervision/intervention. Additionally, these kinds of middleware are well-suited for working with a server to execute the same program repeatedly and to a large number of network clients.While a programmer could conceivably account for all of the things done by these VMs/interpreters, it would be hard to do them better or faster. Additionally, these languages all provide for much faster development and improvements to the middleware layers directly benefits your project.It\'s not popular because nobody bothered to write a decent template system for it, which is not that hard.BTW, Google\'s own web server (from http header: "Server: gws") is written in C++.Check out Google\'s Native Client SDK, to use native code (e.g. C, C++) to create web apps that run in recent versions of Chromium.we made once custom c-lib to create c based app to work with fcgid to get superb request handling power. but, it was far from easy. and required very good financing and reason to do so. nowadays, it\'s cheaper to write in php and get decent hardware to support it. but, in some extreme cases it\'s the c/c++ option that\'s well worth itI would be surprised if C++ is used in any new website builds. I used to use it for making COM components for MTS back in the days of when vanilla ASP and transaction server were the way to do things, but there are much more efficient languages and frameworks to lean on now that make development much quicker.Why not make websites in C++? Because C++ is a low level language for system programming.You don\'t want to think about circular dependencies and object models when making a website - it gains you nothing, as the bottleneck is probably the network or the database.I have a couple of "customer area" websites which are actually ISAPI DLLs written in C++, so it\'s definitely doable. We still use them because we are building on top of really old (but working) code and also because we can distribute the dll to our distributors without them seeing the underlying source code.But I have to agree that it\'s a really clumsy way to build a website. Furthermore, support for ISAPI DLLs has been dropping really fast. Visual Studio 2008 doesn\'t support them anymore (I don\'t know about 2005) and it\'s a real pain to enable them on Vista.It\'s a possible solution if you only know C++ and HTML, but there are definitely better alternatives out there.I learned c/c++ in school and worked on visual basic applications.  I loved the GUI and events, however, there were times when you want to handle data using a c++ data structure.  So linking is a good option. Microsoft products offer so much so why reinvent the wheel.However, I am new to learning web development.  I like some of the things .net is doing, however; everything is out of a box, supposedly saves time, but I spend more time trying to find the right box.  So, it\'s a different kind of learning curve.I think the the reason some apps replaced c/c++ is easy to recognize, and it is learning curve.  I can put together a web site with html, b interacts with a database, scripts to handle this interaction.But I don\'t see why c++ is eliminated as a back end programming tool.  I liked the comment about using php to call  a c++ program.  I was wondering how that can be done.  And how to share a object or pass an object to c++ using this method?I guess before starting any project researching what does what first will help eliminate the crisis when you hit a wall and find you can\'t do something.I\'m sure there actually are some sites using C++ as backend, however, I expect those are mainly older sites. For instance I know a school in the United Kingdom that relies on a C++ backend, can\'t say I know the motivation behind it, but it\'s definitely possible. If I\'m not mistaken it\'s even possible to use the C++ code through IIS as modules, which should give you some advantages over writing the complete server application yourself.It\'s doubtful whether anyone would recommend you to use C++ though, it could have quite some performance advantages for some applications. Nonetheless, it\'ll probably also make it a lot more complicated; languages \'made for the web\' come with so many functions and optimizations out of the box, you\'d probably be (partly) reinventing the wheel.In order to write websites in C++, you simply need to be a programmer. This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen in all languages, this is precisely the beauty of PHP and Ruby. They require few programming skills.Sometimes programmers may use these modern languages to improve their productivity, and here is where frameworks become handy. With C++ web frameworks like WT or BinaryTiers, programmers can write websites and complex web applications in few minutes like if they were using PHP or Ruby.An example of this is Lovingsports, a social networking website entirely written in C++ using the BinaryTiers Web Application Framework
