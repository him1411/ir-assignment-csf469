The eval function is a powerful and easy way to dynamically generate code, so what are the caveats?Improper use of eval opens up your\ncode for injection attacksDebugging can be more challenging\n(no line numbers, etc.)eval\'d code executes slower (no opportunity to compile/cache eval\'d code)Edit: As @Jeff Walden points out in comments, #3 is less true today than it was in 2008. However, while some caching of compiled scripts may happen this will only be limited to scripts that are eval\'d repeated with no modification. A more likely scenario is that you are eval\'ing scripts that have undergone slight modification each time and as such could not be cached. Let\'s just say that SOME eval\'d code executes more slowly.eval isn\'t always evil. There are times where it\'s perfectly appropriate.However, eval is currently and historically massively over-used by people who don\'t know what they\'re doing. That includes people writing JavaScript tutorials, unfortunately, and in some cases this can indeed have security consequences - or, more often, simple bugs. So the more we can do to throw a question mark over eval, the better. Any time you use eval you need to sanity-check what you\'re doing, because chances are you could be doing it a better, safer, cleaner way.To give an all-too-typical example, to set the colour of an element with an id stored in the variable \'potato\':If the authors of the kind of code above had a clue about the basics of how JavaScript objects work, they\'d have realised that square brackets can be used instead of literal dot-names, obviating the need for eval:...which is much easier to read as well as less potentially buggy.(But then, someone who /really/ knew what they were doing would say:which is more reliable than the dodgy old trick of accessing DOM elements straight out of the document object.)I believe it\'s because it can execute any JavaScript function from a string. Using it makes it easier for people to inject rogue code into the application.Two points come to mind:Security (but as long as you generate the string to be evaluated yourself, this might be a non-issue)Performance: until the code to be executed is unknown, it cannot be optimized.  (about javascript and performance, certainly Steve Yegge\'s presentation)Passing user input to eval() is a security risk, but also each invocation of eval() creates a new instance of the JavaScript interpreter. This can be a resource hog.It\'s generally only an issue if you\'re passing eval user input.Mainly, it\'s a lot harder to maintain and debug. It\'s like a goto. You can use it, but it makes it harder to find problems and harder on the people who may need to make changes later.One thing to keep in mind is that you can often use eval() to execute code in an otherwise restricted environment - social networking sites that block specific JavaScript functions can sometimes be fooled by breaking them up in an eval block -So if you\'re looking to run some JavaScript code where it might not otherwise be allowed (Myspace, I\'m looking at you...) then eval() can be a useful trick.However, for all the reasons mentioned above, you shouldn\'t use it for your own code, where you have complete control - it\'s just not necessary, and better-off relegated to the \'tricky JavaScript hacks\' shelf.Unless you let eval() a dynamic content (through cgi or input), it is as safe and solid as all other JavaScript in your page.Along with the rest of the answers, I don\'t think eval statements can have advanced minimization.Unless you are 100% sure that the code being evaluated is from a trusted source (usually your own application) then it\'s a surefire way of exposing your system to a cross-site scripting attack.It is a possible security risk, it has a different scope of execution, and is quite inefficient, as it creates an entirely new scripting environment for the execution of the code. See here for some more info: eval.It is quite useful, though, and used with moderation can add a lot of good functionality.It greatly reduces your level of confidence about security.It\'s not necessarily that bad provided you know what context you\'re using it in.If your application is using eval() to create an object from some JSON which has come back from an XMLHttpRequest to your own site, created by your trusted server-side code, it\'s probably not a problem.Untrusted client-side JavaScript code can\'t do that much anyway. Provided the thing you\'re eval\'ing has come from a reasonable source, you\'re fine.If you want the user to input some logical functions and evaluate for AND the OR then the JavaScript eval function is perfect. I can accept two strings and eval(uate) string1 === string2, etc.I know this discussion is old, but I really like this approach by Google and wanted to share that feeling with others ;)The other thing is that the better You get the more You try to understand and finally You just don\'t believe that something is good or bad just because someone said so :) \nThis is a very inspirational video that helped me to think more by myself :) GOOD PRACTICES are good, but don\'t use them mindelessly :)Besides the possible security issues if you are executing user-submitted code, most of the time there\'s a better way that doesn\'t involve re-parsing the code every time it\'s executed. Anonymous functions or object properties can replace most uses of eval and are much safer and faster.This may become more of an issue as the next generation of browsers come out with some flavor of a JavaScript compiler. Code executed via Eval may not perform as well as the rest of your JavaScript against these newer browsers. Someone should do some profiling.This is one of good articles talking about eval and how it is not an evil:\nhttp://www.nczonline.net/blog/2013/06/25/eval-isnt-evil-just-misunderstood/I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying you should go run out and start using eval()\n  everywhere. In fact, there are very few good use cases for running\n  eval() at all. There are definitely concerns with code clarity,\n  debugability, and certainly performance that should not be overlooked.\n  But you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid to use it when you have a case where\n  eval() makes sense. Try not using it first, but don\xe2\x80\x99t let anyone scare\n  you into thinking your code is more fragile or less secure when eval()\n  is used appropriately.The JavaScript Engine has a number of performance optimizations that it performs during the compilation phase. Some of these boil down to being able to essentially statically analyze the code as it lexes, and pre-determine where all the variable and function declarations are, so that it takes less effort to resolve identifiers during execution.But if the Engine finds an eval(..) in the code, it essentially has to assume that all its awareness of identifier location may be invalid, because it cannot know at lexing time exactly what code you may pass to eval(..) to modify the lexical scope, or the contents of the object you may pass to with to create a new lexical scope to be consulted.In other words, in the pessimistic sense, most of those optimizations it would make are pointless if eval(..) is present, so it simply doesn\'t perform the optimizations at all.This explains it all.Reference :https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20&%20closures/ch2.md#evalhttps://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20&%20closures/ch2.md#performanceeval() is very powerful and can be used to execute a JS statement or evaluate an expression. But the question isn\'t about the uses of eval() but lets just say some how the string you running with eval() is affected by a malicious party. At the end you will be running malicious code. With power comes great responsibility. So use it wisely is you are using it. \n This isn\'t related much to eval() function but this article has pretty good information:\n http://blogs.popart.com/2009/07/javascript-injection-attacks/\nIf you are looking for the basics of eval() look here: \nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/evalIt\'s not always a bad idea. Take for example, code generation. I recently wrote a library called Hyperbars which bridges the gap between virtual-dom and handlebars. It does this by parsing a handlebars template and converting it to hyperscript which is subsequently used by virtual-dom. The hyperscript is generated as a string first and before returning it, eval() it to turn it into executable code. I have found eval() in this particular situation the exact opposite of evil. Basically fromTo thisThe performance of eval() isn\'t an issue in a situation like this because you only need to interpret the generated string once and then reuse the executable output many times over.You can see how the code generation was achieved if you\'re curious here.If you spot the use of eval() in your code, remember the mantra \xe2\x80\x9ceval() is evil.\xe2\x80\x9d This\nfunction takes an arbitrary string and executes it as JavaScript code. When the code in\nquestion is known beforehand (not determined at runtime), there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to use\neval(). \nIf the code is dynamically generated at runtime, there\xe2\x80\x99s often a better way to\nachieve the goal without eval(). \nFor example, just using square bracket notation to\naccess dynamic properties is better and simpler:Using eval() also has security implications, because you might be executing code (for\nexample coming from the network) that has been tampered with. \nThis is a common antipattern when dealing with a JSON response from an Ajax request. \nIn those cases\nit\xe2\x80\x99s better to use the browsers\xe2\x80\x99 built-in methods to parse the JSON response to make\nsure it\xe2\x80\x99s safe and valid. For browsers that don\xe2\x80\x99t support JSON.parse() natively, you can\nuse a library from JSON.org.It\xe2\x80\x99s also important to remember that passing strings to setInterval(), setTimeout(),\nand the Function() constructor is, for the most part, similar to using eval() and therefore\nshould be avoided. Behind the scenes, JavaScript still has to evaluate and execute\nthe string you pass as programming code:Using the new Function() constructor is similar to eval() and should be approached\nwith care. It could be a powerful construct but is often misused. \nIf you absolutely must\nuse eval(), you can consider using new Function() instead. There is a small potential\nbenefit because the code evaluated in new Function() will be running in a local function\nscope, so any variables defined with var in the code being evaluated will not become\nglobals automatically. Another way to prevent automatic globals is to wrap the\neval() call into an immediate function.I won\'t attempt to refute anything said heretofore, but i will offer this use of eval() that (as far as I know) can\'t be done any other way.  There\'s probably other ways to code this, and probably ways to optimize it, but this is done longhand and without any bells and whistles for clarity sake to illustrate a use of eval that really doesn\'t have any other alternatives.  That is: dynamical (or more accurately) programmically-created object names (as opposed to values).EDIT:  by the way, I wouldn\'t suggest (for all the security reasons pointed out heretofore) that you base you object names on user input.  I can\'t imagine any good reason you\'d want to do that though.  Still, thought I\'d point it out that it wouldn\'t be a good idea :)
