I have a repository with a file Hello.java. When I compile it an additional Hello.class file is generated.I created an entry for Hello.class in a .gitignore file. However the file still appears to be tracked.I want to know how to make git ignore Hello.class.The problem is that .gitignore ignores just files that weren\'t tracked before (by git add). Run git reset name_of_file to unstage the file and keep it. In case you want to also remove given file from the repository (after pushing), use git rm --cached name_of_file.How to ignore new filesGloballyAdd the path(s) to your file(s) which you would like to ignore to your .gitignore file (and commit them). These file entries will also apply to others checking out the repo.LocallyAdd the path(s) to your file(s) which you would like to ignore to your .git/info/exclude file. These file entries will only apply to your local working copy.How to ignore changed files (temporarily)In order to ignore changed files to being listed as modified, you can use the following git command:To revert that ignorance use the following command:Add the following line to .gitignore:This will exclude Hello.class from git.  If you have already committed it, run the following command:If you want to exclude all class files from git, add the following line to .gitignore:1) create a .gitignore file, so to do that, you just create a .txt file and change the extention as following:Then you have to change the name writing the following line on the cmd:Where git.txt is the name of the file you\'ve just created.Then you can open the file and write all the files you don\xc2\xb4t want to add on the repository. For example mine looks like this:Once you have this, you need to add it to your git repository. You have to save the file where your repository is. Then in your git bash you have to write the following line:If the respository already exists then you have to do the following:If the step 2 doesn\xc2\xb4t work then you should write the hole route of the files that you would like to add.Hope it helps!To ignore:To undo ignore:Create a .gitignore in the directory where .git is. You can list files in it separated by a newline. You also can use wildcards:You can use below methods for ignoring/not-ignoring changes in tracked files.You should write something likeinto your .gitignore file.By creating a .gitignore file.

In those cases, you must untrack the file first, by running the following command in your terminal:or You can also use .gitattributes (instead of .gitignore) to exclude entire filetypes. The file is pretty self-explanatory but I\'m pasting the contents here for reference. Pay attention to the last line (*.class binary)This webpage may be useful and time-saving when working with .gitignore.It automatically generates .gitignore files for different IDEs and Operating Systems with the specific files/folders that you usually don\'t want to pull to your git repository (for instance, IDE-specific folders and configuration files).Add the following line to .git/info/exclude:\nHello.classI have tried the --assume-unchanged and also the .gitignore but neither worked well. They make it hard to switch branches and hard to merge changes from others. This is my solution:When I commit, I manually remove the files from the list of changesBefore I pull, I stash the changed files. And after pull, I do a stash pop.Step 3 sometimes will trigger a merge and may result in conflict that you need to resolve, which is a good thing.This allows me to keep local changes that are not shared with others on the team.
