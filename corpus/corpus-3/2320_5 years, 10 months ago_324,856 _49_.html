This is probably a stupidly simple question to some :)I\'ve created a new linux instance on Amazon EC2, and as part of that downloaded the .pem file to allow me to SSH in. When I tried to ssh with:I got:Following this post I tried to chmod +600 the pem file, but now when I ssh I just get:What school-boy error am I making here?\n The .pem file is in my home folder (in osx). It\'s permissions look like this:The problem is having wrong mod on the file.Easily solved by executing -chmod 400 mykey.pemTaken from Amazon\'s instructions -Your key file must not be publicly viewable for SSH to work. Use this\n  command if needed:  chmod 400 mykey.pemYou are likely using the wrong username to login:To login, you need to adjust your ssh command:HTHI know this is very late to the game ... but this always works for me:hope this helps someone.Ok man, the only thing that worked for me was:Change permissions of the keychmod 400 mykey.pemMake sure to log in using ec2-user, and the correct ec2-99... address.  The ec2-99 address is at the bottom of the aws console when you\'re logged in and seeing your instance listedssh -i mykey.pem ec2-user@ec2-99-99-99-99.compute-1.amazonaws.comTake a look at this article. You do not use the public DNS but rather the form where the name is visible on your AMI panel Change permission for the key file with : See AWS documentation for connecting to the instance:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html#EC2_ConnectToInstance_LinuxIn Mac terminal, doing "chmod 400 xyz.pem" did not help me, it kept saying permission denied. For ubuntu users I would suggestI know this question has been answered already but for those that have tried them all and you are still getting the annoying "Permission denied (publickey)". Try running your command with SUDO. Of course this is a temporary solution and you should set permissions correctly but at least that will let you identify that your current user is not running with the privileges you need (as you assumed) sudo ssh -i amazonec2.pem ec2-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.comOnce you do this you\'ll get a message like this:Please login as the user "ec2-user" rather than the user "root"Which is also sparsely documented. In that case just do this: sudo ssh -i amazonec2.pem ec2-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com -l ec2-userAnd you\'ll get the glorious:SSH keys and file permission best practices:public key/.pub file - 0600 (read & write only by owner)chmod XXXX file/directoryssh -i /.pem user@host-machine-IPI think it\'s because either you have entered wrong credentials\nor, you are using a public key rather than private key\nor, your port permissions are open for ALL to ssh. This is bad for Amazon.Alternative log-in using PuTTY. Its good but needs a few steps.Im using PuTTY 0.66 in Windows.Checklist:Are you using the right private key .pem file?Are its permissions set correctly? (My Amazon-brand AMIs work with 644, but Red hat must be at least 600 or 400. Don\'t know about Ubuntu.)Are you using the right username in your ssh line? Amazon-branded = "ec2-user", Red Hat = "root", Ubuntu = "ubuntu". User can be specified as "ssh -i pem usename@hostname" OR "ssh -l username -i pem hostname"Do a chmod 400 yourkeyfile.pem \nIf your instance is Amazon linux then use ssh -i yourkeyfile.pem ec2-user@ip\nfor ubuntu\nssh -i yourkeyfile.pem ubuntu@ip\nfor centos\nssh -i yourkeyfile.pem centos@ipThere can be three reasons behind this error.What fixed this for me was to move the .pem file within the apps directory. Soo say fooapp is the name of my app. I placed it directly in there. adding the -v flag worked for me
