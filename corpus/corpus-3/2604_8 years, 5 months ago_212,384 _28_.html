I was deploying an ASP.NET MVC application last night, and found out that it is less work to deploy with IIS7 set to integrated mode. My question is what is the difference? And what are the implications of using one or the other?Classic mode (the only mode in IIS6 and below) is a mode where IIS only works with ISAPI extensions and ISAPI filters directly. In fact, in this mode, ASP.NET is just an ISAPI extension (aspnet_isapi.dll) and an ISAPI filter (aspnet_filter.dll). IIS just treats ASP.NET as an external plugin implemented in ISAPI and works with it like a black box (and only when it\'s needs to give out the request to ASP.NET). In this mode, ASP.NET is not much different from PHP or other technologies for IIS.Integrated mode, on the other hand, is a new mode in IIS7 where IIS pipeline is tightly integrated (i.e. is just the same) as ASP.NET request pipeline. ASP.NET can see every request it wants to and manipulate things along the way. ASP.NET is no longer treated as an external plugin. It\'s completely blended and integrated in IIS. In this mode, ASP.NET HttpModules basically have nearly as much power as an ISAPI filter would have had and ASP.NET HttpHandlers can have nearly equivalent capability as an ISAPI extension could have. In this mode, ASP.NET is basically a part of IIS.Integrated application pool modeWhen an application pool is in Integrated mode, you can take advantage\n  of the integrated request-processing architecture of IIS and ASP.NET.\n  When a worker process in an application pool receives a request, the\n  request passes through an ordered list of events. Each event calls the\n  necessary native and managed modules to process portions of the\n  request and to generate the response.There are several benefits to running application pools in Integrated\n  mode. First the request-processing models of IIS and ASP.NET are\n  integrated into a unified process model. This model eliminates steps\n  that were previously duplicated in IIS and ASP.NET, such as\n  authentication. Additionally, Integrated mode enables the availability\n  of managed features to all content types.Classic application pool modeWhen an application pool is in Classic mode, IIS 7.0 handles requests\n  as in IIS 6.0 worker process isolation mode. ASP.NET requests first go\n  through native processing steps in IIS and are then routed to\n  Aspnet_isapi.dll for processing of managed code in the managed\n  runtime. Finally, the request is routed back through IIS to send the\n  response.This separation of the IIS and ASP.NET request-processing models\n  results in duplication of some processing steps, such as\n  authentication and authorization. Additionally, managed code features,\n  such as forms authentication, are only available to ASP.NET\n  applications or applications for which you have script mapped all\n  requests to be handled by aspnet_isapi.dll.Be sure to test your existing applications for compatibility in\n  Integrated mode before upgrading a production environment to IIS 7.0\n  and assigning applications to application pools in Integrated mode.\n  You should only add an application to an application pool in Classic\n  mode if the application fails to work in Integrated mode. For example,\n  your application might rely on an authentication token passed from IIS\n  to the managed runtime, and, due to the new architecture in IIS 7.0,\n  the process breaks your application.Taken from: What is the difference between DefaultAppPool and Classic .NET AppPool in IIS7?Original source: Introduction to IIS ArchitectureIIS 6.0 and previous versions : ASP.NET integrated with IIS via an ISAPI extension, a C API ( C Programming language based API ) and exposed its own application and request processing model.   This effectively exposed two separate server( request / response ) pipelines, one for native ISAPI filters and extension components, and another for managed application components. ASP.NET components would execute entirely inside the ASP.NET ISAPI extension bubble AND ONLY  for requests mapped to ASP.NET in the IIS script map configuration.Requests to non ASP.NET content types:-  images, text files, HTML pages, and script-less ASP pages, were processed by IIS or other ISAPI extensions and were NOT visible to ASP.NET.The major limitation of this model was that services provided by ASP.NET modules and custom ASP.NET application code were NOT available to non ASP.NET requestsWhat\'s a SCRIPT MAP ?Script maps are used to associate file extensions with the ISAPI handler that executes when that file type is requested.  The script map also has an optional setting that verifies that the physical file associated with the request exists before allowing the request to be processedA good example can be seen hereIIS 7 and aboveIIS 7.0 and above have been re-engineered from the ground up to provide a brand new C++ API based ISAPI. IIS 7.0 and above integrates the ASP.NET runtime with the core functionality of the Web Server, providing a unified(single) request processing pipeline that is exposed to both native and managed components known as modules ( IHttpModules )What this means is that  IIS 7 processes requests that arrive for any content type, with both NON ASP.NET Modules / native IIS modules and ASP.NET modules providing request processing in all stages This is the reason why NON ASP.NET content types (.html, static files ) can be handled by .NET modules.In classic mode IIS works h ISAPI extensions and ISAPI filters directly. And uses two pipe lines , one for native code and other for managed code. You can simply say that in Classic mode IIS 7.x works just as IIS 6 and you dont get extra benefits out of IIS 7.x features.In integrated mode IIS and ASP.Net are tightly coupled rather then depending on just two DLLs on Asp.net as in case of classic mode.Classic Mode\nTypically, moving a Web application from IIS 6.0 to IIS 7.0 Classic mode requires only that you put the application in an application pool that is running in Classic mode. For example, when you install IIS 7.0 with , by default the Web server is configured to operate in Integrated mode. It is also configured to run under the default application pool, which is called DefaultAppPool. To run a Web application in Classic mode, use the Classic.NETAppPool application or create a new application pool that is configured to run in Classic mode. For information about how to create an application pool, see Create an Application Pool.\nAny custom modules that implement the IHttpModule interface in an application that runs in Classic mode are notified only about pipeline requests that are handled by the ASP.NET runtime. For example, they are notified about requests for an .aspx page. The application life cycle for Classic mode is the same as the life cycle for ASP.NET in IIS 6.0. For more information, see ASP.NET Application Life Cycle Overview for IIS 5.0 and 6.0.\nIf an application that runs in Classic mode contains a handler that requires a script map to handle a custom extension in IIS, you must register the handler in both the httpHandler group and the handler group. You map the custom file-name extension to the ASP.NET ISAPI extension (Aspnet_isapi.dll) by specifying the modules and scriptProcessor attributes in the handler element. These attributes specify that the module that defines the handler is an ISAPI extension, and they specify the path of that extension. This is how IIS 7.0 in Classic mode provides backward compatibility with earlier versions of IIS. However, if you run the application in Integrated mode, you must remove the modules and scriptProcessor attributes. For more information, see How to: Configure an HTTP Handler Extension in IIS.\nWhen you move a Web application from IIS 6.0 to Classic mode, it is not guaranteed to work in Integrated mode without changes. If you switch an application from Classic mode to Integrated mode (and change any custom modules and handlers), you might have to make additional changes for the application to run correctly in Integrated mode. The next section in this topic explains how to move an application to IIS 7.0 Integrated mode.Integrated Mode\nWeb applications that do not include custom modules or handlers will usually work without changes in Integrated mode in IIS 7.0. Web applications that rely on custom modules or handlers require the following steps to enable the application to run in Integrated mode:\nRegister custom modules and handlers in the system.webServer section of the Web.config file by using one of the methods described in the Migrating a Web Config File to Integrated Mode section later in this topic.\nDefine event handlers for HttpApplication request pipeline events like BeginRequest and EndRequest only in the Init method of the custom module.\nMake sure that you have addressed any issues discussed in the "Known Differences Between Integrated Mode and Classic Mode" section of Upgrading ASP.NET Applications to IIS 7.0: Differences between IIS 7.0 Integrated Mode and Classic mode.\nModules that implement the IHttpModule interface are referred to as managed-code modules because they are built by using the .NET Framework. Managed-code modules can be registered at the server level or at the application level. Native-code modules are DLLs (non-managed code) that are registered only at the server level. Core ASP.NET features, such as session state and forms authentication, are implemented as managed modules in Integrated mode.\nWhen you move an application from Classic to Integrated mode, you can leave custom modules and handler registrations for Classic mode, or you can remove them. If you do not remove the httpModules and httpHandlers registrations that are used in Classic mode, you must set the validation element\xe2\x80\x99s validateIntegratedModeConfiguration attribute to false to avoid errors. The validation element is a child element of the system.webServer element. For more information, see the section "Disabling the migration message" in ASP.NET Integration with IIS 7.0.
