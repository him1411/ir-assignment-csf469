This question already has an answer here:Assuming I have 2 standard vectors:Let\'s also say the both have around 30 elements.The dirty way would be iterating through b and adding each element via vector<int>::push_back(), though I wouldn\'t like to do that!orThe second variant is a more generically applicable solution, as b could also be an array. However, it requires C++11This can be used in case the items in vector a have no assignment operator (e.g. const member).In all other cases this solution is ineffiecent compared to the above insert solution.While saying "the compiler can reserve", why rely on it?  And what about automatic detection of move semantics?  And what about all that repeating of the container name with the begins and ends?Wouldn\'t you want something, you know, simpler?(Scroll down to main for the punchline)hehe.Now with move-data-from-rhs, append-array-to-container, append forward_list-to-container, move-container-from-lhs, thanks to @DyP\'s help.Note that the above does not compile in clang thanks to the EnableFunctionIf<>... technique.  In clang this workaround works.If you would like to add vector to itself both popular solutions will fail:
