How can I tell if the JVM my application runs in is 32 bit or 64-bit?  Specifically, what function or  preference do I access to detect this within the program?Sun has a Java System property to determine the bitness of the JVM: 32 or 64:You can useto determine if its 32/64 from the program.From the Sun HotSpot FAQ:When writing Java code, how do I\n  distinguish between 32 and 64-bit\n  operation?There\'s no public API that allows you\n  to distinguish between 32 and 64-bit\n  operation. Think of 64-bit as just\n  another platform in the write once,\n  run anywhere tradition. However, if\n  you\'d like to write code which is\n  platform specific (shame on you), the\n  system property sun.arch.data.model\n  has the value "32", "64", or\n  "unknown".The only good reason is if your java\n code is dependent upon native libraries\n and your code needs to determine which\n version (32 or 64bit) to load on startup.You can try on the command line:If it\'s not a 64-bit version, you\'ll get a message that looks like:This Java instance does not support a 64-bit JVM.\n  Please install the desired version.Consult the help options of the JVM for more info java -helpJust type java -version in your console.If a 64 bit version is running, you\'ll get a message like:A 32 bit version will show something similar to:Note Client instead of 64-Bit Server in the third line. The Client/Server part is irrelevant, it\'s the absence of the 64-Bit that matters.If multiple Java versions are installed on your system, navigate to the /bin folder of the Java version you want to check, and type java -version there.Update Again:I installed 32-bit JVM and retried it again, looks like the following does tell you JVM bitness, not OS arch:This was tested against both SUN and IBM JVM (32 and 64-bit). Clearly, the system property is not just the operating system arch.Complementary info:On a running process you may use (at least with some recent Sun JDK5/6 versions):where 14680 is PID of jvm running the application. "os.arch" works too.Also other scenarios are supported:However consider also this note:"NOTE - This utility is unsupported and may or may not be available in future versions of the JDK. In Windows Systems where dbgent.dll is not present, \'Debugging Tools for Windows\' needs to be installed to have these tools working. Also the PATH environment variable should contain the location of jvm.dll used by the target process or the location from which the Crash Dump file was produced."On Linux, you can get ELF header information by using either of the following two commands:o/p:\nELF 64-bit LSB executable, AMD x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), for GNU/Linux 2.4.0, dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.4.0, not strippedoro/p:\nClass:                             ELF64Under Windows 7 in the "Control Panel" under "Programs | Programs and Features" the 64-bit variants of JRE & JDK are listed with "64-bit" in  parentheses (e.g. "Java SE Development Kit 7 Update 65 (64-Bit)"), while for the 32-bit variants the variant is not mentioned in parentheses (e.g. just "Java SE Development Kit 8 Update 60"). If you are using JNA, you can check whether com.sun.jna.Native.POINTER_SIZE == 4 (32 bit) or com.sun.jna.Native.POINTER_SIZE == 8 (64 bit).If its not too late, you can also try using JMX like this..
