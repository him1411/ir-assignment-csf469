This question already has an answer here:I have a code base which I want to push to GitHub as open source. In this git-controlled source tree, I have certain configuration files which contain passwords. I made sure not to track this file and I also added it to the .gitignore file. However, I want to be absolutely positive that no sensitive information is going to be pushed, perhaps if something slipped in-between commits or something. I doubt I was careless enough to do this, but I want to be positive.Is there a way to "grep" all of git? I know that sounds weird, but by "all" I guess I mean every version of very file that ever was. I guess if there is a command that dumps the diff file for every commit, that might work?Git can search diffs with the -S option (it\'s called pickaxe in the docs)This will find any commit that added or removed the string password. Here a few options:Try the following commands to search the string inside all previous tracked files:or which needs to be run from the parent directory where you\'d like to do the searching.
