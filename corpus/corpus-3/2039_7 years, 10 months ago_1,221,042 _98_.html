Windows\'s Snipping tool can capture the screen, but sometimes I want to capture the screen after 5 seconds, such as taking an image being displayed by the webcam.  (run the script and smile at the camera, for example).So in Ruby, I could do something likebut not all computer has Ruby, so how do I do that in a .bat file?  (something that is runnable on most PC with Snipping tool).The problem is that there is no "sleep" usable in a .bat file.One hack I have seen is to (mis)use the ping command:127.0.0.1 is the localhost IP address.\n-n 6 There is a 1s delay between each ping, so for a 5s delay you need to do 6 pings.\nnul gobble the output.  I\'m very surprised no one has mentioned:N.B. Please note however (thanks Dan!) that timeout 5 means:Sleep anywhere between 4 and 5 secondsThis can be verified empirically by putting the following into a batch file, running it repeatedly and calculating the time differences between the first and second echos:Try the Choice command.  It\'s been around since MSDOS 6.0, and should do the trick. Use the /T parameter to specify the timeout in seconds and the /D parameter to specify the default selection and ignore then selected choice.The one thing that might be an issue is if the user types one of the choice characters before the timeout period elapses. A partial work-around is to obfuscate the situation -- use the /N argument to hide the list of valid choices and only have 1 character in the set of choices so it will be less likely that the user will type a valid choice before the timeout expires. Below is the help text on Windows Vista. I think it is the same on XP, but look at the help text on an XP computer to verify.You can make it with timeout: This will be visible: timeout 5This will not be visible timeout 5 >nulIf you\'ve got PowerShell on your system, you can just execute this command:Edit: people raised an issue where the amount of time powershell takes to start is significant compared to how long you\'re trying to wait for. If the accuracy of the wait time is important (ie a second or two extra delay is not acceptable), you can use this approach:This takes the time when the windows command was issued, and the powershell script sleeps until 5 seconds after that time. So as long as powershell takes less time to start than your sleep duration, this approach will work (it\'s around 600ms on my machine).Can\'t we do waitfor /T 180?waitfor /T 180 pause will result in "ERROR: Timed out waiting for \'pause\'." waitfor /T 180 pause >nul  will sweep that "error" under the rugThe waitfor command should be there in Windows OS after Win95In the past I\'ve downloaded a executable named sleep that will work on the command line after you put it in your path.For example: sleep shutdown -r -f /m \\\\yourmachine\nalthough shutdown now has -t option built inTimeout /t 1 >nulIs like pause in 1 secound, you can take the limed to almost 100.000 (99.999) secounds.\nIf you are connected to the internet the best solution would be:ping 1.1.1.1. -n 1 -w 1000 >nulWhen you ping you count in milliseconds, so one second would be 1000 milliseconds. But the ping command is a little iffy, it does not work the same way on offline machines.\nThe problem is that the machine gets confused because it is offline, and it would like to ping a website/server/host/ip, but it can\'t.\nSo i would recommend timeout.\nGood luck!SLEEP 5 was included in some of the Windows Resource Kits.TIMEOUT 5 was included in some of the Windows Resource Kits, but is now a standard command in Windows 7 and 8 (not sure about Vista).PING 1.1.1.1 -n 1 -w 5000 >NUL For any MS-DOS or Windows version with a TCP/IP client, PING can be used to delay execution for a number of seconds.NETSH badcommand (Windows XP/Server 2003 only) or CHOICEthis link will help you more.I was trying to do this from within an msbuild task, and choice and timeout both did not work due to I/O redirection. I ended up using sleep.exe from http://sourceforge.net/projects/unxutils, which is nice because it doesn\'t require any install and it\'s tiny.Trying with choice:Results in:Trying with timeout:Results in:Aside:I am actually using <Exec Command="sleep 2 & dbghost.exe" /> because I am executing dbghost.exe multiple times in parallel and it creates temp files/databases based on the current epoch time in seconds - which of course means if you start multiple instances, each uses the same temp name. I was originally trying to use MSBuild Extension Pack Thread.Sleep command, but it seems that (usually) it was running the sleep task fine, but then starting the <exec> task in all threads at the same time, and of course dbghost.exe would fail with conflicts. So far, using sleep.exe seems to be more reliable.Two answers:Firstly, to delay in a batch file, simply without all the obtuse methods people have been proposing:http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754891.aspxSecondly, worth mentioning that while it may not do exactly what you want, using the inbuilt Windows snipping tool, you can trigger a snip on it without using the mouse. Run the snipping tool, escape out of the current snip but leave the tool running, and hit Control + Print Screen when you want the snip to occur. This shouldn\'t interfere with whatever it is you\'re trying to snip.You can use VBScript, for example, file myscript.vbs: Batch file: I made this. It is working and show time left in seconds. If you want to use it, add to a batch file:It was working when I tested it.Listing of wait.bat (it must be in the working directory or windir/system32/):This is the latest version of what I am using in practice for a ten second pause to see the output when a script finishes.The echo done allows me to see when the script finished and the ping provides the delay. The extra @ signs mean that I see the "done" text and the waiting occurs without me being distracted by their commands.I have tried the various solutions given here on an XP machine, since the idea was to have a batch file that would run on a variety of machines, and so I picked the XP machine as the environment likely to be the least capable.This seemed to give a three second delay as expected. One ping attempt lasting a specified 3 seconds.This took around 10 seconds (not 5). My explanation is that there are 5 ping attempts, each about a second apart, making 4 seconds. And each ping attempt probably lasted around a second making an estimated 9 seconds in total.Commands not available.I tried the above too, after reading that comments could be added to BAT files by using two consecutive colons. However the software returned almost instantly. Putting the comment on its own line before the ping worked fine.To understand better what ping does in practice, I ran This took around 30 seconds, even though 5*5=25. My explanation is that there are 5 ping attempts each lasting 5 seconds, but there is about a 1 second time delay between ping attempts: there is after all little reason to expect a different result if you ping again immediately and it is better to give a network a little time to recover from whatever problem it has had.Edit: stolen from another post, .. RFC 3330 says the IP address 192.0.2.0 should not appear on the internet, so pinging this address prevents these tests spamming anyone!\nI have modified the text above accordingly!By using "ping" the -n will determine the timeout only when there is no response to the ping.\nCheck out this post about implementing DELAY as a batch file. DELAY command implemented as a Batch FileI could just copy-paste the important bits, but the whole post is quite useful.An improvement of the code proposed by the user Aacini, It has resolution of hundredths of a second and does not fail when the time reaches 23:59:59,99:I use the following method entirely based on WindowsÂ XP capabilities to do a delay in a batch file:You may also insert the day in the calculation so the method also works when the delay interval pass over midnight.The easiest way I did it was this:Download the Sleep.exe at http://www.sleepcmd.com/. The .exe file should be in the same folder as the program you wrote!It can be done with two simple lines in a batch file: write a temporary .vbs file in the %temp% folder and call it: in case your LAN adapter is not available.two more ways that should work on everything from XP and above:with w32tm wtih typeperf:If you have an appropriate version of Windows and the Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit Tools, it includes a sleep command for batch programs.  More at: http://malektips.com/xp_dos_0002.htmlWell this works if you have choice or ping.just name it sleep.cmd or sleep.bat and run itOn newer Windows OS versions you can use the commandin a DOS script (.cmd or .bat) to wait for 2s (2000 ms - substitute the time in ms you need). Be careful to include the /w argument - without it the whole computer is put to sleep! You can use -m instead of /m if you wish and optionally a colon (:) between the w and the number.In Windows xp sp3 you can use sleep commandping waits for about 5 seconds before timing out, not 1 second as was stated above.\nThat is, unless you tell it to only wait for 1 second before timing out.ping 1.0.0.1 -n 1 -w 1000will ping once, wait only 1 second (1000 ms) for a response, then time out.So an approximately 20-second delay would be:ping 1.0.0.1 -n 20 -w 1000Make a cmd file called sleep.cmd:Copy sleep.cmd to c:\\windows\\system32Usage:Sleeps for 0.5 seconds. Arguments in ms. Once copied to System32, can be used everywhere. EDIT: You should also be away that if the machine isn\'t connected to a network (say a portable that your using in the subway), the ping trick doesn\'t really work anymore.I wrote a powerbasic program wait.exe, where you pass a millisecond parameter to it in your batch filethe code for the EXE:I think the following command can help:The syntax of the pause command is:\npause d  \\\\where d represents the duration  in secondsI am using Windows 7 (32 bit), but I don\'t know about the others.This should do the trick:\nchoice /T 5 /N /D YReplace the 5 with the time in seconds you want to wait...
