Imagine that you want to develop a non-trivial end-user desktop (not web) application in Python. What is the best way to structure the project\'s folder hierarchy?Desirable features are ease of maintenance, IDE-friendliness, suitability for source control branching/merging, and easy generation of install packages.In particular:Doesn\'t too much matter.  Whatever makes you happy will work.  There aren\'t a lot of silly rules because Python projects can be simple.And the top-level directory can contain README\'s, Config\'s and whatnot.The hard choice is whether or not to use a /src tree.  Python doesn\'t have a distinction between /src, /lib, and /bin like Java or C has.Since a top-level /src directory is seen by some as meaningless, your top-level directory can be the top-level architecture of your application.I recommend putting all of this under the "name-of-my-product" directory.  So, if you\'re writing an application named quux, the directory that contains all this stuff is named  /quux.Another project\'s PYTHONPATH, then, can include /path/to/quux/foo to reuse the QUUX.foo module.  In my case, since I use Komodo Edit, my IDE cuft is a single .KPF file.  I actually put that in the top-level /quux directory, and omit adding it to SVN.According to Jean-Paul Calderone\'s Filesystem structure of a Python project:This blog post by Jean-Paul Calderone is commonly given as an answer in #python on Freenode.Do:Don\'t:Check out Open Sourcing a Python Project the Right Way.Let me excerpt the project layout part of that excellent article:When setting up a project, the layout (or directory structure) is important to get right. A sensible layout means that potential contributors don\'t have to spend forever hunting for a piece of code; file locations are intuitive. Since we\'re dealing with an existing project, it means you\'ll probably need to move some stuff around.Let\'s start at the top. Most projects have a number of top-level files (like setup.py, README.md, requirements.txt, etc). There are then three directories that every project should have:As you can see, there are some top level files, a docs directory (generated is an empty directory where sphinx will put the generated documentation), a sandman directory, and a test directory under sandman.It\'s worth reading through Python\'s documentation on packaging, too.http://docs.python.org/tutorial/modules.html#packagesAlso make sure you\'re familiar with the rest of the information on that page.Try starting the project using the python_boilerplate template. It largely follows the best practices (e.g. those here), but is better suited in case you find yourself willing to split your project into more than one egg at some point (and believe me, with anything but the simplest projects, you will. One common situation is where you have to use a locally-modified version of someone else\'s library).Where do you put the source?Where do you put application startup scripts?Where do you put the IDE project cruft?Where do you put the unit/acceptance tests?Where do you put non-Python data such as config files?Documentation would typically go into PROJECT_ROOT/doc or PROJECT_ROOT/src/<egg_name>/doc (this depends on whether you regard some of the eggs to be a separate large projects). Some additional configuration will be in files like PROJECT_ROOT/buildout.cfg and PROJECT_ROOT/setup.cfg.In my experience, it\'s just a matter of iteration.  Put your data and code wherever you think they go.  Chances are, you\'ll be wrong anyway.  But once you get a better idea of exactly how things are going to shape up, you\'re in a much better position to make these kinds of guesses.As far as extension sources, we have a Code directory under trunk that contains a directory for python and a directory for various other languages.  Personally, I\'m more inclined to try putting any extension code into its own repository next time around.With that said, I go back to my initial point:  don\'t make too big a deal out of it.  Put it somewhere that seems to work for you.  If you find something that doesn\'t work, it can (and should) be changed.Non-python data is best bundled inside your Python modules using the package_data support in setuptools. One thing I strongly recommend is using namespace packages to create shared namespaces which multiple projects can use -- much like the Java convention of putting packages in com.yourcompany.yourproject (and being able to have a shared com.yourcompany.utils namespace).Re branching and merging, if you use a good enough source control system it will handle merges even through renames; Bazaar is particularly good at this.Contrary to some other answers here, I\'m +1 on having a src directory top-level (with doc and test directories alongside). Specific conventions for documentation directory trees will vary depending on what you\'re using; Sphinx, for instance, has its own conventions which its quickstart tool supports.Please, please leverage setuptools and pkg_resources; this makes it much easier for other projects to rely on specific versions of your code (and for multiple versions to be simultaneously installed with different non-code files, if you\'re using package_data).The "Python Packaging Authority" has a sampleproject:https://github.com/pypa/sampleprojectIt is a sample project that exists as an aid to the Python Packaging User Guide\'s Tutorial on Packaging and Distributing Projects.
