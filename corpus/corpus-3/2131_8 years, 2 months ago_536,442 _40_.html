I\'m trying to get my commit-build.bat to execute other .BAT files as part of our build process.Content of commit-build.bat:This seems simple enough, but commit-build.bat only executes the first item in the list (msbuild.bat).I have run each of the files separately with no problems.use When not using CALL, the current batch file stops and the called batch file starts executing. It\'s a peculiar behavior dating back to the early MS-DOS daysAll the other answers are correct: use call. for example:HistoryIn ancient dos versions it was not possible to recursively execute batch files. Then the call command was introduced that called another cmd shell to execute the batch file and returned execution back to the calling cmd shell when finished.Obviously in later versions no other cmd shell was necessary anymore.In the early days many batch files depended on the fact that calling a batch file would not return to the calling batch file. Changing that behaviour without additional syntax would have broken many systems like batch menu systems (using batch files for menu structures).As in many cases with Microsoft, backward compatibility therefore is the reason for this behaviour.TipsIf your batch files have spaces in their names, use quotes around the name:By the way: if you do not have all the names of the batch files, you could also use for to do this: (does not guarantee the correct order of batch file calls, follows order of file system)You can also react on errorlevels after a call. Use to give back an errorlevel. 0 denotes correct execution. In the calling batch file you can react usingUse if errorlevel 1 if you have a an older Windows then NT4/2000/XP to catch all errorlevels 1 and greater.To control the flow of a batch file, there is goto :-(As others pointed out: have a look at build systems to replace batch files.If we want to open multiple command prompt  then we shd use/k: is compulsory which will execute.launching many command propmts can be done as below.try To call a .bat file within a .bat file, use(Yes, this is silly, it would make more sense if you could call it with foo.bat, like you could from the command prompt, but the correct way is to use call.)You are calling multiple batches in an effort to compile a program.\nI take for granted that if an error occurs:\n1) The program within the batch will exit with an errorlevel;\n2) You want to know about it.\'||\' tests for an errorlevel higher than 0.  This way all batches are called in order but will stop at any error, leaving the screen as it is for you to see any error message.If we have 2 batch script aaa.bat & bbb.bat and call like belowWhen execute the script, It will call aaa.bat first and wait for the thread of aaa.bat terminate then will call bbb.batBut if you don\'t want to wait aaa.bat terminate to call bbb.bat, try to use START commandExam:looking at your filenames, have you considered using a build tool like nant or ant (the java version).  You\'ll get a lot more control than bat filesIf that doesn\'t work, replace start with call or try this:If you want to open many batch files at once you can use the call command however the call command closes the current bat file and goes to another if you want to open many at once you may want to try thisand so on or repeat start cmd "call..." for however many files. this works for WIN 7 not sure about other systems.Running multiple scripts in one I had the same issue.  I kept having it die on the first one not realizing that it was exiting on the first script.I removed all 11 of my scripts EXIT lines and tried again and all 11 ran in order one at a time in the same command window.Just use the call command! Here is an example:Cheers!
