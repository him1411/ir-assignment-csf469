I\'m not talking about window.location.hash, et al. If the above exists the answer to this question will be untrue.You can now do this in most "modern" browsers!Here is the original article I read (posted July 10, 2010): HTML5: Changing the browser-URL without refreshing page.For a more in-depth look into pushState/replaceState/popstate (aka the HTML5 History API) see the MDN docs.TL;DR, you can do this:See my answer to Modify the URL without reloading the page for a basic how-to.Changing only what\'s after hash - old browsersChanging full URL (the domain and protocol must be the same as original!) Chrome, Firefox, IE10+The above will add a new entry to the history so you can press Back button to go to the previous state. To change the URL in place without adding a new entry to history useTry running these in the console now!Update to Davids answer to even detect browsers doesn\'t support pushstate:
