Is it possible to deploy a website using git push? I have a hunch it has something to do with using git hooks to perform a git reset --hard on the server side, but how would I go about accomplishing this?I found this script on this site and it seems to work quite well.On your local copy, modify your .git/config file and add your web server as a remote:On the server, replace .git/hooks/post-update with this file (in the answer below)Add execute access to the file (again, on the server):Now, just locally push to your web server and it should automatically update the working copy:Using the post-update file below:On your local copy, modify your .git/config file and add your web server as a remote:On the server, replace .git/hooks/post-update with file belowAdd execute access to the file (again, on the server):Now, just locally push to your web server and it should automatically update the working copy:After many false starts and dead ends, I\'m finally able to deploy website code with just "git push remote" thanks to this article. The author\'s post-update script is only one line long and his solution doesn\'t require .htaccess configuration to hide the Git repo as some others do.\n\nA couple of stumbling blocks if you\'re deploying this on an Amazon EC2 instance; 1) If you use sudo to create the bare destination repository, you have to change the owner of the repo to ec2-user or the push will fail. (Try "chown ec2-user:ec2-user repo.")2) The push will fail if you don\'t pre-configure the location of your amazon-private-key.pem, either in /etc/ssh/ssh_config as an IdentityFile parameter or in ~/.ssh/config using the "[Host] - HostName - IdentityFile - User" layout described here... ...HOWEVER if Host is configured in ~/.ssh/config and different than HostName the Git push will fail.  (That\'s probably a Git bug)dont install git on a server or copy the .git folder there. to update a server from a git clone you can use following command:you might have to delete files which got removed from the project.this copies all the checked in files. rsync uses ssh which is installed on a server anyways.the less software you have installed on a server the more secure he is and the easier it is to manage it\'s configuration and document it. there is also no need to keep a complete git clone on the server. it only makes it more complex to secure everything properly.In essence all you need to do are the following:I have those lines in my application as an executable called deploy.so when I want to do a deploy I type ./deploy myserver mybranch.The way I do it is I have a bare Git repository on my deployment server where I push changes. Then I log in to the deployment server, change to the actual web server docs directory, and do a git pull. I don\'t use any hooks to try to do this automatically, that seems like more trouble than it\'s worth.receive.denyCurrentBranch updateInstead added in Git 2.3 is a possibility.Set it on the server repository, and it also updates the working tree if it is clean.There have been further improvements in 2.4 with the push-to-checkout hook and handling of unborn branches.Sample usage:Output:This does have the following shortcomings mentioned on the GitHub announcement:But all of those points are out of the scope of Git and must be taken care of by external code. So in that sense, this, together with Git hooks, are the ultimate solution.Update: I\'m now using Lloyd Moore solution with the key agent ssh -A .... Pushing to a main repo and then pulling from it in parallel from all your machines is a bit faster and requires less setup on those machines.Not seeing this solution here. just push via ssh if git is installed on the server.You\'ll need the following entry in your local .git/configBut hey, whats that with amazon:? In your local ~/.ssh/config you\'ll need to add the following entry:now you can call(BTW: /path/to/project.git is different to the actual working directory /path/to/project)We use capistrano for managing deploy.\nWe build capistrano to deploy on a staging server, and then running a rsync with all of ours server.With capistrano, we can made easy rollback in case of bug In our scenario we\'re storing the code on github/bitbucket and want to deploy to live servers.\nIn this case the following combination works for us (that is a remix of the highly upvoted answers here):On remote: nano .git/hooks/post-receive and add this content:#!/bin/sh\nGIT_WORK_TREE=/var/www/vhosts/example.org git checkout -fOn remote: chmod +x .git/hooks/post-receiveIf your .git folder is within document root make sure you hide it from the outside by adding to .htaccess (source):RedirectMatch 404 /\\..*$Giddyup are language-agnostic just-add-water git hooks to automate deployment via git push. It also allows you to have custom start/stop hooks for restarting web server, warming up cache etc.https://github.com/mpalmer/giddyupCheck out examples.Sounds like you should have two copies on your server. A bare copy, that you can push/pull from, which your would push your changes when you\'re done, and then you would clone this into you web directory and set up a cronjob to update git pull from your web directory every day or so.You could conceivably set up a git hook that when say a commit is made to say the "stable" branch it will pull the changes and apply them to the PHP site. The big downside is you won\'t have much control if something goes wrong and it will add time to your testing - but you can get an idea of how much work will be involved when you merge say your trunk branch into the stable branch to know how many conflicts you may run into. It will be important to keep an eye on any files that are site specific (eg. configuration files) unless you solely intend to only run the one site.Alternatively have you looked into pushing the change to the site instead?For information on git hooks see the githooks documentation.My take on Christians solution.I am using the following solution by toroid.org, which has a simpler hook script. on the server: and install the hook on the server: on your client: then to publish, just typeThere is a full description on the website: http://toroid.org/ams/git-website-howtoAs complementary answer I would like to offer an alternative. I\'m using git-ftp and it works fine.https://github.com/git-ftp/git-ftpEasy to use, only type:   and git will automatically upload project files.RegardsGiven an environment where you have multiple developers accessing the same repository the following guidelines may help.Ensure that you have a unix group that all devs belong to and give ownership of the .git repository to that group.In the .git/config of the server repository set sharedrepository = true. (This tells git to allow multiple users which is needed for commits and deployment.set the umask of each user in their bashrc files to be the same - 002 is a good start I ended up creating my own rudimentary deployment tool which would automatically pull down new updates from the repo - https://github.com/jesalg/SlimJim - Basically it listens to the github post-receive-hook and uses a proxy to trigger an update script.I use two solutions for post-receive hook:DEPLOY SOLUTION 1 DEPLOY SOLUTION 2 Both solutions are based on earlier solutions available in this thread.Note, the \nBRANCH_REGEX=\'^${GIT_BRANCH1}.$\'\nfilters for the branch names matching "master" or "dev*" string, and deploys the work tree, if the pushed branch matches.\nThis makes possible to deploy a dev version and master version to different places.DEPLOY SOLUTION 1 removes only files, which are part of the repo, and was removed by a commit. It is faster than Deployment Solution 2.DEPLOY SOLUTION 2 has the advantage, that it will remove any new files from the production directory, which was added on server side, no matter if it was added to the repo or not. It will be always clean dupe of the repo. It is slower than Deployment Solution 1.
