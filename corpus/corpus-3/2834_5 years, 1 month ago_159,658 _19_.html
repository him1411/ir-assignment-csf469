Is there a way to subscribe to events on multiple objects using $watchE.g.Starting from AngularJS 1.3 there\'s a new method called $watchGroup for observing a set of expressions.Beginning with AngularJS 1.1.4 you can use $watchCollection:Plunker example hereDocumentation here$watch first parameter can also be a function.If your two combined values are simple, the first parameter is just an angular expression normally.  For example, firstName and lastName:Here\'s a solution very similar to your original pseudo-code that actually works:EDIT: Okay, I think this is even better:Basically we\'re skipping the json step, which seemed dumb to begin with, but it wasn\'t working without it.  They key is the often omitted 3rd parameter which turns on object equality as opposed to reference equality.   Then the comparisons between our created array objects actually work right.Why not simply wrap it in a forEach?It\'s about the same overhead as providing a function for the combined value, without actually having to worry about the value composition.A slightly safer solution to combine values might be to use the following as your $watch function:or You can use functions in $watchGroup to select fields of an object in scope.$watch first parameter can be angular expression or function. See documentation on $scope.$watch. It contains a lot of useful info about how $watch method works: when watchExpression is called, how angular compares results, etc.how about:Here function will get called when both age and name value get changed.
