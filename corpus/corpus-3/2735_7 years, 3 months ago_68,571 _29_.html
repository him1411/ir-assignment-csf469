I just made a perfectly good commit to the wrong branch.\nHow do I undo the last commit in my master branch and then take those same changes and get them into my upgrade branch?If you haven\'t yet pushed your changes, you can also do a soft reset:This will revert the commit, but put the committed changes back into your index. Assuming the branches are relatively up-to-date with regard to each other, git will let you do a checkout into the other branch, whereupon you can simply commit:The disadvantage is that you need to re-enter your commit message.To rollback one commit (make sure you note the commit\'s hash for the next step):To pull that commit into a different branch:Also note that git reset --hard will kill any untracked and modified changes you might have, so if you have those you might prefer:4 years late on the topic, but this might be helpful to someone.If you forgot to create a new branch before committing and committed all on master, no matter how many commits you did, the following approach is easier:Now you have your master branch equals to origin/master and all new commits are on my_feature. Note that my_feature is a local branch, not a remote one.If you already pushed your changes, you will need to force your next push after resetting the HEAD. Warning: a hard reset will undo any uncommitted modifications in your working copy, while a force push will completely overwrite the state of the remote branch with the current state of the local branch.Just in case, on Windows (using the Windows command line, not Bash) it\'s actually four ^^^^ instead of one, so it\'s So if your scenario is that you\'ve committed to master but meant to commit to another-branch (which may or not may not already exist) but you haven\'t pushed yet, this is pretty easy to fix.Now all your commits to master will be on another-branch.Sourced with love from: http://haacked.com/archive/2015/06/29/git-migrate/I recently did the same thing, where I accidentally committed a change to master, when I should have committed to other-branch. But I didn\'t push anything. If you just committed to the wrong branch, and have not changed anything since, and have not pushed to the repo, then you can do the following:NOTE: in the above example, I was rewinding 1 commit with git reset HEAD~1. But if you wanted to rewind n commits, then you can do git reset HEAD~n.Also, if you ended up committing to the wrong branch, and also ended up write some more code before realizing that you committed to the wrong branch, then you could use git stash to save your in-progress work:NOTE: I used this website as a reference\nhttps://www.clearvision-cm.com/blog/what-to-do-when-you-commit-to-the-wrong-git-branch/If the branch you wanted to apply your changes to already exists (branch develop, for example), follow the instructions that were provided by fotanus below, then: And obviously you could use tempbranch or any other branch name instead of my_feature if you wanted. Also, if applicable, delay the stash pop (apply) until after you\'ve merged at your target branch.If you run into this issue and you have Visual Studio, you can do the following:Right-click on your branch and select View History:Right-click on commit you want to go back to. And Revert or Reset as needed.
