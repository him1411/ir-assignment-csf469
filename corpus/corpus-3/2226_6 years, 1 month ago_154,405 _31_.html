I know what CSS Reset is, but recently I heard about this new thing called Normalize.cssWhat is the difference between Normalize.css and Reset CSS?What is the difference between normalizing CSS and resetting CSS?Is it just a new buzz word for the CSS Reset?I work on normalize.css.The main differences are:Normalize.css preserves useful defaults rather than "unstyling" everything. For example, elements like sup or sub "just work" after including normalize.css (and are actually made more robust) whereas they are visually indistinguishable from normal text after including reset.css. So, normalize.css does not impose a visual starting point (homogeny) upon you. This may not be to everyone\'s taste. The best thing to do is experiment with both and see which gels with your preferences.Normalize.css corrects some common bugs that are out of scope for reset.css. It has a wider scope than reset.css, and also provides bug fixes for common problems like: display settings for HTML5 elements, the lack of font inheritance by form elements, correcting font-size rendering for pre, SVG overflow in IE9, and the button styling bug in iOS.Normalize.css doesn\'t clutter your dev tools. A common irritation when using reset.css is the large inheritance chain that is displayed in browser CSS debugging tools. This is not such an issue with normalize.css because of the targeted stylings.Normalize.css is more modular. The project is broken down into relatively independent sections, making it easy for you to potentially remove sections (like the form normalizations) if you know they will never be needed by your website.Normalize.css has better documentation. The normalize.css code is documented inline as well as more comprehensively in the GitHub Wiki. This means you can find out what each line of code is doing, why it was included, what the differences are between browsers, and more easily run your own tests. The project aims to help educate people on how browsers render elements by default, and make it easier for them to be involved in submitting improvements.I\'ve written in greater detail about this in an article about normalize.cssThe major difference is that:CSS resets aim to remove all built-in browser styling. Standard elements like H1-6, p, strong, em, et cetera end up looking exactly alike, having no decoration at all. You\'re then supposed to add all decoration yourself.Normalize CSS aims to make built-in browser styling consistent across browsers. Elements like H1-6 will appear bold, larger et cetera in a consistent way across browsers. You\'re then supposed to add only the difference in decoration your design needs.If your design a) follows common conventions for typography et cetera, and b) Normalize.css works for your target audience, then using Normalize.CSS instead of a CSS reset will make your own CSS smaller and faster to write.Normalize.css is mainly a set of styles, based on what it\'s author thought would look good, and make it look consistent across browsers. Reset basically strips styling from elements so you have more control over the styling of everything.I use both.some styles from Reset, some from Normalize.css. For example, from Normalize.css, there\'s a style to make sure all input elements have the same font, which doesn\'t occur (between text inputs and textareas). Reset has no such style, so inputs have different fonts, which is not normally wanted.So bascially, using the two CSS files does a better job \'Equalizing\' everything ;)regards!Well from its description it appears it tries to make the user agent\'s default style consistent across all browsers rather than stripping away all the default styling as a reset would.Preserves useful defaults, unlike many CSS resets.resetting seems a necessity to meet custom design specifications, especially on complex, non-boilerplate type design  projects. It sounds as though normalizing is a good way to proceed with purely web programming in mind, but oftentimes websites are a marriage between web programming and UI/UX design rules. First reset.css is the worst library you can use, because it removes the standard structure of HTML and displays everything you write just as text, after assigning the values of margin padding and other attributes to 0. So for example you will find that <H1>, will be the same as <H6>.On the other hand Normalize.css uses the standard structure and also fixes almost all the errors existing in it. For example it fixes the problem with showing a form from one browser to another. Normalize fixes this by modifying this features so your elements will be shown the same on all browsers. Sometimes, the best solution is to use both.  Sometimes, it is to use neither.  And sometimes, it is to use one or the other.  If you want all the styles, including margin and padding reset across all browsers, use reset.css. Then apply all decorations and stylings yourself.  If you simply like the built-in stylings but want more cross-browser synchronicity i.e. normalizations then use normalize.css. But if you choose to use both reset.css and normalize.css, link the reset.css stylesheet first and then the normalize.css stylesheet (immediately) afterwards.  Sometimes it\'s not always a matter of which is better, but when to use which one versus when to use both versus when to use neither.
