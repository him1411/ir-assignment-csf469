Is there anything like .NET\'s NotImplementedException in Java?Commons Lang has it. Or you could throw an UnsupportedOperationException.I think the java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException is what you are looking for.You could do it yourself (thats what I did) - in order to not be bothered with exception handling, you simply extend the RuntimeException, your class could look something like this:You could extend it to take a message - but if you use the method as I do (that is, as a reminder, that there is still something to be implemented), then usually there is no need for additional messages.I dare say, that I only use this method, while I am in the process of developing a system, makes it easier for me to not lose track of which methods are still not implemented properly :)No there isn\'t and it\'s probably not there, because there are very few valid uses for it. I would think twice before using it. Also, it is indeed easy to create yourself.Please refer to this discussion about why it\'s even in .NET.I guess UnsupportedOperationException comes close, although it doesn\'t say the operation is just not implemented, but unsupported even. That could imply no valid implementation is possible. Why would the operation be unsupported? Should it even be there? \nInterface segregation or Liskov substitution issues maybe?If it\'s work in progress I\'d go for ToBeImplementedException, but I\'ve never caught myself defining a concrete method and then leave it for so long it makes it into production and there would be a need for such an exception.
