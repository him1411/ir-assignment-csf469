I have this in my package.json file (shortened version):I am using NPM version 1.1.1 on Mac 10.6.8.When I run the following command from the project root, it installs both the dependencies and devDependencies:I was under the impression that this command installed the devDependencies:How do I make it so npm install only installs dependencies (so production environment only gets those modules), while something like npm install --dev installs both dependencies and devDependencies?The npm install command will install the devDependencies along other dependencies when run inside a package directory, in a development environment (the default). To get around this, use npm install --production or set the NODE_ENV environment variable to production.Here is some more info.Edit: As of v3.3.0 of npm (2015-08-13), using npm install --production will throw a warning:Usage of the --production option is deprecated. Use --only=production instead. Use npm install --only=production to install only dependencies, and not devDependencies,regardless of the value of the NODE_ENV environment variable.Reference: npm docs | npm changelogI run into that problem too! npm install is somewhat confusing and web posts keep bringing in the -d/--dev flags as if there is an explicit \'development\' install mode.npm install will install both "dependencies" and "devDependencies"npm install --production will only install "dependencies"npm install --dev will only install "devDependencies"The new option is:If you want to install only devDependencies:If you read this POST in 2016, please achieve what you want by usingargument will cause either only devDependencies or only non-devDependencies to be installed regardless of the NODE_ENV.from: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/installWhen using "npm install" the modules are loaded and available throughout your application regardless of if they are "devDependencies" or "dependencies". Sum of this idea: everything which your package.json defines as a dependency (any type) gets installed to node_modules.The purpose for the difference between dependencies/devDependencies/optionalDependencies is what consumers of your code can do w/ npm to install these resources.Per the documentation: https://npmjs.org/doc/json.html...If someone is planning on downloading and using your module in their\n  program, then they probably don\'t want or need to download and build\n  the external test or documentation framework that you use.In this case, it\'s best to list these additional items in a\n  devDependencies hash.These things will be installed whenever the --dev configuration flag\n  is set. This flag is set automatically when doing npm link or when\n  doing npm install from the root of a package, and can be managed like\n  any other npm configuration param. See config(1) for more on the\n  topic.However, to resolve this question, if you want to ONLY install the "dependencies" using npm, the following command is:This can be confirmed by looking at the Git commit which added this filter (along with some other filters [listed below] to provide this functionality).Alternative filters which can be used by npm:@dmarr try using npm install --productionnpm will install dev dependencies when installing from inside a package (if there is a package.json in the current directory).  If it is from another location (npm registry, git repo, different location on the filesystem) it only installs the dependencies.If you have already installed all your dependencies, and you want to avoid having to download your production packages from NPM again, you can simply type:This will remove your dev dependencies from your node_modules folder, which is helpful if you\'re trying to automate a two step process likeRunning npm prune in between will save you from having to reinstall everything!Need to add to chosen answer: As of now, npm install in a package directory (containing package.json) will install devDependencies, whereas npm install -g will not install them.I have found that, when trying to install dev dependencies for a package that contains a node addon, you cannot avoid building the addon when running npm install --dev even if you just want to install the devDependencies. So, I had to go around npm\'s back:Or, better (and more succinctly) yet,Use npm install packageName --save this will add package in dependencies, if you use npm install packageName --save-dev then it devDependencies.npm install packageName --save-dev should be used for adding packages for development purpose. Like adding TDD packages (Chai, mocha, etc). Which are used in development and not in production.  It\'s worth mentioning that you can use the NODE_ENV environment variable to achieve the same result. Particularly useful if you\'re containerizing your Node application (e.g. Docker).The above code will install all your dependencies but the dev ones (i.e. devDependencies).if you need to use environment variables in your Dockerfile more information can be found here.Environment variables are easy to overwrite whenever needed (e.g. if you want to run your test suite say on Travis CI). If that were the case you could do something like this:NPM Documentation hereproductionType: Boolean\n  Set to true to run in "production" mode.Happy containerization =)Now there is a problem, if you have package-lock.json with npm 5+. You have to remove it before use of npm install --production.
