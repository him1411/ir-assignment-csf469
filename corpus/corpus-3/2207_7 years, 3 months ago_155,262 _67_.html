For Visual Studio 2010 Web based application we have Config Transformation features by which we can maintain multiple configuration files for different environments. But the same feature is not available for App.Config files for Windows Services/WinForms or Console Application. There is a workaround available as suggested here: Applying XDT magic to App.Config.However it is not straightforward and requires a number of steps. Is there an easier way to achieve the same for app.config files?This works now with the Visual Studio AddIn treated in this article: SlowCheetah - Web.config Transformation Syntax now generalized for any XML configuration file.You can right-click on your web.config and click "Add Config\n  Transforms." When you do this, you\'ll get a web.debug.config and a\n  web.release.config. You can make a web.whatever.config if you like, as\n  long as the name lines up with a configuration profile. These files\n  are just the changes you want made, not a complete copy of your\n  web.config.You might think you\'d want to use XSLT to transform a web.config, but\n  while they feels intuitively right it\'s actually very verbose.Here\'s two transforms, one using XSLT and the same one using the XML\n  Document Transform syntax/namespace. As with all things there\'s\n  multiple ways in XSLT to do this, but you get the general idea. XSLT\n  is a generalized tree transformation language, while this deployment\n  one is optimized for a specific subset of common scenarios. But, the\n  cool part is that each XDT transform is a .NET plugin, so you can make\n  your own.Or the same thing via the deployment transform:I tried several solutions and here is the simplest I personally found.\nDan pointed out in the comments that the original post belongs to Oleg Sych\xe2\x80\x94thanks, Oleg!Here are the instructions:1. Add an XML file for each configuration to the project.Typically you will have Debug and Release configurations so name your files App.Debug.config and App.Release.config. In my project, I created a configuration for each kind of environment, so you might want to experiment with that.2. Unload project and open .csproj file for editingVisual Studio allows you to edit .csproj files right in the editor\xe2\x80\x94you just need to unload the project first. Then right-click on it and select Edit <ProjectName>.csproj.3. Bind App.*.config files to main App.configFind the project file section that contains all App.config and App.*.config references. You\'ll notice their build actions are set to None:First, set build action for all of them to Content.\nNext, make all configuration-specific files dependant on the main App.config so Visual Studio groups them like it does designer and code-behind files.Replace XML above with the one below:4. Activate transformations magicIn the end of file afterand before finalinsert the following XML:Now you can reload the project, build it and enjoy App.config transformations!FYIMake sure that your App.*.config files have the right setup like this:Another solution I\'ve found is NOT to use the transformations but just have a separate config file, e.g. app.Release.config. Then add this line to your csproj file.This will not only generate the right myprogram.exe.config file but if you\'re using Setup and Deployment Project in Visual Studio to generate MSI, it\'ll force the deployment project to use the correct config file when packaging.In my experience, the things I need to make environment-specific are things like connection strings, appsettings and often smpt settings. The config system allows to specify these things in separate files. So you can use this in your app.config/web.config:What I typically do is to put these config-specific sections in separate files, in a subfolder called ConfigFiles (either in the solution root or at the project level, depends). I define a file per configuration, e.g. smtp.config.Debug and smtp.config.Release.Then you can define a pre-build event like so:In team development, you can tweak this further by including the %COMPUTERNAME% and/or %USERNAME% in the convention.Of course, this implies that the target files (x.config) should NOT be put in source control (since they are generated). You should still add them to the project file and set their output type property to \'copy always\' or \'copy if newer\' though.Simple, extensible, and it works for all types of Visual Studio projects (console, winforms, wpf, web).You can use a separate config file per configuration, e.g. app.Debug.config, app.Release.config and then use the configuration variable in your project file:This will then create the correct ProjectName.exe.config file depending on the configuration you are building in.Inspired by Oleg and others in this question, I took the solution https://stackoverflow.com/a/5109530/2286801 a step further to enable the following.This solution works by performing the app.config transformation before the app.config is referenced for the first time in the MSBuild process. It uses an external targets file for easier management across multiple projects.Similar steps to the other solution. I\'ve quoted what remains the same and included it for completeness and easier comparison.0. Add a new file to your project called AppConfigTransformation.targets1. Add an XML file for each configuration to the project.Typically you will have Debug and Release configurations so name your files App.Debug.config and App.Release.config. In my project, I created a configuration for each kind of enironment so you might want to experiment with that.2. Unload project and open .csproj file for editingVisual Studio allows you to edit .csproj right in the editor\xe2\x80\x94you just need to unload the project first. Then right-click on it and select Edit .csproj.3. Bind App.*.config files to main App.configFind the project file section that contains all App.config and App.*.config references and replace as follows. You\'ll notice we use None instead of Content.4. Activate transformations magicIn the end of file afterand before finalinsert the following XML:Done!I wrote nice extension to automate app.config transformation like the one built in Web Application Project Configuration TransformThe biggest advantage of this extension is that you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to install it on all build machinesI just found extension for VS http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/579d3a78-3bdd-497c-bc21-aa6e6abbc859I\'ve come across the following article which looks a bit simpler but I\'ve not tried it myself.http://fknut.blogspot.com/2009/11/appconfig-transformation-with-new.htmlAlso, there is a feature request on MS Connect which might be worth voting up so this gets included across the board in the next SP or version.https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/564414I solve this problem with this tool http://ctt.codeplex.com/. I use it with CCNet/nAnt script for making packages. Just a little improvement to the solution that seems to be posted everywhere now:I have created another alternative to the one posted by Vishal Joshi where the requirement to change the build action to Content is removed and also implemented basic support for ClickOnce deployment. I say basic, because I didn\'t test it thoroughly but it should work in the typical ClickOnce deployment scenario.The solution consists of a single MSBuild project that once imported to an existent windows application project (*.csproj) extends the build process to contemplate app.config transformation.You can read a more detailed explanation at Visual Studio App.config XML Transformation and the MSBuild project file can be downloaded from GitHub.So I ended up taking a slightly different approach. I followed Dan\'s steps through step 3, but added another file: App.Base.Config. This file contains the configuration settings you want in every generated App.Config. Then I use BeforeBuild (with Yuri\'s addition to TransformXml) to transform the current configuration with the Base config into the App.config. The build process then uses the transformed App.config as normal. However, one annoyance is you kind of want to exclude the ever-changing App.config from source control afterwards, but the other config files are now dependent upon it.If you use a TFS online(Cloud version) and you want to transform the App.Config in a project, you can do the following without installing any extra tools.\nFrom VS => Unload the project => Edit project file => Go to the bottom of the file and add the following:AssemblyFile and Destination works for local use and TFS online(Cloud) server.proposed solution will not work when a class library with config file is referenced from another project (in my case it was Azure worker project library). It will not copy correct transformed file from obj folder into bin\\##configuration-name## folder. To make it work with minimal changes, you need to change AfterCompile target to BeforeCompile:
