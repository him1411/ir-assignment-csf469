Can Chrome\'s built-in JavaScript console display colors?I want errors in red, warnings in orange and console.log\'s in green. Is that possible?In Chrome & Firefox (+31) you can add CSS in console.log messages:The same can be applied for adding multiple CSS to same command.\n\nSource for Google Chrome: Presentation by Paul Irish & Webkit change\nSource for Firefox: Firefox Web Console - Styling MessagesChrome Console API Reference: Console API ReferenceHere is an extreme example with rainbow drop shadow.You can use a custom stylesheet to color your debugger.  You can put this code in C:\\Documents and Settings\\<User Name>\\Local Settings\\Application Data\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\User StyleSheets\\Custom.css if you are in WinXP, but the directory varies by OS.Older versions of Chrome do not allow you to get console.log()s to show in a specific color programmatically, but calling console.error() will put a red X icon on error lines and make the text red, and console.warn() gets you a yellow ! icon.You can then filter console entries with the All, Errors, Warnings, and Logs buttons beneath the console.It turns out Firebug has supported custom CSS for console.logs since 2010 and Chrome support has been added as of Chrome 24.When %c appears anywhere in the first argument, the next argument is used as the CSS to style the console line.  Further arguments are concatenated (as has always been the case).I wrote Console.js https://github.com/icodeforlove/Console.js to allow us to do this a bit easierthen you can just do thisor something like thisthe main advantage is that this will gracefully degrade in all browsers (inspired by nodes https://github.com/marak/colors.js)This library is fantastic:https://github.com/adamschwartz/logUse Markdown for log messages.There are a series of inbuilt functions for coloring the console log:I know It\'s a bit late to answer but as the OP asked to get custom color messages in console for different options. Everyone is passing the color style property in each console.log() statement which confuses the reader by creating complexity in the code and also harm the overall look & feel of the code.What I suggest is to write a function with few predetermined colors (e.g success, error, info, warning, default colors) which will be applied on the basis of the parameter passed to the function. It improves the readability and reduces the complexity in the code. It is too easy to maintain and further extend according to your needs.Given below is a JavaScript function that you have to write once and than use it \nagain and again.The default color is black and you don\'t have to pass any keyword as parameter in that case. In other cases, you should pass success, error, warning, or info keywords for desired results.Here is working JSFiddle. See output in the browser\'s console.Google has documented this\nhttps://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/console-write#styling_console_output_with_css. The CSS format specifier allows you to customize the display in the console. Start the string with the specifier and give the style you wish to apply as the second parameter.One example:template system, useful if you want to create colorful line text without creating full style for every block
