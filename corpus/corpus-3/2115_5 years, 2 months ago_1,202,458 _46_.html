I am working on a search with JavaScript. I would use a form, but it messes up something else on my page. I have this input text field:And this is my JavaScript code:How do I get the value from the text field into JavaScript?There are various methods to get an input textbox value directly (without wrapping the input element inside a form element):Method 1:document.getElementById(\'textbox_id\').value to get the value of\n  desired boxFor example, document.getElementById("searchTxt").value;Â Note: Method 2,3,4 and 6 returns a collection of elements, so use [whole_number] to get the desired occurrence. For the first element, use [0],\n  for the second one use 1, and so on...Method 2:Use\n  document.getElementsByClassName(\'class_name\')[whole_number].value which returns a Live HTMLCollectionFor example, document.getElementsByClassName("searchField")[0].value; if this is the first textbox in your page.Method 3:Use document.getElementsByTagName(\'tag_name\')[whole_number].value which also returns a live HTMLCollectionFor example, document.getElementsByTagName("input")[0].value;, if this is the first textbox in your page.Method 4:document.getElementsByName(\'name\')[whole_number].value which also >returns a live NodeListFor example, document.getElementsByName("searchTxt")[0].value; if this is the first textbox with name \'searchtext\' in your page.Method 5:Use the powerful document.querySelector(\'selector\').value which uses a CSS selector to select the elementFor example, document.querySelector(\'#searchTxt\').value; selected by id \n  document.querySelector(\'.searchField\').value; selected by class \n          document.querySelector(\'input\').value; selected by tagname \n          document.querySelector(\'[name="searchTxt"]\').value; selected by nameMethod 6:document.querySelectorAll(\'selector\')[whole_number].value which also uses a CSS selector to select elements, but it returns all elements with that selector as a static Nodelist.For example, document.querySelectorAll(\'#searchTxt\')[0].value;  selected by id \n   document.querySelectorAll(\'.searchField\')[0].value; selected by class \n   document.querySelectorAll(\'input\')[0].value;        selected by tagname \n   document.querySelectorAll(\'[name="searchTxt"]\')[0].value; selected by nameSupportUseful linksSee this functioning in codepen. I would create a variable to store the input like this:And then I would just use the variable to add the input value to the string.= "Your string" + input;Also you can, call by tags names, like this: form_name.input_name.value;\nSo you will have the specific value of determined input in a specific form.You should be able to type:I\'m sure there are better ways to do this, but this one seems to work across all browsers, and it requires minimal understanding of JavaScript to make, improve, and edit.Try this oneTested in Chrome and Firefox:Get value by element id:Set value in form element:https://jsfiddle.net/tuq79821/Also have a look at a JavaScript calculator implementation: http://www.4stud.info/web-programming/samples/dhtml-calculator.htmlUPDATE from @bugwheels94: when using this method be aware of this issue.If you are using jQuery then by using plugin formInteract, you just need to do this:At bottom of the page just include this plugin file and write this code:Or if using a parameterized URL then use this:Here is the link to project https://bitbucket.org/ranjeet1985/forminteractYou can use this plugin for many purposes like getting the value of a form, putting values into a form, validation of forms and many more. You can see some example of code in the index.html file of the project.Of course I am the author of this project and all are welcome to make it better.
