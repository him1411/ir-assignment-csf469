What tricks do people use to manage the available memory of an interactive R session?  I use the functions below [based on postings by Petr Pikal and David Hinds to the r-help list in 2004] to list (and/or sort) the largest objects and to occassionally rm() some of them. But by far the most effective solution was ... to run under 64-bit Linux with ample memory. Any other nice tricks folks want to share?  One per post, please.Ensure you record your work in a reproducible script.  From time-to-time, reopen R, then source() your script.  You\'ll clean out anything you\'re no longer using, and as an added benefit will have tested your code.I use the data.table package.  With its := operator you can :None of these operations copy the (potentially large) data.table at all, not even once.Related links :Saw this on a twitter post and think it\'s an awesome function by Dirk! Following on from JD Long\'s answer, I would do this for user friendly reading:Which results in something like the following:NOTE: The main part I added was (again, adapted from JD\'s answer) :I couldn\'t think of any other way to get the output from print(...) and so used capture.output(), which I\'m sure is very inefficient :)I love Dirk\'s .ls.objects() script but I kept squinting to count characters in the size column. So I did some ugly hacks to make it present with pretty formatting for the size:I make aggressive use of the subset parameter with selection of only the required variables when passing dataframes to the data= argument of regression functions. It does result in some errors if I forget to add variables to both the formula and the select= vector, but it still saves a lot of time due to decreased copying of objects and reduces the memory footprint significantly. Say I have 4 million records with 110 variables (and I do.) Example:Unfortunately I did not have time to test it extensively but here is a memory tip that I have not seen before. For me the required memory was reduced with more than 50%.\nWhen you read stuff into R with for example read.csv they require a certain amount of memory.\nAfter this you can save them with save("Destinationfile",list=ls())\nThe next time you open R you can use load("Destinationfile")\nNow the memory usage might have decreased.\nIt would be nice if anyone could confirm whether this produces similar results with a different dataset.I quite like the improved objects function developed by Dirk. Much of the time though, a more basic output with the object name and size is sufficient for me. Here\'s a simpler function with a similar objective. Memory use can be ordered alphabetically or by size, can be limited to a certain number of objects, and can be ordered ascending or descending. Also, I often work with data that are 1GB+, so the function changes units accordingly.And here is some example output:That\'s a good trick.  One other suggestion is to use memory efficient objects wherever possible: for instance, use a matrix instead of a data.frame.This doesn\'t really address memory management, but one important function that isn\'t widely known is memory.limit().  You can increase the default using this command, memory.limit(size=2500), where the size is in MB.  As Dirk mentioned, you need to be using 64-bit in order to take real advantage of this.  I never save an R workspace. I use import scripts and data scripts and output any especially large data objects that I don\'t want to recreate often to files. This way I always start with a fresh workspace and don\'t need to clean out large objects. That is a very nice function though.To further illustrate the common strategy of frequent restarts, we can use littler which allows us to run simple expressions directly from the command-line. Here is an example I sometimes use to time different BLAS for a simple crossprod.Likewise,loads the Matrix package (via the --packages | -l switch)  and runs the examples of the spMatrix function.  As r always starts \'fresh\', this method is also a good test during package development.Last but not least r also work great for automated batch mode in scripts using the \'#!/usr/bin/r\' shebang-header.   Rscript is an alternative where littler is unavailable (e.g. on Windows).For both speed and memory purposes, when building a large data frame via some complex series of steps, I\'ll periodically flush it (the in-progress data set being built) to disk, appending to anything that came before, and then restart it. This way the intermediate steps are only working on smallish data frames (which is good as, e.g., rbind slows down considerably with larger objects). The entire data set can be read back in at the end of the process, when all the intermediate objects have been removed.Just to note that data.table package\'s tables() seems to be a pretty good replacement for Dirk\'s .ls.objects() custom function (detailed in earlier answers), although just for data.frames/tables and not e.g. matrices, arrays, lists.I\'m fortunate and my large data sets are saved by the instrument in "chunks" (subsets) of roughly 100 MB (32bit binary). Thus I can do pre-processing steps (deleting uninformative parts, downsampling) sequentially before fusing the data set. Calling gc () "by hand" can help if the size of the data get close to available memory.Sometimes a different algorithm needs much less memory.\nSometimes there\'s a trade off between vectorization and memory use.\ncompare: split & lapply vs. a for loop.For the sake of fast & easy data analysis, I often work first with a small random subset (sample ()) of the data. Once the data analysis script/.Rnw is finished data analysis code and the complete data go to the calculation server for over night / over weekend / ... calculation.The use of environments instead of lists to handle collections of objects which occupy a significant amount of working memory.The reason: each time an element of a list structure is modified, the whole list is temporarily duplicated. This becomes an issue if the storage requirement of the list is about half the available working memory, because then data has to be swapped to the slow hard disk. Environments, on the other hand, aren\'t subject to this behaviour and they can be treated similar to lists.Here is an example:In conjunction with structures such as big.matrix or data.table which allow for altering their content in-place, very efficient memory usage can be achieved.The llfunction in gData package can show the memory usage of each object as well.If you really want to avoid the leaks, you should avoid creating any big objects in the global environment.What I usually do is to have a function that does the job and returns NULL \xe2\x80\x94 all data is read and manipulated in this function or others that it calls.I really appreciate some of the answers above, following @hadley and @Dirk that suggest closing R and issuing source and using command line I come up with a solution that worked very well for me. I had to deal with hundreds of mass spectras, each occupies around 20 Mb of memory so I used two R scripts, as follows:First a wrapper:with this script I basically control what my main script do runConsensus.r, and I write the data answer for the output. With this, each time the wrapper calls the script it seems the R is reopened and the memory is freed.Hope it helps.   This adds nothing to the above, but is written in the simple and heavily commented style that I like. It yields a table with the objects ordered in size , but without some of the detail given in the examples above:As well as the more general memory management techniques given in the answers above, I always try to reduce the size of my objects as far as possible. For example, I work with very large but very sparse matrices, in other words matrices where most values are zero. Using the \'Matrix\' package (capitalisation important) I was able to reduce my average object sizes from ~2GB to ~200MB as simply as:The Matrix package includes data formats that can be used exactly like a regular matrix (no need to change your other code) but are able to store sparse data much more efficiently, whether loaded into memory or saved to disk.Additionally, the raw files I receive are in \'long\' format where each data point has variables x, y, z, i. Much more efficient to transform the data into an x * y * z dimension array with only variable i.Know your data and use a bit of common sense.You also can get some benefit using knitr and puting your script in Rmd chuncks. I usually divide the code in different chunks and select which one will save a checkpoint to cache or to a RDS file, and Over there you can set a chunk to be saved to "cache", or you can decide to run or not a particular chunk. In this way, in a first run you can process only "part 1", another execution you can select only "part 2", etc. Example:As a side effect, this also could save you some headaches in terms of reproducibility :)Runningfrom time to time also helps R to free unused but still not released memory.With only 4GB of RAM (running Windows 10, so make that about 2 or more realistically 1GB) I\'ve had to be real careful with the allocation.I use data.table almost exclusively. The \'fread\' function allows you to subset information by field names on import; only import the fields that are actually needed to begin with. If you\'re using base R read, null the spurious columns immediately after import.As 42- suggests, where ever possible I will then subset within the columns immediately after importing the information. I frequently rm() objects from the environment as soon as they\'re no longer needed, e.g. on the next line after using them to subset something else, and call gc().\'fread\' and \'fwrite\' from data.table can be very fast by comparison with base R reads and writes.As kpierce8 suggests, I almost always fwrite everything out of the environment and fread it back in, even with thousand / hundreds of thousands of tiny files to get through. This not only keeps the environment \'clean\' and keeps the memory allocation low but, possibly due to the severe lack of RAM available, R has a propensity for frequently crashing on my computer; really frequently. Having the information backed up on the drive itself as the code progresses through various stages means I don\'t have to start right from the beginning if it crashes.As of 2017, I think the fastest SSDs are running around a few GB per second through the M2 port. I have a really basic 50GB Kingston V300 (550MB/s) SSD that I use as my primary disk (has Windows and R on it). I keep all the bulk information on a cheap 500GB WD platter. I move the data sets to the SSD when I start working on them. This, combined with \'fread\'ing and \'fwrite\'ing everything has been working out great. I\'ve tried using \'ff\' but prefer the former. 4K read/write speeds can create issues with this though; backing up a quarter of a million 1k files (250MBs worth) from the SSD to the platter can take hours. As far as I\'m aware, there isn\'t any R package available yet that can automatically optimise the \'chunkification\' process; e.g. look at how much RAM a user has, test the read/write speeds of the RAM / all the drives connected and then suggest an optimal \'chunkification\' protocol. This could produce some significant workflow improvements / resource optimisations; e.g. split it to ... MB for the ram -> split it to ... MB for the SSD -> split it to ... MB on the platter -> split it to ... MB on the tape. It could sample data sets beforehand to give it a more realistic gauge stick to work from.A lot of the problems I\'ve worked on in R involve forming combination and permutation pairs, triples etc, which only makes having limited RAM more of a limitation as they will often at least exponentially expand at some point. This has made me focus a lot of attention on the quality as opposed to quantity of information going into them to begin with, rather than trying to clean it up afterwards, and on the sequence of operations in preparing the information to begin with (starting with the simplest operation and increasing the complexity); e.g. subset, then merge / join, then form combinations / permutations etc.There do seem to be some benefits to using base R read and write in some instances. For instance, the error detection within \'fread\' is so good it can be difficult trying to get really messy information into R to begin with to clean it up. Base R also seems to be a lot easier if you\'re using Linux. Base R seems to work fine in Linux, Windows 10 uses ~20GB of disc space whereas Ubuntu only needs a few GB, the RAM needed with Ubuntu is slightly lower. But I\'ve noticed large quantities of warnings and errors when installing third party packages in (L)Ubuntu. I wouldn\'t recommend drifting too far away from (L)Ubuntu or other stock distributions with Linux as you can loose so much overall compatibility it renders the process almost pointless (I think \'unity\' is due to be cancelled in Ubuntu as of 2017). I realise this won\'t go down well with some Linux users but some of the custom distributions are borderline pointless beyond novelty (I\'ve spent years using Linux alone).Hopefully some of that might help others out.
