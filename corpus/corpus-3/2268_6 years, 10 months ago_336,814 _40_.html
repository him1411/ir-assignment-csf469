This is probably going to be a stupid question but I\'m having one of those nights. In an application I am developing RESTful API and we want the client to send data as JSON. Part of this application requires the client to upload a file (usually an image) as well as information about the image.I\'m having a hard time tracking down how this happens in a single request.  Is it possible to Base64 the file data into a JSON string?  Am I going to need to perform 2 posts to the server?  Should I not be using JSON for this?As a side note, we\'re using Grails on the backend and these services are accessed by native mobile clients (iPhone, Android, etc), if any of that makes a difference.I asked a similar question here:How do I upload a file with metadata using a REST web service?You basically have three choices:You can send the file and data over in one request using the multipart/form-data  content type:In many applications, it is possible for a user to be presented with\n  a form. The user will fill out the form, including information that\n  is typed, generated by user input, or included from files that the\n  user has selected. When the form is filled out, the data from the\n  form is sent from the user to the receiving application.The definition of MultiPart/Form-Data is derived from one of those\n  applications...From http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2388.html:"multipart/form-data" contains a series of parts. Each part is\n  expected to contain a content-disposition header [RFC 2183] where the\n  disposition type is "form-data", and where the disposition contains\n  an (additional) parameter of "name", where the value of that\n  parameter is the original field name in the form. For example, a part\n  might contain a header:Content-Disposition: form-data; name="user"with the value corresponding to the entry of the "user" field.You can include file information or field information within each section between boundaries.  I\'ve successfully implemented a RESTful service that required the user to submit both data and a form, and multipart/form-data worked perfectly. The service was built using Java/Spring, and the client was using C#, so unfortunately I don\'t have any Grails examples to give you concerning how to set up the service. You don\'t need to use JSON in this case since each "form-data" section provides you a place to specify the name of the parameter and its value.The good thing about using multipart/form-data is that you\'re using HTTP-defined headers, so you\'re sticking with the REST philosophy of using existing HTTP tools to create your service.I know that this thread is quite old, however, I am missing here one option.  If you have metadata (in any format) that you want to send along with the data to upload, you can make a single multipart/related request.The Multipart/Related media type is intended for compound objects consisting of several inter-related body parts.You can check RFC 2387 specification for more in-depth details.Basically each part of such a request can have content with different type and all parts are somehow related (e.g. an image and it metadata). The parts are identified by a boundary string, and the final boundary string is followed by two hyphens.Example:I know this question is old, but in the last days I had searched whole web to solution this same question. I have grails REST webservices and iPhone Client that send pictures, title and description.I don\'t know if my approach is the best, but is so easy and simple.I take a picture using the UIImagePickerController and send to server the NSData using the header tags of request to send the picture\'s data.At the server side, I receive the photo using the code:I don\'t know if I have problems in future, but now is working fine in production environment.FormData Objects: Upload Files Using AjaxXMLHttpRequest Level 2 adds support for the new FormData interface. \nFormData objects provide a way to easily construct a set of key/value pairs representing form fields and their values, which can then be easily sent using the XMLHttpRequest send() method.https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormDataHere is my approach API (i use example) - as you can see, you I don\'t use any file_id (uploaded file identyicator in server) in API:1.Create \'photo\' object on server:2.Upload file (note that \'file\' is in singular form because it is only one per photo):And then for instance:3.Read photos list4.Read some photo details5.Read photo fileSo the conclusion is that, first you create object (photo) by POST, and then you send secod request with file (again POST). Since the only missing example is the ANDROID example, I\'ll add it.\nThis technique uses a custom AsyncTask that should be declared inside your Activity class.So, when you want to upload your picture just call:If you are developing a rest server you can do thisPlease ensure that you have following import. Ofcourse other standard imports
