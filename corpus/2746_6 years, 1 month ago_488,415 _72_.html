I have a div tag as follows:Now I want a simple javascript for displaying a tooltip on :hover the div. Can someone please help me out? The tooltip should also have a fade in/out effect.For the basic tooltip, you want:For a fancier javascript version, you can look into:http://www.designer-daily.com/jquery-prototype-mootool-tooltips-12632The above link gives you 12 options for tooltips.It can be done with CSS only, no javascript at all : running demoApply a custom HTML attribute, eg. tooltip="bla bla" to your object (div or whatever):Define the :before pseudoelement of each [tooltip] object to be transparent, absolutely positioned and with tooltip="" value as content:Define :hover:before hovering state of each [tooltip] to make it visible:Apply your styles (color, size, position etc) to the tooltip object; end of story.In the demo I\'ve defined another rule to specify if the tooltip must disappear when hovering over him but outside of the parent, with another custom attribute, tooltip-persistent, and a simple rule:Note 1: The browser coverage for this is very wide, but consider using a javascript fallback (if needed) for old IE.Note 2: an enhancement may be adding a bit of javascript to calculate the mouse position and add it to the pseudo elements, by changing a class applied to him.You don\'t need JavaScript for this at all; just set the title attribute:Note that the visual presentation of the tooltip is browser/OS dependent, so it might fade in and it might not.  However, this is the semantic way to do tooltips, and it will work correctly with accessibility software like screen readers.See this jsfiddle.I did something that should be able to be adapted to a div as well.HTMLCSSFor a more in-depth discussion, see my post:A simple Formatted ToolTip text on hoverHere\'s a nice jQuery Tooltip:https://jqueryui.com/tooltip/To implement this, just follow these steps:Add this code in your <head></head> tags: On the HTML elements that you want to have the tooltip, just add a title attribute to it. Whatever text is in the title attribute will be in the tooltip.Note: When JavaScript is disabled, it will fallback to the default browser/operating system tooltip.Here\'s a pure CSS 3 implementation (with optional JS)The only thing you have to do is set an attribute on any div called "data-tooltip" and that text will be displayed next to it when you hover over it.I\'ve included some optional JavaScript that will cause the tooltip to be displayed near the cursor. If you don\'t need this feature, you can safely ignore the JavaScript portion of this fiddle.If you don\'t want the fade-in on the hover state, just remove the transition properties.It\'s styled like the title property tooltip. Here\'s the JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/toe0hcyn/1/HTML Example:CSS:Optional JavaScript for mouse position-based tooltip location change:Okay, here\'s all of your bounty requirements met:Here\'s a demo and link to my code (JSFiddle)Here are the features that I\'ve incorporated into this purely JS, CSS and HTML5 fiddle:HTML:CSS:JavaScript:How about this , sorry code is not optimized cause im in a hurry , but i guess you will get the idea :http://jsfiddle.net/prollygeek/1b0Lrr8d/The simplest way would be to set position: relative on the containing element and position: absolute on the tooltip element inside the container to make it float relative to the parent (containing element). For example:You can also customise tooltip style. Please refer this link:\nhttp://jqueryui.com/tooltip/#custom-styleYou can create custom CSS tooltips using a data attribute, pseudo elements and content: attr() eg.http://jsfiddle.net/clintioo/gLeydk0k/11/.
