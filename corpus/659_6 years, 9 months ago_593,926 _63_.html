I want to be able to preview a file (image) before it is uploaded.  The preview action should be executed all in the browser without using Ajax to upload the image.How can I do this?Please take a look at the sample JS code below:and the associated HTML:Also, you can try this sample here.There are a couple ways you can do this. The most efficient way would be to use URL.createObjectURL() on the File from your <input>.  Pass this URL to img.src to tell the browser to load the provided image. Here\'s an example:You can also use FileReader.readAsDataURL() to parse the file from your <input>.  This will create a string in memory containing a base64 representation of the image.One-liner solution:Here is a code that uses blob object URLs, which is much more efficient than data URL when loading large images (imagine adding 4M markup to your HTML page !):Generated URL will be like:The answer of LeassTaTT works well in "standard" browsers like FF and Chrome.\nThe solution for IE exists, but looks different. Here description of cross-browser solution:In HTML we need two preview elements, img for standard browsers and div for IEHTML:In CSS we specify the following IE specific thing:CSS:In HTML we include the standard and the IE-specific Javascripts:The pic_preview.js is the Javascript from the LeassTaTT\'s answer. Replace the  $(\'#blah\') whith the $(\'#preview\') and add the $(\'#preview\').show()Now the IE specific Javascript (pic_preview_ie.js):That\'s is. Works in IE7, IE8, FF and Chrome. Please test in IE9 and report.\nThe idea of IE preview was found here:\nhttp://forums.asp.net/t/1320559.aspxhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms532969(v=vs.85).aspxI have edited @Ivan\'s answer to display "No Preview Available" image, if it is not an image:Here\'s a multiple files version, based on Ivan Baev\'s answer.The HTMLJavaScript / jQueryRequires jQuery 1.8 due to the usage of $.parseHTML, which should help with XSS mitigation.This will work out of the box, and the only dependancy you need is jQuery.Yes. It is possible.HtmlJSYou can get Live Demo from here.Example with multiple images using JavaScript (jQuery) and HTML5JavaScript (jQuery)Markup (HTML)How about creating a function that loads the file and fires a custom event. Then attach a listener to the input. This way we have more flexibility to use the file, not just for previewing images. Probably my code isn\'t as good as some users but I think you will get the point of it. Here you can see an exampleClean and simple\nJSfiddleThis will be useful when you want a custom designed image upload button.What about this solution?Just add the data attribute "data-type=editable" to an image tag like this:And the script to your project off course...See demo at JSFiddletry this code (thanks to :http://opoloo.github.io/jquery_upload_preview/)I have made a plugin which can generate the preview effect in IE 7+ thanks to the internet, but has few limitations.
