I want to store a time value and need to retrieve and edit it. How can I use SharedPreferences to do this?To obtain shared preferences, use the following method\nIn your activity:To read preferences:To edit and save preferencesThe android sdk\'s sample directory contains an example of retrieving and storing shared preferences. Its located in the:Edit==>I noticed, it is important to write difference between commit() and apply() here as well.commit() return true if value saved successfully otherwise false. It save values to SharedPreferences synchronously.apply() was added in 2.3 and doesn\'t return any value either on success or failure. It saves values to SharedPreferences immediately but starts an asynchronous commit.\nMore detail is here.To store values in shared preferences:To retrieve values from shared preferences:To edit data from sharedpreferenceTo retrieve data from shared preferenceEdit-I took this snippet from API Demo sample. It had an Edit Text box there... In this context it is not required.I am commenting the sameTo Write :To Read :Easiest way:To save:To retrieve:more info:Using Shared PreferencesShared PreferencesTo store informationTo reset your preferencesIf you are making a large application with other developers in your team and intend to have everything well organized without scattered code or different SharedPreferences instances, you may do something like this:In your activity you may save SharedPreferences this wayand you may retrieve your SharedPreferences this wayIn any application, there are default preferences that can accessed through the PreferenceManager instance and its related method getDefaultSharedPreferences(Context)With the SharedPreference instance one can retrieve the int value of the any preference with the getInt(String key, int defVal). The preference we are interested in this case is counterIn our case, we can modify the SharedPreference instance in our case using the edit() and use the putInt(String key, int newVal) We increased the count for our application that presist beyond the application and displayed accordingly.To further demo this, restart and you application again, you will notice that the count will increase each time you restart the application. PreferencesDemo.javaCode:main.xmlCode:Singleton Shared Preferences Class. it may help for others in future.Simply call SharedPref.init() on MainActivity onceTo Write data To Read DataSimple solution of how to store login value in by SharedPreferences.You can extend the MainActivity class or other class where you will store the "value of something you want to keep". Put this into writer and reader classes:Here InputClass is input and OutputClass is output class, respectively.Now you can use it somewhere else, like other class. The following is OutputClass.Store in SharedPreferencesFetch in SharedPreferencesNote: "temp" is sharedpreferences name and "name" is input value. if value does\'t exit then return null Basic idea of SharedPreferences is to store things on XML file. Declare your xml file path.(if you don\'t have this file, Android will create it. If you have this file, Android will access it.)Write value to Shared Preferencesthe preference_file_key is the name of shared preference files. And the 1010101 is the value you need to store. apply() at last is to save the changes. If you get error from apply(), change it to commit(). So this alternative sentence isRead from Shared Preferenceslsp will be -1 if preference_file_key has no value. If \'preference_file_key\' has a value, it will return the value of this.The whole code for writing isThe code for reading isYou can save value using this method:And using this method you can get value from SharedPreferences:Here prefKey is the key that you used to saved the specific value. Thanks.Best practice everCreate Interface named with PreferenceManager:How to use with Activity / Fragment:Note: Replace your key of SharedPreference with SP_TITLE.Examples:Store string in shareperence: Get string from shareperence:Hope this will help you.to save to retreive :default value is : Values to return if this preference does not exist.you can change "this" with getActivity() or getApplicationContext() in\n  some casesThere are many ways people recommend how to use SharedPreferences. I have made a demo project here. Key point in sample is to use ApplicationContext & single sharedpreferences object. This demonstrates how to use SharedPreferences with following features:-Usage example as below:-Get source code here\n& Detailed API\'s can be found here on developer.android.com Here, mSaved can be any textview or edittext from where we can extract a string. you can simply specify a string. Here text will be the key which hold the value obtained from the mSaved (TextView or Edittext).    Also there is no need to save the preference file using the package name i.e., "com.example.app". You can mention your own preferred name.  Hope this helps!!EditReadUsing this simple library, here is how you make the calls to SharedPreferences..I wanted to add here that most of the snippets for this question will have something like MODE_PRIVATE when using SharedPreferences. Well, MODE_PRIVATE means that whatever you write into this shared preference can only be read by your application only.Whatever key you pass to getSharedPreferences() method, android creates a file with that name and stores the preference data into it.\nAlso remember that getSharedPreferences() is supposed to be used when you intend to have multiple preference files for your application. If you intend to use single preference file and store all key-value pairs into it then use the getSharedPreference() method. Its weird why everyone (including myself) simply uses getSharedPreferences() flavor without even understanding the difference between the above two.The following video tutorial should help\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PcAQ1NBy98Better late than never: I created the "Android-SharedPreferences-Helper" library to help reduce the complexity and effort of using SharedPreferences. It also provides some extended functionality. Few things that it offers are as follows:Declaration of SharedPreferencesHelper object: (recommended at class\n  level)Instantiation of the SharedPreferencesHelper object: (recommended in\n  onCreate() method)Putting values into shared preferencesFairly simple! Unlike the default way (when using the SharedPreferences class) you\'ll NOT need to call .edit() and .commit() ever time.That\'s it! Your values are stored in the shared preferences.Getting values from shared preferencesAgain, just one simple method call with the key name.It has a lot of other extended functionalityCheck the details of extended functionality, usage and installation instructions etc on the GitHub Repository Page.Here i have created an Helper class to use preferences in android.This is the helper class:To store and retrieve global variables in a function way. \nTo test, make sure you have Textview items on your page, uncomment the two lines in the code and run. Then comment the two lines again, and run.\nHere the id of the TextView is username and password.In every Class where you want to use it, add these two routines at the end. \nI would like this routine to be global routines, but do not know how. This works.The variabels are available everywhere.\nIt stores the variables in "MyFile". You may change it your way.You call it usingthe variable username will be filled with "frans" and the password with "!2#4%". Even after a restart they are available.and you retrieve it usingbelow the entire code of my grid.javabelow you find the textview itemsI write a helper class for sharedpreferences:I have created a Helper class to make my Life easy. This is a generic class and has a-lot of methods those are commonly used in Apps like Shared Preferences, Email Validity, Date Time Format. Copy this class in your code and access it\'s methods wherever you need.
