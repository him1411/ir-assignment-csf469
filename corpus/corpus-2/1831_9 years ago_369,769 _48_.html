If I open files I created in Windows, the lines all end with ^M.\nHow do I delete these characters all at once?dos2unix is a commandline utility that will do this, or :%s/^M//g will if you use Ctrl-v Ctrl-m to input the ^M, or you can :set ff=unix and vim will do it for you.Docs on the \'fileformat\' setting are here, and the vim wiki has a comprehensive page on line ending conversions.Alternately, if you move files back and forth a lot, you might not want to convert them, but rather to do :set ff=dos, so vim will know it\'s a DOS file and use DOS conventions for line endings.Change the lineendings in the view:This can also be used as saving operation (:w alone will not save using the lineendings you see on screen):And you can use it from the command-line:I typically usewhich seems a little odd, but works because of the way that vim matches linefeeds.  I also find it easier to remember :)I prefer to use the following command :You can also use mac or dos to respectively convert your file to macintosh or MS-DOS/MS-Windows file convention. And it does nothing if the file is already in the correct format.For more information, see the vim help :In Vim, that strips all carriage returns, and leaves only newlines.:set fileformat=unix to convert from dos to unix.from: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Change_end-of-line_format_for_dos-mac-unix[Esc] :%s/\\r$//dos2unix can directly modify the file contents.You can directly use it on the file, with no need for temporary file redirection.The above uses the assumed US keyboard.  Use the -437 option to use the UK keyboard.(see: http://kb.iu.edu/data/acux.html)With the following command:Get the ^M to appear type Ctrl-V then Ctrl-M.  Ctrl-V tells Vim to take the next character entered literally.Following steps can convert the file format for dos to unix:Reference: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Change_end-of-line_format_for_dos-mac-unix@ https://gist.github.com/sparkida/7773170also, as mentioned above ^M = Ctrl+V + Ctrl+M (don\'t just type the caret "^" symbol and M)You can use the following command:\n:%s/^V^M//g\n where the \'^\' means use "Ctrl" key.The comment about getting the ^M to appear is what worked for me. Merely typing "^M" in my vi got nothing (not found). The Ctrl-V Ctrl-M sequence did it perfectly though.My working substitution command wasand it looked like this on my screen:I found a very easy way\xe2\x80\xa6 Open file with nano: nano file.txtpress Ctrl+O to save, but before pressing Enter press: Alt+D to toggle betwen DOS and Unix/Linux line-endings, or: Alt+M to toggle betwen Mac and Unix/Linux line-endings then press Enter to save and Ctrl+X to quit.Ctrl-m is the character \\r, or carriage return, which DOS line endings add. Ctrl-v tells vim to insert a literal Ctrl-m character at the command line.Taken as a whole, this command replaces all \\r with nothing, removing them from the ends of lines.below command is used for reformat all .sh file in current directory, I tested it on my Fedora OS.Usually there is a dos2unix command you can use for this, just make sure you read the manual as the GNU and BSD versions differ on how they deal with the arguments.BSD version:GNU version:Alternatively, you can create your own dos2unix with any of the proposed answers here, for example:Though this topic is very old, I\'d like to put another stuff from wikia:that fill find all carriage return signs (one and more reps) up to the end of line and delete, so just \\n will stay at eol.This is my way. I opened a file in dos EOL and when I save the file that will automatically convert to unix EOLYou can use \nvim somefile.txt +"%s/\\r/\\r/g" +wq\n or dos2unix utilityI wanted newlines in place of the ^M\'s. Perl to the rescue:if you create a file in NotePad or NotePad ++ in windows and bring it to Linux and open it by vim, you will see ^M at the end of each line. To remove this,At your Linux terminal, typedos2unix filename.extThis will do the required magic.
