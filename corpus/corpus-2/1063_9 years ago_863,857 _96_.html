The MySQL manual at MySQL covers this.Usually I just dump the database and reimport it with a new name. This is not an option for very big databases. Apparently RENAME {DATABASE | SCHEMA} db_name TO new_db_name; does bad things, exist only in a handful of versions, and is a bad idea overall.This needs to work with InnoDB, which stores things very differently than MyISAM.For InnoDB, the following seems to work: create the new empty database, then rename each table in turn into the new database:You will need to adjust the permissions after that.For scripting in a shell, you can use either of the following:OrNotes: there is no space between the option -p and the password. If your database has no password, remove the -u username -ppassword part.Also, if you have stored procedures, you can copy them afterwards:Use these few simple commands:Or to reduce I/O use the following as suggested by @Pablo Marin-Garcia:I think the solution is simpler and was suggested by some developers. phpMyAdmin has an operation for this.From phpMyAdmin, select the database you want to select. In the tabs there\'s one called Operations, go to the rename section. That\'s all.It does, as many suggested, create a new database with the new name, dump all tables of the old database into the new database and drop the old database.Generate an SQL script to transfer each table in your source database to the destination database. You must create the destination database before running the script generated from the command.  ($1 and $2 are source and target respectively)This will generate a SQL command that you\'ll have to then run.Three options:Create the new database, bring down the server, move the files from one database folder to the other, and restart the server. Note that this will only work if ALL of your tables are MyISAM.Create the new database, use CREATE TABLE ... LIKE statements, and then use INSERT ... SELECT * FROM statements.Use mysqldump and reload with that file.Change to the database directory:Shut down MySQL... This is important!Okay, this way doesn\'t work for InnoDB or BDB-Databases.Rename database:...or the table...Restart MySQLDone...OK, this way doesn\'t work with InnoDB or BDB databases. In this case you have to dump the database and re-import it.I\'ve only recently came across a very nice way to do it, works with MyISAM and InnoDB and is very fast:I don\'t remember where I read it but credit goes to someone else not me.Emulating the missing RENAME DATABASE command in MySQL:Create the rename queries with:Run that outputIt was taken from Emulating The Missing RENAME DATABASE Command in MySQL.This is what I use:MySQL does not support the renaming of a database through its command interface at the moment, but you can rename the database if you have access to the directory in which MySQL stores its databases. For default MySQL installations this is usually in the Data directory under the directory where MySQL was installed. Locate the name of the database you want to rename under the Data directory and rename it. Renaming the directory could cause some permissions issues though. Be aware.Note: You must stop MySQL before you can rename the databaseI would recommend creating a new database (using the name you want) and export/import the data you need from the old to the new. Pretty simple.When you rename a database in PHPMyAdmin it creates a dump, then drops and recreates the database with the new name.Simplest bullet-and-fool-proof way of doing a complete rename (including dropping the old database at the end so it\'s a rename rather than a copy):Steps:For those who are Mac users, Sequel Pro has a Rename Database option in the Database menu.\nhttp://www.sequelpro.com/You may use this shell script:Reference: How to rename a MySQL database? It\'s working:It is possible to rename all tables within a database to be under another database without having to do a full dump and restore.However any triggers in the target db will not be happy. You\'ll need to drop them first then recreate them after the rename.Well there are 2 methods:Method 1: A well-known method for renaming database schema is by dumping the schema using Mysqldump and restoring it in another schema, and then dropping the old schema (if needed).From ShellAlthough the above method is easy, it is time and space consuming. What if the schema is more than a 100GB? There are methods where you can pipe the above commands together to save on space, however it will not save time.To remedy such situations, there is another quick method to rename schemas, however, some care must be taken while doing it.Method 2: MySQL has a very good feature for renaming tables that even works across different schemas. This rename operation is atomic and no one else can access the table while its being renamed. This takes a short time to complete since changing a table\xe2\x80\x99s name or its schema is only a metadata change. Here is procedural approach at doing the rename:Create the new database schema with the desired name.\nRename the tables from old schema to new schema, using MySQL\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cRENAME TABLE\xe2\x80\x9d command.\nDrop the old database schema.\nIf there are views, triggers, functions, stored procedures in the schema, those will need to be recreated too. MySQL\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cRENAME TABLE\xe2\x80\x9d fails if there are triggers exists on the tables. To remedy this we can do the following things :1) Dump the triggers, events and stored routines in a separate file. This done using -E, -R flags (in addition to -t -d which dumps the triggers) to the mysqldump command. Once triggers are dumped, we will need to drop them from the schema, for RENAME TABLE command to work.2) Generate a list of only \xe2\x80\x9cBASE\xe2\x80\x9d tables. These can be found using a query on information_schema.TABLES table.3) Dump the views in an out file. Views can be found using a query on the same information_schema.TABLES table.4) Drop the triggers on the current tables in the old_schema.5) Restore the above dump files once all the \xe2\x80\x9cBase\xe2\x80\x9d tables found in step #2 are renamed.Intricacies with above methods : We may need to update the GRANTS for users such that they match the correct schema_name. These could fixed with a simple UPDATE on mysql.columns_priv, mysql.procs_priv, mysql.tables_priv, mysql.db tables updating the old_schema name to new_schema and calling \xe2\x80\x9cFlush privileges;\xe2\x80\x9d. Although \xe2\x80\x9cmethod 2\xe2\x80\xb3 seems a bit more complicated than the \xe2\x80\x9cmethod 1\xe2\x80\xb3, this is totally scriptable. A simple bash script to carry out the above steps in proper sequence, can help you save space and time while renaming database schemas next time.The Percona Remote DBA team have written a script called \xe2\x80\x9crename_db\xe2\x80\x9d that works in the following way :To demonstrate the use of this script, used a sample schema \xe2\x80\x9cemp\xe2\x80\x9d, created test triggers, stored routines on that schema. Will try to rename the database schema using the script, which takes some seconds to complete as opposed to time consuming dump/restore method.As you can see in the above output the database schema \xe2\x80\x9cemp\xe2\x80\x9d was renamed to \xe2\x80\x9cemp_test\xe2\x80\x9d in less than a second. Lastly, This is the script from Percona that is used above for \xe2\x80\x9cmethod 2\xe2\x80\xb3.Here is a batch file I wrote to automate it from the command line, but it for Windows/MS-DOS.Syntax is rename_mysqldb database newdatabase -u [user] -p[password]TodoInTX\'s stored procedure didn\'t quite work for me. Here\'s my stab at it:I posed a question on Server Fault trying to get around downtime when restoring very large databases by using MySQL Proxy. I didn\'t have any success, but I realized in the end what I wanted was RENAME DATABASE functionality because dump/import wasn\'t an option due to the size of our database.There is a RENAME TABLE functionality built in to MySQL so I ended up writing a simple Python script to do the job for me. I\'ve posted it on GitHub in case it could be of use to others.For your convenience, below is a small shellscript that has to be executed with two parameters: db-name and new db-name.You might need to add login-parameters to the mysql-lines if you don\'t use the .my.cnf-file in your home-directory. Please make a backup before executing this script.Here is a quick way to generate renaming sql script, if you have many tables to move.The simplest method is to use HeidiSQL software. It\'s free and open source. It runs on Windows and on any Linux with Wine (run Windows applications on Linux, BSD, Solaris and Mac OS X).To download HeidiSQL, goto http://www.heidisql.com/download.php.To download Wine, goto http://www.winehq.org/.To rename a database in HeidiSQL, just right click on the database name and select \'Edit\'. Then enter a new name and press \'OK\'.It is so simple.ALTER DATABASE is the proposed way around this by MySQL and RENAME DATABASE is dropped.From 13.1.32 RENAME DATABASE Syntax:This statement was added in MySQL 5.1.7, but it was found to be dangerous and was removed in MySQL 5.1.23.In MySQL Administrator do the following:This works for all databases and works by renaming each table with maatkit mysql toolkitUse mk-find to print and rename each table. The man page has many more options and examplesIf you have maatkit installed (which is very easy), then this is the simplest way to do it.You can do it in two ways.in phpmyadmin you can easily rename the databaseask to drop old table and reload table data click OK in bothYour database is renamedIf you are using phpMyAdmin you can go to the "operations" tab once you have selected the database you want to rename. Then go to the last section "copy database to" (or something like that), give a name, and select the options below. In this case, I guess you must select "structure and data" and "create database before copying" checkboxes and, finally, press the "go" button in that section. By the way, I\'m using phpMyAdmin in Spanish so I\'m not sure what the names of the sections are in English.This is the batch script I wrote for renaming a database on Windows:Here is a one-line Bash snippet to move all tables from one schema to another:The history command at the start simply ensures that the MySQL commands containing passwords aren\'t saved to the shell history.Make sure that db_user has read/write/drop permissions on the old schema, and read/write/create permissions on the new schema.
