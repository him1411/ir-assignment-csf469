How do I refer to the null object in Python?In Python, the \'null\' object is the singleton None.The best way to check things for "Noneness" is to use the identity operator, is:It\'s not called null as in other languages, but None. There is always only one instance of this object, so you can check for equivalence with x is None (identity comparison) instead of x == None, if you want.In Python, to represent the absence of a value, you can use the None value (types.NoneType.None) for objects and "" (or len() == 0) for strings. Therefore:Regarding the difference between "==" and "is", testing for object identity using "==" should be sufficient. However, since the operation "is" is defined as the object identity operation, it is probably more correct to use it, rather than "==". Not sure if there is even a speed difference.Anyway, you can have a look at:
