I have a survey on a website, and there seems to be some issues with the users hitting enter (I don\'t know why) and accidentally submitting the survey (form) without clicking the submit button. Is there a way to prevent this?  I\'m using HTML, PHP 5.2.9, and jQuery on the survey.You can use a method such asIn reading the comments on the original post, to make it more usable and allow people to press Enter if they have completed all the fields:If you don\'t have a <textarea> in your form, then just add the following to your <form>:Or with jQuery:This will cause that every key press inside the form will be checked on the keyCode. If it is not 13 (the Enter key), then it will return true and anything will go as expected. If it is 13 (the Enter key), then it will return false and anything will stop immediately, so the form won\'t be submitted.The keypress event is preferred over keydown as this is only fired when the character is actually being inserted. The keydown (and keyup) are fired when any key is pressed, including control keys. And, the keyCode of keypress represents the actual character being inserted, not the physical key used. This way you don\'t need to explicitly check if Numpad Enter key (108) is pressed too. The keyup is too late to block form submit.Note that $(window) as suggested in some other answers instead of $(document) doesn\'t work for keydown/keypress/keyup in IE<=8, so that\'s not a good choice if you\'re like to cover those poor users as well.If you have a <textarea> in your form (which of course should accept the Enter key), then add the keypress handler to every individual input element which isn\'t a <textarea>. To reduce boilerplate, this is better to be done with jQuery:If you have other event handler functions attached on those input elements, which you\'d also like to invoke on enter key for some reason, then only prevent event\'s default behavior instead of returning false, so it can properly propagate to other handlers.If you\'d like to allow enter key on submit buttons <input|button type="submit"> too, then you can always refine the selector as below.Note that input[type=text] as suggested in some other answers doesn\'t cover those HTML5 non-text inputs, so that\'s not a good selector.I had to catch all three events related to pressing keys in order to prevent the form from being submitted:You can combine all the above into a nice compact version:If you use a script to do the actual submit, then you can add "return false" line to the onsubmit handler like this:Calling submit() on the form from JavaScript will not trigger the event.Use:This solution works on all forms on a website (also on forms inserted with Ajax), preventing only Enters in input texts. Place it in a document ready function, and forget this problem for a life.Instead of preventing users from pressing Enter, which may seem unnatural, you can leave the form as is and add some extra client-side validation: When the survey is not finished the result is not sent to the server and the user gets a nice message telling what needs to be finished to complete the form. If you are using jQuery, try the Validation plugin:http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/ValidationThis will require more work than catching the Enter button, but surely it will provide a richer user experience.I can\'t commet yet, so I\'ll post a new answerAccepted answer is ok-ish, but it wasn\'t stoping submit on numpad enter. At least in current version of Chrome. I had to alter the keycode condition to this, then it works.A nice simple little jQuery solution:Giving the form an action of \'javascript:void(0);\' seems to do the trickI needed to prevent only specific inputs from submitting, so I used a class selector, to let this be a "global" feature wherever I need it.And this jQuery code:Alternatively, if keydown is insufficient:Some notes:Modifying various good answers here, the Enter key seems to work for keydown on all the browsers. For the alternative, I updated bind() to the on() method.I\'m a big fan of class selectors, weighing all the pros and cons and performance discussions. My naming convention is \'idSomething\' to indicate jQuery is using it as an id, to separate it from CSS styling.You could make a JavaScript method to check to see if the Enter key was hit, and if it is, to stop the submit.Just call that on the submit method.I had a similiar problem, where I had a grid with "ajax textfields" (Yii CGridView) and just one submit button. Everytime I did a search on a textfield and hit enter the form submitted. I had to do something with the button because it was the only common button between the views (MVC pattern). All I had to do was remove type="submit" and put onclick="document.forms[0].submit()I think it\'s well covered with all the answers, but if you are using a button with some JavaScript validation code you could just set the form\'s onkeypress for Enter to call your submit as expected:The onkeypress JS could be whatever you need to do. There\'s no need for a larger, global change. This is especially true if you\'re not the one coding the app from scratch, and you\'ve been brought into fix someone else\'s web site without tearing it apart and re-testing it.A completely different approach:Thus:It is my solution to reach the goal,\nit is clean and effective.In my specific case I had to stop ENTER from submitting the form and also simulate the clicking of the submit button. This is because the submit button had a click handler on it because we were within a modal window (inherited old code). In any case here\'s my combo solutions for this case.This use case is specifically useful for people working with IE8.This works for me A simpler and elegant way to do this is:create a validate function which returns true or false (with your business logic inside it) and add this code to your script:This has worked for me in all browsers after much frustration with other solutions. The name_space outer function is just to stay away from declaring globals, something I also recommend.Sample use:Something I have not seen answered here: when you tab through the elements on the page, pressing Enter when you get to the submit button will trigger the onsubmit handler on the form, but it will record the event as a MouseEvent. Here is my short solution to cover most bases:This is not a jQuery-related answerTo find a working example: https://jsfiddle.net/nemesarial/6rhogva2/I\'d like to add a little CoffeeScript code (not field tested):(I hope you like the nice trick in the unless clause.)Use:Not putting a submit button could do. Just put a script to the input (type=button) or add eventListener if you want it to submit the data in the form.Rather use thisthan using thisIn my case I had a couple of jQuery UI autocomplete fields and textareas in a form, so I definitely wanted them to accept Enter. So I removed the type="submit" input from a form and added an anchor <a href="" id="btn">Ok</a> instead. Then I styled it as a button and added the following code:If a user fills all required fields, validateData() succeeds and the form submits.
