I have classes like these:And I would like to turn a Lad object into a JSON string like this:(without the formatting). I found this link, but it uses a namespace that\'s not in .NET 4. I also heard about JSON.NET, but their site seems to be down at the moment, and I\'m not keen on using external DLL files. Are there other options besides manually creating a JSON string writer?You could use the JavaScriptSerializer class (add reference to System.Web.Extensions):A full example:Since we all love one liners... this one depends on the Newtonsoft NuGet package, which is popular and better than the default serializer.Documentation: Serializing and Deserializing JSONUse the DataContractJsonSerializer class: MSDN1, MSDN2.My example: HERE.It can also safely deserialize objects from a JSON string, unlike JavaScriptSerializer. But personally I still prefer Json.NET.Wooou! Really better using a JSON framework :)Here is my example using Json.NET (http://james.newtonking.com/json):The test:The result:Now I will implement the constructor method that will receives a JSON string and populates the class\' fields.Use Json.Net library, you can download it from Nuget Packet Manager.Serializing to Json String:Deserializing to Object:use this tools for generate C# classand use this codefor serialization your objectAs easy as this, works for dynamic objects as well (type object):        I would vote for ServiceStack\'s JSON Serializer:It is also the fastest JSON serializer available for .NET:\nhttp://www.servicestack.net/benchmarks/Use the below code for converting XML to JSON.If you are in an ASP.NET MVC web controller it\'s as simple as:Can\'t believe no one has mentioned this.SerializerObjectImplementationOutputTake care to create your class with the right attribute too:Create this class with <Serializable> attribute as per the example C# example followed by vb.net exmpaleC#VBNET EXAMPLEEnd NamespaceThe second step is to create a simple test data like this:C#VB.NETAnd this is the final result:Remember to add a reference to system.web.extension.dll in order to achive your goal.
