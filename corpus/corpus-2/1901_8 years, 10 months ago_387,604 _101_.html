I\'m trying to write a small script to change the current directory to my project directory:I saved this file as proj, changed the chmod, copied it to /usr/bin. When I call it by:\nproj, it does nothing. What am I doing wrong?Shell scripts are run inside a subshell, and each subshell has its own concept of what the current directory is. The cd succeeds, but as soon as the subshell exits, you\'re back in the interactive shell and nothing ever changed there.One way to get around this is to use an alias instead:You\'re doing nothing wrong!  You\'ve changed the directory, but only within the subshell that runs the script.You can run the script in your current process with the "dot" command:But I\'d prefer Greg\'s suggestion to use an alias in this simple case.The cd in your script technically worked as it changed the directory of the shell that ran the script, but that was a separate process forked from your interactive shell.A Posix-compatible way to solve this problem is to define a shell procedure rather than a shell-invoked command script.You can just type this in or put it in one of the various shell startup files.The cd is done within the script\'s shell. When the script ends, that shell exits, and then you are left in the directory you were. "Source" the script, don\'t run it. Instead of:do(Notice the dot and space before the script name.)Create the script fileThen create an alias in your startup file.\nFor example, create a master aliases/functions file: /scripts/mastercode.sh\n(Put the alias in this file.)\nThen at the end of your .bashrc file:Now its easy to cd to your java directory, just type cdjava and you are there.Jeremy Ruten\'s idea of using a symlink triggered a thought that hasn\'t crossed any other answer.  Use:The leading colon is important; it means that if there is a directory \'dir\' in the current directory, then \'cd dir\' will change to that, rather than hopping off somewhere else.  With the value set as shown, you can do:and, if there is no sub-directory called java in the current directory, then it will take you directly to $HOME/projects/java - no aliases, no scripts, no dubious execs or dot commands.My $HOME is /Users/jleffler; my $CDPATH is:I got my code to work by using. <your file name>./<your file name> dose not work because it doesn\'t change your directory in the terminal it just changes the directory specific to that script. Here is my programHere is my terminal you can use . script_nameto execute it, it wont execute in subshell.When you fire a shell script, it runs a new instance of that shell (/bin/bash).  Thus, your script just fires up a shell, changes the directory and exits.  Put another way, cd (and other such commands) within a shell script do not affect nor have access to the shell from which they were launched.On my particular case i needed too many times to change for the same directory. \nSo on my .bashrc (I use ubuntu) i\'ve added the 1 -$ nano ~./bashrc2- $ source ~/.bashrc3 - $ switchp javaDirectly it will do: cd /home/tree/projects/javaHope that helps!simply run:It only changes the directory for the script itself, while your current directory stays the same.You might want to use a symbolic link instead. It allows you to make a "shortcut" to a file or directory, so you\'d only have to type something like cd my-project.You can combine an alias and a script,provided that the script echos the destination path.  Note that those are backticks surrounding the script name.Â For example, your script could beThe advantage with this technique is that the script could take any number of command line parameters and emit different destinations calculated by possibly complex logic.You can do following:EDIT: This could be \'dotted\' as well, to prevent creation of subsequent shells.Example:A bash script operates on its current environment or on that of its\n  children, but never on its parent environment.However, this question often gets asked because one wants to be left at a bash prompt in a certain directory after the execution of a bash script from another directory.If this is the case, simply execute a child bash instance at the end of the script:to navigate directories quicky, there\'s $CDPATH, cdargs, and ways to generate aliases automaticallyhttp://jackndempsey.blogspot.com/2008/07/cdargs.htmlhttp://muness.blogspot.com/2008/06/lazy-bash-cd-aliaes.htmlhttps://web.archive.org/web/1/http://articles.techrepublic%2ecom%2ecom/5100-10878_11-5827311.htmlYou can combine Adam & Greg\'s alias and dot approaches to make something that can be more dynamic\xe2\x80\x94Now running the project alias will execute the project script in the current shell as opposed to the subshell. You can use the operator && :cd myDirectory && lsLOOOOOng time after, but I did the following:create a file called casepaste the following in the file:save it and then:I also created an alias in my .bashrc:now when I type:essentially I am typing:You can type any folder after \'case\':which is like typing:respectivelyIn my case the path is much longer - these guys summed it up with the ~ info earlier.In your ~/.bash_profile file. add the next functionRestart terminal and you can typeand you will be moved to the destination folder.While sourcing the script you want to run is one solution, you should be aware that this script then can directly modify the environment of your current shell. Also it is not possible to pass arguments anymore.Another way to do, is to implement your script as a function in bash.This technique is used by autojump: http://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/wiki to provide you with learning shell directory bookmarks.You can create a function like below in your .bash_profile and it will work smoothlyThe following function takes a optional parameter which is a project in particular for example, you can just run$cdprojor$cdproj project_nameDont forget to source your .bash_profileHere is a blog post I wrote on the exact problem:http://blog.sampsonchen.com/2012/09/18/three-shortcuts-to-quickly-change-directories-in-linux/Also there is a tool for this called z: https://github.com/rupa/zIf you are using fish as your shell, the best solution is to create a function. As an example, given the original question, you could copy the 4 lines below and paste them into your fish command line:This will create the function and save it for use later. If your project changes, just repeat the process using the new path.If you prefer, you can manually add the function file by doing the following:and enter the text:and finally press ctrl+x to exit and y followed by return to save your changes.(NOTE: the first method of using funcsave creates the proj.fish file for you).I have a simple bash script called p to manage directory changing ongithub.com/godzilla/bash-stuff\njust put the script in your local bin directory (/usr/local/bin) \nand putin your .bashrc You need no script, only set the correct option and create an environment variable.in your ~/.bashrc allows to cd to the content of environment variables.Create such an environment variable:and you can use:Other alternatives.You can execute some lines in the same subshell if you end lines with backslash.
