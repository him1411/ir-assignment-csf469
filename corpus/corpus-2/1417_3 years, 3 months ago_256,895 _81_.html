My app that worked fine on iOS 7 doesn\'t work with the iOS 8 SDK.CLLocationManager doesn\'t return a location, and I don\'t see my app under Settings -> Location Services either. I did a Google search on the issue, but nothing came up. What could be wrong?I ended up solving my own problem. Apparently in iOS 8 SDK, requestAlwaysAuthorization (for background location) or requestWhenInUseAuthorization (location only when foreground) call on CLLocationManager is needed before starting location updates.There also needs to be NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription or NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription key in Info.plist with a message to be displayed in the prompt. Adding these solved my problem.Hope it helps someone else.EDIT: For more extensive information, have a look at: Core-Location-Manager-Changes-in-ios-8I was pulling my hair out with the same problem. Xcode gives you the error:Trying to start MapKit location updates without prompting for\n  location authorization. Must call -[CLLocationManager\n  requestWhenInUseAuthorization] or -[CLLocationManager\n  requestAlwaysAuthorization] first.But even if you implement one of the above methods, it won\'t prompt the user unless there is an entry in the info.plist for NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription or NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription.Add the following lines to your info.plist where the string values represent the reason you you need to access the users location I think these entries may have been missing since I started this project in Xcode 5. I\'m guessing Xcode 6 might add default entries for these keys but have not confirmed. You can find more information on these two Settings here To ensure that this is backwards compatible with iOS 7, you should check whether the user is running iOS 8 or iOS 7. For example:And to your info.plist File\nAccording to the Apple docs:As of iOS 8, the presence of a NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription or a NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription key value in your app\'s Info.plist file is required. It\'s then also necessary to request permission from the user prior to registering for location updates, either by calling [self.myLocationManager requestWhenInUseAuthorization] or [self.myLocationManager requestAlwaysAuthorization] depending on your need. The string you entered into the Info.plist will then be displayed in the ensuing dialog.If the user grants permission, it\'s business as usual. If they deny permission, then the delegate is not informed of location updates.In iOS 8 you need to do two extra things to get location working: Add\n  a key to your Info.plist and request authorization from the location\n  manager asking it to start. There are two Info.plist keys for the new\n  location authorization. One or both of these keys is required. If\n  neither of the keys are there, you can call startUpdatingLocation but\n  the location manager won\xe2\x80\x99t actually start. It won\xe2\x80\x99t send a failure\n  message to the delegate either (since it never started, it can\xe2\x80\x99t\n  fail). It will also fail if you add one or both of the keys but forget\n  to explicitly request authorization. So the first thing you need to do\n  is to add one or both of the following keys to your Info.plist file:  Both of these keys take a stringwhich is a description of why you need location services. You can\n  enter a string like \xe2\x80\x9cLocation is required to find out where you are\xe2\x80\x9d\n  which, as in iOS 7, can be localized in the InfoPlist.strings file. My solution which can be compiled in Xcode 5:The old code for asking location won\'t work in iOS 8. You can try this method for location authorization:Add this to your codeand to info.plist:One common error for Swift developers:First make sure you add a value to the plist for either NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription or NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription.If you are still not seeing a window pop up asking for authorization, look to see if you are putting the line var locationManager = CLLocationManager() in your View Controller\'s viewDidLoad method. If you do, then even if you call locationManager.requestWhenInUseAuthorization(), nothing will show up. This is because after viewDidLoad executes, the locationManager variable is deallocated (cleared out).The solution is to locate the line var locationManager = CLLocationManager() at the top of the class method.Before [locationManager startUpdatingLocation];, add an iOS8 location services request:Edit your app\'s Info.plist and add key NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription with the string value that will be displayed to the user (for example, We do our best to preserve your battery life.)If your app needs location services only while the app is open, replace:requestAlwaysAuthorization with requestWhenInUseAuthorization andNSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription with NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription.I was working on an app that was upgraded to iOS 8 and location services stopped working. You\'ll probably get and error in the Debug area like so:Trying to start MapKit location updates without prompting for location authorization. Must call -[CLLocationManager requestWhenInUseAuthorization] or -[CLLocationManager requestAlwaysAuthorization] first.I did the least intrusive procedure. First add NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription entry to your info.plist:Notice I didn\'t fill out the value for this key. This still works, and I\'m not concerned because this is a in house app. Also, there is already a title asking to use location services, so I didn\'t want to do anything redundant.Next I created a conditional for iOS 8:After this the locationManager:didChangeAuthorizationStatus: method is call:And now everything works fine. As always, check out the documentation.Solution with backward compatibility:Setup NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription key in your Info.plistSolution with backward compatibility which doesn\'t produce Xcode warnings:Setup NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription key in your Info.plistThis is issue with ios 8 \nAdd this to your codeand to info.plist:To Access User Location in iOS 8 you will have to add,This will ask the user for the permission to get their current location.For those using Xamarin, I had to add the key NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription to the info.plist manually since it was not available in the dropdowns in either Xamarin 5.5.3 Build 6 or XCode 6.1 - only  NSLocationUsageDescription was in the list, and that caused the CLLocationManager to continue to fail silently.A little helper for all of you that have more than one Info.plist file...It will add the needed tag to all of the Info.plist files in the current directory (and subfolders).Another is:It will add your description to all files.Keep Cocoa Keys information always at your fingertips for those updates, here is the link:https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW26Enjoy.I get a similar error in iOS9 (working with Xcode 7 and Swift 2):\nTrying to start MapKit location updates without prompting for location authorization. Must call -[CLLocationManager requestWhenInUseAuthorization] or -[CLLocationManager requestAlwaysAuthorization] first.\nI was following a tutorial but the tutor was using iOS8 and Swift 1.2. There are some changes in Xcode 7 and Swift 2, I found this code and it works fine for me (if somebody needs help):Finally, I put that in info.plist:\nInformation Property List: NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription\nValue: App needs location servers for staffIn order to access the users location in iOS. You need to add two keys NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescriptionNSLocationAlwaysUsageDescriptioninto the Info.plist file. See this below image.Add key NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription or NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription (background GPS use) with string asking to use GPS on each info.plist from each target.Ask for permission by running:[self initLocationManager:locationManager];Where initLocationManager is:Remember that if the keys are not on each info.plist for each target the app will not ask the user. The if provides compatibility with iOS 7 and the respondsToSelector: method guarantees future compatibility rather than just solving the issue for iOS 7 and 8.The problem for me was that the class that was the CLLocationManagerDelegate was private, which prevented all the delegate methods from being called. Guess it\'s not a very common situation but thought I\'d mention it in case t helps anyone.I add those key in InfoPlist.strings in iOS 8.4, iPad mini 2. It works too. I don\'t set any key, like NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription, in my Info.plist.InfoPlist.strings:Base on this thread, it said, as in iOS 7, can be localized in the InfoPlist.strings. In my test, those keys can be configured directly in the file InfoPlist.strings.So the first thing you need to do is to add one or both of the > following keys to your Info.plist file:Both of these keys take a string which is a description of why you\n  need location services. You can enter a string like \xe2\x80\x9cLocation is\n  required to find out where you are\xe2\x80\x9d which, as in iOS 7, can be\n  localized in the InfoPlist.strings file.UPDATE:I think @IOS\'s method is better. Add key to Info.plist with empty value and add localized strings to InfoPlist.strings.
