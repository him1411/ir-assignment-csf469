I\'ve got the following scenario:and there are 5 <li>\'s on the page each with a data-slide=number attribute (number being 1,2,3,4,5 respectively).I now need to find the currently active slide number which is mapped to var current = $(\'ul\').data(current); and is updated on each slide change.So far my tries have been unsuccessful, trying to construct the selector that would match the current slide:does not match/return anything\xe2\x80\xa6The reason I can\'t hardcode the li part is that this is a user accessible variable that can be changed to a different element if required, so it may not always be an li.Any ideas on what I\'m missing?You have to inject the value of current into an Attribute Equals selector:ES6 way:in case you don\'t want to type all that, here\'s a shorter way to query by data attribute:FYI:\nhttp://james.padolsey.com/javascript/a-better-data-selector-for-jquery/When searching with [data-x=...], watch out, it doesn\'t work with jQuery.data(..) setter:You can use this instead:I improved upon psycho brm\'s filterByData extension to jQuery.Where the former extension searched on a key-value pair, with this extension you can additionally search for the presence of a data attribute, irrespective of its value.Usage:Or the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/PTqmE/46/I have faced the same issue while fetching elements using jQuery and data-* attribute.so for your reference the shortest code is here:This is my HTML Code:This is my jQuery selector:Going back to his original question, about how to make this work without knowing the element type in advance, the following does this:This selector $("ul [data-slide=\'" + current +"\']"); will work for following structure:While this $("ul[data-slide=\'" + current +"\']"); will work for:<ul data-slide="item"><li></li></ul>I hope this may work betterthanks
