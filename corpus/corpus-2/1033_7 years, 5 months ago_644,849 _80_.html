I want to hide the titlebar for some of my activities. The problem is that I applied a style to all my activities, therefore I can\'t simply set the theme to @android:style/Theme.NoTitleBar. Using the NoTitleBar theme as a parent for my style would remove the title bar for to much activities.Can I set a no title style item somewhere?Do this in your onCreate() method.this refers to the Activity.You can modify your AndroidManifest.xml:You can use this for each activity in your project.I now did the following. I declared a style inheriting everything from my general style and then disabling the titleBar.Now I can set this style to every Activity in which I want to hide the title bar overwriting the application wide style and inheriting all the other style informations, therefor no duplication in the style code.I don\'t like the this.requestWindowFeature(Window.FEATURE_NO_TITLE); because the title bar appears briefly, then disappears. I also don\'t like the android:theme="@android:style/Theme.NoTitleBar" because I lost all of the 3.0+ Holo changes that the users of the new devices have gotten used to.  So I came across this solution.In your res/values folder make a file called styles.xml (If it doesn\'t already exist).  In that file place the following code:Next create a res/values-v11 with another styles.xml file (Once again this may already exist). In that file place the following code:And if you are targeting 4.0+, create a res/values-v14 folder with yet another styles.xml file (Yes it may already be there).  In that file place the following code:Finally, with all of these files created, open your AndroidManifiest.xml file you can add the code:to the activity tag of the activity you want no title for or the application tag if you want it to apply to the entire application.Now your users will get the themes associated with their device version with the screen layout you desire.P.S.  Changing the value to android:theme="@style/Theme.FullScreen" will have the same effect, but also remove Notification bar.The title bar can be removed in two ways as mentioned on the developer Android page:In the manifest.xml file:Add the following in application if you want to remove it for all the activities in an app:Or for a particular activity:If you use this.requestWindowFeature(Window.FEATURE_NO_TITLE) user will still be able to see the title bar just for a moment during launch animation when activity starts through onCreate. If you use @android:style/Theme.Black.NoTitleBar as shown below then title bar won\'t be shown during launch animation.above example will obviously override your existing application theme, if you have existing theme then add <item name="android:windowNoTitle">true</item> to it. the correct answer probably is to not extend ActionbarActivity rather extend  just Activityif you still use actionbar activity \nseems this is working:seems this works too:i could do like as Scott Biggs wrote. this kind of works. except there is no theme then. i mean the settings menu\'s background is transparent:just change to Activity or FragmentActivity however i could make it look good enough using material design and not remove \nthe actionbar:\nhttps://gist.github.com/shimondoodkin/86e56b3351b704a05e53it is by example of material design compatibility actionbar styling.Create a theme as below.Add <item name="android:windowNoTitle">true</item>inside AppTheme (styles.xml)Just use getActionBar().hide(); in your main activity onCreate() method.what works for me:1- in styles.xml:2- in MainActivity in manifest inherit the style:  < activity android:name=".MainActivity"\nandroid:theme="@style/generalnotitle">You can use this code in your java fileadd this line before you set or load your viewAdd both of those for the theme you use:In your onCreate method, use the following snippet:You just need to change AppTheme style in Style.xml if you replace the definition from DarkActionBarto NoActionBarthe AppTheme defined in AndroidManifast.xmlOr if you want to hide/show the title bar at any point:when i tried to use all those high upvoted answers my app always crashed.\n(i think it has something to do with the "@android:style"?)The best solution for me was to use the following:No header / title bar anymore. Just plaace it in the <application>...</application> or <activity>...</activity> depending if you (don\'t) want it in the whole app or just a specific activity.Add this style to your style.xml fileAfter that reference this style name into your androidManifest.xml in perticular activity in which you don\'t want to see titlebar, as like below.First answer is amphibole.\nhere is my explain:\nadd:in oncreate() method.before:(not just before setContentView)\nif don\'t do this u will get forceclose.\n+1 this answer.In my case, if you are using android studio 2.1, and your compile SDK version is 6.0, then just go to your manifest.xml file, and change the following code:Here is the code:And here is the snip shoot(see the highlight code):\nI found two reasons why this error might occur.One. The Window flags are set already set inside super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); in which case you may want to use the following order of commands:Two. You have the Back/Up button inside the TitleBar, meaning that the current activity is a hierarchical child of another activity, in which case you might want to comment out or remove this line of code from inside the onCreate method.This is how the complete code looks like. Note the import of android.view.Window.I\'m using a support widget Toolbar v7.\nSo, in order to be able to delete or hide the Title we need to write this.Ahem, you can apply themes to individual activities in XML such as no title. In other words, take it out of your application tag, open the tag declaration and put it in the desired activity tag.This Solved my problemIn manifest my activity:In style under  "AppTheme" name:add in manifiest file , add following line into ur java file,If you do what users YaW and Doug Paul say, then you have to have in mind that window features must be set prior to calling setContentView. If not, you will get an exception.Simply change the parent tag of your App theme to "Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar"Add theme @style/Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar in your activity on AndroidManifest.xml like thisThere are mentions of it in this post but no one explicitly addresses it, so maybe this will save people some time. If you are like me and have multiple classes extending one root class which extends ActionBarActivity, it may not be immediately obvious that trying to set that activity to a NoTitleBar/NoActionBar will throw an error, specifically:"You need to use a Theme.AppCompat theme (or descendant) with this activity"You can fix this changing the extends to Activity.
