I\'m used to doing print >>f, "hi there"However, it seems that print >> is getting deprecated. What is the recommended way to do the line above?Update:\nRegarding all those answers with "\\n"...is this universal or Unix-specific? IE, should I be doing "\\r\\n" on Windows?You should use the print() function which is available since Python 2.6+For Python 3 you don\'t need the import, since the  print() function is the default.The alternative would be to use:Quoting from Python documentation regarding newlines:On output, if newline is None, any \'\\n\' characters written are translated to the system default line separator, os.linesep. If newline is \'\', no translation takes place. If newline is any of the other legal values, any \'\\n\' characters written are translated to the given string.This should be as simple as:From The Documentation:Do not use os.linesep as a line terminator when writing files opened in text mode (the default); use a single \'\\n\' instead, on all platforms.Some useful reading:Regarding os.linesep:Here is an exact unedited Python 2.7.1 interpreter session on Windows:On Windows:As expected, os.linesep does NOT produce the same outcome as \'\\n\'. There is no way that it could produce the same outcome. \'hi there\' + os.linesep is equivalent to \'hi there\\r\\n\', which is NOT equivalent to \'hi there\\n\'.It\'s this simple: use \\n which will be translated automatically to os.linesep. And it\'s been that simple ever since the first port of Python to Windows.There is no point in using os.linesep on non-Windows systems, and it produces wrong results on Windows.DO NOT USE os.linesep!The python docs recommend this way:So this is the way I do it do :)Statement from docs.python.org:It is good practice to use the \'with\' keyword when dealing with file\n  objects. This has the advantage that the file is properly closed after\n  its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised on the way. It is\n  also much shorter than writing equivalent try-finally blocks.I do not think there is a "correct" way.I would use:In memoriam Tim Toady.In Python 3 it is a function, but in Python 2 you can add this to the top of the source file:Then you do If you are writing a lot of data and speed is a concern you should probably go with f.write(...). I did a quick speed comparison and it was considerably faster than print(..., file=f) when performing a large number of writes.On average write finished in 2.45s on my machine, whereas print took about 4 times as long (9.76s). That being said, in most real-world scenarios this will not be an issue.If you choose to go with print(..., file=f) you will probably find that you\'ll want to suppress the newline from time to time, or replace it with something else. This can be done by setting the optional end parameter, e.g.;Whichever way you choose I\'d suggest using with since it makes the code much easier to read.Update: This difference in performance is explained by the fact that write is highly buffered and returns before any writes to disk actually take place (see this answer), whereas print (probably) uses line buffering. A simple test for this would be to check performance for long writes as well, where the disadvantages (in terms of speed) for line buffering would be less pronounced.The performance difference now becomes much less pronounced, with an average time of 2.20s for write and 3.10s for print. If you need to concatenate a bunch of strings to get this loooong line performance will suffer, so use-cases where print would be more efficient are a bit rare.When you said Line it means some serialized characters which are ended to \'\\n\' characters. Line should be last at some point so we should consider \'\\n\' at the end of each line. Here is solution:in append mode after each write the cursor move to new line, if you want to use \'w\' mode you should add \'\\n\' characters at the end of write() function:
