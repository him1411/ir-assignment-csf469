I have a div tag with width set to 800px. When the browser width is greater than 800px, it shouldn\'t stretch the div but it should bring it to the middle of the page.position: absolute and then top:50% and left:50% places the top edge at vertically center of the screen, and left edge at horizontally center, then by adding margin-top to negative of height of the div i.e -100 shifts it above by 100, similarly for margin-left. This gets div exactly in the center of the page.  Do you mean that you want to center it vertically or horizontally? You said you specified the height to 800px, and wanted the div not to stretch when the width was greater than that...To center horizontally, you can use the margin: auto; attribute in css. Also, you\'ll have to make sure that the body and html elements don\'t have any margin or padding:To make it also work correctly in Internet Explorer 6 you have to do it as following:HTMLCSSModern Flexbox solution is the way to go in/from 2015. justify-content: center is used for the parent element to align the content to the center of it.HTMLCSSOutputYou can also use it like this:Simply use center tag just after body tag, and end center tag  just before body endsThis worked for me with all the browsers I have triedUse css flex property: http://jsfiddle.net/cytr/j7SEa/6/show/Add this class to the div you want centered (which should have a set width):Or, add the margin stuff to your div class, like this:Some other pre-existing setups from older code that will prevent div page centering L&R are:\n1) other classes hidden in external stylesheet links.\n2) other classes embedded in something like an img (like for older external CSS Print format controls).\n3) legend code with IDs and/or CLASSES will conflict with a named div class.Centering without specifying div width:This is something like <center> tag does, except:http://jsfiddle.net/NPV2E/"width:100%"  for  "body"  tag it\'s only for example. In real project you may remove this property.If you have some regular content and not only one line of text, so only possible reason I know is to calculate margin.\nHere is an example:  HTMLCSSSo, #supercontainer is your "whole page" and it\'s width is 1200px.\n#middlecontainer is div with content of your site; it\'s width 102px. In case, the width of content is known, you need to divide page\'s size to 2, and substruct from result half of content\'s width:\n1200 / 2 - (102 / 2) = 549;  Yes, I\'m also see that this is DER GROSSE fail of CSS.This works in IE also, Auto Margins do not.Div centered vertically and horizontally inside parent without fixing content sizeCheck out this example (click).\nVery simple, and works for flexible heights too.\nPerfect if you don\'t have content with fixed height.And here (click) is a nice overview with some other solutions.And here (click) another example with a flexible width solution with the famous -50% trickSimple http://jsfiddle.net/8pd4qx5r/Use justify-content and align-items to horizontally and vertically align a divhttps://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/align-itemsUse the below code for centering the div box:If you want to change the vertical position, change the value of 250 and you can arrange the content as per your need. There is no need to give the width and other parameters.A pretty old question with a lot of answers, but for some reason none of them worked for me really. This is what worked for me and it works across browser as well:If your center content is deep inside other divs then only margin can save you. Nothing else. I face it always when not using framework like Bootstrap.This can be easily achieved via flex container.Preview Link
