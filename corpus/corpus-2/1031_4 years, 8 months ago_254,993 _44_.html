Recently I joined GitHub. I hosted some projects there.I need to include some images in my README File. I don\'t know how to do that.I searched about this, but all I got was some links which tell me to "host images on web and specify the image path in README.md file".Is there any way to do this without hosting the images on web?Try this markdown:I think you can link directly to the raw version of an image if it\'s stored in your repository. i.e.Edit: just noticed comment linking to article which suggests using gh-pages. Also, relative links can be a better idea than the absolute URLs I posted above.You can create a new issue, upload images to it and then attach the images to your file as described in this articleGitHub Tricks: Upload Images & Live DemosYou can also use relative paths likeYou can also add images with simple HTML tags:Result:Just upload your image to the repository root, and link to the filename without any path, like so:Then copy image sourceNow add ![alt tag](http://url/to/img.png) to your README.md fileDone!Alternatively you can use some image hosting site like imgur and get it\'s url and add it in your README.md file or you can use some static file hosting too.Sample issueI need to include some images in my README File. I don\'t know how to\n  do that.I created a small wizard that allows you to create and customize simple image galleries for your GitHub repository\'s readme: See ReadmeGalleryCreatorForGitHub.The wizard takes advantage of the fact that GitHub allows img tags to occur in the README.md. Also, the wizard makes use of the popular trick of uploading images to GitHub by drag\'n\'dropping them in the issue area (as already mentioned in one of the answers in this thread).Many of the posted solutions are incomplete or not to my taste.My preferred solution, inspired by this gist, is to use an assets branch with permalinks to specific revisions.Construct a "permalink" to this revision of the image, and wrap it in Markdown:![Cat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{user}/{repo}/{sha}/cat.png)e.g.![Cat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulmelnikow/zsh-startup-timer/3923c60fc66d4223ccf063d169ccf2ff167b1270/cat.png)To always show the latest image on the assets branch, use assets in place of the sha:![Cat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{user}/{repo}/assets/cat.png)Commit your image (image.png) in a folder (myFolder) and add the following line in your README.md: ![Optional Text](../master/myFolder/image.png)I usually host the image on the site, this can link to any hosted image.   Just toss this in the readme.  Works for .rst files, not sure about .mdI have solved this problem. You only need to refer to someone else\'s readme file.At first,you should upload an image file to github code library ! Then direct reference to the address of the image file .\n\nIn my case i use imgur and use the direct link this way.In my case I wanted to show a print screen on Github but also on NPM. Even though using the relative path was working within Github, it wasn\'t working outside of it. Basically, even if I pushed my project to NPM as well (which simply uses the same readme.md, the image was never showing. I tried a few ways, at the end this is what worked for me:![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/project/master/image-path/image.png)I now see my image correctly on NPM or anywhere else that I could publish my package.
