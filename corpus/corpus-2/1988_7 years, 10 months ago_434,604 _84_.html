How can I easily obtain the min or max element of a JavaScript Array?Example Psuedocode:How about augmenting the built-in Array object to use Math.max/Math.min instead:Here is a JSFiddle.Augmenting the built-ins can cause collisions with other libraries (some see), so you may be more comfortable with just apply\'ing Math.xxx() to your array directly:Alternately, assuming your browser supports ECMAScript 6, you can use the spread operator which functions similarly to the apply method:For a full discussion see:\nhttp://aaroncrane.co.uk/2008/11/javascript_max_api/For big arrays (~10\xe2\x81\xb7 elements), Math.min and Math.max both produces the following error in Node.js. RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceededA more robust solution is to not add every element to the call stack, but to instead pass an array:If you are concerned about speed, the following code is ~3 times faster then Math.max.apply is on my computer. See http://jsperf.com/min-and-max-in-array/2.If your arrays contains strings instead of numbers, you also need to coerce them into numbers. The below code does that, but it slows the code down ~10 times on my machine. See http://jsperf.com/min-and-max-in-array/3.Using spread operator (ES6).apply is often used when the intention is to invoke a variadic function with a list of argument values, e.g.The Math.max([value1[,value2, ...]]) function returns the largest of zero or more numbers.The Math.max() method doesn\'t allow you to pass in an array. If you have a list of values of which you need to get the largest, you would normally call this function using Function.prototype.apply(), e.g. However, as of the ECMAScript 6 you can use the spread operator:The spread operator allows an expression to be expanded in places where multiple arguments (for function calls) or multiple elements (for array literals) are expected.Using the spread operator, the above can be rewritten as such:When calling a function using the variadic operator, you can even add additional values, e.g.Bonus:Spread operator enables you to use the array literal syntax to create new arrays in situations where in ES5 you would need to fall back to imperative code, using a combination of push, splice, etc.If you\'re paranoid like me about using Math.max.apply (which could cause errors when given large arrays according to MDN), try this:Or, in ES6:The anonymous functions are unfortunately necessary (instead of using Math.max.bind(Math) because reduce doesn\'t just pass a and b to its function, but also i and a reference to the array itself, so we have to ensure we don\'t try to call max on those as well.The following function uses Function.prototype.apply() to find the maximum element in a numeric array. getMaxOfArray([1, 2, 3]) is equivalent to Math.max(1, 2, 3), but you can use getMaxOfArray() on programmatically constructed arrays of any size.Or with the new spread operator, getting the maximum of an array becomes a lot easier.You do it by extending the Array type:Boosted from here (by John Resig)Others have already given some solutions in which they augment Array.prototype. All I want in this answer is to clarify whether it should be Math.min.apply( Math, array ) or Math.min.apply( null, array ). So what context should be used, Math or null? When passing null as a context to apply, then the context will default to the global object (the window object in the case of browsers). Passing the Math object as the context would be the correct solution, but it won\'t hurt passing null either. Here\'s an example when null might cause trouble, when decorating the Math.max function:The above will throw an exception because this.foo will be evaluated as window.foo, which is undefined. If we replace null with Math, things will work as expected and the string "foo" will be printed to the screen (I tested this using Mozilla Rhino).You can pretty much assume that nobody has decorated Math.max so, passing null will work without problems.One more way to do it:Usage:  I am surprised not one mentiond the reduce function.https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/maxthis worked for me.For big arrays (~10\xe2\x81\xb7 elements), Math.min and Math.max procuces a RangeError (Maximum call stack size exceeded) in node.js.For big arrays, a quick & dirty solution is:I had the same problem, I needed to obtain the minimum and maximum values of an array and, to my surprise, there were no built-in functions for arrays. After reading a lot, I decided to test the "top 3" solutions myself:The test code was this:The array A was filled with 100,000 random integer numbers, each function was executed 10,000 times on Mozilla Firefox 28.0 on an intel Pentium 4 2.99GHz desktop with Windows Vista. The times are in seconds, retrieved by performance.now() function. The results were these, with 3 fractional digits and standard deviation:The REDUCE solution was 117% slower than the discrete solution. The APPLY solution was the worse, 2,118% slower than the discrete solution. Besides, as Peter observed, it doesn\'t work for large arrays (about more than 1,000,000 elements).Also, to complete the tests, I tested this extended discrete code:The timing: mean=0.218s, sd=0.094So, it is 35% slower than the simple discrete solution, but it retrieves both the maximum and the minimum values at once (any other solution would take at least twice that to retrieve them). Once the OP needed both values, the discrete solution would be the best choice (even as two separate functions, one for calculating maximum and another for calculating minimum, they would outperform the second best, the REDUCE solution).You can use the following function anywhere in your project:And then you can call the functions passing the array:This may suit your purposes.Iterate through, keeping track as you go.This will leave min/max null if there are no elements in the array.  Will set min and max in one pass if the array has any elements.You could also extend Array with a range method using the above to allow reuse and improve on readability.  See a working fiddle at http://jsfiddle.net/9C9fU/Used asSimple stuff, really. Here\'s one way to get the max value from an array of objects.  Create a copy (with slice), then sort the copy in descending order and grab the first item.Using Math.max() or Math.min()The following function uses Function.prototype.apply() to find the maximum element in a numeric array. getMaxOfArray([1, 2, 3]) is equivalent to Math.max(1, 2, 3), but you can use getMaxOfArray() on programmatically constructed arrays of any size.Or with the new spread operator, getting the maximum of an array becomes a lot easier.ChaosPandion\'s solution works if you\'re using protoype. If not, consider this:The above will return NaN if an array value is not an integer so you should build some functionality to avoid that.  Otherwise this will work.I thought I\'d share my simple and easy to understand solution.For the min:And for the max: If you are using prototype.js framework, then this code will work ok:Documented here: Javascript prototype framework for maxIf you use the library sugar.js, you can write arr.min() and arr.max() as you suggest. You can also get min and max values from non-numeric arrays.min( map , all = false ) Returns the element in the array with the\n  lowest value. map may be a function mapping the value to be checked or\n  a string acting as a shortcut. If all is true, will return all min\n  values in an array.max( map , all = false ) Returns the element in the array with the\n  greatest value. map may be a function mapping the value to be checked\n  or a string acting as a shortcut. If all is true, will return all max\n  values in an array.Examples:Libraries like Lo-Dash and underscore.js also provide similar powerful min and max functions:Example from Lo-Dash:I like Linus\'s reduce() approach, especially for large arrays.  But as long as you know you need both min and the max, why iterate over the array twice?Of course, if you prefer the iterative approach, you can do that too:create a simple object Below script worked for me in ndoejs:You can use Array.sort but you\'ll have to write a simple number sorting function since the default is alphabetic.Look at example 2 here.Then you can grab arr[0] and arr[arr.length-1] to get min and max.If you need performance then this is the best way for small arrays:
