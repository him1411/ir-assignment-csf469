I am trying to upload an Apple TV App to the App Store for testing purposes, but I got the issue:This Action could not be completed. Try Again (-22421)as in the below image:So what can I do?This happens because Apple\'s servers may not be working correctly. Just wait and try later or next time. It will work for sure eventually.Just try exporting the iPA file and then upload that exported iPA file with application loader. It will solve your problem.There\'s another way to fix above error. Try this, it fixed it for me. Open Terminal and run:Three above code line will update iTMSTransporter, then you can try uploading in XCode again.Refs for more details: https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/76803As with all thing Xcode related. A simple reboot fixed the problem for me.(As of September 15, 2017)Step 1 Open Xcode --> Product tab --> Archive --> export and save to desktopStep 2Open Xcode --> Xcode tab --> Open Developer Tool --> Application Loader >> double-click Deliver YourApp and select the recently exported .ipa file from your desktopSolved the issue every time =)Hey i have same issue when i am trying to upload IPA on Appstore. I solved it when i checked that my Distribution provisioning profile was invalid. So just update provisioning profile,download then install and restart Xcode. Now archive and upload it on Appstore it will be done. ORCreate IPA and upload via Application Loader.Good luck.Will work for 100% sure. I had the same issue but its solved by below steps:I hope this will work for all.I was experiencing the exact same error hence being here (failed about 6 times over an hour).I just tried again now (without changing anything), it worked by itself. I read on the Apple-forums that it\'s an issue with Apple servers, nothing to do with your Xcode.I also read that others trying the upload via ApplicationLoader (Menu -> Xcode -> Open Developer Tool -> Application Loader), this will ask where your code is, you would then have to select your Archive (not the source code), you can upload your code this way if you need. I personally prefer the built-in Xcode instead.Works either way.For the record, I am copying the thread from Apple Forums.Cheers\nHeider Uncheck "Include bitcode" box, worked for me.Apple appear to have fixed the current particular bug that was present for about the last week.In short, you can upload with the blue "Upload to App Store..." button, rather than having to use the application loader.even more information, the seemingly failed uploadswith each of the items there 208-231, I had tried to upload in the normal way, and it failed with the "Try Again (-22421)" code.In fact, unnoticed by me, they were all going up to the app store, but it looks like they were just getting stuck on endless processing.I then did I believe exactly what StevenOjo reported (yesterday) above:Setting up an A NEW account on iTunes with a NEW email addressALSO SET THAT UP ON DEVELOPER, remembering that, because Apple is the world\'s most idiotic organization, developer.apple is totally different from ituneconnect.appleFrom my actual normal account, and this is IN DEVELOPER, NOT ITUNES CONNECT, I invited that new alter ego as an adminExporting the app from the organizer, as an IPA for app store distribution.Logging into application loader with that new email and uploading the archive. It worked without any issues.It\'s possible it would actually work fine now with my usual account; I don\'t know.To be clear, after a very short time (say, two minutes), the final build (ie, 233 above) did indeed become "ready to test" as normal on the app store ..All the "dud" uploads seem to be stuck forever on processing.It is literally not possible to hire programmers and sysadmins, who are this bad.There must be some sort of conspiracy theory, behind the utter fiasco that is Apple\'s provisioning. Maybe it\'s some sort of reverse-psychology marketing plot or something ....... who knows.Later the same day: I then tried with a new build number using the normal "Upload to the App Store..." cheery blue button.I then tried using Application Loader as described above...Conclusion ...:/  what a fiasco.I increased build number but the problem remained.Then,This action could not be completed. Try Again (-22421)This action could not be completed. Try again.I hope this helps.The problem can not be solved with xCode Upload Process. I was facing same issues few days ago when submitting few of my apps and all apps showing same error. After many tries, I used Application Loader to upload app and it worked.Submit it! It works!I\'ve tried to load archive nearly 10 times (with all kinds of cleans and reloads, with different versions and provisioning files), still received the same error. Then suddenly on my next attempt it showed me: "cannot proceed with delivery an existing transporter instance is currently uploading this package", I did the following and it helped:Basically, you need to clear out the transport tokens. This can happen if you were to close out of Xcode while in the middle of submitting an app to iTunes Connect.Delete any .token files in this directory.\nIf you are unable to find the .token files, this is because they are hidden in Finder. To hide/show hidden files in Finder, use the following Terminal command (TRUE = UNHIDE, FALSE = HIDE):defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE;killall FinderInstead of clicking the blue Upload to App Store\xe2\x80\xa6 button from the Organizer or while Archiving, Xcode offers a better tool to do this, but it is a little hidden and the process is not clear how to use it.Here is what I documented while submitting our latest iOS application to the App Store:First, do NOT use the blue Upload to App Store\xe2\x80\xa6 button.From Xcode\'s Xcode: Developer Tools: menu, select Application Loader.Sign in with appropriate credentials that allow you to upload to the App Store.When Application Loader shows you its main screen, select the Choose button on the lower right of the main window and open your IPA that you exported for the App Store.Proceed with the submission.Why you want to do this:Open Terminal and run:\xef\xa3\xbfFor Xcode 8.3.2i have resolved same issue "This action could not be completed. Try Again (-22421)"using following steps...For Xcode 9issue \xe2\x80\x9dThis action could not be completed. Try Again (-22421)\xe2\x80\x9d has been Resolved in Xcode 9. Now, we can upload app through Xcode Organizer also. https://developer.apple.com/library/content/releasenotes/DeveloperTools/RN-Xcode/Chapters/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001051-CH1-SW876Just In case it is same my mistake.Did you check both provisioning profile settings in "your Project" and "your Targets"?Both developers on our team experienced the same problem, from different machines on May 31st 2017. \nI worked around the problem by: What a lovely waste of time. Hopefully these steps work for others and save some time. In my case it was caused by lack of some of the app icons in the Images.xcassetsWhen you receive error "Action could not be completed. Try Again (-22421)",\nJust try to resubmit same app on iTunes store using XCode again, and you will get the actual error messages next time. Detailed error message which your received next time will help you what to do actually!!!If you are receiving same error again and again, you can submit app using "App Loader" and it may success to submit.[ Take care Point: ] Please check your app version / build version number is greater than previously submitted version. \nYou can verify it in Xcode -> Project setting -> General section AND iTunes-Connect-Account -> App Package -> Activity tabFor June 1 2017Certain combined steps from answer of this thread that worked for me. I am writing the process that worked fine for me.1) Open terminal and run thiscd ~mv .itmstransporter/ .old_itmstransporter/"/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/Application Loader.app/Contents/itms/bin/iTMSTransporter"iTMSTransporter will then update itself, wait till process completes.2) Logout the apple account from Xcode preferences account and login again instead of creating new Id on iTunes and developer account.3) Clean the project and archive then export the app from organiser as an IPA for app store distribution.4) Logging into application loader with same account and upload the ipa. 5) Process will complete successfully.I had this problem over and over again. No descriptive description, just the error message that OP posted.In fact, it was a problem with the build and so had nothing to do with Apple\'s servers at all, as you might think.The solution was to go to Organizer and Export the build, then upload it via Application Loader. Here I got the correct error messages. In my case, it was a problem with CocoaPods breaking app extension validations. I solved this and then I could upload my build.Hope this helps someone like me.I had the same issue. It was related to the Build Settings -> Code Signing Identity -> Release which was set to iOS Developer. If has to be set to iOS Distribution in order for Xcode upload to work.I was too having this issues, I had uploaded my application and also updated it once but had no issues, but as i was uploading it for the 3rd time, i came across this issue, tried hell lot of things, scratched my head, googled it for hours, kept on trying the whole day, but nothing happened, but next day( a new light came) and my app uploaded on the first attempt.Feel like there was some issue from apple side(be it there server, there software xCode or there mac).So don not get dishearten if facing this problem, you can explore diff things with this problem but its just simple thing to correct this issue is to wait for some time take rest and try again.The best solution is indeed Application Loader.\nI can\'t comment on Naresh\'s note on this (I\'m too much of a newbie to StackOverflow), but am warning you that if you are using Swift, don\'t the use Xcode ipa generation system. I prefer manual creation of the IPA by:Validating the same archive that failed to upload worked for me. Or just Apple\'s servers came back up.If you connect a device while the app is building/archiving, your generic device will change to your connected device automatically, and when you are trying to upload to the app store you will have that weird crash. This:\n will change to this automatically:So to answer your question, I don\'t know if your issue have been caused because you plugged your iOs device while archiving, but you will be able to reproduce that issue if you plug your iOS device while archiving your app. Hope this helps somebodyMy problem was with the provisional profiles.So for me it worked:Go to Xcode preferences -> Accounts -> In my ID Apple Account -> Select "Download All"I checked too, in member center and delete all invalid provisionals profiles and:1 - Close Xcode2 - Open Xcode, do clean and build of my project.3 - Archive my code again.Check this list or just keep trying upload!This occurred to me after I enabled two-factor authentication in my Apple ID. After I disable two-factor authentication, everything works as expected.
