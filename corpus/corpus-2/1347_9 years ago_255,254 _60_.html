In what scenarios is it better to use a struct vs a class in C++?Differences between a class and a struct in C++ are that structs have default public members and bases and classes have default private members and bases. Both classes and structs can have a mixture of public and private members, can use inheritance and can have member functions.I would recommend using structs as plain-old-data structures without any class-like features, and using classes as aggregate data structures with private data and member functions.As everyone else notes there are really only two actual language differences:But the real difference in practice is between a class/struct that declares a constructor/destructor and one that doesn\'t.  There are certain guarantees to a "plain-old-data" POD type, that no longer apply once you take over the class\'s construction.  To keep this distinction clear, many people deliberately only use structs for POD types, and, if they are going to add any methods at all, use classes.  The difference between the two fragments below is otherwise meaningless:(Incidentally, here\'s a thread with some good explanations about what "POD type" actually means: What are POD types in C++?)The only time I use a struct instead of a class is when declaring a functor right before using it in a function call and want to minimize syntax for the sake of clarity. e.g.:There are lots of misconceptions in the existing answers.Both class and struct declare a class.Yes, you may have to rearrange your access modifying keywords inside the class definition, depending on which keyword you used to declare the class.But, beyond syntax, the only reason to choose one over the other is convention/style/preference.Some people like to stick with the struct keyword for classes without member functions, because the resulting definition "looks like" a simple structure from C.Similarly, some people like to use the class keyword for classes with member functions and private data, because it says "class" on it and therefore looks like examples from their favourite book on object-oriented programming.The reality is that this completely up to you and your team, and it\'ll make literally no difference whatsoever to your program.The following two classes are absolutely equivalent in every way except their name:You can even switch keywords when redeclaring:(although some compilers will emit a warning when you do this, on the assumption that you probably didn\'t intend to do something so confusing and that you should therefore be prompted to double-check your code.)and the following expressions both evaluate to true:From the C++ FAQ Lite:The members and base classes of a struct are public by default, while in class, they default to private. Note: you should make your base classes explicitly public, private, or protected, rather than relying on the defaults.struct and class are otherwise functionally equivalent.OK, enough of that squeaky clean techno talk. Emotionally, most developers make a strong distinction between a class and a struct. A struct simply feels like an open pile of bits with very little in the way of encapsulation or functionality. A class feels like a living and responsible member of society with intelligent services, a strong encapsulation barrier, and a well defined interface. Since that\'s the connotation most people already have, you should probably use the struct keyword if you have a class that has very few methods and has public data (such things do exist in well designed systems!), but otherwise you should probably use the class keyword. One place where a struct has been helpful for me is when I have a system that\'s receiving fixed format messages (over say, a serial port) from another system.  You can cast the stream of bytes into a struct that defines your fields, and then easily access the fields.Obviously, this is the same thing you would do in C, but I find that the overhead of having to decode the message into a class is usually not worth it.You can use "struct" in C++ if you are writing a library whose internals are C++ but the API can be called by either C or C++ code.  You simply make a single header that contains structs and global API functions that you expose to both C and C++ code as this:Then you can write a function bar() in a C++ file using C++ code and make it callable from C and the two worlds can share data through the declared struct\'s.  There are other caveats of course when mixing C and C++ but this is a simplified example.Structs (PODs, more generally) are handy when you\'re providing a C-compatible interface with a C++ implementation, since they\'re portable across language borders and linker formats.If that\'s not a concern to you, then I suppose the use of the "struct" instead of "class" is a good communicator of intent (as @ZeroSignal said above).  Structs also have more predictable copying semantics, so they\'re useful for data you intend to write to external media or send across the wire.  Structs are also handy for various metaprogramming tasks, like traits templates that just expose a bunch of dependent typedefs:...But that\'s really just taking advantage of struct\'s default protection level being public...For C++, there really isn\'t much of a difference between structs and classes. The main functional difference is that members of a struct are public by default, while they are private by default in classes. Otherwise, as far as the language is concerned, they are equivalent.That said, I tend to use structs in C++ like I do in C#, similar to what Brian has said. Structs are simple data containers, while classes are used for objects that need to act on the data in addition to just holding on to it.As every one says, the only real difference is the default access. But I particularly use struct when I don\'t want any sort of encapsulation with a simple data class, even if I implement some helper methods. For instance, when I need something like this:To answer my own question (shamelessly), As already mentioned, access privileges are the only difference between them in C++.  I tend to use a struct for data-storage only.  I\'ll allow it to get a few helper functions if it makes working with the data easier.  However as soon as the data requires flow control (i.e. getters/setters that maintain or protect an internal state) or starts acquring any major functionality (basically more object-like), it will get \'upgraded\' to a class to better communicate intent.They are pretty much the same thing.  Thanks to the magic of C++, a struct can hold functions, use inheritance, created using "new" and so on  just like a class The only functional difference is that a class begins with private access rights, while a struct begins with public.  This is the maintain backwards compatibility with C.In practice, I\'ve always used structs as data holders and classes as objects.they\'re the same thing with different defaults (private by default for class, and public by default for struct), so in theory they\'re totally interchangeable.so, if I just want to package some info to move around, I use a struct, even if i put a few methods there (but not many).  If it\'s a mostly-opaque thing, where the main use would be via methods, and not directly to the data members, i use a full class.Structs by default have public access and classes by default have private access.Personally I use structs for Data Transfer Objects or as Value Objects. When used as such I declare all members as const to prevent modification by other code.When would you choose to use struct\n  and when to use class in C++?I use struct when I define functors and POD. Otherwise I use class.I use structs when I need to create POD type or functor.I use struct only when I need to hold some data without any member functions associated to it (to operate on the member data) and to access the data variables directly.Eg: Reading/Writing data from files and socket streams etc. Passing function arguments in a structure where the function arguments are too many and function syntax looks too lengthy.Technically there is no big difference between class and struture except default accessibility.\nMore over it depends on programming style how you use it.Technically both are the same in C++ - for instance it\'s possible for a struct to have overloaded operators etc.However :I use structs when I wish to pass information of multiple types simultaneously\nI use classes when the I\'m dealing with a "functional" object.Hope it helps.For instance, I\'m returning a struct student in the get...() methods over here - enjoy.I thought that Structs was intended as a Data Structure (like a multi-data type array of information) and classes was inteded for Code Packaging (like collections of subroutines & functions)..:(I never use "struct" in C++. I can\'t ever imagine a scenario where you would use a struct when you want private members, unless you\'re willfully trying to be confusing. It seems that using structs is more of a syntactic indication of how the data will be used, but I\'d rather just make a class and try to make that explicit in the name of the class, or through comments. E.g.Access functions aren\'t the only difference between structs and classes. A struct is better for POD (Plain Old Data) types, since it is easier to manage for the compiler and the programmer. For beginners who don\'t use object-oriented programming, using a struct is fine.
