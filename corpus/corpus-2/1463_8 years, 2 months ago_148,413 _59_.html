What is an idempotent operation?In computing, an idempotent operation is one that has no additional effect if it is called more than once with the same input parameters. For example, removing an item from a set can be considered an idempotent operation on the set.In mathematics, an idempotent operation is one where f(f(x)) = f(x). For example, the abs() function is idempotent because abs(abs(x)) = abs(x) for all x. These slightly different definitions can be reconciled by considering that x in the mathematical definition represents the state of an object, and f is an operation that may mutate that object. For example, consider the Python set and its discard method. The discard method removes an element from a set, and does nothing if the element does not exist. So:has exactly the same effect as doing the same operation twice:Idempotent operations are often used in the design of network protocols, where a request to perform an operation is guaranteed to happen at least once, but might also happen more than once. If the operation is idempotent, then there is no harm in performing the operation two or more times.See the Wikipedia article on idempotence for more information.The above answer previously had some incorrect and misleading examples. Comments below written before April 2014 refer to an older revision.An idempotent operation can be repeated an arbitrary number of times and the result will be the same as if it had been done only once.  In arithmetic, adding zero to a number is idempotent.Idempotence is talked about a lot in the context of "RESTful" web services.  REST seeks to maximally leverage HTTP to give programs access to web content, and is usually set in contrast to SOAP-based web services, which just tunnel remote procedure call style services inside HTTP requests and responses.REST organizes a web application into "resources" (like a Twitter user, or a Flickr image) and then uses the HTTP verbs of POST, PUT, GET, and DELETE to create, update, read, and delete those resources.Idempotence plays an important role in REST.  If you GET a representation of a REST resource (eg, GET a jpeg image from Flickr), and the operation fails, you can just repeat the GET again and again until the operation succeeds.  To the web service, it doesn\'t matter how many times the image is gotten.  Likewise, if you use a RESTful web service to update your Twitter account information, you can PUT the new information as many times as it takes in order to get confirmation from the web service.  PUT-ing it a thousand times is the same as PUT-ing it once.  Similarly DELETE-ing a REST resource a thousand times is the same as deleting it once.  Idempotence thus makes it a lot easier to construct a web service that\'s resilient to communication errors.Further reading: RESTful Web Services, by Richardson and Ruby (idempotence is discussed on page 103-104), and Roy Fielding\'s PhD dissertation on REST.  Fielding was one of the authors of HTTP 1.1, RFC-2616, which talks about idempotence in section 9.1.2.No matter how many times you call the operation, the result will be the same.Idempotence means that applying an operation once or applying it multiple times has the same effect.Examples:For pure functions (functions with no side effects) then idempotency implies that f(x) = f(f(x)) = f(f(f(x))) = f(f(f(f(x)))) = ...... for all values of xFor functions with side effects, idempotency furthermore implies that no additional side effects will be caused after the first application. You can consider the state of the world to be an additional "hidden" parameter to the function if you like.Note that in a world where you have concurrent actions going on, you may find that operations you thought were idempotent cease to be so (for example, another thread could unset the value of the boolean flag in the example above). Basically whenever you have concurrency and mutable state, you need to think much more carefully about idempotency.Idempotency is often a useful property in building robust systems. For example, if there is a risk that you may receive a duplicate message from a third party, it is helpful to have the message handler act as an idempotent operation so that the message effect only happens once.An idempotent operation leaves everything in the same state if you call it once or many times, provided you pass in the same parameters.Just wanted to throw out a real use case that demonstrates idempotence. In JavaScript, say you are defining a bunch of model classes (as in MVC model). The way this is often implemented is functionally equivalent to something like this (basic example):You could then define new classes like this:But if you were to try to get the User class via model(\'user\'), from somewhere else in the code, it would fail:Those two User constructors would be different. That is,To make it idempotent, you would just add some sort of caching mechanism, like this:By adding caching, every time you did model(\'user\') it will be the same object, and so it\'s idempotent. So:Idempotent Operations: Operations that have no side-effects if executed multiple times.\n\nExample: An operation that retrieves values from a data resource and say, prints it\n\nNon-Idempotent Operations: Operations that would cause some harm if executed multiple times. (As they change some values or states)\n\nExample: An operation that withdraws from a bank account An idempotent operation over a set leaves its members unchanged when applied one or more times.It can be a unary operation like absolute(x) where x belongs to a set of positive integers. Here absolute(absolute(x)) = x.It can be a binary operation like union of a set with itself would always return the same set.cheersQuite a detailed and technical answers. Just adding a simple definition.Idempotent = Re-runnableFor example, \nCreate operation in itself is not guaranteed to run without error if executed more than once.\nBut if there is an operation CreateOrUpdate then it states re-runnability (Idempotency).It is any operation that every nth result will result in an output matching the value of the 1st result. For instance the absolute value of -1 is 1. The absolute value of the absolute value of -1 is 1. The absolute value of the absolute value of absolute value of -1 is 1. And so on. See also: When would be a really silly time to use recursion?An idempotent operation is an operation, action, or request that can be applied multiple times without changing the result, i.e. the state of the system, beyond the initial application. EXAMPLES (WEB APP CONTEXT):NULLIPOTENT:\nIf an operation has no side effects, like purely displaying information on a web page without any change in a database (in other words you are only reading the database), we say the operation is NULLIPOTENT. All GETs should be nullipotent. Otherwise, use POST.IDEMPOTENT:\nA message in an email messaging system is opened and marked as "opened" in the database. One can open the message many times but this repeated action will only ever result in that message being in the "opened" state. This is an idempotent operation.NON-IDEMPOTENT:\nIf an operation always causes a change in state, like POSTing the same message to a user over and over, resulting in a new message sent and stored in the database every time, we say that the operation is NON-IDEMPOTENT.When talking about the state of the system we are obviously ignoring hopefully harmless and inevitable effects like logging and diagnostics.In short, Idempotent operations means that the operation will not result in different results no matter how many times you operate the idempotent operations.For example, according to the definition of the spec of HTTP, GET, HEAD, PUT, and DELETE are idempotent operations; however POST and PATCH are not. That\'s why sometimes POST is replaced by PATCH.An idempotent method is a method that will produce the same results irrespective of how many times it is called.The GET method is idempotent, as multiple calls to the GET resource will always return the same response.The PUT method is idempotent, as calling the PUT method multiple times will update the same resource and not change the outcome.The POST is not idempotent, and calling the POST method multiple times can \nhave different results and will result in creating new resources.The DELETE is idempotent because once the resource is deleted, it is gone and calling the method multiple times will not change the outcome.my 5c:\nIn integration and networking the idempotency is very important.\nSeveral examples from real-life:\nImagine, we deliver data to the target system. Data delivered by a sequence of messages. \n1. What would happen if the sequence is mixed in channel? (As network packages always do :) ). If the target system is idempotent, the result will not be different. If the target system depends of the right order in the sequence, we have to implement resequencer on the target site, which would restore the right order.\n2. What would happen if there are the message duplicates? If the channel of target system does not acknowledge timely, the source system (or channel itself) usually sends another copy of the message. As a result we can have duplicate message on the target system side. \nIf the target system is idempotent, it takes care of it and result will not be different.\nIf the target system is not idempotent, we have to implement deduplicator on the target system side of the channel.From a RESTful service standpoint, for an operation (or service call) to be idempotent, clients can make that same call repeatedly while producing the same result. In other words, making multiple identical requests has the same effect as making a single request. Note that while idempotent operations produce the same result on the server (no side effects), the response itself may not be the same (e.g. a resource\'s state may change between requests).GET represents an idempotent,\nread-only operation. You can send a GET request to a server repeatedly with no ill effects,\nbecause a GET does not (or should not) change state on the server.A POST, on the other hand, is the type of request you\nuse to submit a credit card transaction, add an album to\na shopping cart, or change a password. A POST request\ngenerally modifi es state on the server, and repeating the\nrequest might produce undesirable effects (such as double\nbilling). Many browsers help a user avoid repeating\na POST request.Web applications generally use GET requests for reads and POST requests for writes (which\ntypically include updates, creates, and deletes). A request to pay for music uses POST. A request to\nsearch for music, a scenario you look at next, uses GET.I read other answers and it seems there is some confusion about idempotence.  I think it happens because sometimes it looks like its usage in programming differs from its mathematical definition (e.g. using it for REST verbs). If it confuses you then have a look at this article which makes things easier https://mortoray.com/2014/09/05/what-is-an-idempotent-function/. It explains that we always can rewrite cases of idempotence from programming to follow its mathematical definition.retry-safe.Is usually the easiest way to understand its meaning in computer science.
