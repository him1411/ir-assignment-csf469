I\'m changing CSS with jQuery and I wish to remove the styling I\'m adding based on the input value:How can I do this? Note that the line above runs whenever a color is selected using a color picker (ie. when mouse moves over a color wheel).2nd note: I can\'t do this with css("background-color", "none") because it will remove the default styling from the css files. I just want to remove the background-color inline style added by jQuery.Changing the property to an empty string appears to do the job.$.css("background-color", "");The accepted answer works but leaves an empty style attribute on the DOM in my tests. No big deal, but this removes it all:This assumes you want to remove all dynamic styling and return back to the stylesheet styling.There are several ways to remove a CSS property using jQuery:1. Setting the CSS property to its default (initial) valueSee the initial value for the CSS property at MDN.\nHere the default value is transparent. You can also use inherit for several CSS properties to inherite the attribute from its parent. In CSS3/CSS4, you may also use initial, revert or unset but these keywords may have limited browser support.2. Removing the CSS propertyAn empty string removes the CSS property, i.e.But beware, as specified in jQuery .css() documentation, this removes the property but it has compatibilty issues with IE8 for certain CSS shorthand properties, including background.Setting the value of a style property to an empty string \xe2\x80\x94 e.g.\n  $(\'#mydiv\').css(\'color\', \'\') \xe2\x80\x94 removes that property from an element\n  if it has already been directly applied, whether in the HTML style\n  attribute, through jQuery\'s .css() method, or through direct DOM\n  manipulation of the style property. It does not, however, remove a\n  style that has been applied with a CSS rule in a stylesheet or \n  element. Warning: one notable exception is that, for IE 8 and below,\n  removing a shorthand property such as border or background will\n  remove that style entirely from the element, regardless of what is set\n  in a stylesheet or  element.3. Removing the whole style of the elementI got the way to remove a style attribute with pure JavaScript just to let you know the way of pure JavaScript either of these jQuery functions should work:This will remove complete tag : How about something like:Try this:ThanksIf you use CSS style, you can use:and then replace with:If you don\'t use CSS style and you have attribute in HTML element, you can use:Use my Plugin : For your case ,Use it as following : or if you want to remove also CSS defined in its classes : Just using:or This one also work!!This is more complex than some other solutions, but may offer more flexibility in scenarios:1) Make a class definition to isolate (encapsulate) the styling you want to apply/remove selectively. It can be empty (and for this case, probably should be):2) use this code, based on http://jsfiddle.net/kdp5V/167/ from this answer  by gilly3:Usage example: http://jsfiddle.net/qvkwhtow/Caveats: Isolating the styling this way is what CSS is all about, even if manipulating it isn\'t. Manipulating CSS rules is NOT what jQuery is all about, jQuery manipulates DOM elements, and uses CSS selectors to do it.Simple is cheap in web development. I recommend using empty string when removing a particular style Try ThisWhy not make the style you wish to remove a CSS class? Now you can use: .removeClass(). \nThis also opens up the possibility of using: .toggleClass()(remove the class if it\'s present, and add it if it\'s not.) Adding / removing a class is also less confusing to change / troubleshoot when dealing with layout issues (as opposed to trying to figure out why a particular style disappeared.)
