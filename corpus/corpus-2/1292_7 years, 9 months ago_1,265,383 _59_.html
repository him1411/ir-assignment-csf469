I have a form with name orderproductForm and an undefined number of inputs.I want to do some kind of jQuery.get or ajax or anything like that that would call a page through Ajax, and send along all the inputs of the form orderproductForm.I suppose one way would be to do something likeHowever I do not know exactly all the form inputs. Is there a feature, function or something that would just send ALL the form inputs?ThanksYou can use the ajaxForm/ajaxSubmit functions from Ajax Form Plugin or the jQuery serialize function.AjaxForm:orajaxForm will send when the submit button is pressed. ajaxSubmit sends immediately.Serialize:AJAX serialization documentation is here.This is a simple reference:I hope it helps you.Another similar solution using attributes defined on the form element:There are a few things you need to bear in mind.1. There are several ways to submit a formWe should therefore bind to the form submit event, not the button click event. This will ensure our code works on all devices and assistive technologies now and in the future.2. HijaxThe user may not have JavaScript enabled. A hijax pattern is good here, where we gently take control of the form using JavaScript, but leave it submittable if JavaScript fails.We should pull the URL and method from the form, so if the HTML changes, we don\'t need to update the JavaScript.3. Unobtrusive JavaScriptUsing event.preventDefault() instead of return false is good practice as it allows the event to bubble up. This lets other scripts tie into the event, for example analytics scripts which may be monitoring user interactions.SpeedWe should ideally use an external script, rather than inserting our script inline. We can link to this in the head section of the page using a script tag, or link to it at the bottom of the page for speed. The script should quietly enhance the user experience, not get in the way.CodeAssuming you agree with all the above, and you want to catch the submit event, and handle it via AJAX (a hijax pattern), you could do something like this:You can manually trigger a form submission whenever you like via JavaScript using something like:Edit:I recently had to do this and ended up writing a plugin. Add a data-autosubmit attribute to your form tag and you can then do this:It is a modified version of Alfrekjv\'s answerJavaScriptI wanted to edit Alfrekjv\'s answer but deviated too much from it so decided to post this as a separate answer.Does not send files, does not support buttons, for example clicking a button (including a submit button) sends its value as form data, but because this is an ajax request the button click will not be sent.To support buttons you can capture the actual button click instead of the submit.On the server side you can detect an ajax request with this header that jquery sets HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH\nfor phpPHPYou can also use FormData (But not available in IE):How to use FormData: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/XMLHttpRequest/FormData/Using_FormData_ObjectsThis code works even with file inputI really liked this answer by superluminary and especially the way he wrapped is solution in a jQuery plugin. So thanks to superluminary for a very useful answer. In my case, though, I wanted a plugin that would allow me to define the success and error event handlers by means of options when the plugin is initialized.So here is what I came up with:This plugin allows me to very easily "ajaxify" html forms on the page and provide onsubmit, success and error event handlers for implementing feedback to the user of the status of the form submit. This allowed the plugin to be used as follows:Note that the success and error event handlers receive the same arguments that you would receive from the corresponding events of the jQuery ajax method.  I got the following for me:whereThis assumes the post to \'url\' returns an ajax in the form of {success: false, error:\'my Error to display\'}You can vary this as you like. Feel free to use that snippet.consider using closestTo avoid multiple formdata sends:Don\'t forget to unbind submit event, before the form submited again, \nUser can call sumbit function more than one time, maybe he forgot something, or was a validation error.If you\'re using form.serialize() - you need to give each form element a name like this:And the form gets serialized like this:You may use this on submit function like below.HTML FormjQuery function:For more details and sample Visit:\nhttp://www.spiderscode.com/simple-ajax-contact-form/There\'s also the submit event, which can be triggered like this $("#form_id").submit(). You\'d use this method if the form is well represented in HTML already. You\'d just read in the page, populate the form inputs with stuff, then call .submit(). It\'ll use the method and action defined in the form\'s declaration, so you don\'t need to copy it into your javascript.examples
