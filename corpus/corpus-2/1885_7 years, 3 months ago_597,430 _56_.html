Fairly new to the Google Maps Api. I\'ve got an array of data that I want to cycle through and plot on a map. Seems fairly simple, but all the multi-marker tutorials I have found are quite complex.Let\'s use the data array from google\'s site for an example:I simply want to plot all of these points and have an infoWindow pop up when clicked to display the name.This is the simplest I could reduce it to:Screenshot:There is some closure magic happening when passing the callback argument to the addListener method. This can be quite a tricky topic, if you are not familiar with how closures work. I would suggest checking out the following Mozilla article for a brief introduction, if it is the case:Here is another example of Multiple Markers Loading with unique title and infoWindow text. Tested with Latest Google Maps API V3.11Screenshot of 250 MarkersIt will automatically randomize the Lat/Lng to make unique. Example will be very helpful if you want to test 500, 1000, xxx markers and performance.I thought I would put this here as it appears to be a popular landing point for those starting to use Google Maps API\'s. Multiple markers rendered on the client side is probably the downfall of many mapping applications performance wise. It is difficult to benchmark, fix and in some cases even establish there is an issue (due to browser implementation differences, hardware available to the client, mobile devices, the list goes on). The simplest way to begin to address this issue is to use a marker clustering solution. The basic idea is to group geographically similar locations into a group with the number of points displayed. As the user zooms into the map these groups expand to reveal individual markers beneath. Perhaps the simplest to implement is the markerclusterer library. A basic implementation would be as follows (after library imports):The markers instead of being added directly to the map are added to an array. This array is then passed to the library which handles complex calculation for you and attached to the map. Not only do these implementations massively increase client side performance but they also in many cases lead to a simpler and less cluttered UI and easier digestion of data on larger scales. Other implementations are available from Google. Hope this aids some of those newer to the nuances of mapping.Asynchronous version :From Google Map API samples: Full working Example you can Just Copy Paste and use.Here is another version I wrote to save map real estate, that places the infowindow pointer on the actual lat and long of the marker, while temporarily hiding the marker while the infowindow is being displayed.It also does away with the standard \'marker\' assignment and speeds up\nprocessing by directly assigning the new marker to the markers array on the markers creation. Note however, that additional properties have been added to both the marker and the infowindow, so this approach is a tad unconventional... but that\'s me! It is never mentioned in these infowindow questions, that the standard infowindow IS NOT placed at the lat and lng of the marker point, but rather at the top of the marker image. The marker visibility must be hidden for this to work, otherwise the Maps API will shove the infowindow anchor back to the top of the marker image again.Reference to the markers in the \'markers\' array are created immediately upon marker declaration for any additional processing tasks that may be desired later(hiding/showing, grabbing the coords,etc...). This saves the additional step of assigning the marker object to \'marker\', and then pushing the \'marker\' to the markers array... a lot of unnecessary processing in my book.Anyway, a different take on infowindows, and hope it helps to inform and inspire you.Here is a working JSFiddleAdditional Note\nYou will notice in this given Google example data a fourth place in the \'locations\' array with a number. Given this in the example, you could also use this value for the marker id in place of the current loop value, such that...Add a marker in your program is very simple. You just need to add this code: The following fields are particularly important and commonly set when constructing a marker:Note, in my example, the title field set the marker\'s title who will appear as a tooltip.You can have the Google documenation here.This is a complete code to set one marker in a map. Be care full, you must replace YOUR_API_KEY by your google API key:\nNow, if you want to plot some markers of an array in a map, you should do like this:This example give me the following result:You can, also, put an infoWindow in your pin. You just need this code:You can have the Google\'s documentation about infoWindows here.Now, we can open the infoWindow when the marker is "clik" like this:Note, you can have some documentation about Listener here in google developer.And, finally, we can plot an infoWindow in a marker if the user click on it. This is my complete code:Normally, you should have this result:Following from Daniel Vassallo\'s answer, here is a version that deals with the closure issue in a simpler way.Since since all markers will have an individual InfoWindow and since JavaScript doesn\'t care if you add extra properties to an object, all you need to do is add an InfoWindow to the Marker\'s properties and then call the .open() on the InfoWindow from itself! Edit: With enough data, the pageload could take a lot of time, so rather than construction the InfoWindow with the marker, the construction should happen only when needed.  Note that any data used to construct the InfoWindow must be appended to the Marker as a property (data). Also note that after the first click event, infoWindow will persist as a property of it\'s marker so the browser doesn\'t need to constantly reconstruct.Here is a nearly complete example javascript function that will allow multiple markers defined in a JSONObject.It will only display the markers that are with in the bounds of the map.  This is important so you are not doing extra work.  You can also set a limit to the markers so you are not showing an extreme amount of markers (if there is a possibility of a thing in your usage);it will also not display markers if the center of the map has not changed more than 500 meters.\nThis is important because if a user clicks on the marker and accidentally drags the map while doing so you don\'t want the map to reload the markers.I attached this function to the idle event listener for the map so markers will show only when the map is idle and will redisplay the markers after a different event.In action screen shot\nthere is a little change in the screen shot showing more content in the infowindow.\n\npasted from pastbin.com
