Here\'s my layout code;What this looks like is on the left and what I want it to look like is on the right.The obvious answer is to set the TextView to fill_parent on height but this causes no room to be left for the button or entry field. Essentially the issue is that I want the submit button and the text entry to be a fixed height at the bottom and the text view to fill the rest of the space, similarly in the horizontal Linear layout I want the submit button to wrap its content and for the text entry to fill the rest of the space.If the first item in a Linear Layout is told to fill_parent it does exactly that, leaving no room for other items, how do I get an item which is first in a linear layout to fill all space apart from the minimum required by the rest of the items in the layout?EDIT:Relative Layouts were indeed the answer - Thank you!I think you should try a relative layout.\nIf you have a relative layout that fills the whole screen you should be able to use android:layout_alignParentBottom to move the button to the bottom of the screen.If your views at the bottom are not shown in a relative layout then maybe the layout above it takes all the space. In this case you can put the view that should be at the bottom, first in your layout file and position the rest of the layout above the views with android:layout_above. This enable the bottom view to take as much space as it needs and the rest of the layout can fill all the rest of the screen.In a ScrollView this doesn\'t work, as the RelativeLayout would then overlap whatever is in the ScrollView at the bottom of the page.I fixed it using a dynamically stretching FrameLayout :You can keep your initial linear layout by nesting the relative layout within the linear layout:The answer above (by Janusz) is quite correct, but I personnally don\'t feel 100% confortable with RelativeLayouts, so I prefer to introduce a \'filler\', empty TextView, like this:before the element that should be at the bottom of the screen.This also works.You can do this with a LinearLayout or a ScrollView, too. Sometimes it is easier to implement then a RelativeLayout. The only thing you need to do is to add the following view before the Views you want to align to the bottom of the screen:This creates an empty view, filling the empty space and pushing the next views to the bottom of the screen.You don\'t even need to nest the second relative layout inside the first one. Simply use the android:layout_alignParentBottom="true" in the Button and EditText.Following up on Timores\'s elegant solution, I have found that the following creates a vertical fill in a vertical LinearLayout and a horizontal fill in a horizontal LinearLayout:If you don\'t wish to make many changes, then you could just put:for the TextView having ID as @+id/TextView i.eCreating both HEADER and FOOTER, here is an example[ Layout XML ][ Screenshot ]Hope this is helpful. Thanks!!use below code align button to bottem its workingUse android:layout_alignParentBottom="true"  in your <RelativeLayout>.This will definitely help.In case you have a hierarchy like this:First, apply android:fillViewport="true" to the ScrollView and then apply android:layout_alignParentBottom="true" to the LinearLayout. This worked for me perfectly.You can just give your top child view (the TextView @+id/TextView) an attribute:\n android:layout_weight="1".This will force all other elements below it to the bottom.I used the solution Janusz posted, but added padding to the last View since the  top part of my layout was a ScrollView.  The ScrollView will be partly hidden as it grows with content.  Using  android:paddingBottom on the last View helps show all the content in the ScrollView.This can be done with linear layout too\nJust provide Height = 0dp and weight = 1 to the layout above and the one you want in the bottom just write height = wrap content and no weight.\nWhat it does is it provides wrap content for the layout (the one that contains your edit text and button) and then the one that has weight occupies the rest of the layout.\nI discovered this by accident.For a case like this always use RelativeLayouts. A LinearLayout is not intended for such a usage.
