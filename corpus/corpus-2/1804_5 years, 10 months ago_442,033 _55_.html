I want to run two commands in a Windows CMD console.In Linux I would do it like this: touch thisfile ; ls -lstrh.How is it done on Windows?Like this, at least on WindowsÂ 7:A quote from the documentation:Using multiple commands and conditional processing symbolsYou can run multiple commands from a single command line or script using conditional processing symbols. When you run multiple commands with conditional processing symbols, the commands to the right of the conditional processing symbol act based upon the results of the command to the left of the conditional processing symbol. For example, you might want to run a command only if the previous command fails. Or, you might want to run a command only if the previous command is successful.You can use the special characters listed in the following table to pass multiple commands.& [...]  command1 & command2\n   Use to separate multiple commands on one command line. Cmd.exe runs the first command, and then the second command.&& [...]  command1 && command2\n   Use to run the command following && only if the command preceding the symbol is successful. Cmd.exe runs the first command, and then runs the second command only if the first command completed successfully. || [...]  command1 || command2\n   Use to run the command following || only if the command preceding || fails. Cmd.exe runs the first command, and then runs the second command only if the first command did not complete successfully (receives an error code greater than zero).( ) [...]  (command1 & command2)\n   Use to group or nest multiple commands.; or , command1 parameter1;parameter2\n   Use to separate command parameters.& is the Bash equivalent for ; ( run commands) and && is the Bash equivalent of && (run commands only when the previous has not caused an error).You can use & to run commands one after another. Example: c:\\dir & vim myFile.txtIf you want to create a cmd shortcut (for example on your desktop) add /k parameter (/k means keep, /c will close window):You can use call to overcome the problem of environment variables being evaluated too soon - e.g.cmd /c ipconfig /all & Output.txtThis command execute command and open Output.txt file in a single commandA number of processing symbols can be used when running several commands on the same line, and may lead to processing redirection in some cases, altering output in other case, or just fail. One important case is placing on the same line commands that manipulate variables.As you see in the above example, when commands using variables are placed on the same line, you must use delayed expansion to update your variable values. If your variable is indexed, use CALL command with %% modifiers to update its value on the same line:So, I was trying to enable the specific task of running RegAsm (register assembly) from a context menu.  The issue I had was that the result would flash up and go away before I could read it.  So I tried piping to Pause, which does not work when the command fails (as mentioned here Pause command not working in .bat script and here Batch file command PAUSE does not work).  So I tried cmd /k but that leaves the window open for more commands (I just want to read the result).  So I added a pause followed by exit to the chain, resulting in the following:cmd /k C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\regasm.exe "%1" /codebase \\"%1\\" & pause & exitThis works like a charm -- RegAsm runs on the file and shows its results, then a "Press any key to continue..." prompt is shown, then the command prompt window closes when a key is pressed.P.S.  For others who might be interested, you can use the following .reg file entries to add a dllfile association to .dll files and then a RegAsm command extension to that (notice the escaped quotes and backslashes):Now I have a nice right-click menu to register an assembly.In order to execute two commands at the same time, you must put an & (ampersand) symbol between the two commands. Like so:Cheers!I try to have two pings in the same window, and it is a serial command on the same line. After finishing the first, run the second command.The solution was to combine with start /b on a Windows 7 command prompt.Start as usual, without /b, and launch in a separate window.The command used to launch in the same line is:Any way, if you wish to parse the output, I don\'t recommend to use this.\nI noticed the output is scrambled between the output of the commands.No, cd / && tree && echo %time%. The time echoed is at when the first command is executed.The piping has some issue, but it is not critical as long as people know how it works.Well, you have two options: Piping, or just &:Or,Piping (|) is more for taking the output of one command, and putting it into another. And (&) is just saying run this, and that.  It\'s simple: just differentiate them with && signs. \nExample: Goodbye World will be printed after Hello World.One more example: For example, when we use the gulp build system, instead ofgulp        - default > buildgulp build  - build build-foldergulp watch  - start file-watchgulp dist   - build dist-folderWe can do that with one line:It is possible, you can use the \'&\' Statement.Like in Java or C++ in if you can use \'&&\' Statement,there in Console (BATCH), to execute more than one command in one line, you use \'&\' Statement.Usage:  [command] & [command]Example:.. You can Also write the whole script in just one long line (Maybe):When you try to use or manipulate variables in one line beware of their content! E.g. a variable like the followingmay lead to a lot of unhand-able trouble if you use it as %PATH%
