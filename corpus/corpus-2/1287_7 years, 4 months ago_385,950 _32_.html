In a Git tutorial I\'m going through, git commit is used to store the changes you\'ve made. What is git push used for then?Basically git commit "records changes to the repository" while git push "updates remote refs along with associated objects". So the first one is used in connection with your local repository, while the latter one is used to interact with a remote repository.Here is a nice picture from Oliver Steele, that explains the git model and the commands:Read more about git push and git pull on GitReady.com (the article I referred to first)commit: adding changes to the local repository  push: to transfer the last commit(s) to a remote serverWell, basically git commit puts your changes into your local repo, while git push sends your changes to the remote location.Since git is a distributed version control system, the difference is that commit will commit changes to your local repository, whereas push will push changes up to a remote repo.git push is used to add commits you have done on the local repository to a remote one - together with git pull, it allows people to collaborate.git commit record your changes to the local repository.  git push update the remote repository with your local changes.Commit: {Snapshot | Changeset | History record | Version | \'Save-as\'} of a repository. Repository: series of commits.Local repository: repository on your machine.Remote repository: repository on a server (Github).git commit: Add a new commit (last commit + staged modifications) to the local repository.git push, git pull: Sync local repository with a remote repository. push: from local to remote; pull: from remote to local.A very crude analogy: if we compare git commit to editing a file, then git push would be copying that file to another location.Please don\'t take this analogy out of this context -- committing and pushing are nothing like editing a single file or copying it. That said, the analogy should hold for comparisons sake only.Just want to add the following points:Yon can not push until you commit as we use git push to push commits made on your local branch to a remote repository.The git push command takes two arguments:A remote name, for example, origin\nA branch name, for example, masterFor example:git push  <REMOTENAME> <BRANCHNAME>in layman terms, git commit is the step before git push you run them in that order to successfully git your file to github.Well, basically git commit puts your changes into your local repo, while git push sends your changes to the remote location. Since git is a distributed version control system, the difference is that commit will commit changes to your local repository, whereas push will push changes up to a remote reposource Googlehttp://gitref.org/basic/ this link will be very useful toohttps://git-scm.com/docs/git-commitgit commit is to commit the files that is staged in the local repo. git push is to fast-forward merge the master branch of local side with the remote master branch. But the merge won\'t always success. If rejection appears, you have to pull so that you can make a successful git push.
