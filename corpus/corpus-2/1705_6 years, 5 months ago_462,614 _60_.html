Here is my simple form:Here is my Express.js/Node.js code:I tried sReq.query.email or sReq.query[\'email\'] or sReq.params[\'email\'], etc. None of them work. They all return undefined. When I change to a Get call, it works, so .. any idea?Things have changed again in Express 4.0:and then:The rest is like in Express 3.0:Firstly you need to add some middleware to parse the post data of the body.Add one or both of the following lines of code:Then, in your handler, use the req.body object:Note that the use of express.bodyParser() is not recommended....is equivalent to:Security concerns exist with express.multipart(), and so it is better to explicitly add support for the specific encoding type(s) you require. If you do need multipart encoding (to support uploading files for example) then you should read this.Note: this answer is for Express 2. See here for Express 3.If you\'re using connect/express, you should use the bodyParser middleware: It\'s described in the Expressjs guide.Here\'s the original connect-only version:Both the querystring and body are parsed using Rails-style parameter handling (qs) rather than the low-level querystring library. In order to parse repeated parameters with qs, the parameter needs to have brackets: name[]=val1&name[]=val2. It also supports nested maps. In addition to parsing HTML form submissions, the bodyParser can parse JSON requests automatically.Edit: I read up on express.js and modified my answer to be more natural to users of Express.Security concern using express.bodyParser()While all the other answers currently recommend using the express.bodyParser() middleware, this is actually a wrapper around the express.json(), express.urlencoded(), and express.multipart() middlewares (http://expressjs.com/api.html#bodyParser).  The parsing of form request bodies is done by the express.urlencoded() middleware and is all that you need to expose your form data on req.body object.Due to a security concern with how express.multipart()/connect.multipart() creates temporary files for all uploaded files (and are not garbage collected), it is now recommended not to use the express.bodyParser() wrapper but instead use only the middlewares you need.Note: connect.bodyParser() will soon be updated to only include urlencoded and json when Connect 3.0 is released (which Express extends).So in short, instead of ......you should useand if/when you need to handle multipart forms (file uploads), use a third party library or middleware such as multiparty, busboy, dicer, etc.This will do it if you want to build the posted query without middleware:That will send this to the browserIt\'s probably better to use middleware though so you don\'t have to write this over and over in each route.Note for Express 4 users:If you try and put app.use(express.bodyParser()); into your app, you\'ll get the following error when you try to start your Express server:Error: Most middleware (like bodyParser) is no longer bundled with Express and must be installed separately. Please see https://github.com/senchalabs/connect#middleware.You\'ll have to install the package body-parser separately from npm, then use something like the following (example taken from the GitHub page):Given some form: Using expressOutput:Then for app.post request you can get post values via req.body.{post request variable}.Middleware of the following is removed from Express.When you use the middleware directly like you did in express 3.0. You will get the following error:\nIn order to utilize those middleware, now you need to do npm for each middleware separately.Since bodyParser is marked as deprecated, so I recommend the following way using json, urlencode and multipart parser like formidable, connect-multiparty. (Multipart middleware is deprecated as well).Also remember, just defining urlencode + json, the form data will not be parsed and req.body will be undefined. You need to define a middleware handle the multipart request.As most of the answers are using to Express, bodyParser, connect; where multipart is deprecated. There is a secure way to send post multipart objects easily.Multer can be used as replacement for connect.multipart(). To install the packageLoad it in your app:And then, add it in the middleware stack along with the other form parsing middleware.connect.json() handles application/jsonconnect.urlencoded() handles application/x-www-form-urlencodedmulter() handles multipart/form-dataBackend:Frontend:You shoudn\'t use app.use(express.bodyParser()). BodyParser is a union of json + urlencoded + mulitpart. You shoudn\'t use this because multipart will be removed in connect 3.0.To resolve that, you can do this:It\xc2\xb4s very important know that app.use(app.router) should be used after the json and urlencoded, otherwise it does not work!I was searching for this exact problem. I was following all the advice above but req.body was still returning an empty object {}. In my case, it was something just as simple as the html being incorrect. In your form\'s html, make sure you use the \'name\' attribute in your input tags, not just \'id\'. Otherwise, nothing is parsed.My idiot mistake is your benefit.Request streaming worked for meI could find all parameters by using following code for both POST and GET requests.
