I have Windows 8.1 pro with an AMD processor. I installed the Android SDK and Eclipse. It works but the problem is that when I Create AVD and launch it shows this error:emulator: ERROR: x86 emulation currently requires hardware acceleration!\n   Please ensure Intel HAXM is properly installed and usable.\n   CPU acceleration status: HAX kernel module is not installed!I have already installed Intel Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager and I have enabled Virtual modulation from the boot menu, but it\'s still not working.Make sure you have installed HAXM installer on your SDK Manager.After you download it and make sure you run the setup located in:\n{SDK_FOLDER}\\extras\\intel\\Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager\\intelhaxm.exeNote: in Android Studio, the command "intelhaxm.exe" has been changed to "intelhaxm-android.exe"If you get the error "VT not supported" during the installation disable Hyper-V on windows features. You can execute this command dism.exe /Online /Disable-Feature:Microsoft-Hyper-V. You will also need "Virtualization Technology" to be enabled on your BIOSOpen SDK Manager and download Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM installer) if you haven\'t.Now go to your SDK directory (C:\\users\\username\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\sdk, generally). In this directory, go to extras \xe2\x86\x92 Intel \xe2\x86\x92 Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager and run the file named "intelhaxm-android.exe".In case you get an error like "Intel virtualization technology\n  (vt,vt-x) is not enabled", go to your BIOS settings and enable\n  hardware virtualization.Restart Android Studio and then try to start the AVD again.It might take a minute or 2 to show the emulator window.If you\'re running Mac, as @pedro mentions ensure you have the HAXM installer dowloaded via the Android SDK Manager. Next install it! In finder navigate to /YOUR_SDK_PATH/extras/intel/Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager/ Run and install the .mpgk in the following .dmgExample:First, you must enable Intel virtualization technology from the BIOS:Second, navigate to your SDK ...\\extras\\intel\\Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager:Then install intelhaxm-android.exe.Note that if you can\'t find this file in the directory, make sure you install the package from your SDK manager:This resolves it for me:Go to (C:\\users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\sdk, generally). Then go to Extras -> Intel -> Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager and run the file named "intelhaxm-android.exe".In case you get an error like "Intel virtualization technology (vt,vt-x) is not enabled", go to your BIOS settings and enable Hardware Virtualization.Restart your studioFor AMD processors:You don\'t need Genymotion, just create a new Virtual Device and while selecting the system Image select the ABI as armeabi instead of the default x86 one. I faced the same problem recently.I installed the HAXM installer on your SDK Manager:And then installed the latest Intel HAXM driver:https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager-end-user-license-agreementAnd voila!!! The emulator works like a charm :)For AMD processors:Go to AVD manager and create a new virtual device as an ARM system image.So I am having this issue and it seems that unless you are on Linux you will not be able to use HAXM. [EDIT: this is if you have an AMD chip (non intel) of course as that is the issue]As stated on the Android Site;Many modern CPUs provide extensions for running virtual machines (VMs)\n  more efficiently. Taking advantage of these extensions with the\n  Android emulator requires some additional configuration of your\n  development system, but can significantly improve the execution speed.\n  Before attempting to use this type of acceleration, you should first\n  determine if your development system\xe2\x80\x99s CPU supports one of the\n  following virtualization extensions technologies:>     AMD Virtualization (AMD-V, SVM) extensions (only supported for Linux)As others have mentioned Genymotion may be a solution. For those who are using Android Studio based on Jetbrains:Goto Tools > Android > SDK ManagerUnder Extras --> select the checkbox Intel x86 Emulator AcceloratorFor those who are unable to use Nexus AVD can also try using Generic AVD.Then create a new Genreic AVD with something like QVGA and use for your app. This AVD does not use hardware acceleration.You need to read (and post) the output of as stated on http://developer.android.com/tools/devices/emulator.html#accel-vmYou open a command prompt window by right click on the start menu, choose execute and write \'cmd\'. See also Android Emulator Doesn't Use HAXM .If you cannot get the emulator to work you might want to try out an easier alternative: Genymotion - http://genymotion.com/I waste too much time on this, and none of the previous answers work. I find that Avast is the issue!!! If you have Avast installed in your system, you have to:Go to settings tab --> troubleshooting, then you should UNCHECK the\n  "enable hardware-assisted virtualization"Restart your PC and install the intelhaxm-android.exe if it is not installed. You can find it in C:\\Users\\{YOUR USERNAME}\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\sdk\\extras\\intel\\Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_ManagerI was facing this issue running the emulator inside Oracle VirtualBox. For me the solution was to modify the emulator to use an ARM CPU instead of x86.For Android Studio 1.0.2:First make sure Intel x86 emulator accelerator is installer. Check it in your SDK Manager. If not, then install it from there.Go to your Android SDK folder,\n**{SDK_FOLDER}\\extras\\intel\\Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager**There you will find silent_install.bat.Run it. It will create haxm_silent_run.log. After that, close and restart your Android Studio and then run your app.It will work. In case of a problem, check the haxm_silent_run.log file.I didn\'t see any mention about Windows 7, but if you have this OS, \nyou can download the HAXM here...While creating a Virtual Device select the ARM system Image. Others have suggested to install HAXM, but the truth is haxm wont work on amd platform or even if it does as android studio does not supports amd-vt on windows the end result will still be a very very slow emulator to run and operate. My recommendation would be to either use alternative emulator like Genymotion (works like a charm with Gapps installed) or switch to linux as then you will get the benefit of amd-vt and emulator will run a lot faster.In my case, HAXM was already installed in SDK Manager.  But every time I attempted to intelhaxm-android.exe, it would silently fail.Finally, I extracted the internal installers out of intelhaxm-android.exe in 7-zip.  Copied the three files to another directory and finally got a real installer to run.  Ran without a hitch and HAXM issues were gone.
