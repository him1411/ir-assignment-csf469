I am displaying text in a textview that appears to be too long to fit\ninto one screen. I need to make my TextView scrollable. How can I do\nthat?Here is the code:You don\'t need to use a ScrollView actually.Just set theproperties of your TextView in your layout\'s xml file. Then use:yourTextView.setMovementMethod(new ScrollingMovementMethod()); in your code.Bingo, it scrolls! This is how I did it purely in XML:NOTES:android:fillViewport="true" combined with android:layout_weight="1.0" will make the textview take up all available space.When defining the Scrollview, DO NOT specify android:layout_height="fill_parent" otherwise the scrollview doesn\'t work! (this has caused me to waste an hour just now! FFS).PRO TIP:To programmatically scroll to the bottom after appending text, use this:All that is really necessary is the setMovementMethod(). Here\'s an example using a LinearLayout.Make your textview just adding thisYou can eitherIt is not necessary to put inYou can do your work by simply adding:And, put this code in your Java class:The best way I found:Replace the TextView with an EditText with these extra attributes:There is no need for wrapping in a ScrollView.The "pro tip" above from Someone Somewhere (Making TextView scrollable on Android) works great, however, what if you\'re dynamically adding text to the ScrollView and would like to automatically scroll to the bottom after an append only when the user is at the bottom of the ScrollView? (Perhaps because if the user has scrolled up to read something you don\'t want to automatically reset to the bottom during an append, which would be annoying.)Anyway, here it is:The mTextStatus.getLineHeight() will make it so that you don\'t scrollToBottom() if the user is within one line from the end of the ScrollView.This is "How to apply ScrollBar to your TextView", using only XML.First, you need to take a Textview control in the main.xml file and write some text into it ... like this:Next, place the text view control in between the scrollview to display the scroll bar for this text:That\'s it...This will provide smooth scrolling text with a scroll bar.If you want text to be scrolled within the textview, then you can follow the following:First you should have to subclass textview.And then use that.Following is an example of a subclassed textview.Now, you have to use that in the XML in this way:That\'s it.Simple. This is how I did it:XML Side:Java side:To let the text view scroll down as the text fill it, you have to add:to the TextView xml file. It will scroll down automatically as more text comes in.Of course you need to add the text using the append function instead of set text:I used it for Log purpose, so that.I hope this helps ;)I didn\'t find TextView scrolling to support the \'fling\' gesture, where it continues scrolling after a flick up or down. I ended up implementing that myself because I didn\'t want to use a ScrollView for various reasons, and there didn\'t seem to be a MovementMethod that both allowed me to select text and click on links.When you are done with scrollable, add this line to the view\'s last line when you enter anything in the view:Add this to your XML layout:And in code you have to write the following lines:Add the following in the textview in XML.And finally, addin the Java file.If you don\'t want to use the EditText solution then you might have better luck with:The code below creates an automatic horizontal scrolling textview:While adding TextView to xml useSet the following properties of TextView in onCreate()Use it like thisIn my case.Constraint Layout.AS 2.3.Code implementation:XML:I struggled with this for over a week and finally figured out how to make this work!My issue was that everything would scroll as a \'block\'. The text itself was scrolling, but as a chunk rather than line by line. This obviously didn\'t work for me, because it would cut off lines at the bottom. All of the previous solutions did not work for me, so I crafted my own.Here is the easiest solution by far:Make a class file called: \'PerfectScrollableTextView\' inside a package, then copy and paste this code in:Finally change your \'TextView\' in XML:From: <TextViewTo: <com.your_app_goes_here.PerfectScrollableTextView
