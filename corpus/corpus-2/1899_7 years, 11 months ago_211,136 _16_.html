In Vim, I did too much undo. How do I undo this (that is, redo)?Ctrl+rAlso check out :undolist, which offers multiple paths through the undo history. This is useful if you accidentally type something after undoing too much.Strange nobody mentioned :earlier/:later. To redo everything you just need to do(assuming that you first edited the file at most 9999999 days ago), or, if you remember the difference between current undo state and needed one, use Nh, Nm or Ns for hours, minutes and seconds respectively. + :later N<CR> <=> Ng+ and :later Nf for file writes.Vim documentationIn command mode, use the u key to undo and Ctrl + R to redo. Have a look at http://www.vim.org/htmldoc/undo.html.Refer to the "undo" and "redo" part of vim document.:red[o] (Redo one change which was undone) and {count} Ctrl+r (Redo {count} changes which were undone) are both ok.Also the :earlier {count} (Go to older text state {count} times.) could always be a substitute for undo and redo.First Press Esc key to exit from edit mode.Then,For Undo use u key as many times you want to undo.For Redo use Ctrl +r key[ctrl]+rThe "r" is lower-case.
