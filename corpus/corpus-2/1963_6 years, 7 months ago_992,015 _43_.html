I am trying to send data from a form to a database. Here is the form I am using:The typical approach would be to submit the form, but this causes the browser to redirect. Using jQuery and Ajax, is it possible to capture all of the form\'s data and submit it to a PHP script (in example, form.php)?Basic usage of .ajax would look something like this:HTML:JQuery:Note: Since jQuery 1.8, .success(), .error() and .complete() are deprecated in favor of .done(), .fail() and .always().Note: Remember that the above snippet has to be done after DOM ready, so you should put it inside a $(document).ready() handler (or use the $() shorthand).Tip: You can chain the callback handlers like this: $.ajax().done().fail().always();PHP (that is, form.php):Note: Always sanitize posted data, to prevent injections and other malicious code.You could also use the shorthand .post in place of .ajax in the above JavaScript code:Note: The above JavaScript code is made to work with jQuery 1.8 and later, but it should work with previous versions down to jQuery 1.5.To make ajax request using jQuery you can do this by following code HTML:JavaScript:Method  1Method 2The .success(), .error(), and .complete() callbacks are deprecated as of jQuery 1.8. To prepare your code for their eventual removal, use .done(), .fail(), and .always() instead.MDN: abort() . If the request has been sent already, this method will abort the request.so we have successfully  send ajax request now its time to grab data to server.PHPAs we make a POST request in ajax call ( type: "post" ) we can now grab data using either $_REQUEST or $_POSTYou can also see what you get in POST request by simply either, Btw make sure that $_POST is set other wise you will get error.And you are inserting value to database make sure you are sensitizing or escaping All request ( weather you made GET or POST) properly before making query, Best would be using prepared statements.and if you want to return any data back to page, you can do it by just echoing that data like below.and than you can get it like There are Couple of Shorthand Methods you can use below code it do the same work.I would like to share a detailed way of how to post with PHP + Ajax along with errors thrown back on failure.First of all, create two files, for example form.php and process.php.We will first create a form which will be then submitted using the jQuery .ajax() method. The rest will be explained in the comments.form.phpValidate the form using jQuery client-side validation and pass the data to process.php.Now we will take a look at process.phpThe project files can be downloaded from http://projects.decodingweb.com/simple_ajax_form.zip.You can use serialize. Below is an example.HTML:JavaScript :I use this way.It submit everything like filesIf you want to send data using jquery Ajax then there is no need of form tag and submit buttonExample:I am using this simple one line code for years without problem. (It requires jquery)Here ap() means ajax page and af() means ajax form.\nIn a form just simply calling af() function will post form to the url and load response on desired html element.
