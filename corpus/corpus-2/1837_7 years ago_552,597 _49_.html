Some elements in my array are empty strings based on what the user has submitted. I need to remove those elements. I have this:But it doesn\'t work, $linksArray still has empty elements. I have also tried doing it with the empty() function but the outcome is the same.  As you\'re dealing with an array of strings, you can simply use array_filter(), which conveniently handles all this for you:Keep in mind that if no callback is supplied, all entries of array equal to FALSE (see converting to boolean) will be removed. So if you need to preserve elements that are i.e. exact string \'0\', you will need a custom callback:You can use array_filter to remove empty elements:If you have (int) 0 in your array, you may use the following:EDIT: Maybe your elements are not empty per se but contain one or more spaces... You can use the following before using array_filter"If no callback is supplied, all entries of input equal to FALSE will be removed." -- http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-filter.phpYou can just doarray_filter: "If no callback is supplied, all entries of input equal to FALSE will be removed." This means that elements with values NULL, 0, \'0\', \'\', FALSE, array() will be removed too.The other option is doingwhich will remove elements with values NULL, \'\' and FALSE.Hope this helps :)Here is an example.To sum up:The most popular answer on this topic is absolutely INCORRECT.Consider the following PHP script:Why is this?  Because a string containing a single \'0\' character also evaluates to boolean false, so even though it\'s not an empty string, it will still get filtered.  That would be a bug.Passing the built-in strlen function as the filtering function will work, because it returns a non-zero integer for a non-empty string, and a zero integer for an empty string.  Non-zero integers always evaluate to true when converted to boolean, while zero integers always evaluate to false when converted to boolean.So, the absolute, definitive, correct answer is:Another one liner to remove empty ("" empty string) elements from your array.Note: This code deliberately keeps null, 0 and false elements.Or maybe you want to trim your array elements first:Note: This code also removes null and false elements.I use the following script to remove empty elements from an arrayIf you are working with a numerical array and need to re-index the array after removing empty elements, use the array_values function:Also see: PHP reindex array?The most voted answer is wrong or at least not completely true as the OP is talking about blank strings only. Here\'s a thorough explanation:First of all, we must agree on what empty means. Do you mean to filter out:To filter out empty strings only:To only filter out strictly false values, you must use a callback function:The callback is also useful for any combination in which you want to filter out the "falsey" values, except some. (For example, filter every null and false, etc, leaving only 0):Third and fourth case are (for our purposes at last) equivalent, and for that all you have to use is the default:For multidimensional array I had to do this in order to keep an array value of (string) 0Just want to contribute an alternative to loops...also addressing gaps in keys...In my case I wanted to keep sequential array keys when the operation was complete (not just odd numbers, which is what I was staring at. Setting up code to look just for odd keys seemed fragile to me and not future-friendly.)I was looking for something more like this: http://gotofritz.net/blog/howto/removing-empty-array-elements-php/The combination of array_filter and array_slice does the trick.\n$example = array_filter($example);\n$example = array_slice($example,0);No idea on efficiencies or benchmarks but it works.use array_filter function to remove empty values:Just one line :\nUpdate (thanks to @suther):output1:52:6Remove empty array elements\xc2\xa1it works!try this ** \n**Example
