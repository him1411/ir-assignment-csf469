I want to set up Git to globally ignore certain files.I have added a .gitignore file to my user root directory (Users/me/) and I have added the following line to it:But it is not ignoring this type of files, any idea what I am doing wrong?You need to set up your global core.excludesfile configuration file to point to this global ignore file.e.g.*nix:Windows git bash:Windows cmd:For Windows it set to the location C:/users/{myusername}/.gitignore. \nThe above command will only set the location of the ignore file that git will use. The file has to still be manually created in that location and populated with the ignore list.(from muruge\'s comment)You can read about the command at https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/#create-a-global-gitignoreBefore reconfiguring the global excludes file, you might want to check what it\'s currently configured to, using this command:In my case, when I ran it I saw my global excludes file was configured to Although other answers are correct they are setting the global config value whereas there is a default git location for the global git ignore file:*nix:Windows:You may need to create git directory and ignore file but then you can put your global ignores into that file and that\'s it!SourceWhich file to place a pattern in depends on how the pattern is meant to be used.\xe2\x80\xa6To create global gitignore from scratch: From here.If you create a file in your repo named .gitignore git will use its rules when looking at files to commit. Note that git will not ignore a file that was already tracked before a rule was added to this file to ignore it. In such a case the file must be un-tracked, usually with :Is it your case ?You should create an exclude file for this. Check out this gist which is pretty self explanatory.To address your question though, you may need to either de-index the .tmproj file (if you\'ve already added it to the index) with git rm --cached path/to/.tmproj, or git add and commit your .gitignore file.I am able to ignore a .tmproj file by including either .tmproj or *.tmproj in my /users/me/.gitignore-global file.  Note that the file name is .gitignore-global not .gitignore.  It did not work by including .tmproj or *.tmproj in a file called .gitignore in the /users/me directory. Remember that running the command will just set up the global file, but will NOT create it.\nFor Windows check your Users directory for the .gitconfig file, and edit it to your preferences. In my case It\'s like that:
