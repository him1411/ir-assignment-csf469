I want to create a div that can change its width/height as the window\'s width changes.Are there any CSS3 rules that would allow the height to change according to the width, while maintaining its aspect ratio?I know I can do this via JavaScript, but I would prefer using only CSS.Just create a wrapper <div> with a percentage value for padding-bottom, like this:It will result in a <div> with height equal to 75% of the width of its container (a 4:3 aspect ratio).This relies on the fact that for padding :The percentage is calculated with respect to the width of the generated box\'s containing block [...]  (source: w3.org, emphasis mine)Padding-bottom values for other aspect ratios and 100% width :Placing content in the div :In order to keep the aspect ratio of the div and prevent it\'s content from stretching it, you need to add an absolutely positioned child and stretch it to the edges of the wrapper with:Here\'s a demo and another more in depth demoYou can use vw units for both the width and height of the element. This allows the element\'s aspect ratio to be preserved, based on the viewport width.vw : 1/100th of the width of the viewport.  [MDN]Alternatively, you can also use vh for viewport height, or even vmin/vmax to use the lesser/greater of the viewport dimensions (discussion here).For other aspect ratios, you can use the following table to calculate the value for height according to the width of the element :Here is a Fiddle with this demo and here is a solution to make a responsive grid of squares with verticaly and horizontaly centered content.Browser support for vh/vw units is IE9+ see canIuse for more infoI\'ve found a way to do this using CSS, but you have to be careful as it may change depending on the flow of your own web site.  I\'ve done it in order to embed video with a constant aspect ratio within a fluid width portion of my web site.Say you have an embedded video like this:You could then place this all inside a div with a "video" class.  This video class will probably be the fluid element in your website such that, by itself, it has no direct height constraints, but when you resize the browser it will change in width according to the flow of the web site.  This would be the element you are probably trying to get your embedded video in while maintaining a certain aspect ratio of the video.In order to do this, I put an image before the embedded object within the "video" class div.  !!! The important part is that the image has the correct aspect ratio you wish to maintain.  Also, make sure the size of the image is AT LEAST as big as the smallest you expect the video (or whatever you are maintaining the A.R. of) to get based on your layout.  This will avoid any potential issues in the resolution of the image when it is percentage-resized.  For example, if you wanted to maintain an aspect ratio of 3:2, don\'t just use a 3px by 2px image.  It may work under some circumstances, but I haven\'t tested it, and it would probably be a good idea to avoid.  You should probably already have a minimum width like this defined for fluid elements of your web site.  If not, it is a good idea to do so in order to avoid chopping elements off or having overlap when the browser window gets too small.  It is better to have a scroll bar at some point.  The smallest in width a web page should get is somewhere around ~600px (including any fixed width columns) because screen resolutions don\'t come smaller unless you are dealing with phone-friendly sites. !!!I use a completely transparent png but I don\'t really think it ends up mattering if you do it right. Like this:Now you should be able to add CSS similar to the following:Make sure you also remove any explicit height or width declaration within the object and embed tags that usually come with copy/pasted embed code.The way it works depends on the position properties of the video class element and the item you want have maintain a certain aspect ratio.  It takes advantage of the way an image will maintain its proper aspect ratio when resized in an element.  It tells whatever else is in video class element to take full-advantage of the real estate provided by the dynamic image by forcing its width/height to 100% of the video class element being adjusted by the image. Pretty cool, eh?You might have to play around with it a bit to get it to work with your own design, but this actually works surprisingly well for me.  The general concept is there.To add to Web_Designer\'s answer, the <div> will have a height (entirely made up of bottom padding) of 75% of the width of it\'s containing element. Here\'s a good summary: http://mattsnider.com/css-using-percent-for-margin-and-padding/. I\'m not sure why this should be so, but that\'s how it is.If you want your div to be a width other than 100%, you need another wrapping div on which to set the width:I used something similar to Elliot\'s image trick recently to allow me to use CSS media queries to serve a different logo file depending on device resolution, but still scale proportionally as an <img> would naturally do (I set the logo as background image to a transparent .png with the correct aspect ratio). But Web_Designer\'s solution would save me an http request.Elliot inspired me to this solution - thanks:aspectratio.png is a completely transparent PNG-file with the size of your preferred aspect-ratio, in my case 30x10 pixels.Please note: background-size is a css3-feature which might not work with your target-browsers. You may check interoperability (f.e. on caniuse.com).Basing on your solutions I\'ve made some trick:When you use it, your HTML will be onlyTo use it this way make:\nCSS:and js (jQuery)And having this you just set attr data-keep-ratio to height/width and that\'s it.As stated in here on w3schools.com and somewhat reiterated in this accepted answer, padding values as percentages (emphasis mine):Specifies the padding in percent of the width of the containing elementErgo, a correct example of a responsive DIV that keeps a 16:9 aspect ratio is as follows:CSSHTMLDemo on JSFiddleYou can use an svg. Make the container/wrapper position relative, put the svg first as staticly positioned and then put absolutely positioned content (top: 0; left:0; right:0; bottom:0;)Example with 16:9 proportions:image.svg: (can be inlined in src)CSS:HTML:Note that inline svg doesn\'t seem to work, but you can urlencode the svg and embed it in img src attribute like this:SCSS is the best solution in my case; using a data attribute :For example :sourcehtml looks like this : lets say you need to keep the ratio of the "element" css looks like this padding when specified in % it is calculated based on width not height.\n..\nso basically you it doesn\'t matter what your width it height will always be calculated based of that . which will keep the ratio . While most answers are very cool, most of them require to have an image already sized correctly... Other solutions only work for a width and do not care of the height available, but sometimes you want to fit the content in a certain height too.I\'ve tried to couple them together to bring a fully portable and re-sizable solution... The trick is to use to auto scaling of an image but use an inline svg element instead of using a pre-rendered image or any form of second HTTP request...Notice that I have used big values in the width and height attributes of the SVG, as it needs to be bigger than the maximum expected size as it can only shrink. The example makes the div\'s ratio 10:5If you want to fit a square inside the viewport on either portrait or landscape view (as big as possible, but nothing sticking outside), switch between using vw/vh on orientation portrait/landscape:Just an idea or a hack.I have run into this issue quite some times, so I made a JS solution for it. This basically adjust the height of the domElement according the width of the element by the ratio you specify. You could use it as followed:<div ratio="4x3"></div>Please be aware that since it is setting the height of the element, the element should be either a display:block or display:inline-block.https://github.com/JeffreyArts/html-ratio-componentIf the entire container structure was percentage based, this would be the default behavior, can you provide a more specific example?Below is an example of what I mean, if your entire parent hierarchy was % based, any browser window adjustment would work without any additional js/css, is this not a possibility with your layout?I used a new solution. To main aspect ratioHowever, this is relative to the entire viewport. So, if you need a div that is 30% of the viewport width, you can use 30vw instead, and since you know the width, you reuse them in height using calc and vw unit.
