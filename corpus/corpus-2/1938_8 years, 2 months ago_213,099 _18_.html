I need to test whether the object is of type NSString or UIImageView. How can I accomplish this? Is there some type of "isoftype" method?If your object is myObject, and you want to test to see if it is an NSString, the code would be:Likewise, if you wanted to test myObject for a UIImageView:You would probably use This is a method of NSObject.For more info check the NSObject documentation.This is how you use this.You might also try doing somthing like thisWhen you want to differ between a superClass and the inheritedClass you can use:Using - (BOOL)isKindOfClass:(Class)aClass in this case would result in TRUE both times because the inheritedClass is also a kind of the superClass.Running a simple test, I thought I\'d document what works and what doesn\'t.  Often I see people checking to see if the object\'s class is a member of the other class or is equal to the other class.For the line below, we have some poorly formed data that can be an NSArray, an NSDictionary or (null).  These are the tests that were performed:isKindOfClass worked rather well while isMemberOfClass didn\'t.You can make use of the following code incase you want to check the types of primitive data types.Simple, [yourobject  class] it will return the class name of yourobject.With Swift 2.0, you can use just is operator;For example you are searching kind of UITextView and learn which index in your views subviews like that;
