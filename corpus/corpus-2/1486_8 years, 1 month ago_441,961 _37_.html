I am trying implement the Data transformation using Reflection1 example in my code.The GetSourceValue function has a switch comparing various types, but I want to remove these types and properties and have GetSourceValue get the value of the property using only a single string as the parameter. I want to pass a class and property in the string and resolve the value of the property.Is this possible?1 Web Archive version of original blog postOf course, you will want to add validation and whatnot, but that is the gist of it.How about something like this:This will allow you to descend into properties using a single string, like this:You can either use these methods as static methods or extensions.What about using the CallByName of the Microsoft.VisualBasic namespace (Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll)? It uses reflection to get properties, fields, and methods of normal objects, COM objects, and even dynamic objects.and thenAdd to any Class:Then, you can use as:Great answer by jheddings. I would like to improve it allowing referencing of aggregated arrays or collections of objects, so that propertyName could be property1.property2[X].property3:If I use the code from Ed S. I get\'ReflectionExtensions.GetProperty(Type, string)\' is inaccessible due to its protection levelIt seems that GetProperty() is not available in Xamarin.Forms. TargetFrameworkProfile is Profile7 in my Portable Class Library (.NET Framework 4.5, Windows 8, ASP.NET Core 1.0, Xamarin.Android, Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.iOS Classic).Now I found a working solution:SourceUsing PropertyInfo of the System.Reflection namespace. Reflection compiles just fine no matter what property we try to access. The error will come up during run-time. It works fine to get the Location property of an objectWe\'ll get the Location : {X=71,Y=27}\nWe can also return location.X or location.Y on the same way.This is a way to get all properties with their values in a List.Here is another way to find a nested property that doesn\'t require the string to tell you the nesting path. Credit to Ed S. for the single property method.About the nested properties discussion, you can avoid all the reflection stuff if you use the DataBinder.Eval Method (Object, String) as below:Of course, you\'ll need to add a reference to the System.Web assembly, but this probably isn\'t a big deal.You never mention what object you are inspecting, and since you are rejecting ones that reference a given object, I will assume you mean a static one.Note that I marked the object that is being inspected with the local variable obj. null means static, otherwise set it to what you want. Also note that the GetEntryAssembly() is one of a few available methods to get the "running" assembly, you may want to play around with it if you are having a hard time loading the type.The following code is a Recursive method for displaying the entire hierarchy  of all of the Property Names and Values contained in an object\'s instance.  This method uses a simplified version of AlexD\'s GetPropertyValue() answer above in this thread.  Thanks to this discussion thread, I was able to figure out how to do this!For example, I use this method to show an explosion or dump of all of the properties in a WebService response by calling the method as follows: PropertyValues_byRecursion("Response", response, false);shorter way ....jheddings and AlexD both wrote excellent answers on how to resolve property strings. I\'d like to throw mine in the mix, since I wrote a dedicated library exactly for that purpose.Pather.CSharp\'s main class is Resolver. Per default it can resolve properties, array and dictionary entries.So, for example, if you have an object like thisand want to get Property2, you can do it like this:This is the most basic example of the paths it can resolve. If you want to see what else it can, or how you can extend it, just head to its Github page.The method to call has changed in .NET Standard (as of 1.6). Also we can use C# 6\'s null conditional operator.
