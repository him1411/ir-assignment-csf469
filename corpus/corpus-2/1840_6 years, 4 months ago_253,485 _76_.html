They seem to be doing the same thing... Is one modern and one old? Or are they supported by different browsers?When I handle events myself (without framework) I just always check for both and execute both if present. (I also return false, but I have the feeling that doesn\'t work with events attached with node.addEventListener).So why both? Should I keep checking for both? Or is there actually a difference?(I know, a lot of questions, but they\'re all sort of the same =))stopPropagation stops the event from bubbling up the event chain.preventDefault prevents the default action the browser makes on that event.Let\'s say you haveExampleWith stopPropagation only the buttons click handler is called and the divs click handler never fires.Where as if you just preventDefault only the browsers default action is stopped but the div\'s click handler still fires.Below are some docs on the DOM event objects from MDN and MSDNMSDN:MDN:For IE9 and FF you can just use preventDefault & stopPropagation.To support IE8 and lower replace stopPropagation with cancelBubble and replace preventDefault with returnValueFrom quirksmode.orgWhen you use event capturingthe event handler of element1 fires first, the event handler of element2 fires last.the event handler of element2 fires first, the event handler of element1 fires last.Any event taking place in the W3C event model is first captured until it reaches the target element and then bubbles up again.From https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/events.htmlIf the capturing EventListener wishes to prevent further processing of\n  the event from occurring it may call the stopPropagation method of the\n  Event interface. This will prevent further dispatch of the event,\n  although additional EventListeners registered at the same hierarchy\n  level will still receive the event. Once an event\'s stopPropagation\n  method has been called, further calls to that method have no\n  additional effect. If no additional capturers exist and\n  stopPropagation has not been called, the event triggers the\n  appropriate EventListeners on the target itself.And for bubbling:Any event handler may choose to prevent further event propagation by\n  calling the stopPropagation method of the Event interface. If any\n  EventListener calls this method, all additional EventListeners on the\n  current EventTarget will be triggered but bubbling will cease at that\n  level. Only one call to stopPropagation is required to prevent further\n  bubbling.Examples:HTMLJavaScriptDemo, In this example four event listener are executed, and a new tab is opened in the brower. The output is:Changing the first function to:Will result in this output:which means downward propagation of the event is stopped and also its upward propagation. Demo. But it won\'t prevent the tab from opening.Adding stopPropagation() to Demo, orDemo, Will result in the same output because they are on the current EventTarget:In these two cases, the event prevented from bubbling up to the parent. Also these two won\'t prevent the tab from opening.\nTo prevent the tab from opening we need to use preventDefault() to prevent the default browser action:Now the tab won\'t open and only one of the event listener will be executed. Demo.return false;return false; does 3 separate things when you call it:Note that this behaviour differs from normal (non-jQuery) event handlers, in which, notably, return false does not stop the event from bubbling up.preventDefault();preventDefault(); does one thing: It stops the browsers default behaviour.When to use them?We know what they do but when to use them? Simply it depends on what you want to accomplish. Use preventDefault(); if you want to \xe2\x80\x9cjust\xe2\x80\x9d prevent the default browser behaviour. Use return false; when you want to prevent the default browser behaviour and prevent the event from propagating the DOM. In most situations where you would use return false; what you really want is preventDefault().Examples:Let\xe2\x80\x99s try to understand with examples:We will see pure JAVASCRIPT exampleExample 1:Run the above code you will see the hyperlink \xe2\x80\x98Click here to visit\n  stackoverflow.com\xe2\x80\x98 now if you click on that link first you will get\n  the javascript alert Link Clicked Next you will get the javascript\n  alert div Clicked and immediately you will be redirected to\n  stackoverflow.com.Example 2:Run the above code you will see the hyperlink \xe2\x80\x98Click here to visit\n  stackoverflow.com\xe2\x80\x98 now if you click on that link first you will get\n  the javascript alert Link Clicked Next you will get the javascript\n  alert div Clicked Next you will see the hyperlink \xe2\x80\x98Click here to\n  visit stackoverflow.com\xe2\x80\x98 replaced by the text \xe2\x80\x98Click event prevented\xe2\x80\x98\n  and you will not be redirected to stackoverflow.com. This is due > to event.preventDefault() method we used to prevent the default click\n  action to be triggered.Example 3:This time if you click on Link the function executeParent() will not\n  be called and you will not get the javascript alert div Clicked\n  this time. This is due to us having prevented the propagation to the\n  parent div using event.stopPropagation() method. Next you will see the\n  hyperlink \xe2\x80\x98Click here to visit stackoverflow.com\xe2\x80\x98 replaced by the text\n  \xe2\x80\x98Click event is going to be executed\xe2\x80\x98 and immediately you will be\n  redirected to stackoverflow.com. This is because we haven\xe2\x80\x99t prevented\n  the default click action from triggering this time using\n  event.preventDefault() method.Example 4:If you click on the Link, the function executeParent() will not be\n  called and you will not get the javascript alert. This is due to us\n  having prevented the propagation to the parent div using\n  event.stopPropagation() method. Next you will see the hyperlink \xe2\x80\x98Click\n  here to visit stackoverflow.com\xe2\x80\x98 replaced by the text \xe2\x80\x98Click event\n  prevented\xe2\x80\x98 and you will not be redirected to stackoverflow.com. This\n  is because we have prevented the default click action from triggering\n  this time using event.preventDefault() method.Example 5:For return false I have three examples and all appear to be doing the exact same thing (just returning false), but in reality the\n  results are quite different. Here\'s what actually happens in each of\n  the above.cases:Will see all three example.Hope these examples are clear. Try executing all these examples in a html file to see how they work.This is the quote from hereEvent.preventDefaultThe preventDefault method prevents an event from carrying out its default functionality.  For example, you would use preventDefault on an A element to stop clicking that element from leaving the current page:While the element\'s default functionality is bricked, the event continues to bubble up the DOM.Event.stopPropagationThe second method, stopPropagation, allows the event\'s default functionality to happen but prevents the event from propagating:stopPropagation effectively stops parent elements from knowing about a given event on its child.  While a simple stop  method allows us to quickly handle events, it\'s\n  important to think about what exactly you want to happen with\n  bubbling.  I\'d bet that all a developer really wants is preventDefault\n  90% of the time!  Incorrectly "stopping" an event could cause you\n  numerous troubles down the line; your plugins may not work and your\n  third party plugins could be bricked.  Or worse yet -- your code\n  breaks other functionality on a site.
