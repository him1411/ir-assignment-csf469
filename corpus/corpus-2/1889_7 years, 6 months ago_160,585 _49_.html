Pretty straightforward question: In PHP, when do you use and when do you useWhat are the main differences between those two?As of PHP 5.3 there are two ways to define constants: Either using the const keyword or using the define() function:The fundamental difference between those two ways is that const defines constants at compile time, whereas define defines them at run time. This causes most of const\'s disadvantages. Some disadvantages of const are:const cannot be used to conditionally define constants. To define a global constant, it has to be used in the outermost scope:Why would you want to do that anyways? One common application is to check whether the constant is already defined:const accepts a static scalar (number, string or other constant like true, false, null, __FILE__), whereas define() takes any expression. Since PHP 5.6 constant expressions are allowed in const as well:const takes a plain constant name, whereas define() accepts any expression as name. This allows to do things like this:consts are always case sensitive, whereas define() allows you to define case insensitive constants by passing true as the third argument:So, that was the bad side of things. Now let\'s look at the reason why I personally always use const unless one of the above situations occurs:const defines a constant in the current namespace, while define() has to be passed the full namespace name:Since PHP 5.6 const constants can also be arrays, while define() does not support arrays yet. However arrays will be supported for both cases in PHP 7.As consts are language constructs and defined at compile time they are a bit faster than define()s.It is well known that PHP define()s are slow when using a large number of constants. People have even invented things like apc_load_constants() and hidef to get around this.consts make the definition of constants approximately twice as fast (on development machines with XDebug turned on even more). Lookup time on the other hand does not change (as both constant types share the same lookup table): Demo.Finally, note that const can also be used within a class or interface to define a class constant or interface constant. define cannot be used for this purpose:SummaryUnless you need any type of conditional or expressional definition, use consts instead of define()s - simply for the sake of readability!Until PHP 5.3, const could not be used in the global scope. You could only use this from within a class. This should be used when you want to set some kind of constant option or setting that pertains to that class. Or maybe you want to create some kind of enum.define can be used for the same purpose, but it can only be used in the global scope. It should only be used for global settings that affect the entire application.An example of good const usage is to get rid of magic numbers. Take a look at PDO\'s constants. When you need to specify a fetch type, you would type PDO::FETCH_ASSOC, for example. If consts were not used, you\'d end up typing something like 35 (or whatever FETCH_ASSOC is defined as). This makes no sense to the reader.An example of good define usage is maybe specifying your application\'s root path or a library\'s version number. I know this is already answered, but none of the current answers make any mention of namespacing and how it affects constants and defines. As of PHP 5.3, consts and defines are similar in most respects.  There are still, however, some important differences: The code below should illustrate the differences. The content of the user sub-array will be [\'foo\\\\BAR\' => 1, \'BAZ\' => 2, \'foo\\\\BAZ\' => 3].=== UPDATE ===The upcoming PHP 5.6 will allow a bit more flexibility with const.  You will now be able to define consts in terms of expressions, provided that those expressions are made up of other consts or of literals.  This means the following should be valid as of 5.6:You still won\'t be able to define consts in terms of variables or function returns though, so will still be out. I believe that as of PHP 5.3, you can use const outside of classes, as shown here in the second example: http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.constants.syntax.phpdefine i use for global constants.const i use for class constants.You cannot define into class scope, and with const you can.\nNeedless to say, you cannot use const outside class scopeAlso, with const, it actually becomes a member of the class, with define, it will be pushed to global scope.NikiC\'s answer is the best, but let me add a non-obvious caveat when using namespaces so you don\'t get caught with unexpected behavior. The thing to remember is that defines are always in the global namespace unless you explicitly add the namespace as part of the define identifier. What isn\'t obvious about that is that the namespaced identifier trumps the global identifier. So :produces:Which to me makes the whole const notion needlessly confusing since the idea of a const in dozens of other languages is that it is always the same wherever you are in your code, and PHP doesn\'t really guarantee that.Most of these answers are wrong or are only telling half the story.For example:Bad example:To create variable constants use define() like so:Yes, const are defined at compile-time and as nikic states cannot be assigned an expression, as define()\'s can. But also const\'s cannot be conditionally declared (for the same reason). ie. You cannot do this:Whereas you could with a define(). So, it doesn\'t really come down to personal preference, there is a correct and a wrong way to use both.As an aside... I would like to see some kind of class const that can be assigned an expression, a sort of define() that can be isolated to classes?To add on NikiC\'s answer. const can be used within classes in the following manner:You can not do this with define().
