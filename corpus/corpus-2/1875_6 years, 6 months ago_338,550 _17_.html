I\'m trying to use a wildcard to get the id of all the elements whose id begin with "jander". I tried $(\'#jander*\'), $(\'#jander%\') but it doesn\'t work..I know I can use classes of the elements to solve it, but it is also possible using wildcards??To get all the elements starting with "jander" you should use:To get those that end with "jander"See also the JQuery documentationSince the title suggests wildcard you could also use this:This will select the given string anywhere in the id.Try the jQuery starts-with selector, \'^=\', egI have to ask though, why don\'t you want to do this using classes?for classes you can use: To get the id from the wildcard match:When you have a more complex id string the double quotes are mandatory.For example if you have an id like this: id="2.2", the correct way to access it is: $(\'input[id="2.2"]\')As much as possible use the double quotes, for safety reasons.
