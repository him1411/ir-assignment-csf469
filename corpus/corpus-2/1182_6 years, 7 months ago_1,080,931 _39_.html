Is it possible that I can query for names of all tables which contain column with nameSearch Tables:Search Tables & Views:We can also use the following syntax:-If you\xe2\x80\x99re more into third party tools there a lot of options there such as:These come in very handy if your database contains encrypted objects (views, procedures, functions) because you can\xe2\x80\x99t easily search for these using system tables. This here will give you a little extra information about the schema, tables and columns that you may or may not choose to use extra conditions in your where clause to filter on. For example, if you only wanted to see the fields which must have values addYou could add other conditionals, I also added the columns in the select clause in this vertical manner so it was easy to reorder, remove, rename, or add others based on your needs. Alternately you could search for just tables by using T.Name. Its very customisable.Enjoy.This should work:I don\'t know why so many of you suggesting Joining with sys.table with sys.columns\nyou can simply use below code:Select object_name(object_id) as TableName,* from  SYS.columns where name LIKE \'%MyName%\'or If you want schema name as well:If you simply want the table name you can run:If you want the Schema Name as well (which in a lot of cases you will, as you\'ll have a lot of different schemas, and unless you can remember every table in the database and where it belongs this can be useful) run:and finally if you want it in a nicer format (although this is where the code (In my opinion) is getting too complicated for easy writing):note you can also create a function based on what I have:It is worth noting that the concat feature was added in 2012. For 2008r2 and earlier use + to concatenate strings.I\'ve re-formatted the proc a bit since I posted this. It\'s a bit more advanced now but looks a lot messier (but it\'s in a proc so you\'ll never see it) and it\'s formatted better.This version allows you to have it in an administrative database and then search through any database. Change the decleration of @db from \'master\' to whichever you want the default database to be (NOTE: using the CONCAT() function will only work with 2012+ unless you change the string concatenation to use the + operators).It is from Pinal Sir BlogYou can find it from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS by column_name filter Following query will give you the exact table names of the database having field name like \'%myName\'.To get full information: column name, table name as well as schema of the table..i have just tried it and this works perfectlyOnly change YourDatbaseName to your database and YourcolumnName to your column name that you are looking for the rest keep it as it is.Hope this has helpedI used this for the same purpose and it worked:Hopefully this isn\'t a duplicate answer, but what I like to do is generate a sql statement within a sql statement that will allow me to search for the values I am looking for (not just the tables with those field names ( as it\'s usually necessary for me to then delete any info related to the id of the column name I am looking for):Then I can copy and paste run my 1st column "SQLToRun"... then I replace the "Select * from \' with \'Delete from \' and it allows me to delete any references to that given ID! Write these results to file so you have them just in case.NOTE**** Make sure you eliminate any bakup tables prior to running your your delete statement... Like oracle you can find tables and columns with this:You can try this query:It worksYou can use [INFORMATION_SCHEMA].[COLUMNS] table to find columns\nSuch asFor getting Table and Column information for given SQL statement visit\nhttp://www.w3hattrick.com/2016/05/getting-table-and-column-information.htmlJust to improve on the answers above i have included Views as well and Concatenated the Schema and Table/View together making the Results more apparent.For Oracle, with normal user permissions:
