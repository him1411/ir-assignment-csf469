I need Notepad++ to take a json string from thisto this...I looked around at all the TextFX options but couldn\'t find anything that worked.18 Sep 2013 Update: Mike\'s right, it\'s now called JSToolNppJSMin\'s JSformat option turned the JSON into this in Notepad++ 6.1.2:\nTip: Select the code you want to reformat, then Plugins | JSTool | JSFormat.Universal Indent GUI plugin for Notepad++ will turn your sample into:I personally use JSON Viewer since the Notepad++ plugin doesn\'t work any more.EDIT - 24th May 2012I advise that you download the JSMin plugin for Notepad as mentioned in the answer. This works well for me in the latest version (v6.1.2 at time of writing).JSMinNpp plugin will do this job.\nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/jsminnpp/It\'s not an NPP solution, but in a pinch, you can use this online JSON Formatter and then just paste the formatted text into NPP and then select Javascript as the language.The following Notepad++ plugin worked for me as suggested by "SUN"\nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/jsminnpp/It worked for me in the latest edition to Notepad using the UniversalIndentGui.What I did was under the plugin setting choose Enable Text Auto Update, a window popped up and I selected javascript.Notepad 5.8.7 and jsmin 1.7.0.0 works wonderful here.Be careful though, found out jsmin eats the comments the hard way (should have read first).I\'m using the JSON Viewer plug-in with NPP 5.9 and it seems to work well.I know this thread is old but I recently ran into a problem with JSToolNPP not being compatible with my newly updated N++, I did find a replacement that seems to work.  http://sourceforge.net/projects/nppjsonviewer/Use at your own risk, ofc.  (standard disclaimer from me when linking anything outside the SExchange, fyi)You can use http://www.jsonlint.com/I know you asked about NotePad++ but TextMate for OS X can do it via the JSON bundle, its called the "Reformat Document" command.Your best bet is to use one of the latest versions of Eclipse (I am using Eclipse Galileo J2EE and Eclipse Ganymede J2EE). Create a JavaScript file, then create a variable:Lastly, hit CTRL+SHIFT+F and voila! You have a nicely indented JSON Object. I, too, am looking for a Notepad++ JSON formatter, and I very well may be forced to develop an Npp plugin some short time in the future.
