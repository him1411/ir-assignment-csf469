I\'ve seen weirdly formatted text called Zalgo like below written on various forums. It\'s kind of annoying to look at, but it really bothers me because it undermines my notion of what a character is supposed to be. My understanding is that a character is supposed to move horizontally across a line and stay within a certain "container". Obviously the Zalgo text is moving vertically and doesn\'t seem to be restricted to any space. Is this a bug/flaw/exploit/hack in Unicode? Are these individual characters with weird properties?  "What" is happening here?H\xcd\xad\xcd\x83\xcc\x93\xcc\x87\xcd\x97\xcc\x8e\xcc\xa1\xcd\x80\xcc\xab\xcc\xa4\xcc\xa4\xcc\xa3\xcd\x89\xcc\xa4o\xcd\x92\xcc\x84\xcc\x80\xcc\x88\xcd\xa4\xcc\x80\xcc\x9b\xcd\xa1\xcc\xaf\xcc\x97\xcc\xb1\xcc\x98\xcc\xaew\xcd\x8b\xcd\xac\xcc\x8a\xcd\xa6\xcc\x9a\xcc\x82\xcd\x80\xcd\x93\xcc\xb2\xcd\x99\xcd\x96\xcc\xa5\xcd\x89\xcc\xb9 \xcc\x8c\xcd\xaf\xcd\x8e\xcd\x85\xcd\x85\xcd\x89\xcd\x96d\xcc\xbf\xcc\x83\xcc\x94\xcc\x8f\xcd\xa3\xcd\x82\xcc\x89\xcc\x95\xcc\xb3\xcc\x98o\xcc\x86\xcd\x8b\xcd\xa4\xcc\x8a\xcd\x97\xcd\x83\xcd\x9f\xcd\x9c\xcc\x96\xcc\x99e\xcd\x8c\xcd\xad\xcc\x8d\xcc\x90\xcc\x83\xcd\x92\xcd\x88\xcd\x95\xcc\xaf\xcc\xae\xcc\x99\xcc\xa3\xcd\x93s\xcc\xbf\xcc\x8a\xcc\x87\xcd\x9e\xcd\x99\xcd\x94\xcc\xba\xcd\x87\xcc\x97\xcc\xb1 \xcd\xa9\xcd\xa9\xcd\x91\xcc\x8b\xcc\x80\xcd\xae\xcd\xa5\xcd\xa6\xcc\x8a\xcc\xb8\xcc\xa4\xcd\x93\xcc\x9e\xcc\xb1\xcc\xabZ\xcc\x86\xcc\x8a\xcd\x8a\xd2\x89\xd2\x89\xcc\xa0\xcc\xb1\xcc\xa6\xcc\xa9\xcd\x95a\xcc\x8b\xcc\x85\xcd\xaf\xcc\xa8\xcc\x9f\xcc\xb9\xcd\x88\xcc\xba\xcc\xb9l\xcc\x81\xcd\x8b\xcd\x98\xcc\xa1\xcc\x98\xcc\xb9\xcc\xbb\xcc\xa9\xcc\xa9g\xcd\x97\xcd\xac\xcd\x92\xcc\xaa\xcd\x9ao\xcc\x94\xcd\x8b\xcd\x8a\xcc\x93\xcc\xa2\xcc\x96\xcd\x87\xcc\xac\xcd\x8d\xcd\x87\xcd\x93 \xcd\x82\xcd\xa3\xcc\x8f\xcc\xbf\xcd\x90\xcd\x82\xcd\xaf\xcc\xa2\xcd\xa0\xcd\x88\xcd\x99t\xcd\xa4\xcc\x88\xcd\xa3\xcc\x9b\xcd\x9d\xcd\x93\xcc\x96\xcc\xbb\xcc\xb2e\xcd\x8b\xcc\x84\xcd\xac\xcc\xbd\xcd\x9c\xd2\x89\xcd\x9a\xcc\xad\xcd\x87\xcd\x85x\xcc\x8c\xcd\xa4\xcc\x93\xcc\x82\xcd\x83\xcd\x90\xcd\x90\xcc\x81\xcd\x8b\xcd\xa1\xcd\x8e\xcc\xac\xcc\xa0\xcd\x87t\xcc\x84\xcc\x8c\xcc\x80\xcd\xa7\xcd\xa9\xcc\x95\xcd\xa2\xcc\xa6\xcc\x97\xcc\xb9\xcc\x9d \xcc\xbe\xcc\xae\xcc\x97\xcc\xa9\xcc\xb3\xcc\xb1w\xcc\x84\xcd\x97\xcd\xad\xcc\x83\xcd\x97\xcd\xae\xcc\x90\xcd\x8e\xcc\xad\xcc\xa4\xcd\x8d\xcd\x87\xcc\xb0o\xcc\xbe\xcd\xa3\xcd\xac\xcc\xbd\xcc\x94\xcc\x8d\xcd\x9f\xcc\xa2\xcc\xaf\xcc\xbb\xcc\xb0\xcd\x85\xcc\xbc\xcd\x95r\xcc\x80\xcc\xa2\xcd\x85\xcc\xaa\xcd\x99\xcd\x8d\xcc\xa0k\xcc\x8c\xcd\xaa\xcc\x81\xcc\xb5\xcc\xb6\xcc\x97\xcc\xae\xcc\xae?\xcd\xa4\xcc\x8c\xcd\x97\xcd\xa9\xcc\x95\xcd\xa1\xcc\x99\xcd\x89\xcc\xa5\xcc\xac\xcd\x99\xcc\x9f\xcc\xae\xcd\x95\n  \n  \n  The text uses combining characters, also known as combining marks. See section 2.11 of Combining Characters in the Unicode Standard (PDF).In Unicode, character rendering does not use a simple character cell model where each glyph fits into a box with given height. Combining marks may be rendered above, below, or inside a base characterSo you can easily construct a character sequence, consisting of a base character and \xe2\x80\x9ccombining above\xe2\x80\x9d marks, of any length, to reach any desired visual height, assuming that the rendering software conforms to the Unicode rendering model. Such a sequence has no meaning of course, and even a monkey could produce it (e.g., given a keyboard with suitable driver).And you can mix \xe2\x80\x9ccombining above\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccombining below\xe2\x80\x9d marks.The sample text in the question starts with:Zalgo text works because of combining characters. These are special characters that allow to modify character that comes before.OR y + ̆ = y̆ which actually isSince you can stack them one atop the other you can produce the following:\ny̆̆̆̆̆̆̆̆̆̆̆̆̆̆̆̆̆̆which actually is:The same goes for putting stuff underneath:\ny̰̰̰̰̰̰̰̰̰̰̰̰̰̰̰̆̆̆̆̆̆̆̆̆̆̆̆̆̆̆̆̆̆\nthat in fact is:       In Unicode, the main block of combining diacritics for European languages and the International Phonetic Alphabet is U+0300\xe2\x80\x93U+036F.
