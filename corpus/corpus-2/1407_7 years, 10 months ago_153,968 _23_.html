Is it somehow possible to automatically have a link to GitHub issue number in the git commit message?Just include #xxx in your commit message to reference an issue without closing it.With new GitHub issues 2.0 you can use these synonyms to reference an issue and close it (in your commit message):You can also substitute #xxx with gh-xxx.Referencing and closing issues across repos also works:Check out the documentation available in their Help section.If you want to link to a GitHub issue and close the issue, you can provide the following lines in your Git commit message:(Any of the three will work.) Note that this will link to the issue and also close it. You can find out more in this blog post (start watching the embedded video at about 1:40).I\'m not sure if a similar syntax will simply link to an issue without closing it.You can also cross reference repos:xxx being the issue numbergithub adds a reference to the commit if it contains #issuenbr (discovered this by chance).they have an nice write up about the new issues 2.0 on their blog\nhttps://github.com/blog/831-issues-2-0-the-next-generationsynonyms includeusing any of the keywords in a commit message will make your commit either mentioned or close an issue.Just as addition to the other answers: If you don\'t even want to write the commit message with the issue number and happen to use Eclipse for development, then you can install the eGit and Mylyn plugins as well as the GitHub connector for Mylyn. Eclipse can then automatically track which issue you are working on and automatically fill the commit message, including the issue number as shown in all the other answers.For more details about that setup see http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/GitHub/UserGuideOne of my first projects as a programmer was a gem called stagecoach that (among other things) allowed the automatic adding of a github issue number to every commit message on a branch, which is a part of the question that hasn\'t really been answered.  Essentially when creating a branch you\'d use a custom command (something like stagecoach -b <branch_name> -g <issue_number>), and the issue number would then be assigned to that branch in a yml file.  There was then a commit hook that appended the issue number to the commit message automatically.I wouldn\'t recommend it for production use as at the time I\'d only been programming for a few months and I no longer maintain it, but it may be of interest to somebody.In order to link the issue number to your commit message, you should add:\n#issue_number in your git commit message.Example Commit Message from Udacity Git Commit Message Style Guide You can also reference the repositories:
