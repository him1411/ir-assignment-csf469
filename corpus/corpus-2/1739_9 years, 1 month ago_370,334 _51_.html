I have a data structure that represents a directed graph, and I want to render that dynamically on an HTML page.  These graphs will usually be just a few nodes, maybe ten at the very upper end, so my guess is that performance isn\'t going to be a big deal. Ideally, I\'d like to be able to hook it in with jQuery so that users can tweak the layout manually by dragging the nodes around.Note: I\'m not looking for a charting library.I\'ve just put together what you may be looking for: http://www.graphdracula.netIt\'s JavaScript with directed graph layouting, SVG and you can even drag the nodes around. Still needs some tweaking, but is totally usable. You create nodes and edges easily with JavaScript code like this:I used the previously mentioned Raphael JS library (the graffle example) plus some code for a force based graph layout algorithm I found on the net (everything open source, MIT license). If you have any remarks or need a certain feature, I may implement it, just ask!You may want to have a look at other projects, too! Below are two meta-comparisons:SocialCompare has an extensive list of libraries, and the "Node / edge graph" line will filter for graph visualization ones.DataVisualization.ch has evaluated many libraries, including node/graph ones. Unfortunately there\'s no direct link so you\'ll have to filter for "graph":Here\'s a list of similar projects (some have been already mentioned here):vis.js supports many types of network/edge graphs, plus timelines and 2D/3D charts.

It\'s free and open-source:http://js.cytoscape.orgAs guruz mentioned, the JIT has several lovely graph/tree layouts, including quite appealing RGraph and HyperTree visualizations.Also, I\'ve just put up a super simple SVG-based implementation at github (no dependencies, ~125 LOC) that should work well enough for small graphs displayed in modern browsers.In a commercial scenario, a serious contestant for sure is yFiles for HTML:It offers:Here is a sample rendering that shows most of the requested features:Full disclosure: I work for yWorks, but on Stackoverflow I do not represent my employer.
