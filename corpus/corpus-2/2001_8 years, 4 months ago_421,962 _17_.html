Isn\'t there a convenient way of getting from a java.util.Date to a XMLGregorianCalendar?For those that might end up here looking for the opposite conversion (from XMLGregorianCalendar to Date):Here is a method for converting from a GregorianCalendar to XMLGregorianCalendar; I\'ll leave the part of converting from a java.util.Date to GregorianCalendar as an exercise for you:EDIT: Slooow  :-)A one line example using Joda-Time library:Credit to Nicolas Mommaerts from his comment in the accepted answer.Just thought I\'d add my solution below, since the answers above did not meet my exact needs. My Xml schema required seperate Date and Time elements, not a singe DateTime field. The standard XMLGregorianCalendar constructor used above will generate a DateTime fieldNote there a couple of gothca\'s, such as having to add one to the month (since java counts months from 0).I hope my encoding here is right ;D\nTo make it faster just use the ugly getInstance() call of GregorianCalendar instead of constructor call:Assuming you are decoding or encoding xml and using JAXB, then it\'s possible to replace the dateTime binding entirely and use something else than `XMLGregorianCalendar\' for every date in the schema.In that way you can have JAXB do the repetitive stuff while you can spend the time on writing awesome code that delivers value.Example for a jodatime DateTime:  (Doing this with java.util.Date would also work - but with certain limitations. I prefer jodatime and it\'s copied from my code so I know it works...)And the converter:See here: \nhow replace XmlGregorianCalendar by Date?If you are happy to just map to an instant based on the timezone+timestamp, and the original timezone is not really relevant, then java.util.Date is probably fine too.Check out this code :-You can see complete example here
