I am running a program and want to see what its return code is (since it returns different codes based on different errors).I know in Bash I can do this by runningecho $?What do I do when using cmd.exe on Windows?A pseudo environment variable named errorlevel stores the exit code:Also, the if command has a special syntax:See if /? for details.Warning: If you set an environment variable name errorlevel, %errorlevel% will return that value and not the exit code. Use (set errorlevel=) to clear the environment variable, allowing access to the true value of errorlevel via the %errorlevel% environment variable.Testing ErrorLevel works for console applications, but as hinted at by dmihailescu, this won\'t work if you\'re trying to run a windowed application (e.g. Win32-based) from a command prompt.  A windowed application will run in the background, and control will return immediately to the command prompt (most likely with an ErrorLevel of zero to indicate that the process was created successfully).  When a windowed application eventually exits, its exit status is lost.Instead of using the console-based C++ launcher mentioned elsewhere, though, a simpler alternative is to start a windowed application using the command prompt\'s START /WAIT command.  This will start the windowed application, wait for it to exit, and then return control to the command prompt with the exit status of the process set in ErrorLevel.Use the built-in ERRORLEVEL Variable:But beware if an application has defined an environment variable named ERRORLEVEL!It might not work correctly when using a program that is not attached to the console, because that app might still be running while you think you have the exit code.\nA solution to do it in C++ looks like below:If you want to match the error code exactly (eg equals 0), use this:"if errorlevel 0" matches errorlevel >= 0. See "if /?".At one point I needed to accurately push log events from Cygwin to the Windows Event log. I wanted the messages in WEVL to be custom, have the correct exit code, details, priorities, message, etc. So I created a little Bash script to take care of this. Here it is on GitHub, logit.sh.Some excerpts:Here is the temporary file contents part:Here is a function to to create events in WEVL:Executing the batch script and calling on __create_event:
