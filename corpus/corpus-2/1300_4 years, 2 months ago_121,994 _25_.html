I have changed a few files name by  de-capitalize the first letter, as in Name.jpg to name.jpg. Git does not recognize this changes and I had to delete the files and upload them again. Is there a way that Git can be case-sensitive when checking for changes in file names? I have not made any changes to the file itself. You can use git mv:Git has a configuration setting that tells it whether to be case sensitive or insensitive: core.ignorecase. To tell Git to be case-senstive, simply set this setting to false:From the git config documentation:core.ignorecaseIf true, this option enables various workarounds to enable git to work better on filesystems that are not case sensitive, like FAT. For example, if a directory listing finds makefile when git expects Makefile, git will assume it is really the same file, and continue to remember it as Makefile.The default is false, except git-clone(1) or git-init(1) will probe and set core.ignorecase true if appropriate when the repository is created.The two most popular operating systems that have case-insensitive file systems that I know of areThis is what I did on OS X:Two steps because otherwise I got a \xe2\x80\x9cfile exists\xe2\x80\x9d error. Perhaps it can be done in one step by adding --cached or such.Under OSX, to avoid this issue and avoid other problems with developing on a case-insensitive filesystem, you can use Disk Utility to create a case sensitive virtual drive / disk image.Run disk utility, create new disk image, and use the following settings (or change as you like, but keep it case sensitive):Make sure to tell git it is now on a case sensitive FS:Using SourceTree I was able to do this all from the UIIt\'s a bit tedious, but if you only need to do it to a few files it\'s pretty quick1) rename file Name.jpg to name1.jpg2) commit removed file Name.jpg3) rename file name1.jpg to name.jpg4) ammend added file name.jpg to previous commitI\'ve faced this issue several times on MacOS. Git is case sensitive but Mac is only case preserving. Someone commit a file: Foobar.java and after a few days decides to rename it to FooBar.java. When you pull the latest code it fails with The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by checkout...The only reliable way that I\'ve seen that fixes this is:When you\'ve done a lot of file renaming and some of it are just a change of casing, it\'s hard to remember which is which. manually "git moving" the file can be quite some work. So what I would do during my filename change tasks are:This will fix all the case issues without trying to figure out which files or folders you renamed.
