How do I remove the border from an iframe embedded in my web app? An example of the iframe is:I would like the transition from the content on my page to the contents of the iframe to be seamless, assuming the background colors are consistent. The target browser is IE6 only and unfortunately solutions for others will not help.Add the frameBorder attribute (note the capital \xe2\x80\x98B\xe2\x80\x99).So it would look like:DEMOAfter going mad trying to remove the border in IE7, I found that the frameBorder attribute is case sensitive.You have to set the frameBorder attribute with a capital B.In addition to adding the frameBorder attribute you might want to consider setting the scrolling attribute to "no" to prevent scrollbars from appearing. Using the "border" CSS attribute works as well:For browser specific issues also add frameborder="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" according to Dreamweaver:Use the HTML iframe frameborder Attributehttp://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_iframe_frameborder.aspNote: use frameBorder (cap B) for IE, otherwise will not work. But, the iframe frameborder attribute is not supported in HTML5. So, Use CSS instead.you can also remove scrolling using scrolling attribute\nhttp://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_iframe_scrolling.aspAlso you can use seamless attribute which is new in HTML5. The seamless attribute of the iframe tag is only supported in Opera, Chrome and Safari. When present, it specifies that the iframe should look like it is a part of the containing document (no borders or scrollbars). As of now, The seamless attribute of the  tag is only supported in Opera, Chrome and Safari. But in near future it will be the standard solution and will be compatible with all browsers. http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_iframe_seamless.aspYou can use style="border:0;" in your iframe code. That is the recommended way to remove border in HTML5. Check out my html5 iframe generator tool to customize your iframe without editing code.If the doctype of the page you are placing the iframe on is HTML5 then you can use the seamless attribute like so:Mozilla docs on the seamless attributeYou can also do it with JavaScript this way. It will find any iframe elements and remove their borders in IE and other browsers (though you can just set a style of "border : none;" in non-IE browsers instead of using JavaScript). AND it will work even if used AFTER the iframe is generated and in place in the document (e.g. iframes that are added in plain HTML and not JavaScript)!This appears to work because IE creates the border, not on the iframe element as you\'d expect, but on the CONTENT of the iframe--after the iframe is created in the BOM. ($@&*#@!!! IE!!!)Note: The IE part will only work (of course) if the parent window and iframe are from the SAME origin (same domain, port, protocol etc.). Otherwise the script will get "access denied" errors in the IE error console. If that happens, your only option is to set it before it is generated, as others have noted, or use the non-standard frameBorder="0" attribute. (or just let IE look fugly--my current favorite option ;) )Took me MANY hours of working to the point of despair to figure this out...Enjoy. :)Style property can be used \nFor HTML5 if you want to remove the boder of your frame or anything you can use the style property. as given below Code goes hereAdd the frameBorder attribute (Capital \xe2\x80\x98B\xe2\x80\x99).I tried all of the above and if that doesn\'t work for you try the below CSS resolved the issue for me.
