How can I install Google Play Services in a Genymotion emulator with no drag and drop support?I can\'t install it as mentioned in Stack Overflow post How do you install Google frameworks (Play, Accounts, etc.) on a Genymotion virtual device? due to the lack of support for drag and drop installation.Genymotion supports Google Apps for a few emulators, but it doesn\'t support tablet emulators.Genymotion doesn\'t provide Google Apps. To install Google Apps:Upgrade Genymotion and VirtualBox to the latest version.Download two zip files:\n - ARM Translation Installer v1.1\n - Google Apps for your Android version: 2.3.7 - 4.4.4 or 4.4 - 6.0 (with platform and variant) You can also find the GApps list in the wbroek user GitHubGist page.Open Genymotion emulator and go to home screen then drag and drop the first file Genymotion-ARM-Translation_v1.1.zip over the emulator. A dialog will appear and show as file transfer in progress, then another dialog will appear and ask that do you want to flash it on the emulator. Click OK and reboot the device by running adb reboot from your terminal or command prompt. Drag and drop the second file gapps-*-signed.zip and repeat the same steps as above. Run adb reboot again and, once rebooted, Google Apps will be in the emulator. At this point \'Google Apps Services\' will crash frequently with the following message google play services has stopped working. Open Google Play. After providing your account details, open Google Play and update your installed Google Apps. This seems to make Google Play realize you have an old Google Play Services and will ask you to update (in my case, updating Google Hangouts required a new version of Google Play Services). I\'ve also heard that simply waiting will also prompt you to update. The \'Google Play Services\' app doesn\'t seem to appear otherwise - you can\'t search for it. You should then see an offer to update Google Play Services. Once the new Google Play Services is installed you will now have stable, working access to Google PlayYou could do this simply by: NOTE: you can find the right GApp version here: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2528952I tried almost all of the above options, but was not able to install google play services, however just found from the faq section of genymotion that the only way to access google play services is to use the packages provided by OpenGapps.I tried and this worked:For Android 6.0 at least, the ARM Translation thing is apparently unnecessary.Just grab an x86 + Android 6.0 package (nano is fine) from OpenGApps and install by dragging-and-dropping and telling it to flash.It seems the ARM translation thing was previously required, before the x86 package was available. You might still need the ARM translation if you want to install ARM-only apps though.Same steps mentioned in @KingyBobo and @anp8850 answers, but:Download the correct GApps for Android 5.0:\n  Google Apps for Android 5.0 (https://www.androidfilehost.com/?fid=95784891001614559 - gapps-lp-20141109-signed.zip)More GApps hereNote that Google+ shows lot of errors before updated.With adb, you can install GApps and ARM Support zips without a drag & drop.\nemuking from XDA Developers has instructions for it:I used 4.2.2, which is acceptable for my testing purposes. I then extracted both zip\'s "/system/..." folders to a folder on my desktop.\n  In cmd prompt I used the following commands (step 1 is optional and for verification that adb is working):You\'ll have to change the folder name in "adb push" line to where you actually extracted both zip files. After doing it, I recommend you to "adb reboot" the device.The latest version of Genymotion (2.10.0) now allows you to install GApps from the emulator toolbar:Click the GApps button the toolbarAccept the Terms and ConditionsYour download of google apps will then beginOnce the download is complete simply restart the virtual device!Drag and Drop did not work on my system... I found a blogpost which describes how you install it with adb:Now Gapps provide way to install gapps package thorough apk.Download APK and installation instruction from below link:http://opengapps.org/app/You can download current APK from below link:Play store link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.opengapps.appCurrent version Website Link (7/22/2017):\nhttp://opengapps.org/app/opengapps-app-v16.apkFollowing the steps in the accepted answer didn\'t work for me. I followed the steps in this guide with an image running 5.0.0, and it got the job done. It\'s a step-wise process just like the accepted answer for adding Google Play support to genymotion images.The most important differences are that in the guide I linked to, they mention that installing Google Play Services on images running higher than 5.0.0 may not work, and they say to change the ADB tool connection settings in the Genymotion desktop application\'s settings window to: Use custom Android SDK tools. Also, the gapps zips seem to be different.The guide also uses GIFs to illustrate the steps in the process, so it leaves much less room for doubt.Link to gapps zip for Android 5.0 used in the guide -- requires Genymotion 2.4.0+Link to ARM Translation Installer v1.1 used in the guide -- this is provided for convenience. it doesn\'t seem any different than the one provided in the accepted answer at first glanceAs of February 2017 it is not possible to install google play services on genymotion emulator.
