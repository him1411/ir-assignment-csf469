I want to provide my visitors the ability to see images in high quality, is there any way I can detect the window size?Or better yet, the viewport size of the browser with JavaScript? See green area here:jQuery dimension functions$(window).width() and $(window).height()You can use the window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight properties.If you aren\'t using jQuery, it gets ugly. Here\'s a snippet that should work on all new browsers. The behavior is different in Quirks mode and standards mode in IE. This takes care of it.I know this has an acceptable answer, but I ran into a situation where clientWidth didn\'t work, as iPhone (at least mine) returned 980, not 320, so I used window.screen.width. I was working on existing site being made "responsive" and needed to force larger browsers to use a different meta viewport. Hope this helps someone, it may not be perfect, but it works in my testing on iOs and Android. I was able to find a definitive answer in JavaScript: The Definitive Guide, 6th Edition by O\'Reilly, p. 391:This solution works even in Quirks mode, while ryanve and ScottEvernden\'s current solution do not.except for the fact that I wonder why the line if (document.compatMode == "CSS1Compat") is not if (d.compatMode == "CSS1Compat"), everything looks good.There is a difference between window.innerHeight and document.documentElement.clientHeight. The first includes the height of the horizontal scrollbar.This code is from http://andylangton.co.uk/articles/javascript/get-viewport-size-javascript/NB : to read the width, use console.log(\'viewport width\'+viewport().width);If you are looking for non-jQuery solution that gives correct values in virtual pixels on mobile, and you think that plain window.innerHeight or document.documentElement.clientHeight can solve your problem, please study this link first: http://tripleodeon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/table.htmlThe developer has done good testing that reveals the problem: you can get unexpected values for Android/iOS, landscape/portrait, normal/high density displays. My current answer is not silver bullet yet (//todo), but rather a warning to those who are going to quickly copy-paste any given solution from this thread into production code.I was looking for page width in virtual pixels on mobile, and I\'ve found the  only working code is (unexpectedly!) window.outerWidth. I will later examine this table for correct solution giving height excluding navigation bar, when I have time.A solution that would conform to W3C standards would be to create a transparent div (for example dynamically with JavaScript), set its width and height to 100vw/100vh (Viewport units) and then get its offsetWidth and offsetHeight. After that, the element can be removed again. This will not work in older browsers because the viewport units are relatively new, but if you don\'t care about them but about (soon-to-be) standards instead, you could definitely go this way:Of course, you could also set objNode.style.position = "fixed" and then use 100% as width/height - this should have the same effect and improve compatibility to some extent. Also, setting position to fixed might be a good idea in general, because otherwise the div will be invisible but consume some space, which will lead to scrollbars appearing etc.I looked and found a cross browser way: This is the way I do it, I tried it in IE 8 -> 10, FF 35, Chrome 40, it will work very smooth in all modern browsers (as window.innerWidth is defined) and in IE 8 (with no window.innerWidth) it works smooth as well, any issue (like flashing because of overflow: "hidden"), please report it. I\'m not really interested on the viewport height as I made this function just to workaround some responsive tools, but it might be implemented. Hope it helps, I appreciate comments and suggestions.
