What\'s the best way to determine the first key in a possibly associative array? My first thought it to just foreach the array and then immediately breaking it, like this:Thus having $key contain the first key, but this seems inefficient. Does anyone have a better solution?You can use reset and key:It\'s essentially the same as your initial code, but with a little less overhead, and it\'s more obvious what is happening.Just remember to call reset, or you may get any of the keys in the array. You can also use end instead of reset to get the last key.If you wanted the key to get the first value, reset actually returns it:There is one special case to watch out for though (so check the length of the array first):array_keys returns an array of keys. Take the first entry. Alternatively, you could call reset on the array, and subsequently key. The latter approach is probably slightly faster (Thoug I didn\'t test it), but it has the side effect of resetting the internal pointer.Interestingly enough, the foreach loop is actually the most efficient way of doing this.Since the OP specifically asked about efficiency, it should be pointed out that all the current answers are in fact much less efficient than a foreach.I did a benchmark on this with php 5.4, and the reset/key pointer method (accepted answer) seems to be about 7 times slower than a foreach. Other approaches manipulating the entire array (array_keys, array_flip) are obviously even slower than that and become much worse when working with a large array.Foreach is not inefficient at all, feel free to use it!Edit 2015-03-03:Benchmark scripts have been requested, I don\'t have the original ones but made some new tests instead. This time I found the foreach only about twice as fast as reset/key. I used a 100-key array and ran each method a million times to get some noticeable difference, here\'s code of the simple benchmark:On my php 5.5 this outputs:reset+key http://3v4l.org/b4DrN/perf#tabs\nforeach http://3v4l.org/gRoGD/perf#tabskey($an_array) will give you the first keyedit per Blixt: you should call reset($array); before key($an_array) to reset the pointer to the beginning of the array.If efficiency is not that important for you, you can use array_keys($yourArray)[0] in PHP 5.4 (and higher).Examples:The advantage over solution: is that you can pass array_keys($arr)[0] as a function parameter (i.e. doSomething(array_keys($arr)[0], $otherParameter)).HTHPlease find the following:I think this will work.This could also be a solution.I have tested it and it works.You could tryThe best way that worked for me was array_keys  gets array of keys from initial array and then array_shift cuts from it first element value.\nYou will need PHP 5.4+ for this.You can play with your arrayTo get the first element of array you can use current and for last element you can use endA one-liner:You can try this.\nTo get first value of the array :-To get first key of the arrayThis is the easier way I had ever found. Fast and only two lines of code :-DTo enhance on the solution of Webmut, I\'ve added the following solution:The output for me on PHP 7.1 is:If I do this for an array of size 10000, then the results becomeThe array_keys method times out at 30 seconds (with only 1000 elements, the timing for the rest was about the same, but the array_keys method had about 7.5 seconds).Today I had to search for the first key of my array returned by a POST request. (And note the number for a form id etc)Well, I\'ve found this:\nReturn first key of associative array in PHPhttp://php.net/keyI\'ve done this, and it work.Maybe it will eco 15min of an other guy.\nCYA.
