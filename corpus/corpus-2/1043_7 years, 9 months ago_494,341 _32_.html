My current setting assumes 8 spaces; how could I redefine it?It depends on what you mean. Do you want actual tab characters in your file to appear 4 spaces wide, or by "tab" do you actually mean an indent, generated by pressing the tab key, which would result in the file literally containing (up to) 4 space characters for each "tab" you type?Depending on your answer, one of the following sets of\nsettings should work for you:For tab characters that appear 4-spaces-wide:If you\'re using actual tab character in your source code you probably also want these settings (these are actually the defaults, but you may want to set them defensively):Finally, if you want an indent to correspond to a single tab, you should also use:For indents that consist of 4 space characters but are entered with the tab key:To make the above settings permanent add\nthese lines to your vimrc.In case you need to make adjustments, or would simply like to understand what these options all mean, here\'s a breakdown of what each option means:The width of a hard tabstop measured in "spaces" -- effectively the (maximum) width of an actual tab character.The size of an "indent". It\'s also measured in spaces, so if your code base indents with tab characters then you want shiftwidth to equal the number of tab characters times tabstop. This is also used by things like the =, > and < commands.Setting this to a non-zero value other than tabstop will make the tab key (in insert mode) \n  insert a combination of spaces (and possibly tabs) to simulate tab stops at this width.Enabling this will make the tab key (in insert mode) insert spaces instead of \n  tab characters. This also affects the behavior of the retab command.Enabling this will make the tab key (in insert mode) insert spaces or tabs to\n  go to the next indent\n  of the next tabstop when the cursor is at the beginning of a line (i.e. the\n  only preceding characters are whitespace).For more details on any of these see :help \'optionname\' in vim (e.g. :help \'tabstop\') To define this on a permanent basis for the current user, create (or edit) the .vimrc file:Then, paste the configuration below into the file. Once vim is restarted, the tab settings will apply.or shorthand for vim modeline:I copied and pasted this into my .vimrc file:The first 2 settings mean that when I press Tab I get 4 spaces.\nThe third setting means that when I do V> (i.e. visual and indent) I also get 4 spaces.Not as comprehensive as the accepted answer but it might help people who just want something to copy and paste.Put your desired settings in the ~/.vimrc file -- See below for some guidelines and best practices.There are four main ways to use tabs in Vim:Always keep \'tabstop\' at 8, set \'softtabstop\' and \'shiftwidth\' to 4 (or 3 or whatever you prefer) and use \'noexpandtab\'.  Then Vim will use a mix of tabs and spaces, but typing  and  will behave like a tab appears every 4 (or 3) characters.Note: Setting \'tabstop\' to any other value than 8 can make your file appear wrong in many places (e.g., when printing it).Set \'tabstop\' and \'shiftwidth\' to whatever you prefer and use \'expandtab\'.  This way you will always insert spaces.  The formatting will never be messed up when \'tabstop\' is changed.Set \'tabstop\' and \'shiftwidth\' to whatever you prefer and use a |modeline| to set these values when editing the file again.  Only works when using Vim to edit the file.Always set \'tabstop\' and \'shiftwidth\' to the same value, and \'noexpandtab\'.  This should then work (for initial indents only) for any tabstop setting that people use.  It might be nice to have tabs after the first non-blank inserted as spaces if you do this though.  Otherwise aligned comments will be wrong when \'tabstop\' ischanged.Source:See Mastering the VI editorAdd line\nset ts=4\nin\n~/.vimrc file for per user\nor\n /etc/vimrc file for system wideOne more thing, use\n:retab\nto convert existing tab to spaces\nhttp://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Converting_tabs_to_spaces
