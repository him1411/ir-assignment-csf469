What would be a nice way to go from {2:3, 1:89, 4:5, 3:0} to {1:89, 2:3, 3:0, 4:5}?\nI checked some posts but they all use the "sorted" operator that returns tuples. Standard Python dictionaries are unordered. Even if you sorted the (key,value) pairs, you wouldn\'t be able to store them in a dict in a way that would preserve the ordering.The easiest way is to use OrderedDict, which remembers the order in which the elements have been inserted:Never mind the way od is printed out; it\'ll work as expected:For Python 3 users, one needs to use the .items() instead of .iteritems():Dictionaries themselves do not have ordered items as such, should you want to print them etc to some order, here are some examples:In Python 2.4 and above:gives:(Python below 2.4:)Source: http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2007/09/how-to-sort-python-dictionary-by-keys/From Python\'s collections library documentation:There are a number of Python modules that provide dictionary implementations which automatically maintain the keys in sorted order. Consider the sortedcontainers module which is pure-Python and fast-as-C implementations. There is also a performance comparison with other popular options benchmarked against one another.Using an ordered dict is an inadequate solution if you need to constantly add and remove key/value pairs while also iterating.The SortedDict type also supports indexed location lookups and deletion which isn\'t possible with the built-in dict type.As others have mentioned, dictionaries are inherently unordered.  However, if the issue is merely displaying dictionaries in an ordered fashion, you can override the __str__ method in a dictionary subclass, and use this dictionary class rather than the builtin dict.  Eg.Note, this changes nothing about how the keys are stored, the order they will come back when you iterate over them etc, just how they\'re displayed with print or at the python console.Simply:Output:Found another way:upd:\n1. this also sorts nested objects (thanks @DanielF).\n2. python dictionaries are unordered therefore this is sutable for print or assign to str only.In Python 3. givesHere I found some simplest solution to sort the python dict by key using pprint.\neg. but while using pprint it will return sorted dictThere is an easy way to sort a dictionary.According to your question,The solution is :(Where c,is the name of your dictionary.)This program gives the following output:like u wanted.Another example is:Gives the output:[\'Albert\', \'Bill\', \'John\', \'Lucy\', \'Peter\']Gives the output:[18, 24, 32, 36, 41]Gives the output:Hence by changing it into keys, values and items , you can print like what u wanted.Hope this helps!Python dicts are un-ordered. Usually, this is not a problem since the most common use case is to do a lookup. The simplest way to do what you want would be to create a collections.OrderedDict inserting the elements in sorted order.If you need to iterated, as others above have suggested, the simplest way would be to iterate over sorted keys. Examples-Print values sorted by keys:Get list of values sorted by keys:Will generate exactly what you want: But this is not the write way to do this, because, It could show a distinct behavior with different dictionaries , which I have learned recently. Hence perfect way has been suggested by Tim In the response of my Query which I am sharing here.I think the easiest thing is to sort the dict by key and save the sorted key:value pair in a new dict.To make it clearer:Guys you are making things complicated ... it\'s really simpleThe output is:A timing comparison of the two methods in 2.7 shows them to be virtually identical:Simplest solution is that you should get a list of dict key is sorted order and then iterate over dict. For exampleFollowing will be the output (desending order)If you have a dict, for example:
