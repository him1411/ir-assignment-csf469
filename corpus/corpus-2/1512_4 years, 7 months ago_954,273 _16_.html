This question already has an answer here:Please explain the use of Xms and Xmx parameters in JVMs. What are the default values for them?The flag Xmx specifies the maximum memory allocation pool for a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), while Xms specifies the initial memory allocation pool.This means that your JVM will be started with Xms amount of memory and will be able to use a maximum of Xmx amount of memory. For example, starting a JVM like below will start it with 256MB of memory, and will allow the process to use up to 2048MB of memory:The memory flag can also be specified in multiple sizes, such as kilobytes, megabytes, and so on.The Xms flag has no default value, and Xmx typically has a default value of 256MB. A common use for these flags is when you encounter a java.lang.OutOfMemoryError.When using these settings, keep in mind that these settings are for the JVM\'s heap, and that the JVM can/will use more memory than just the size allocated to the heap. From Oracle\'s Documentation:Note that the JVM uses more memory than just the heap. For example Java methods, thread stacks and native handles are allocated in memory separate from the heap, as well as JVM internal data structures.Just run the command java -X and you will get a list of all -X options:The -X options are non-standard and subject to change without notice.I hope this will help you understand Xms, Xmx as well as many more other things that matters the most. :)You can specify in your IDE . eg for eclipse in Run Configuration> Vm Arguments\nyou enter -Xmx800m -Xms500mThe main part of the question has already been addressed above. \nJust adding part of the default values.As per http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13150_01/jrockit_jvm/jrockit/jrdocs/refman/optionX.htmlThe default value of Xmx will depend on platform and amount of memory available in the system.
