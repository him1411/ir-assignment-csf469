This is a question you can read everywhere on the web with various answers :etc.However, there is always "the best way" and it should be on stackoverflow.People from other scripting languages always think theirs is better because they have a built in function to do that and not PHP (I am looking at pythonistas right now :-)).In fact, it does exist, but few people know it. Meet pathinfo():This is fast and built-in. pathinfo() can give you other information, such as canonical path, depending on the constant you pass to it.Remember that if you want to be able to deal with non ASCII characters, you need to set the locale first. E.G:Also note this doesn\'t take in consideration the file content or mimetype, you only get the extension. But it\'s what you asked for.Lastly, note that this works only for a file path, not a URL ressources path, which are covered using PARSE_URL.Enjoypathinfo()An example...There is also SplFileInfo:Often you can write better code if you pass such an object around instead of a string, your code is more speaking then. Since PHP 5.4 this is a one-liner:for example, url is http://example.com/myfolder/sympony.mp3?a=1&b=2Addition:p.s. note, Hashtag part of url (i.e. #smth) not available in PHP request, but only with javascript.E-satis response is the correct way to determine the file extension.Alternatively, instead of relying on a files extension, you could use the fileinfo (http://us2.php.net/fileinfo) to determine the files MIME type.Here\'s a simplified example of processing an image uploaded by a user:1) If you are using (PHP 5 >= 5.3.6)\nyou can use SplFileInfo::getExtension \xe2\x80\x94 Gets the file extensionExample codeThis will output2) Another way of getting the extension if you are using (PHP 4 >= 4.0.3, PHP 5) is pathinfoExample codeThis will output// EDIT: removed a bracketSometimes it\'s useful to not to use pathinfo($path, PATHINFO_EXTENSION), for example:Also note that pathinfo fails to handle some non-ASCII characters (usually it just suppresses them from the output), in extensions that usually isn\'t a problem but it doesn\'t hurt to be aware of that caveat.The simplest way to get file extension in php is to use php built-in function pathinfo.As long as it does not contain path you can also use:Where $fname is a name of the file, for example: my_picture.jpg\nAnd the outcome would be: jpgHere is a example, suppose $filename is "example.txt"So $ext will be ".txt"A quick fix would be something like this.pathinfo is array. We can check directory name,file name,extension etc This will workI found that the pathinfo() and SplFileInfo solutions works well for standard files on the local file system, but you can run into difficulties if you\'re working with remote files as URLs for valid images may have a # (fragment identifiers) and/or ? (query parameters) at the end of the URL, which both those solutions will (incorrect) treat as part of the file extension.I found this was a reliable way to use pathinfo() on a URL after first parsing it to strip out the unnecessary clutter after the file extension:you can try also this :Why not to use substr($path, strrpos($path,\'.\')+1); ?\nIt is the fastest method of all compare.\n@Kurt Zhong already answered.Let\'s check the comparative result here: https://eval.in/661574You can get all file extension on particular folder and do operation with specific file extentionIf you are looking for speed (such as in a router), you probably don\'t want to tokenize everything. Many other answers will fail with /root/my.folder/my.css you can try also this \n(work on php 5.* and 7)tip: it return an empty string if the file has no extension\n\nenjoy it ;)You can simply use followingHere $temp is your extension like if your file is image then it will be .jpgUse for a quick extension retrieval (if you know for sure your file name has one).
