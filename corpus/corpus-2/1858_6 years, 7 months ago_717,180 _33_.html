I\'d like to remove the lines in this data frame that contain NAs across all columns. Below is my example data frame. Basically, I\'d like to get a data frame such as the following.Also, I\'d like to know how to only filter for some columns, so I can also get a data frame like this:Also check complete.cases :na.omit is nicer for just removing all NA\'s. complete.cases allows partial selection by including only certain columns of the dataframe:Your solution can\'t work. If you insist on using is.na, then you have to do something like:but using complete.cases is quite a lot more clear, and faster.Try na.omit(your.data.frame). As for the second question, try posting it as another question (for clarity).I prefer following way to check whether rows contain any NAs:This returns logical vector with values denoting whether there is any NA in a row. You can use it to see how many rows you\'ll have to drop:and eventually drop themFor filtering rows with certain part of NAs it becomes a little trickier (for example, you can feed \'final[,5:6]\' to \'apply\').\nGenerally, Joris Meys\' solution seems to be more elegant.Another option if you want greater control over how rows are deemed to be invalid isUsing the above, this:Becomes:...where only row 5 is removed since it is the only row containing NAs for both rnor AND cfam. The boolean logic can then be changed to fit specific requirements.If you want control over how many NAs are valid for each row, try this function. For many survey data sets, too many blank question responses can ruin the results. So they are deleted after a certain threshold. This function will allow you to choose how many NAs the row can have before it\'s deleted:By default, it will eliminate all NAs:Or specify the maximum number of NAs allowed:If you like pipes (%>%), tidyr\'s new drop_na is your friend: This will return the rows that have at least ONE non-NA value.This will return the rows that have at least TWO non-NA value.We can also use the subset function for this.This will give only those rows that do not have NA in both mmul and rnorFor your first question, I have a code that I am comfortable with to get rid of all NAs. Thanks for @Gregor to make it simpler.For the second question, the code is just an alternation from the previous solution.Notice the -5 is the number of columns in your data. This will eliminate rows with all NAs, since the rowSums adds up to 5 and they become zeroes after subtraction. This time, as.logical is necessary.Hope you enjoy!I am a synthesizer:). Here I combined the answers into one function:Using dplyr package we can filter NA as follows:Assuming dat as your dataframe, the expected output can be achieved using1.rowSums2.lapply
