Both these joins will give me the same results:vsIs there any difference between the statements in performance or otherwise? Does it differ between different SQL implementations? They are functionally equivalent, but INNER JOIN can be a bit clearer to read, especially if the query has other join types (i.e. LEFT or RIGHT or CROSS) included in it.Just typing JOIN performs an INNER JOIN by default.For all others, one picture is sometimes worth more than hundreds of words:Image courtesy of CodeProject No, there is no difference, pure syntactic sugar.INNER JOIN = JOIN:INNER JOIN is the default if you don\'t specify the type when you use the word JOIN.You can also use LEFT OUTER JOIN or RIGHT OUTER JOIN, in which case the word OUTER is optional,\n  or you can specify CROSS JOIN.ORFor an inner join, the syntax is:SELECT ...\n  FROM TableA\n  [INNER] JOIN TableB(in other words, the "INNER" keyword is optional - results are the same\n  with or without it)Similarly with OUTER JOINs the word "OUTER" is optional, its the LEFT or RIGHT keyword that makes the JOIN an "OUTER" JOIN.However for some reason I always use "OUTER" as in LEFT OUTER JOIN and never LEFT JOIN, but I never use INNER JOIN but rather I just use "JOIN"Does it differ between different SQL implementations?Yes, MS Access doesn\'t allow just join it requires inner join.As the other answers already state there is no difference in your example.The relevant bit of grammar is documented hereShowing that all are optional. The page further clarifies that INNER Specifies all matching pairs of rows are returned. Discards\n  unmatched rows from both tables. When no join type is specified, this\n  is the default.The grammar does also indicate that there is one time where the INNER is required though. When specifying a join hint.See the example below
