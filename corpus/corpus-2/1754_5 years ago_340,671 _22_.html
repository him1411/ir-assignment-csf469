I\'d like to show all configured git sections. I only found git config --get core.editor and I\'d like to output everything that\'s configured globally, not only the configured default editor. You can use git config --list, or look at your ~/.gitconfig file. Local config will be in your repository\'s .git/config file.The shortest,shows all inherited values from: system, global and localis one way to go. I usually just open up .gitconfig though.You can also call git config -e to open the config file in your editor directly. The git-config file is much more readable that the -l output, so I always tend to use the -e flag.So to summarise:(Couldn\'t really find what $(prefix) means, but it seems to default to $HOME.)Git 2.6 (Sept/Oct 2015) will add the option --name-only to simplify the output of a git config -l:See commit a92330d, commit f225987, commit 9f1429d (20 Aug 2015) by Jeff King (peff).\nSee commit ebca2d4 (20 Aug 2015), and commit 905f203, commit 578625f (10 Aug 2015) by SZEDER G\xc3\xa1bor (szeder).\n(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit fc9dfda, 31 Aug 2015) \'git config\' can only show values or name-value pairs, so if a shell\n  script needs the names of set config variables it has to run \'git config --list\' or \'--get-regexp\' and parse the output to separate config variable names from their values.\n  However, such a parsing can\'t cope with multi-line values.  Though \'git config\' can produce null-terminated output for newline-safe parsing, that\'s of no use in such a case, because shells can\'t cope with null characters.Even our own bash completion script suffers from these issues.Help the completion script, and shell scripts in general, by introducing\n  the \'--name-only\' option to modify the output of \'--list\' and\n  \'--get-regexp\' to list only the names of config variables, so they don\'t\n  have to perform error-prone post processing to separate variable names\n  from their values anymore.you can also use cat .gitconfig If you just want to list one part of the gitconfig, such as alias, core, remote, etc., you could just pipe the result through grep. Something like:On linux based systems you can view/edit config file by make sure you are inside git init folderIf you want to work with --global config it\'son /home/userNameThis should help with editing.\nhttps://help.github.com/categories/setup/
