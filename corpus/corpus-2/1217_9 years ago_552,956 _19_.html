How can I convert a character to its ASCII code using JavaScript? For example:get 10 from "\\n".String.prototype.charCodeAt() can convert string characters to ASCII numbers. For example:For opposite use String.fromCharCode(10) that convert numbers to equal ASCII character. This function can accept multiple numbers and join all the characters then return the string. Example:Here is a quick ASCII characters reference:If you have only one char and not a string, you can use:omitting the 0...It is slower though. With the current version of chrome, it is 5 times slower.While the other answers are right, I prefer this way:Then, to use it, simply:I am using this for a small shortcut system:And you can even use it inside map() or other methods:For those that want to get a sum of all the ASCII codes for a string:Or, ES6:JavaScript stores strings as UTF-16 (double byte) so if you want to ignore the second byte just strip it out with a bitwise & operator on 0000000011111111 (ie 255):For supporting all UTF-16 (also non-BMP/supplementary characters) from ES6 the string.codePointAt() method is available;This method is an improved version of charCodeAt which could support only  unicode codepoints < 65536 ( 216 - a single 16bit ) .For Example Enter a Character Like A \nYou Get Ascii Code 65
