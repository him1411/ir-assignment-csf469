The default Rails 4 project generator now creates the directory "concerns" under controllers and models. I have found some explanations about how to use routing concerns, but nothing about controllers or models.I am pretty sure it has to do with the current "DCI trend" in the community and would like to give it a try.The question is, how am I supposed to use this feature, is there a convention on how to define the naming / class hierarchy in order to make it work? How can I include a concern in a model or controller?So I found it out by myself. It is actually a pretty simple but powerful concept. It has to do with code reuse as in the example below. Basically, the idea is to extract common and / or context specific chunks of code in order to clean up the models and avoid them getting too fat and messy.As an example, I\'ll put one well known pattern, the taggable pattern:So following the Product sample, you can add Taggable to any class you desire and share its functionality.This is pretty well explained by DHH:In Rails 4, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to invite programmers to use concerns with the\n  default app/models/concerns and app/controllers/concerns directories\n  that are automatically part of the load path. Together with the\n  ActiveSupport::Concern wrapper, it\xe2\x80\x99s just enough support to make this\n  light-weight factoring mechanism shine.I have been reading about using model concerns to skin-nize fat models as well as DRY up your model codes. Here is an explanation with examples:Consider a Article model, a Event model and a Comment model. An article or an event has many comments. A comment belongs to either Article or Event. Traditionally, the models may look like this:Comment Model:Article Model:Event ModelAs we can notice, there is a significant piece of code common to both Event and Article. Using concerns we can extract this common code in a separate module Commentable. For this create a commentable.rb file in app/models/concerns.And now your models look like this :Comment Model: Article Model:Event Model:Consider a Event model. A event has many attenders and comments.Typically, the event model might look like thisModels with many associations and otherwise have tendency to accumulate more and more code and become unmanageable. Concerns provide a way to skin-nize fat modules making them more modularized and easy to understand. The above model can be refactored using concerns as below:\nCreate a attendable.rb and commentable.rb file in app/models/concerns/event folderattendable.rbcommentable.rbAnd now using Concerns, your Event model reduces to * While using concerns its advisable to go for \'domain\' based grouping rather than \'technical\' grouping. Domain Based grouping is like \'Commentable\', \'Photoable\', \'Attendable\'. Technical grouping will mean \'ValidationMethods\', \'FinderMethods\' etcIt\'s worth to mention that using concerns is considered bad idea by many.Some reasons:Concerns are easy way to shoot yourself in the leg, be careful with them.This post helped me understand concerns.I felt most of the examples here demonstrating the power of module rather than how ActiveSupport::Concern adds value to module. Example 1: More readable modules.So without concerns this how a typical module will be.After refactoring with ActiveSupport::Concern.You see instance methods ,class methods and included block are less messy. Concerns will inject them appropriately for you. Thats one advantage of using ActiveSupport::Concern.Example 2: Handle module dependencies gracefully.In this example Bar is the module that Host really needs. But since Bar has dependency with Foo the Host class have to include Foo (but wait why Host want to know about Foo ? can it be avoided ?).So Bar adds dependency everywhere it goes. And order of inclusion also matters here. This adds lot of complexity/dependency to huge code base.After refactoring with ActiveSupport::ConcernNow it looks simple.If you are thinking why cant we add Foo dependency in Bar module itself ? That wont work since method_injected_by_foo_to_host_klass have to be injected in class thats including Bar not on Bar module itself.Source: Rails ActiveSupport::ConcernIn concerns make file filename.rbFor example I want in my application where attribute create_by exist update there value by 1, and 0 for updated_byafter that include in your model like this:
