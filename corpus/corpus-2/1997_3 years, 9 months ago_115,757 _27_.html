I have one simple question, that got stuck in my mind for a few days: What is VanillaJS? Some people refer to it as a framework, you can download a library from the official pages.But when I check some examples or TodoMVC, they just use classic raw JavaScript functions without even including the library from the official pages or anything. Also the link "Docs" on the official webpage leads to the Mozilla specification of JavaScript.My question is: Is VanillaJS raw JavaScript? And if yes, why people refer to it as "framework" when all you need is a browser without any special included scripts?I am sorry for a probably stupid question but I have no idea what people are talking about when they say "VanillaJS".This is VanillaJS (unmodified):As you can see, it\'s not really a framework or a library. It\'s just a running gag for framework-loving bosses or people who think you NEED to use a JS framework. It means you just use whatever your (for you own sake: non-legacy) browser gives you (using Vanilla JS when working with legacy browsers is a bad idea).Using "VanillaJS" means using plain JavaScript without any additional libraries like jQuery. People use it as a joke to remind other developers that many things can be done nowadays without the need for additional JavaScript libraries.  Here\'s a funny site that jokingly talks about this: http://vanilla-js.com/VanillaJS is a term for library/framework free javascript.  Its sometimes ironically referred to as a library, as a joke for people who could be seen as mindlessly using different frameworks, especially jQuery.Some people have gone so far to release this library, usually with an empty or comment-only js file.The plain and simple answer is yes, VanillaJS === JavaScript, as prescribed by Dr B. Eich.This is a joke for those who are excited about the JavaScript frameworks and do not know the pure Javascript.So VanillaJS is the same as pure Javascript. Vanilla in slang means:unexciting, normal, conventional, boringHere is a nice presentation on YouTube about VanillaJS: What is Vanilla JS?VanillaJS === JavaScript i.e.VanillaJS is native JavaScriptWhy,\nVanilla says it all !!!Computer software, and sometimes also other computing-related systems like computer hardware or algorithms, are called vanilla when not customized from their original form, meaning that they are used without any customization or updates applied to them (Refer this article). So Vanilla often refers to pure or plain.In the English language Vanilla has a similar meaning,\n  In information technology, vanilla (pronounced vah-NIHL-uh ) is an adjective meaning plain or basic. Or having no special or extra features, ordinary or standard.So why name it VanillaJs, As the accepted answer says some bosses want to work with a framework (because it\'s more organized and flexible and do all the things we want??) but simply javaScript will do the job.  Yet you need to add a framework somewhere. Use VanillaJs... Is it a Joke ? YESWant some fun ? \nWhere can you find it,\nhttp://vanilla-js.com/ Download and see for yourself !!!
