I am writing a quick-and-dirty script to generate plots on the fly. I am using the code below (from Matplotlib documentation) as a starting point:I don\'t want to display the plot on a GUI, instead, I want to save the plot to a file (say foo.png), so that, for example, it can be used in batch scripts. How do I do that?While the question has been answered, I\'d like to add some useful tips when using savefig. The file format can be specified by the extension:Will give a rasterized or vectorized output respectively, both which could be useful. In addition, you\'ll find that pylab leaves a generous, often undesirable, whitespace around the image. Remove it with:The solution is: As others have said, plt.savefig() or fig1.savefig() is indeed the way to save an image.However I\'ve found that in certain cases (eg. with Spyder having plt.ion(): interactive mode = On) the figure is always shown.  I work around this by forcing the closing of the figure window in my giant loop, so I don\'t have a million open figures during the loop:Just found this link on the MatPlotLib documentation addressing exactly this issue:\nhttp://matplotlib.org/faq/howto_faq.html#generate-images-without-having-a-window-appearThey say that the easiest way to prevent the figure from popping up is to use a non-interactive backend (eg. Agg), via matplotib.use(<backend>), eg:I still personally prefer using plt.close( fig ), since then you have the option to hide certain figures (during a loop), but still display figures for post-loop data processing. It is probably slower than choosing a non-interactive backend though - would be interesting if someone tested that.If you don\'t like the concept of the "current" figure, do:The other answers are correct.  However, I sometimes find that I want to open the figure object later.  For example, I might want to change the label sizes, add a grid, or do other processing.  In a perfect world, I would simply rerun the code generating the plot, and adapt the settings.  Alas, the world is not perfect.  Therefore, in addition to saving to PDF or PNG, I add:Like this, I can later load the figure object and manipulate the settings as I please.I also write out the stack with the source-code and locals() dictionary for each function/method in the stack, so that I can later tell exactly what generated the figure.NB: Be careful, as sometimes this method generates huge files.I used the following:I found very important to use plt.show after saving the figure, otherwise it won\'t work.figure exported in pngAfter using the plot() and other functions to create the content you want, you could use a clause like this to select between plotting to the screen or to file:If, like me, you use Spyder IDE, you have to disable the interactive mode with :plt.ioff()(this command is automatically launched with the scientific startup)If you want to enable it again, use :plt.ion()The Solution : If you do want to display the image as well as saving the image use:after \nimport matplotlib
