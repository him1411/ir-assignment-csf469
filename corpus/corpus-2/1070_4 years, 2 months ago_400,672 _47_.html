When I do git diff COMMIT I see the changes between that commit and HEAD (afaik) but I would like to see the changes that were made by that single commit.I haven\'t found any obvious options on diff/log that will give me that output.To see the diff for a particular  COMMIT hash:git diff COMMIT^ COMMIT will show you the difference between that COMMIT\'s ancestor and the COMMIT. See the man pages for git diff for details about the command and gitrevisions about the ^ notation and its friends.  Alternatively, git show COMMIT will do something very similar. (The commit\'s data, including its diff.) See the git show manpage.As mentioned in "Shorthand for diff of git commit with its parent?", you can also use git diff with:orWith git show, you would need (in order to focus on diff alone) to do:The COMMIT parameter is a commit-ish:A commit object or an object that can be recursively dereferenced to a commit object. The following are all commit-ishes: a commit object, a tag object that points to a commit object, a tag object that points to a tag object that points to a commit object, etc.See gitrevision "SPECIFYING REVISIONS" to reference a commit-ish.\nSee also "What does tree-ish mean in Git?".You can also try this easy way:git show shows the changes made in the most recent commit. Equivalent to git show HEAD.git show HEAD~1 takes you back 1 commit.From the man page for git-diff(1):Use the 3rd one in the middle:Also from the same man page, at the bottom, in the Examples section:Compare the version before the last commit and the last commit.Admittedly it\'s worded a little confusingly, it would be less confusing asCompare the most recent commit with the commit before it.this seems to do the job; i use it to show what has been brought in by a merge.Another possibility:git log -p COMMIT -1is also possible if you have configured your difftool.See here how to configure difftool\nOr the manual page hereAdditionally you can use git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r <commit hash> to see which files been changed/committed in a give commit hashTo see author and time by commit use git show COMMIT. Which will result in something like this:If you want to see which files had been changed, run the following with the values from the Merge line above git diff --stat a2a2894 3a1ba8f.If you want to see the actual diff, run git --stat a2a2894 3a1ba8fyou could use git diff HEAD HEAD^1 to see the diff with the parent commit.if you only wanna see the list of files, add the option --stat into it.I\'m running git version 2.6.1.windows.1 on Windows 10, so I needed a slight modification to Nevik\'s answer (tilde instead of caret):Other option is to quote the caret:first get commit id using ,git log #to list all or git log -p -1 #last one commit idcopy commit id. now we use 2 methods to list changes from specific commit,Method 1:git diff commit_id^!   #commit id something like this 1c6a6000asad012Method 2:this command will get you the git parent commit-hash after that git diff-tool <commit-hash> <parent-commit-hash>Ex: after this
