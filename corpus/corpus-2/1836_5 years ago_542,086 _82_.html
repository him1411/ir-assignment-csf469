So I\'d like to change the android:fontFamily in Android but I don\'t see any pre-defined fonts in Android. How do I select one of the pre-defined ones? I don\'t really need to define my own TypeFace but all I need is something different from what it shows right now.It seems what I did up there won\'t really work! BTW android:fontFamily="Arial" was a stupid attempt!From android 4.1 / 4.2 / 5.0, the following Roboto font families are available:in combination withthis 16 variants are possible:fonts.xmlThis is the way to set the font programmatically:put the font file in your assets folder. In my case I created a subdirectory called fonts.EDIT: If you wonder where is your assets folder see this questionI had to parse /system/etc/fonts.xml in a recent project. Here are the current font families as of Lollipop:Here is the parser (based off FontListParser):Feel free to use the above class in your project. For example, you could give your users a selection of font families and set the typeface based on their preference.A small incomplete example:Android doesn\'t allow you to set custom fonts from the XML layout. Instead, you must bundle the specific font file in your app\'s assets folder, and set it programmatically. Something like:Note that you can only run this code after setContentView() has been called. Also, only some fonts are supported by Android, and should be in a .ttf (TrueType) or .otf (OpenType) format. Even then, some fonts may not work.This is a font that definitely works on Android, and you can use this to confirm that your code is working in case your font file isn\'t supported by Android.Android O Update: This is now possible with XML in Android O, based on Roger\'s comment.It\'s the same as android:typeface.built-in fonts are:See android:typeface.To set Roboto programmatically:If you want it programatically, you could use Where SANS_SERIF you can use:And where ITALIC you can use:All is stated on Android DevelopersI am using excellent library Calligraphy by Chris Jenx designed to allow you to use custom fonts in your android application. Give it a try!What you want is not possible. You must need to set TypeFace in your Code.In XML what you can do is other then this you can not play much with the Fonts in XML. :)For Arial you need to set type face in your code.An easy way to manage the fonts would be to declare them via resources, as such:This is based on the source code here and hereI made a small library named Foundry that you can use to apply custom typefaces through XML layouts and styles.With some trial and error I learned the following.Within the *.xml you can combine the stock fonts with the following functions, not only with typeface:With this two styles, there was no need to use typeface in any other case. The range of combinations is much more bigger with fontfamily&textStyle.Starting from Android-Studio 3.0  its very easy to change font familyUsing support library 26, it will work on devices running Android API version 14 and higherCreate a folder font under res directory .Download the font which ever you want and paste it inside font folder. The structure should be some thing like belowTo Create your own font family- Right-click the font folder and go to New > Font resource file. The New Resource File window appears.- Enter the file name, and then click OK. The new font resource XML opens in the editor.Write your own font family here , for example1. To change fontfamily in layout you can write2. To Change ProgrammaticallySee the Documentation For more infoThe valid value of android:fontFamily is defined in /system/etc/system_fonts.xml(4.x) or /system/etc/fonts.xml(5.x). But Device Manufacturer might modify it, so the actual font used by setting fontFamily value depends on the above-mentioned file of the specified device.In AOSP, the Arial font is valid but must be defined using "arial" not "Arial", for example android:fontFamily="arial". Have a qucik look at Kitkat\'s system_fonts.xml//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////There are three relevant xml-attributes for defining a "font" in layout--android:fontFamily, android:typeface and android:textStyle. The combination of "fontFamily" and "textStyle" or "typeface" and "textStyle" can be used to change the appearance of font in text, so does used alone. Code snippet in TextView.java like this:From the code We can see:This is also a good library RobotoTextView. It really serves your needs.You set style in res/layout/value/style.xml like that:and to use this style in main.xml file use:Here is an easier way that can work in some cases. The principle is to add a not visible TextVview in your xml layout and to get its typeFace in the java code.The layout in the xml file:And the java code:It has worked for me (within a TextSwitcher for example).If you want to use a TextView in so many places with same font family, extend the TextView class and set your font like this:-And then use this custom class in xml for the TextView like this:-Dynamically you can set the fontfamily similar to android:fontFamily in xml by using this,These are the list of default font family used, use any of this by replacing the double quotation string "sans-serif-medium""mycustomfont.ttf" is the ttf file. Path will be in src/assets/fonts/mycustomfont.ttf , you can refer more about default font in this Default font familyHere you can see all the avaliable fontFamily values and it\'s corresponding font file\'s names(This file is using in android 5.0+). In mobile device, you can find it in:/system/etc/fonts.xml (for 5.0+)(For android 4.4 and below using this version, but I think that fonts.xml has a more clear format and easy to understand.)For example, The name attribute name="sans-serif" of family tag defined the value you can use in android:fontFamily.The font tag define the corresponded font files.In this case, you can ignore the source under <!-- fallback fonts -->, it\'s using for fonts\' fallback logic.i use Letter Press lib for my NonTextView stuff like Buttons and kianoni fontloader lib for my TextViews cause of usage of style in this lib is more easy than Letter Press for me and i got ideal feedback with that.\nthis is great for those who want to use custom font except Roboto Font.\nso it was my experience with font libs.\nfor those who want to use custom class for change font i highly recommended to create this class with this snippet}and use class like thismaybe this help.You can do it easy way by using following libraryhttps://github.com/sunnag7/FontStylerits light weight and easy to implement, just copy your fonts in asset folder and use name in xml.I just want to mention that the hell with the fonts inside Android is about to end, because this year on Google IO we finally got this -> https://developer.android.com/preview/features/working-with-fonts.htmlNow there is a new resource type a font and you can place all your application fonts inside res/fonts folder and access then with R.font.my_custom_font, just like you can access string res values, drawable res values etc. You have even chance to create font-face xml file, which is gonna be set of your custom fonts (about italic, bold and underline attr). Read the link above for more info. Let\'s see the support.
