I need to do the ssh key audit for GitHub, but I am not sure how do find my RSA key fingerprint. I originally followed a guide to do the set up on a ubuntu 10.04 box hosted by linode. What is the command I need to enter to find my current RSA key fingerprint if I am logged remotely using Putty?Run the following command to retrieve your SSH RSA fingerprint (-l means "list" instead of create a new key, -f means "filename"):So for example, on my machine the command I ran was:Concrete example (if you use an RSA public key):With newer versions of ssh-keygen, run ssh-keygen -E md5 -lf <fileName> if you want the same format as old (thanks Lloyd Dewolf)Bonus info:ssh-keygen -lf also works on known_hosts and authorized_keys files.Find most public on a Linux/Unix/OSX system with find /etc/ssh /home/*/.ssh /Users/*/.ssh -name \'*.pub\' -o -name \'authorized_keys\' -o -name \'known_hosts\' (If you want to see inside other users\' homedirs, you\'ll have to be root or sudo.)The ssh-add -l is very similar but lists the fingerprints of keys added to your agent. (OSX users take note that magic passwordless ssh via Keychain is not the same as using ssh-agent.)Additional....The newer SSH commands will list fingerprints as a SHA256 Key.For exampleIf you need to compare it against a old fingerprint you also need to specify to use the md5 fingerprint hashing function.Also available: -E sha1To see your key on Ubuntu, just enter the following command on your terminal:ssh-add -lYou will get an output like this:\n2568 0j:20:4b:88:a7:9t:wd:19:f0:d4:4y:9g:27:cf:97:23 yourName@ubuntu (RSA)If however you get an error like; Could not open a connection to your authentication agent.\nThen it means that ssh-agent is not running. You can start/run it with: \n       ssh-agent bash (thanks to @Richard in the comments) and then re-run ssh-add -lA keypair (the private & public keys) will have the same fingerprint; so in the case you can\'t remember which private key belong to which public key, find the match by comparing their fingerprints. The most voted answer by Marvin Vinto provides the fingerprint of a public ssh key file. The fingerprint of the corresponding private ssh key can also be queried, but it requires a longer series of step, as shown below.1) Load the SSH agent, if you haven\'t done so. The easiest way is to invokeor(or other shell you use).2) Load the private key you want to test:You will be asked to enter the passphrase if the key is password-protected.3) Now, as others have said, typefd:bc:... is the fingerprint you are after. If there are multiple keys, multiple lines will be printed, and the last line contains the fingerprint of the last loaded key.4) If you want to stop the agent (i.e., if you invoked step 1 above), then simply type `exit\' on the shell, and you\'ll be back on the shell prior to the loading of ssh agent.I do not add new info, but hopefully this answer is clear to users of all levels.will also work on Mac OSX 10.8-10.10On Windows, if you\'re running Putty/Pageant, the fingerprint is listed when you load your putty (.ppk) key into pageant. Pretty useful in case you forget which one you\'re using.Reproducing content from AWS forums here, because I found it useful to my use case - I wanted to check which of my keys matched ones I had imported into AWSopenssl pkey -in ~/.ssh/ec2/primary.pem -pubout -outform DER | openssl md5 -cWhere primary.pem is the private key to check.This is the shell function I use to get my ssh key finger print for creating digitalocean droplets:Put it in your ~/.bashrc, source it, and then you can get the finger print as so:If you SSH agent is running, it is:to lists RSA fingerprints of all identities, or -L for listing public keys.If your agent is not running, try:and for your public keys:If you get the message: \'The agent has no identities.\', then you have to generate your RSA key by ssh-keygen first.To check a remote SSH server prior to first connection, you can give a look at www.server-stats.net/ssh/ to see all SHH keys for the server, as well as from when key key is known.That\'s not like a SSL cert, but definitely a must-do before connecting to any SSH server for the first time.Google Compute Engine shows the SSH host key fingerprint in the serial output of a Linux instance. The API can get that data from GCE, no need to log in to the instance. I didn\'t find it anywhere else but from the serial output. I think the fingerprint should be in some more programmer-friendly place.EDIT: it seems that it depends on the type of an instance, I am using instances of Debian Wheezy f1-micro
