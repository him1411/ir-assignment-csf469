I have a string variable with content as follows:in above string i have to find a sub string i.e.How can I find it? I just need to determine whether the substring is present or not.You can use the include? method:If case is irrelevant, then a case-insensitive regular expression is a good solution:This will also work for multi-line strings.See Ruby\'s Regexp class.You can also do this...Expanding on Clint Pachl\'s answer:Regex matching in Ruby returns nil when the expression doesn\'t match. When it does, it returns the index of the character where the match happens. For exampleIt\'s important to note that in Ruby only nil and the boolean expression false evaluate to false. Everything else, including an empty array, empty hash, or the integer 0, evaluates to true.That\'s why the /foo/ example above works, and whyworks as expected. Only entering the \'true\' part of the if block if a match occurred.A more succinct idiom than the accepted answer above that\'s available in Rails (from 3.1.0 and above) is .in?.E.g:I also think it\'s more readable.c.f. http://apidock.com/rails/v3.1.0/Object/in%3FTernary wayORThis will help you check if the string contains substring or notYou can use the String Element Reference method which is []Inside the [] can either be a literal substring, an index, or a regex:Since nil is functionally the same as false and any substring returned from [] is true you can use the logic as if you use the method .include?:Just make sure you don\'t confuse an index with a sub string:You can also use a regex:
