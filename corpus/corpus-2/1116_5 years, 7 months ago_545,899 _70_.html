Is it possible to create an HTML fragment in an AngularJS controller and have this HTML shown in the view?This comes from a requirement to turn an inconsistent JSON blob into a nested list of id : value pairs. Therefore the HTML is created in the controller and I am now looking to display it.I have created a model property, but cannot render this in the view without it just printing the HTML.UpdateIt appears that the problem arises from angular rendering the created HTML as a string within quotes. Will attempt to find a way around this.Example controller :Example view :Gives :For Angular 1.x, use ng-bind-html in the HTML:At this point you would get a attempting to use an unsafe value in a safe context error so you need to either use ngSanitize or $sce to resolve that.Use $sce.trustAsHtml() in the controller to convert the html string.There are 2 steps:include the angular-sanitize.min.js resource, i.e.:\n<script src="lib/angular/angular-sanitize.min.js"></script>In a js file (controller or usually app.js), include ngSanitize, i.e.:\nangular.module(\'myApp\', [\'myApp.filters\', \'myApp.services\', \'myApp.directives\', \'ngSanitize\'])You can also create a filter like so:Then in the viewNote:  This filter trusts any and all html passed to it, and could present an XSS vulnerability if variables with user input are passed to it.Angular JS shows HTML within the tag The solution provided in the above link worked for me, none of the options on this thread did. For anyone looking for the same thing with AngularJS version 1.2.9Here\'s a copy: Ok I found solution for this:JS:HTML:EDIT:Here\'s the set up:JS file:HTML file:Fortunately, you don\'t need any fancy filters or unsafe methods to avoid that error message. This is the complete implementation to properly output HTML markup in a view in the intended and safe way.The sanitize module must be included after Angular:Then, the module must be loaded:This will allow you to include markup in a string from a controller, directive, etc:Finally, in a template, it must be output like so:Which will produce the expected output: 42 is the answer.I have tried today, the only way I found was this<div ng-bind-html-unsafe="expression"></div>ng-bind-html-unsafe no longer works.  This is the shortest way:Create a filter:And in your view:P.S. This method doesn\'t require you to include the ngSanitize module.on htmlORon controllerworks also with $scope.comment.msg = $sce.trustAsHtml(html);I found that using ng-sanitize did not allow me to add ng-click in the html.To solve this I added a directive. Like this:And this is the HTML:Good luck.Just did this using ngBindHtml by following angular(v1.4) docs,Make sure you include ngSanitize in the module\'s dependencies.\nThen it should work fine.Another solution, very similar to blrbr\'s except using a scoped attribute is:And then Note you may replace element.append() with element.replaceWith()there is one more solution for this problem using creating new attribute or directives in angular.product-specs.html app.jsindex.htmlor or https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directiveyou can also use ng-include. you can use "ng-show" to show hide this template data.As of Angular 4, this is the way that now works:Taken from this question here.See the answers I posted for you in these two locations:http://forum.ionicframework.com/t/eval-json-data-as-html/1455/6http://codepen.io/calendee/pen/DKhbcUseandFor that, you need to include angular-sanitize.js,\nfor example in your html-file with
