How do I get the delete button to show when swiping on a UITableViewCell? The event is never raised and the delete button never appears.This code shows how to implement the delete.Optionally, in your initialization override, add the line below to show the Edit button item:This answer has been updated to Swift 3I always think it is nice to have a very simple, self-contained example so that nothing is assumed when I am learning a new task. This answer is that for deleting UITableView rows. The project performs like this:This project is based on the UITableView example for Swift.Create a new project and replace the ViewController.swift code with the following.The single key method in the code above that enables row deletion is the last one. Here it is again for emphasis:Add a UITableView to the View Controller in the storyboard. Use auto layout to pin the four sides of the table view to the edges of the View Controller. Control drag from the table view in the storyboard to the @IBOutlet var tableView: UITableView! line in the code.That\'s all. You should be able to run your app now and delete rows by swiping left and tapping "Delete".Change the "Delete" button textAdd the following method:Custom button actionsAdd the following method. Note that this is only available from iOS 8. See this answer for more details.Note: I don\'t have enough reputation to post a comment in the answer from Kurbz.The answer from Kurbz is right.  But for me it never worked. After some investigation, I realized that swipe-to-delete happens when NOT editing the table view..I never seen this explicitly stated as such. Unless I\'m mistaken, I haven\'t found any other way to have it work.When you are editing, the delete and/or reorder control will show up.I had a problem which I have just managed to solve so I am sharing it as it may help someone.I have a UITableView and added the methods shown to enable swipe to delete:I am working on an update that allows me to put the table into edit mode and enables multiselect. To do that I added the code from Apple\'s TableMultiSelect sample. Once I got that working I found that my swipe the delete function had stopped working.It turns out that adding the following line to viewDidLoad was the issue:With this line in, the multiselect would work but the swipe to delete wouldn\'t. Without the line it was the other way around.The fix:Add the following method to your viewController:Then in your method that puts the table into editing mode (from a button press for example) you should use:instead of:This means that multiselect is only enabled when the table is in editing mode.In iOS 8 and Swift 2.0 please try this,Below UITableViewDataSource will help you for swipe deletearrYears is a NSMutableArray and then reload the tableViewSwift@Kurbz\'s answer is awesome, but I want to leave this note and hope this answer can save people some time.I occasionally had these lines in my controller, and they made the swiping feature not working.If you use UITableViewCellEditingStyleInsert or UITableViewCellEditingStyleNone as the editing style, then the swiping feature doesn\'t work. You can only use UITableViewCellEditingStyleDelete, which is the default style.Also, this can be achieved in SWIFT using the method as followsAll you have to do is enable these two functions:When you remove a cell of your tableview, you also have to remove your array object at index x.I think you can remove it by using a swipe gesture. \nThe table view will call the Delegate:After removing the object. You have to reload the tableview use. \nAdd the following line in your code:after that, you have deleted the row successfully. And when you reload the view or adding data to the DataSource the object will not be there anymore. For all other is the answer from Kurbz correct. I only wanted to remind you that the delegate function won\'t be enough if you want to remove the object from the DataSource array.I hope I have helped you out.I know is old question, but @Kurbz answer just need this for Xcode 6.3.2 and SDK 8.3I need add [tableView beginUpdates] and [tableView endUpdates] (thanks to @bay.phillips here)  Swift 2.2 :For Swift, Just write this code  For Objective C, Just write this code
