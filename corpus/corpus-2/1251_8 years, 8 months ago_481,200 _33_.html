When one wants to refer to some part of a webpage with the "http://example.com/#foo" method, should one useorThey both work, but are they equal, or do they have semantic differences?According to the HTML 5 specification, 5.9.8 Navigating to a fragment identifier:For HTML documents (and the text/html MIME type), the following processing model must be followed to determine what the indicated part of the document is.   So, it will look for id="foo", and then will follow to name="foo"Edit: As pointed out by @hsivonen, in HTML5 the a element has no name attribute.  However, the above rules still apply to other named elements.You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t use <h1><a name="foo"/>Foo Title</h1> in any flavor of HTML served as text/html, because the XML empty element syntax isn\xe2\x80\x99t supported in text/html. However, <h1><a name="foo">Foo Title</a></h1> is OK in HTML4. It is not valid in HTML5 as currently drafted.<h1 id="foo">Foo Title</h1> is OK in both HTML4 and HTML5. This won\xe2\x80\x99t work in Netscape 4, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll probably use a dozen other features that don\xe2\x80\x99t work in Netscape 4.I have to say if you are going to be linking to that area in the page... such as page.html#foo and Foo Title isn\'t a link you should be using:If you instead put an <a> reference around it you\'re headline will be influenced by an <a> specific CSS within your site. It\'s just extra markup, and you shouldn\'t need it. It\'d highly recommend to going with placing an id on the headline, not only is it better formed, but it will allow you to either address that object in Javascript or CSS.is what should be used. Don\'t use an anchor unless you want a link.Wikipedia makes heavy use of this feature like this:And Wikipedia is working for everybody, so I would feel safe sticking with this form.Also don\'t forget, you can use this not only with spans but with divs or even table cells, and then you have access to the :target pseudo-class on the element. Just watch out not to change the width, like with bold text, cause that moves content around, which is disturbing.Named anchors - my vote is to avoid:ID method will not work on older browsers, anchor name method will be deprecated in newer HTML versions... I\'d go with id.There\'s no semantic difference; the trend in the standards is toward the use of id rather than name. However, there are differences that may lead one to prefer name in some cases. The HTML 4.01 specification offers the following hints:Use id or name? Authors should consider the following issues when deciding whether to use id or name for an anchor name:Heads up for JavaScript users: all IDs become global variables under window.Just created the JS global:The value of window.foo will be the HTMLElement for the h1. Unless you can guarantee all values used in id attributes are safe, you may prefer sticking to name: I have a web page consisting of a number of vertically stacked div containers, identical in format and differing only in serial number. I wanted to hide the name anchor at the top of each div, so the most economical solution turned out to be including the anchor as an id within the opening div tag, i.e,Just an observation about the markup  The markup form  in prior versions of HTML provided an anchor point. The markup forms in HTML5 using the id attribute, while mostly equivalent, require an element to identify, almost all of which are normally expected to contain content. An empty span or div could be used, for instance, but this usage looks and smells degenerate. One thought is to use the wbr element for this purpose. The wbr has an empty content model and simply declares that a line break is possible; this is still a slightly gratuitous use of a markup tag, but much less so than gratuitous document divisions or empty text spans. The second sample assigns a unique ID to the element in question. This element can then be manipulated or accessed using DHTML. The first one, on the other hand, sets a named location within the document, akin to a bookmark. Attached to an "anchor", it makes perfect sense.How about using name attribute for old browsers and id attribute to the new browsers. Both options will be used and fallback method will be implemented by default!!!In html 5, the id="" attribute defines a unique identifier for an element, which is also an anchor for a fragment link.  In previous html standards, the name="" attribute of the <a> element defines an anchor for a fragment link.  I recommend something like:<a name="foo" id="foo"></a><h1>Foo Title</h1>\nBecause support for the id="" attribute is a bit spotty(even though the latest releases of all major browsers support it, the releases that don\'t aren\'t more than a few years old[And it\'s best not to break something if there isn\'t a good reason to]).\nBe sure that the name="" and id="" attributes of the <a> element are the same.  The whole "named anchor" concept uses the name attribute, by definition. You should just stick to using the name, but the ID attribute might be handy for some javascript situations.As in the comments, you could always use both to hedge your bets.
