In my current repo I have the following output:I want to delete remotes/public/master from the branch list:Also, the output of git remote is strange, since it does not list public:How can I delete \'remotes/public/master\' from the branch list?Update, tried the git push command:You might be needing a cleanupor you might be needing a prunepruneDeletes all stale tracking branches under <name>. These stale branches have already been removed from the remote repository referenced by <name>, but are still locally available in "remotes/<name>".With --dry-run option, report what branches will be pruned, but do no actually prune them.However, it appears these should have been cleaned up earlier with rmRemove the remote named <name>. All remote tracking branches and configuration settings for the remote\n             are removed.So it might be you hand-edited your config file and this did not occur, or you have privilege problems.Maybe run that again and see what happens.If you take a look in the revision logs,  you\'ll note I suggested more "correct" techniques, which for whatever reason didn\'t want to work on their repository. I suspected the OP had done something that left their tree in an inconsistent state that caused it to behave a bit strangely, and git gc was required to fix up the left behind cruft.Usually git branch -rd origin/badbranch is sufficient for nuking a local tracking branch , or git push origin :badbranch for nuking a remote branch, and usually you will never need to call git gcAll you need to do is It\'ll remove all your local branches which are remotely deleted.If you are on git 1.8.5+ you can set this automaticallyorThis would delete the remote branch named master as Kent Fredric has pointed out.To list remote-tracking branches:To delete a remote-tracking branch:All you need to do is It\'s that simple. There is no reason to call a gc here.git gc --prune=now is not what you want.  or git remote prune origin # if thats the the remote sourceis what you wantThe accepted answer didn\'t work for me when the ref was packed.  This does however:In my case I was trying to delete entries that were saved in .git/packed-refs. You can edit this plain text file and delete entries from it that git br -D doesn\'t know how to touch (At least in ver 1.7.9.5).I found this solution here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/11050880/1695680Referenced from: http://www.gitguys.com/topics/adding-and-removing-remote-branches/I had a similar problem. None of the answers helped. In my case I had two removed remote repositories showing up permanently.My last idea was to remove all references to it by hand.Lets say the repository is called \xe2\x80\x9cRepo\xe2\x80\x9d. I did:and deleted the corresponding files and directoriesThis found some text files in which I removed the corresponding lines.\nNow, everything seems to  be fine.Usually you should leave this job to git.I didn\'t know about git branch -rd, so the way I have solved issues like this for myself is to treat my repo as a remote repo and do a remote delete. git push . :refs/remotes/public/master. If the other ways don\'t work and you have some weird reference you want to get rid of, this raw way is surefire. It gives you the exact precision to remove (or create!) any kind of reference.Only slightly related, but still might be helpful in the same situation as we had - we use a network file share for our remote repository.  Last week things were working, this week we were getting the error "Remote origin did not advertise Ref for branch refs/heads/master. This Ref may not exist in the remote or may be hidden by permission settings"But we believed nothing had been done to corrupt things.  The NFS does snapshots so I reviewed each "previous version" and saw that three days ago, the size in MB of the repository had gone from 282MB to 33MB, and about 1,403 new files and 300 folders now existed.  I queried my co-workers and one had tried to do a push that day - then cancelled it.I used the "Restore" functionality to restore it to just before that date and now everythings working fine again.  I did try the prune previously, didnt seem to help.  Maybe the harsher cleanups would have worked.Hope this might help someone else one day!Jay
