I have a git repository with multiple branches. How can I know which branches are already merged into the master branch?git branch --merged master lists branches merged into mastergit branch --merged lists branches merged into HEAD (i.e. tip of current branch)git branch --no-merged lists branches that have not been mergedBy default this applies to only the local branches.  The -a flag will show both local and remote branches, and the -r flag shows only the remote branches.You can use the git merge-base command to find the latest common commit between the two branches. If that commit is the same as your branch head, then the branch has been completely merged.Note that git branch -d does this sort of thing already because it will refuse to delete a branch that hasn\'t already been completely merged.There is a graphical interface solution as well. Just typegitk --allA new application window will prompt with a graphical representation of your whole repo, where it is very easy to realize if a branch was already merged or notOn the topic of cleaning up remote branchesThis lists each remote branch followed by which remote branches their latest SHAs are within.This is useful to discern which remote branches have been merged but not deleted, and which haven\'t been merged and thus are decaying.If you\'re using \'tig\' (its like gitk but terminal based) then you can to see a branch\'s commit history without having to git checkoutUse git merge-base <commit> <commit>. This command finds best common ancestor(s) between two commits. And if the common ancestor is identical to the last commit of a "branch" ,then we can safely assume that that a "branch" has been already merged into the master.Here are the stepsMore info on git merge-base https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge-base. Here are my techniques when I need to figure out if a branch has been merged, even if it may have been rebased to be up to date with our main branch, which is a common scenario for feature branches.Neither of these approaches are fool proof, but I\'ve found them useful many times.Using a visual tool like gitk or TortoiseGit, or simply git log with --all, go through the history to see all the merges to the main branch. You should be able to spot if this particular feature branch has been merged or not.If you have a good habit of always removing both the local and the remote branch when you merge in a feature branch, then you can simply update and prune remotes on your other computer and the feature branches will disappear.To help remember doing this, I\'m already using git flow extensions (AVH edition) to create and merge my feature branches locally, so I added the following git flow hook to ask me if I also want to auto-remove the remote branch.Example create/finish feature branch.git/hooks/post-flow-feature-finish If you do not always remove the remote branch, you can still search for similar commits to determine if the branch has been merged or not. The pitfall here is if the remote branch has been rebased to the unrecognizable, such as squashing commits or changing commit messages.Example commands on master branch:In my bash .profile config
