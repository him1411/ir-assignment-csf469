Maven2 is driving me crazy during the experimentation / quick and dirty mock-up phase of development.  I have a pom.xml file that defines the dependencies for the web-app framework I want to use, and I can quickly generate starter projects from that file. However, sometimes I want to link to a 3rd party library that doesn\'t already have a pom.xml file defined, so rather than create the pom.xml file for the 3rd party lib by hand and install it, and add the dependency to my pom.xml, I would just like to tell Maven: "In addition to my defined dependencies, include any jars that are in /lib too."  It seems like this ought to be simple, but if it is, I am missing something.Any pointers on how to do this are greatly appreciated. Short of that, if there is a simple way to point maven to a /lib directory and easily create a pom.xml with all the enclosed jars mapped to a single dependency which I could then name / install and link to in one fell swoop would also suffice.Most of the answers you\'ll find around the internet will suggest you to either install the dependency to your local repository or specify a "system" scope in the pom and distribute the dependency with the source of your project. But both of these solutions are actually flawed.When you install a dependency to your local repository it remains there. Your distribution artifact will do fine as long as it has access to this repository. The problem is in most cases this repository will reside on your local machine, so there\'ll be no way to resolve this dependency on any other machine. Clearly making your artifact depend on a specific machine is not a way to handle things. Otherwise this dependency will have to be locally installed on every machine working with that project which is not any better.The jars you depend on with the "System Scope" approach neither get installed to any repository or attached to your target packages. That\'s why your distribution package won\'t have a way to resolve that dependency when used. That I believe was the reason why the use of system scope even got deprecated. Anyway you don\'t want to rely on a deprecated feature.After putting this in your pom:for each artifact with a group id of form x.y.z Maven will include the following location inside your project dir in its search for artifacts:To elaborate more on this you can read this blog post.Instead of creating this structure by hand I recommend to use a Maven plugin to install your jars as artifacts. So, to install an artifact to an in-project repository under repo folder execute:If you\'ll choose this approach you\'ll be able to simplify the repository declaration in pom to:Since executing installation command for each lib is kinda annoying and definitely error prone, I\'ve created a utility script which automatically installs all the jars from a lib folder to a project repository, while automatically resolving all metadata (groupId, artifactId and etc.) from names of files. The script also prints out the dependencies xml for you to copy-paste in your pom.When you\'ll have your in-project repository created you\'ll have solved a problem of distributing the dependencies of the project with its source, but since then your project\'s target artifact will depend on non-published jars, so when you\'ll install it to a repository it will have unresolvable dependencies. To beat this problem I suggest to include these dependencies in your target package. This you can do with either the Assembly Plugin or better with the OneJar Plugin. The official documentaion on OneJar is easy to grasp.For throw away code onlyset scope == system and just make up a groupId, artifactId, and versionNote: system dependencies are not copied into resulted jar/war\n(see How to include system dependencies in war built using maven)You may create local repository on your projectFor example if you have libs folder in project structureIn libs folder you should create directory structure like: /groupId/artifactId/version/artifactId-version.jarIn your pom.xml you should register repositoryand add dependency as usualThat is all.For detailed information: How to add external libraries in MavenNote: When using the System scope (as mentioned on this page), Maven needs absolute paths.If your jars are under your project\'s root, you\'ll want to prefix your systemPath values with ${basedir}.You really ought to get a framework in place via a repository and identifying your dependencies up front. Using the system scope is a common mistake people use, because they "don\'t care about the dependency management." The trouble is that doing this you end up with a perverted maven build that will not show maven in a normal condition. You would be better off following an approach like this.Maven install plugin has command line usage to install a jar into the local repository, POM is optional but you will have to specify the GroupId, ArtifactId, Version and Packaging (all the POM stuff).This is what I have done, it also works around the package issue and it works with checked out code.I created a new folder in the project in my case I used repo, but feel free to use src/repoIn my POM I had a dependency that is not in any public maven repositoriesI then created the following directories repo/com/dovetail/zoslog4j/1.0.1 and copied the JAR file into that folder.I created the following POM file to represent the downloaded file (this step is optional, but it removes a WARNING) and helps the next guy figure out where I got the file to begin with.Two optional files I create are the SHA1 checksums for the POM and the JAR to remove the missing checksum warnings.Finally I add the following fragment to my pom.xml that allows me to refer to the local repositoryThis is how we add or install a local jari gave some default groupId and artifactId because they are mandatory :)Using <scope>system</scope> is a terrible idea for reasons explained by others, installing the file manually to your local repository makes the build unreproducible, and using <url>file://${project.basedir}/repo</url> is not a good idea either because (1) that may not be a well-formed file URL (e.g. if the project is checked out in a directory with unusual characters), (2) the result is unusable if this project\xe2\x80\x99s POM is used as a dependency of someone else\xe2\x80\x99s project.Assuming you are unwilling to upload the artifact to a public repository, Simeon\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion of a helper module does the job. But there is an easier way now\xe2\x80\xa6Use non-maven-jar-maven-plugin. Does exactly what you were asking for, with none of the drawbacks of the other approaches.I found another way to do this, see here from a Heroku postTo summarize (sorry about some copy & paste)After having really long discussion with CloudBees guys about properly maven packaging of such kind of JARs, they made an interesting good proposal for a solution:Creation of a fake Maven project which attaches a pre-existing JAR as a primary artifact, running into belonged POM install:install-file execution. Here is an example of such kinf of POM: But in order to implement it, existing project structure should be changed. First, you should have in mind that for each such kind of JAR there should be created different fake Maven project (module). And there should be created a parent Maven project including all sub-modules which are : all JAR wrappers and existing main project. The structure could be : root project (this contains the parent POM file includes all sub-modules with module XML element) (POM packaging)JAR 1 wrapper Maven child project (POM packaging)JAR 2 wrapper Maven child project (POM packaging)main existing Maven child project (WAR, JAR, EAR .... packaging)When parent running via mvn:install or mvn:packaging is forced and sub-modules will be executed. That could be concerned as a minus here, since project structure should be changed, but offers a non static solution at the endThe problem with systemPath is that the dependencies\' jars won\'t get distributed along your artifacts as transitive dependencies. Try what I\'ve posted here: Is it best to Mavenize your project jar files or put them in WEB-INF/lib?Then declare dependencies as usual.And please read the footer note.If you want a quick and dirty solution, you can do the following (though I do not recommend this for anything except test projects, maven will complain in length that this is not proper).Add a dependency entry for each jar file you need, preferably with a perl script or something similar and copy/paste that into your pom file.What seems simplest to me is just configure your maven-compiler-plugin to include your custom jars. This example will load any jar files in a lib directory. A strange solution I found: using Eclipse cheers,\nBalintEven though it does not exactly fit to your problem, I\'ll drop this here. My requirements were:Let\'s talk about (3) first: Just having the jars in a folder and somehow merging them into the final jar will not work for here, since the IDE will not understand this. This means all libraries have to be installed properly. However, I dont want to have everyone installing it using "mvn install-file".In my project I needed metawidget. Here we go:Every time you have a new library, just add a new execution and tell everyone to build the project again (you can improve this process with project hierachies).A quick&dirty batch solution (based on Alex\'s answer):libs.batExecute it like this: libs.bat > libs.txt.\nThen open libs.txt and copy its content as dependencies.In my case, I only needed the libraries to compile my code, and this solution was the best for that purpose.To install the 3rd party jar which is not in maven repository use maven-install-plugin.Below are steps:mvn install:install-file -Dfile= -DgroupId=\n  -DartifactId= -Dversion= -Dpackaging=Below is the e.g one I used it for simonsite log4jmvn install:install-file\n  -Dfile=/Users/athanka/git/MyProject/repo/log4j-rolling-appender.jar -DgroupId=uk.org.simonsite -DartifactId=log4j-rolling-appender -Dversion=20150607-2059 -Dpackaging=jarIn the pom.xml include the dependency as belowRun the mvn clean install command to create your packagingBelow is the reference link:https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-3rd-party-jars-local.htmlFor those that didn\'t find a good answer here, this is what we are doing to get a jar with all the necessary dependencies in it. This answer (https://stackoverflow.com/a/7623805/1084306) mentions to use the Maven Assembly plugin but doesn\'t actually give an example in the answer. And if you don\'t read all the way to the end of the answer (it\'s pretty lengthy), you may miss it. Adding the below to your pom.xml will generate target/${PROJECT_NAME}-${VERSION}-jar-with-dependencies.jarThis doesn\'t answer how to add them to your POM, and may be a no brainer, but would just adding the lib dir to your classpath work? I know that is what I do when I need an external jar that I don\'t want to add to my Maven repos. Hope this helps.What works in our project is what Archimedes Trajano wrote, but we had in our .m2/settings.xml something like this:and the * should be changed to central. So if his answer doesn\'t work for you, you should check your settings.xmlI alluded to some python code in a comment to the answer from @alex lehmann\'s , so am posting it here.I just wanted a quick and dirty workaround... I couldn\'t run the script from Nikita Volkov: syntax error + it requires a strict format for the jar names.I made this Perl script which works with whatever format for the jar file names, and it generates the dependencies in an xml so it can be copy pasted directly in a pom.If you want to use it, make sure you understand what the script is doing, you may need to change the lib folder and the value for the groupId or artifactId...
