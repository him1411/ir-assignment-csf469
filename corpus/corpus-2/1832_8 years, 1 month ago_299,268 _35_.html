How do you obtain the clicked mouse button using jQuery?this is triggered by both right and left click, what is the way of being able to catch right mouse click? I\'d be happy if something like below exists:As of jQuery version 1.1.3, event.which normalizes event.keyCode and event.charCode so you don\'t have to worry about browser compatibility issues. Documentation on event.whichevent.which will give 1, 2 or 3 for left, middle and right mouse buttons respectively so:Edit: I changed it to work for dynamically added elements using .on() in jQuery 1.7 or above:Demo: jsfiddle.net/Kn9s7/5[Start of original post] This is what worked for me:In case you are into multiple solutions ^^Edit: Tim Down brings up a good point that it\'s not always going to be a right-click that fires the contextmenu event, but also when the context menu key is pressed (which is arguably a replacement for a right-click)You can easily tell which mouse button was pressed by checking the which property of the event object on mouse events:You can also bind to contextmenu and return false:Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/maniator/WS9S2/Or you can make a quick plugin that does the same:Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/maniator/WS9S2/2/Using .on(...) jQuery >= 1.7:Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/maniator/WS9S2/283/ http://jsfiddle.net/SRX3y/8/There are a lot of very good answers, but I just want to touch on one major difference between IE9 and IE < 9 when using event.button.According to the old Microsoft specification for event.button the codes differ from the ones used by W3C. W3C considers only 3 cases: In older Internet Explorers however Microsoft are flipping a bit for the pressed button and there are 8 cases:Despite the fact that this is theoretically how it should work, no Internet Explorer has ever supported the cases of two or three buttons simultaneously pressed. I am mentioning it because the W3C standard cannot even theoretically support this.It seems to me that a slight adaptation of TheVillageIdiot\'s answer would be cleaner:EDIT: JQuery provides an e.which attribute, returning 1, 2, 3 for left, middle, and right click respectively. So you could also use if (e.which == 3) { alert("right click"); }See also: answers to "Triggering onclick event using middle click"event.which === 1 ensures it\'s a left-click (when using jQuery).But you should also think about modifier keys: ctrlcmdshiftaltIf you\'re only interested in catching simple, unmodified left-clicks, you can do something like this:If you are looking for "Better Javascript Mouse Events" which allow forHave a look at this cross browser normal javascript which triggers the above events, and removes the headache work. Just copy and paste it into the head of your script, or include it in a file in the <head> of your document. Then bind your events, refer to the next code block below which shows a jquery example of capturing the events and firing the functions assigned to them, though this works with normal javascript binding as well.If your interested in seeing it work, have a look at the jsFiddle:  https://jsfiddle.net/BNefn/Better Mouse Click Events Example (uses jquery for simplicity, but the above will work cross browser and fire the same event names, IE uses on before the names)And for those who are in need of the minified version...With jquery you can use event object typethere is also a way, to do it without JQuery!check out this:
