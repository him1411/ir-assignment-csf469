After experimenting with composite operations and drawing images on the canvas I\'m now trying to remove images and compositing. How do I do this?I need to clear the canvas for redrawing other images; this can go on for a while so I don\'t think drawing a new rectangle every time will be the most efficient option.This is the fastest and most descriptive way to clear the entire canvas.Resetting canvas.width resets all canvas state (e.g. transformations, lineWidth, strokeStyle, etc.), it is very slow (compared to clearRect), it doesn\'t work in all browsers, and it doesn\'t describe what you are actually trying to do.If you have modified the transformation matrix (e.g. using scale, rotate, or translate) then context.clearRect(0,0,canvas.width,canvas.height) will likely not clear the entire visible portion of the canvas.The solution? Reset the transformation matrix prior to clearing the canvas:Edit:\nI\'ve just done some profiling and (in Chrome) it is about 10% faster to clear a 300x150 (default size) canvas without resetting the transform. As the size of your canvas increases this difference drops.That is already relatively insignificant, but in most cases you will be drawing considerably more than you are clearing and I believe this performance difference be irrelevant.If you are drawing lines, make sure you don\'t forget:Otherwise the lines won\'t get cleared.Others have already done an excellent job answering the question but if a simple clear() method on the context object would be useful to you (it was to me), this is the implementation I use based on answers here:Usage:So if you have a canvas and context created like this:You can use a method like this:Use clearRect method by passing x,y co-ordinates and height and width of canvas. ClearRect will clear whole canvas as : there are a ton of good answers here.\none further note is that sometimes it\'s fun to only partially clear the canvas.\nthat is, "fade out" the previous image instead of erasing it entirely.\nthis can give nice trails effects.it\'s easy. supposing your background color is white:This worked for my pieChart in chart.js        in webkit you need to set the width to a different value, then you can set it back to the initial valueI have found that in all browsers I test, the fastest way is to actually fillRect with white, or whataever color you would like.  I have a very large monitor and in full screen mode the clearRect is agonizingly slow, but the fillRect is reasonable.The drawback is that the canvas is no longer transparent.fastest way:These are all great examples of how you clear a standard canvas, but if you are using paperjs, then this will work:Define a global variable in JavaScript:From your PaperScript define:Now wherever you set clearCanvas to true, it will clear all the items from the screen.fill the given rectangle with RGBA values  :\n0 0 0 0 : with Chrome\n0 0 0 255 : with FF & SafariBut  let the rectangle filled with\n0 0 0 255\nno matter the browser !If you use clearRect only, if you have it in a form to submit your drawing, you\'ll get a submit instead the clearing, or maybe it can be cleared first and then upload a void drawing, so you\'ll need to add a preventDefault at the beggining of the function:Hope it helps someone.A simple, but not very readable way is to write this:
