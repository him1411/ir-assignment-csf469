Is there a way to call a block with a primitive parameter after a delay, like using performSelector:withObject:afterDelay: but with an argument like int/double/float?I think you\'re looking for dispatch_after().  It requires your block to accept no parameters, but you can just let the block capture those variables from your local scope instead.More: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/1452876-dispatch_afterYou can use dispatch_after to call a block later. In Xcode, start typing dispatch_after and hit Enter to autocomplete to the following:Here\'s an example with two floats as "arguments." You don\'t have to rely on any type of macro, and the intent of the code is quite clear: How about using Xcode built-in code snippet library?Update for Swift:Many up votes inspired me to update this answer.The build-in Xcode code snippet library has dispatch_after for only objective-c language. People can also create their own Custom Code Snippet for Swift.  Write this in Xcode. Drag this code and drop it in the code snippet library area.\nBottom of the code snippet list, there will be a new entity named My Code Snippet. Edit this for a title. For suggestion as you type in the Xcode fill in the Completion Shortcut.For more info see CreatingaCustomCodeSnippet.Drag this code and drop it in the code snippet library area. Expanding on Jaime Cham\'s answer I created a NSObject+Blocks category as below.  I felt these methods better matched the existing performSelector: NSObject methods NSObject+Blocks.hNSObject+Blocks.mand use like so:For Swift I\'ve created a global function, nothing special, using the dispatch_after method. I like this more as it\'s readable and easy to use:Which you can use as followed:Perhaps simpler than going thru GCD, in a class somewhere (e.g. "Util"), or a Category on Object:So to use:Here are my 2 cents = 5 methods ;) I like encapsulate these details and have AppCode tell me how to finish my sentences. PerformSelector:WithObject always takes an object, so in order to pass arguments like int/double/float etc..... You can use something like this.//NSNumber is an object..Same way you can use [NSNumber numberWithInt:] etc.... and in the receiving method you can convert the number into your format as [number int] or [number double].The dispatch_after function dispatches a block object to a dispatch queue after a given period of time. Use below code to perform some UI related taks after 2.0 seconds.In swift 3.0 :Here\'s the Swift 3 way to queue work after a delay.There\'s a nice one in the BlocksKit framework.BlocksKit(and the class)BBlocksKit.mHere\'s a handy helper to prevent making the annoying GCD call over and over again:Now you simply delay your code on the Main thread like this:If you want to delay your code to different thread:If you prefer a Framework that also has some more handy features then checkout HandySwift. You can add it to your project via Carthage then use it exactly like in the examples above:You can either wrap the argument in your own class, or wrap the method call in a method that doesn\'t need to be passed in the primitive type. Then call that method after your delay, and within that method perform the selector you wish to perform.Here is how you can trigger a block after a delay in Swift:Its included as a standard function in my repo.I believe the author is not asking how to wait for a fractional time (delay), but instead how to pass a scalar as argument of the selector (withObject:) and the fastest way in modern objective C is:your selector have to change its parameter to NSNumber, and retrieve the value using a selector like floatValue or doubleValueIn swift 3, We can simply use  DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter function to trigger any function or action after the delay of \'n\' seconds. Here in code we have set delay after 1 second. You call any function inside the body of this function which will trigger after the delay of 1 second.\n    `Swift 3 & Xcode 8.3.2This code will help you, i add an explanation too
