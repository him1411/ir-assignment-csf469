How can I create static variables in Javascript?If you come from a class-based, strongly typed object-oriented language (like Java, C++ or C#) I assume that you are trying to create a variable or method associated to a "type" but not to an instance.An example using a "classical" approach, with constructor functions maybe could help you to catch the concepts of basic OO JavaScript:staticProperty is defined in the MyClass object (which is a function) and has nothing to do with its created instances, JavaScript treats functions as first-class objects, so being an object, you can assign properties to a function.You might take advantage of the fact that JS functions are also objects -- which means they can have properties.For instance, quoting the example given on the (now vanished) article Static variables in Javascript:If you call that function several time, you\'ll see the counter is being incremented.And this is probably a much better solution than poluting the global namespace with a global variable.\nAnd here is another possible solution, based on a closure : Trick to use static variables in javascript : Which gets you the same kind of result -- except, this time, the incremented value is returned, instead of displayed.You do it through an IIFE (immediately invoked function expression):you can use arguments.callee to store "static" variables (this is useful in anonymous function too):I\'ve seen a couple of similar answers, but I\'d like to mention that this post describes it best, so I\'d like to share it with you.Here\'s some code taken from it, which I have modified to get a complete example which hopefully gives benefit to the community because it can be used as a design template for classes. It also answers your question:Given that example, you can access the static properties/function as follows:And the object properties/functions simply as:Note that in podcast.immutableProp(), we have a closure: The reference to _somePrivateVariable is kept inside the function.You can even define getters and setters. Take a look at this code snippet (where d is the object\'s prototype for which you want to declare a property, y is a private variable not visible outside of the constructor):It defines the property d.year via get and set functions - if you don\'t specify set, then the property is read-only and cannot be modified (be aware you will not get an error if you try to set it, but it has no effect). Each property has the attributes writable, configurable (allow to change after declaration) and enumerable (allow to use it as enumerator), which are per default false. You can set them via defineProperty in the 3rd parameter, e.g. enumerable: true.What is also valid is this syntax:which defines a readable/writable property a, a readonly property b and a write-only property c, through which property a can be accessed. Usage:Notes: To avoid unexpected behaviour in case you\'ve forgotten the new keyword, I suggest that you add the following to the function Podcast:Now both of the following instantiations will work as expected:The \'new\' statement creates a new object and copies all properties and methods, i.e.Note also, that in some situations it can be useful to use the return statement in the constructor function Podcast to return a custom object protecting functions the class internally relies on but which need to be exposed. This is explained further in chapter 2 (Objects) of the article series.You can say that a and b inherit from Podcast. Now, what if you want to add a method to Podcast that applies to all of them after a and b have been instanciated? In this case, use the .prototype as follows:Now call a and b again:You can find more details about prototypes here. If you want to do more inheritance, I suggest looking into this.The article series I\'ve mentioned above are highly recommended to read, they include also the following topics:Note that the automatic semicolon insertion "feature" of JavaScript (as mentioned in 6.) is very often responsible for causing strange issues in your code. Hence, I would rather regard it as a bug than as a feature.If you want to read more, here is a quite interesting MSDN article about these topics, some of them described there provide even more details.What is interesting to read as well (also covering the topics mentioned above) are those articles from the MDN JavaScript Guide:Those of you who are working with IE (which has no console for JavaScript unless you open the developer tools using F12 and open the console tab) might find the following snippet useful. It allows you to use console.log(msg); as used in the examples above. Just insert it before the Podcast function.For your convenience, here\'s the code above in one complete single code snippet:Updated answer:In ECMAScript 6, you can create static functions using the static keyword:ES6 classes don\'t introduce any new semantics for statics. You can do the same thing in ES5 like this:You can assign to a property of Foo because in JavaScript functions are objects.The following example and explanation are from the book Professional JavaScript for Web Developers 2nd Edition by Nicholas Zakas. This is the answer I was looking for so I thought it would be helpful to add it here.The Person constructor in this example has access to the private variable name, as do the getName() and setName() methods. Using this pattern, the name variable becomes static and will be used among all instances. This means calling setName() on one instance affects all other instances. Calling setName() or creating a new Person instance sets the name variable to a new value. This causes all instances to return the same value.If you want to declare static variables for creating constants in your application then I found following as most simplistic approachThere are other similar answers, but none of them quite appealed to me. Here\'s what I ended up with:If you are using the new class syntax then you can now do the following:This effectively creates a static variable in JavaScript.If you wanted to make a global static variable:Replace the variable with the below:You can create a static variable in JavaScript like this below. Here count is the static variable.You can assign values to the static variable using either the Person function, or any of the instances:About the class introduced by ECMAScript 2015. The other answers are not totally clear.Here is an example showing how to create a static var staticVar with the ClassName.var synthax:To access the static variable we use the .constructor property that returns a reference to the object constructor function that created the class.\nWe can call it on the two created instances:The closest thing in JavaScript to a static variable is a global variable - this is simply a variable declared outside the scope of a function or object literal:The other thing you could do would be to store global variables inside an object literal like this:And then access the variabels like this: foo.bar.There\'s another approach, which solved my requirements after browsing this thread. It depends on exactly what you want to achieve with a "static variable".The global property sessionStorage or localStorage allows data to be stored for the life of the session, or for an indefinite longer period until explicitly cleared, respectively. This allows data to be shared among all windows, frames, tab panels, popups etc of your page/app and is much more powerful than a simple "static/global variable" in one code segment.It avoids all hassle with the scope, lifetime, semantics, dynamics etc of top-level global variables, ie Window.myglobal. Don\'t know how efficient it is, but that\'s not important for modest amounts of data, accessed at modest rates.Easily accessed as "sessionStorage.mydata = anything" and retrieved similarly.

Example:The value of x is incremented by 1 every 1000 milliseconds\nIt will print 1,2,3 so forthSource :- staticThe static keyword defines a static method for a class.Syntaxstatic methodName() { ... }DescriptionStatic method calls are made directly on the class and are not callable on instances of the class. Static methods are often used to create utility functions.Window level vars are sorta like statics in the sense that you can use direct reference and these are available to all parts of your appThere is no such thing as an static variable in Javascript. This language is prototype-based object orientated, so there are no classes, but prototypes from where objects "copy" themselves.You may simulate them with global variables or with prototyping (adding a property to the prototype):Working with MVC websites that use jQuery, I like to make sure AJAX actions within certain event handlers can only be executed once the previous request has completed. I use a "static" jqXHR object variable to achieve this.Given the following button:I generally use an IIFE like this for my click handler:If you want to use prototype then there is a wayDoing this you will be able to access the counter variable from any instance and any change in the property will be immediately reflected!!So what I see with the other answers is that they don\'t address the fundamental architectural requirement of a static attribute in object oriented programming. Object oriented programming actually has two different styles one is \'class based\' (C++, C#, Java etc), the other is \'prototypal\' (Javascript). In class based languages a \'static attribute\' is supposed to be associated with the class and not the instantiated objects. This concept actually works much more intuitively in a prototypal languages like Javascript because you just assign the attribute as a value of the parent prototype like so.And access it from every one of the objects that is instantiated from this constructor like so...Now if you go ahead and change the MyObject.prototype.staticAttribute the change will cascade down to the child objects that immediately inherit it. However there are a few \'gotchas\' that could significantly undermine the \'static\' nature of this attribute, or just leave security vulnerability... First make sure to hide the constructor from the Global namespace by enclosing it inside another function like the jQuery ready methodSecond and lastly, even if you do this, the attribute is still editable from any of the other parts of your own script, so it could be the case that a bug in your code writes over the attribute on one of the child objects and detaches it from the parent prototype, so if you change the parent attribute it will no longer cascade and change the static attribute for the child object. See this jsfiddle. In different scenarios we could either Object.freeze(obj) to stop any changes to the child object, or we could set up a setter and getter method in the constructor and access a closure, both of these have associated complexities.It seems to me that there is not a perfect analogue between the class-based idea of a \'static attribute\' and this Javascript implementation. So I think it might be better in the long run to use a different code pattern that is more Javascript friendly. Such as a central datastore or cache or even a dedicated helper object to hold all the necessary static variables. I didn\'t see this idea in any of the answers so just adding it to the list. If it\'s a duplicate just let me know and i\'ll delete it and upvote the other.I created a sort of super global in my website. Since I have several js files that are loaded on every page load and dozens of other js files that are only loaded on some pages I put all of the "global" function into a single global variable.At the top of my first included "global" files is the declarationThen I delcare several global helper functionsThen if I need a static variable I just store it outside scope such as outside the document ready or outside the behavior attachment. (I use jquery but it should work in javascript)This of course is a global not a static but as it is reinitialized on every page load it accomplishes the same purpose.In JavaScript, there is no term or keyword static, but we can put such data directly into function object (like in any other object).For private static variables, I found this way:Try this one:If we define a property and override its getters and setters to use the Function Object property then in theory you can have an static variable in javascriptfor example:In JavaScript everything is either a primitive type or an object.\nFunctions are objects — (key value pairs). When you create a function you create two objects. One object that represents the function itself and the other that represents the prototype of the function. Function is basically in that sense an object with the properties:So where to set the static property:\nTwo places, either inside the function object or inside the function prototype object. Here is a snippet that creates that end even instantiates two instances, using the new JavaScript keyword.The main idea is that instances i1 and i2 are using the same static properties.There are two main things to note, In EcmaScript 5 specificationLets take this function/class called Foo and try to set a static variable to it.According to the 2nd points I mentioned earlier class is a function in JavaScript.\nIf we want to create a new instance (object) of this class/function, We use it like this.But because we need to create a static variable (function/class level variable) the variable directly needs to bind to the Foo functionThere are three ways of doing thisFoo.staticVariableName = \'staticValue\';Foo.__proto__.staticVariableName = \'staticValue\';Foo.constructor.prototype.staticVariableName = \'staticValue\';In above ways you can simply access Foo.staticVariableName.Note: Don\'t directly bind the staticVariable to the prototype object in Foo functionThen this staticVariableName will be only available when you create a new Foo function objectTo understand how this __proto__ linking work you can refer this diagram JavaScript Prototype Chain Diagram
