I want to update a column in a table making a join on other table e.g.:But it is complaining :Msg 170, Level 15, State 1, Line 2\n   Line 2: Incorrect syntax near \'a\'.What is wrong here?You don\'t quite have SQL Server\'s proprietary UPDATE FROM syntax down. Also not sure why you needed to join on the CommonField and also filter on it afterward.  Try this:If you\'re doing something really silly - like constantly trying to set the value of one column to the aggregate of another column (which violates the principle of avoiding storing redundant data), you can use a CTE (common table expression):The reason this is really silly, is that you\'re going to have to re-run this entire update every single time any row in table2 changes. A SUM is something you can always calculate at runtime and, in doing so, never have to worry that the result is stale.Try it like this:(edit: darn typos!)Answer given above by Aaron is perfect:Just want to add why this problem occurs in SQL Server when we try to use alias of a table while updating that table, below mention syntax will always give error:case can be any if you are updating a single table or updating while using join.Although above query will work fine in PL/SQL but not in SQL Server.Correct way to update a table while using table alias in SQL Server is:Hope it will help everybody why error came here.Seems like SQL Server 2012 can handle the old update syntax of Teradata too:If I remember correctly, 2008R2 was giving error when I tried similar query.I find it useful to turn an UPDATE into a SELECT to get the rows I want to update as a test before updating. If I can select the exact rows I want, I can update just those rows I want to update.Another approach would be to use MERGE -Merge is part of the SQL Standard-Also I\'m pretty sure inner join updates are non deterministic..\nSimilar question here where the answer talks about that\nhttp://ask.sqlservercentral.com/questions/19089/updating-two-tables-using-single-query.htmlMore alternatives here: http://www.karlrixon.co.uk/writing/update-multiple-rows-with-different-values-and-a-single-sql-query/Try:
