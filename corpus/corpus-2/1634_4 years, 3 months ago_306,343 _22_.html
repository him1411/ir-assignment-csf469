I installed expressjs with the following command:I have the following warning:Im new to nodejs and expressjs. Why I have the above warnings? Should I be worried?It\'s just a check as of NPM v1.2.20, they report this as a warning.However, don\'t worry, there are sooooooo many packages which still don\'t have the repository field in their package.json.  The field is used for informational purposes.In the case you\'re a package author, put the repository in your package.json, like this:Read more about the repository field, and see the logged bug for further details.Additionally, as originally reported by @dan_nl, you can set private key in your package.json.\nThis will not only stop you from accidentally running npm publish in your app, but will also stop NPM from printing warnings regarding package.json problems.you can also mark the application as private if you don\xe2\x80\x99t plan to put it in an actual repository.As dan_nl stated, you can add a private fake repository in package.json. You don\'t even need name and version for it:Better still: Set the private flag directly. This way npm doesn\'t ask for a README file either:If you are getting this from your own package.json, just add the repository field to it.  (use the link to your actual repository):Have you run npm init? That command runs you through everything...Yes, probably you can re/create one by including -f at the end of your commandthis will help all of you to find your own correct details use this will then show the correct info so you don\'t guess the version file location etcenjoy :)In Simple word-\npackage.json of your project has not property of repository \nyou must have to add it,and you have to add repository in your package.json like below and Let me explain according to your scenarioyou must have to add repository field something like below
