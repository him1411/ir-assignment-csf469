Let\'s say I have a file called app.js. Pretty simple:What if I have a functions inside "tools.js".  How would I import them to use in apps.js?Or...am I supposed to turn "tools" into a module, and then require it? << seems hard, I rather do the basic import of the tools.js file.You can require any js file, you just need to declare what you want to expose.And in your app file:If, despite all the other answers, you still want to traditionally include a file in a node.js source file, you can use this:Please note that in most cases this is bad practice and you should instead write a module. However, there are rare situations, where pollution of your local context/namespace is what you really want.Please also note this won\'t work with "use strict"; (when you are in "strict mode") because functions and variables defined in the "imported" file can\'t be accessed by the code that does the import. Strict mode enforces some rules defined by newer versions of the language standard. This may be another reason to avoid the solution described here.You need no new functions nor new modules.\nYou simply need to execute the module you\'re calling if you don\'t want to use namespace.or in any other .js like myController.js :instead ofvar tools = require(\'tools.js\') which force us to use a namespace and call tools like tools.sum(1,2);we can simply calland thenin my case I have a file with controllers ctrls.jsand I can use Categories in every context as public class after require(\'ctrls.js\')()Here is a plain and simple explanation:I was also looking for a NodeJS \'include\' function and I checked the solution proposed by Udo G - see message https://stackoverflow.com/a/8744519/2979590. His code doesn\'t work with my included JS files.\nFinally I solved the problem like that:Sure, that helps.The vm module in Node.js provides the ability to execute JavaScript code within the current context (including global object).  See http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/vm.html#vm_vm_runinthiscontext_code_filenameNote that, as of today, there\'s a bug in the vm module that prevenst runInThisContext from doing the right when invoked from a new context.  This only matters if your main program executes code within a new context and then that code calls runInThisContext.  See https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/898Sadly, the with(global) approach that Fernando suggested doesn\'t work for named functions like "function foo() {}"In short, here\'s an include() function that works for me:say we wants to call function ping() and add(30,20) which is in lib.js file \nfrom main.js main.jslib.jsUdo G. said: He\'s right, but there\'s a way to affect the global scope from a function. Improving his example:Hope, that helps.Create two js fileMain js fileOutputYou can put your functions in global variables, but it\'s better practice to just turn your tools script into a module. It\'s really not too hard \xe2\x80\x93 just attach your public API to the exports object. Take a look at Understanding Node.js\' exports module for some more detail.It worked with me like the following.... Lib1.jsnow in the Main.js file you need to include Lib1.jsPlease remember to put the Lib1.js in node_modules folder.Another way to do this in my opinion, is to execute everything in the lib file when you call require() function using (function(/* things here */){})(); doing this will make all these functions global scope, exactly like the eval() solutionsrc/lib.jsAnd then in your main code you can call your functions by name like:main.jsWill make this outputPay atention to the undefined when you call my object.funcFour(), it will be the same if you load with eval(). Hope it helps :)This is the best way i have created so far.You still need to inform what you want to exportLike you are having a file abc.txt and many more? Create 2 files: fileread.js and fetchingfile.js, then in fileread.js write this code:In fetchingfile.js write this code:Now, in a terminal:\n    $ node fetchingfile.js --file=abc.txtYou are passing the file name as an argument, moreover include all files in readfile.js instead of passing it.ThanksYou can simple just require(\'./filename\').Eg.Please note that:I was as well searching for an option to include code without writing modules, resp. use the same tested standalone sources from a different project for a Node.js service - and jmparattes answer did it for me.The benefit is, you don\'t pollute the namespace, I don\'t have trouble with "use strict"; and it works well.Here a full sample:Hope this was helpfull somehow.Another method when using node.js and express.js frameworkstore this in a js file named s and in the folder staticsNow to use the functionI\'ve come up with a rather crude method of handling this for HTML templating.
