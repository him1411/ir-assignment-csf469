I have setup where we have a remote Git server, Here is the scenario which I want to perform,For each bug/feature I create a different Git branch,I keep on committing my code in that Git branch with un-official Git messagesIn top repository we have to do one commit for one bug with official Git message,so how can I merge my branch to remote branch so that they get just one commit for all my check-ins (I even want to provide commit message for this)?Say your bug fix branch is called bugfix and you want to merge it into master:This will take all the commits from the bugfix branch, squash them into 1 commit and then merge it with your master branch.You want to merge with the squash option. That\'s if you want to do it one branch at a time.If you want to merge all the branches at the same time as single commits, then first rebase interactively and squash each feature then octopus merge: Squash into one commit then repeat for the other features.That last merge is an "octopus merge" because it\'s merging a lot of branches at once. Hope this helpsWhat finally cleared this up for me was a comment showing that:is the equivalent of doing:When I want to merge a feature branch with 105(!!) commits and have them all squashed into one, I don\'t want to git rebase -i origin/master because I need to separately resolve merge conflicts for each of the intermediate commits (or at least the ones which git can\'t figure out itself). Using git merge --squash gets me the result I want, of a single commit for merging an entire feature branch. And, I only need to do at most one manual conflict resolution.If you have already git merge bugfix on main, you can squash your merge commit into one with:Merge newFeature branch into master with a custom commit:If instead, you dogit merge --squash newFeature && git commityou will get a commit message that will include all the newFeature branch commits, which you can customize.
