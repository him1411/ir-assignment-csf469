How would I get just the current working directory name in a bash script, or even better, just a terminal command.pwd gives the full path of the current working directory, e.g. /opt/local/bin but I only want binNo need for basename, and especially no need for a subshell running pwd (which adds an extra, and expensive, fork operation); the shell can do this internally using parameter expansion:Use the basename program.  For your case:​​​​​You can use a combination of pwd and basename. E.g.How about grep:I like the selected answer (Charles Duffy), but be careful if you are in a symlinked dir and you want the name of the target dir. Unfortunately I don\'t think it can be done in a single parameter expansion expression, perhaps I\'m mistaken. This should work:To see this, an experiment:reports "bar"To show the leading directories of a path (without incurring a fork-exec of /usr/bin/dirname):This will e.g. transform foo/bar/baz -> foo/barIf you are using Bourne shell or ${PWD##*/} is not available.This thread is great! Here is one more flavor:Surprisingly, no one mentioned this alternative that uses only built-in bash commands:As an added bonus you can easily obtain the name of the parent directory with:These will work on Bash 4.3-alpha or newer.Below grep with regex is also working,or i usually use this in sh scripts you can use this to automate things ... For the find jockeys out there like me:I strongly prefer using gbasename, which is part of GNU coreutils.very simpleThe following commands will result in printing your current working directory in a bash script.Just use:orYou can use the basename utility which deletes any prefix ending in / and the suffix (if present in string) from string, and prints the\nresult on the standard output.I use this command:\ndirname "$0"\n
