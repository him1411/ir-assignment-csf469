I would like to get a list of Python modules, which are in my Python installation (UNIX server).How can you get a list of Python modules installed in your computer?My 50 cents for getting a pip freeze-like list from a Python script:As a (too long) one liner:Giving:This solution applies to the system scope or to a virtual environment scope, and covers packages installed by setuptools, pip and (god forbid) easy_install.I added the result of this call to my flask server, so when I call it with http://example.com/exampleServer/environment I get the list of packages installed on the server\'s virtualenv. It makes debugging a whole lot easier.I have noticed a strange behaviour of this technique - when the Python interpreter is invoked in the same directory as a setup.py file, it does not list the package installed by setup.py.We have behave\'s setup.py in /tmp/behave:behave==1.2.5a1 is missing from the second example, because the working directory contains behave\'s setup.py file.I could not find any reference to this issue in the documentation. Perhaps I shall open a bug for it.in a Python shell/prompt.Now, these methods I tried myself, and I got exactly what was advertised:  All the modules.Alas, really you don\'t care much about the stdlib, you know what you get with a python install.  Really, I want the stuff that I installed. What actually, surprisingly, worked just fine was:Which returned:I say "surprisingly" because the package install tool is the exact place one would expect to find this functionality, although not under the name \'freeze\' but python packaging is so weird, that I am flabbergasted that this tool makes sense.  Pip 0.8.2, Python 2.7.  In ipython you can type "importTab".In the standard Python interpreter, you can type "help(\'modules\')".At the command-line, you can use pydoc modules.In a script, call pkgutil.iter_modules().Since pip version 1.3, you\'ve got access to:Which seems to be syntactic sugar for "pip freeze".  It will list all of the modules particular to your installation or virtualenv, along with their version numbers.  Unfortunately it does not display the current version number of any module, nor does it wash your dishes or shine your shoes.In normal shell just useI just use this to see currently used modules:which shows all modules running on your python.For all built-in modules use:Which is a dict containing all modules and import objects.If we need to know list of installed packages in python , we can use \'help\' command like given below (in python shell)I ran into a custom installed python 2.7 on OS X. It required X11 to list modules installed (both using help and pydoc).To be able to list all modules without installing X11 I ran pydoc as http-server, i.e.:Then it\'s possible to direct Safari to http://localhost:12345/ to see all modules.Very simple searching using pkgutil.iter_modulesAside from using pip freeze I have been installing yolk in my virtual environments.on windows, Enter this in cmdFor the second purpose, example code:In case you have an anaconda python distribution installed, you could also usein addition to solutions described above.This solution is primary based on modules importlib and pkgutil and work with CPython 3.4 and CPython 3.5, but has no support for the CPython 2.ExplanationFull codeUsageFor the CPython3.5 (truncated)For the CPython3.4 (truncated)pip freeze does it all finding packages however one can simply write the following command to list all paths where python packages are.From the shellIf that\'s not helpful, you can do this.And see what that produces.
