Usually I use $("#id").val() to return the value of the selected option, but this time it doesn\'t work.\nThe selected tag has the id aioConceptNamehtml codeFor dropdown options you probably want something like this:The reason val() doesn\'t do the trick is because clicking an option doesn\'t change the value of the dropdown--it just adds the :selected property to the selected option which is a child of the dropdown.Set the values for each of the options$(\'#aioConceptName\').val() didn\'t work because .val() returns the value attribute.
