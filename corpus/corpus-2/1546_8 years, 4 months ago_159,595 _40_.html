When I select multiple lines of code and want to indent them as usual with TAB key, it just deletes them all. I come from Eclipse where I always did it that way. How\'s that done in Xcode? I hope not line by line ;)The keyboard shortcuts are \xe2\x8c\x98+] for indent and \xe2\x8c\x98+[ for un-indent.  \xe2\x8c\x98 + [ and \xe2\x8c\x98 + ] are the equivalents to shift+tab in Xcode.Select your code to reindent, then Go to Editor -> Structure -> Re-IndentHere are the shortcuts, to format the code in XCode Format entire code (entire class/controller)Select the entire code and press control+I  on mac to format your code.Format particular block of codeSelect the code and press:Note: as per @JavierGiovannini sugesstion you can do using Editor Menu optionAnother way to quickly reformat indenting is a quick cut and paste. \xe2\x8c\x98+x and \xe2\x8c\x98+v. I often find it faster than \xe2\x8c\x98+[ or \xe2\x8c\x98+] as you can do it with one hand (versus two) and it will reformat to the correct indent level in one shot.If you use synergy (to share one keyboard for two PCs) and PC(MAC) in which you are using xcode is slave, and master PC is Windows PC keyboard shortcuts are alt+] for indent and alt+[ for un-indent.  Update:But from synergy version 1.5 working \xe2\x8c\x98+[ for indent and \xe2\x8c\x98+] for un-indentSelect "Tab key: Indents always" in Preferences->Text Editing->Indentation\nThen you can indent a single line or a selection of lines by pressing TAB or SHIFT+TAB\nSadly this removes altogether the possibility to insert tabs where you want, and conflict badly with the tab key being used to switch between "autocompletion fields".I guess we need more tab keys in the keyboard, one is not enough...For those of you with Spanish keyboard on mac this are the shortcuts:\xe2\x8c\x98 + \xe2\x8c\xa5 + [ for un-indent\xe2\x8c\x98 + \xe2\x8c\xa5 + ] for indenthere all the important shortcuts from another question answered on stack overflow\nTo all frenchs Xcoders around, the default keybindings are as follow :\xe2\x87\xa7 + \xe2\x8c\x98 + \xe2\x8c\xa5 + )\xe2\x87\xa7 + \xe2\x8c\x98 + \xe2\x8c\xa5 + (If you want to remap the standard Xcode\'s \xe2\x8c\x98+[ to TAB, you can do the following:Install a program called "Karabiner".Go to Preferences ~> "Misc and Uninstall"In "Custom Setting" section click on the "Open private.xml" buttonOpen the file and replace its content with the following code:Go to Preferences ~> "Change Key" ~> click on "Reload XML" buttonPut a tick in the checkbox which is called "Tab instead of Command+["EnjoyPS: Please note that this setting works globally on your machine, not just in Xcode. However, I am sure that google might help you to find a solution how to customize it even further, applying the changes only to Xcode.Danish KeyboardUnindent: \xe2\x8c\x98 + \xe2\x8c\xa5 + 8Indent: \xe2\x8c\x98 + \xe2\x8c\xa5 + 9In Xcode 9, you can finally use Tab and Shift+Tab to indent multiple lines of code. Yay!In Xcode 4.2 auto-indenting is pretty good. You can now indent a selection of code by pressing the Tab key. I find that Xcode generally formats code really well automatically, and you rarely have to move things around yourself. I find it faster to select a piece of code, right-click and choose Structure -> Re-indent if some code looks messy.
