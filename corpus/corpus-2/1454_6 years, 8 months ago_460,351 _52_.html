I have created my application with the height and width given in pixels for a Pantech device whose resolution is 480x800.I need to convert height and width for a G1 device. I thought converting it into dp will solve the problem and provide same solution for both devices. Is there any easy way to convert pixels to dp? Any suggestions?Preferably put in a Util.java class     density equalsUse this online converter to play around with dpi values.EDIT: \nIt seems there is no 1:1 relationship between dpi bucket and density. It looks like the Nexus 5X being xxhdpi has a density value of 2.625 (instead of 3). See for yourself in the Device Metrics.According to the Android Development Guide:But often you\'ll want do perform this the other way around when you receive a design that\'s stated in pixels. So:If you\'re on a 240dpi device this ratio is 1.5 (like stated before), so this means that a 60px icon equals 40dp in the application.Without Context, elegant static methods:You can use this .. without ContextIf you can use the dimensions XML it\'s very simple!In your res/values/dimens.xml:Then in your Java:You can therefore use the following formulator to calculate the right amount of pixels from a dimension specified in dpThere is a default util in android SDK:\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/TypedValue.htmlFor DP to PixelCreate a value in dimens.xmlGet that value in pixel as:Probably the best way if you have the dimension inside values/dimen is to get the dimension directly from getDimension() method, it will return you the dimension already converted into pixel value.Just to better explain this, will return the dimension already converted to pixel AS A FLOAT.will return the same but truncated to int, so AS AN \nINTEGER.See Android referencewhere resource is context.getResources().like this:dependent on Context, return float value, static methodfrom: https://github.com/Trinea/android-common/blob/master/src/cn/trinea/android/common/util/ScreenUtils.java#L15In case you developing a performance critical application, please consider the following optimized class:You should use dp just as you would pixels. That\'s all they are; display independent pixels. Use the same numbers you would on a medium density screen, and the size will be magically correct on a high density screen.However, it sounds like what you need is the fill_parent option in your layout design. Use fill_parent when you want your view or control to expand to all the remaining size in the parent container.to convert Pixels to dp use the TypedValue . As the documentation mentioned : Container for a dynamically typed data value . and use the applyDimension method : which Converts an unpacked complex data value holding a dimension to its final floating point value like the following : Hope that Helps .This is how it works for me:You can do the same for the width.A lot of great solutions above. However, the best solution I found is google\'s design:https://design.google.com/devices/PX and DP are different but similar.DP is the resolution when you only factor the physical size of the screen. When you use DP it will scale your layout to other similar sized screens with different pixel densities.Occasionally you actually want pixels though, and when you deal with dimensions in code you are always dealing with real pixels, unless you convert them.So on a android device, normal sized hdpi screen, 800x480 is 533x320 in DP (I believe). To convert DP into pixels /1.5, to convert back *1.5. This is only for the one screen size and dpi, it would change depending on design. Our artists give me pixels though and I convert to DP with the above 1.5 equation.For anyone using Kotlin:Usage:More elegant approach using kotlin\'s extension functionUsage:This workds for me (C#):To convert dp to px this code can be helpful :
