The W3C validator doesn\'t like self-closing tags (those that end with "/>") on non-void elements. (Void elements are those that may not ever contain any content.) Are they still valid in HTML5?Some examples of accepted void elements:Some examples of rejected non-void elements:Note: the W3C validator actually accepts void self-closing tags: the author originally had a problem because of a simple typo (\\> instead of />). However, self-closing tags are not 100% valid in HTML5 in general, and the answers elaborate on the issue of self-closing tags across various HTML flavors.In HTML 4, <foo / (yes, with no > at all) means <foo> (which leads to <br /> meaning <br>> (i.e. <br>&gt;) and <title/hello/ meaning <title>hello</title>). Browsers did a very poor job of supporting this and the spec advises authors to avoid the syntax.In XHTML, <foo /> means <foo></foo>, but since this only works in XML parsing mode and most documents are served as text/html there are compatibility guidelines to follow.In HTML5, the meaning of <foo /> depends on the type of element.As Nikita Skvortsov pointed out, a self-closing div will not validate. This is because a div is a normal element, not a void element. According to the HTML5 spec, tags that cannot have any contents (known as void elements) can be self-closing*. This includes the following tags:The "/" is completely optional on the above tags, however, so <img/> is not different from <img>, but <img></img> is invalid.*Note: foreign elements can also be self-closing, but I don\'t think that\'s in scope for this answer.In practice, using self-closing tags in HTML should work just like you\'d expect. But if you are concerned about writing valid HTML5, you should understand how the use of such tags behaves within the two different two syntax forms you can use. HTML5 defines both an HTML syntax and an XHTML syntax, which are similar but not identical. Which one is used depends on the media type sent by the web server.  More than likely, your pages are being served as text/html, which follows the more lenient HTML syntax. In these cases, HTML5 allows certain start tags to have an optional / before it\'s terminating >. In these cases, the / is optional and ignored, so <hr> and <hr /> are identical.  The HTML spec calls these "void elements", and gives a list of valid ones. Strictly speaking, the optional / is only valid within the start tags of these void elements; for example, <br /> and <hr /> are valid HTML5, but <p /> is not.The HTML5 spec makes a clear distinction between what is correct for HTML authors and for web browser developers, with the second group being required to accept all kinds of invalid "legacy" syntax. In this case, it means that HTML5-compliant browsers will accept illegal self-closed tags, like <p />, and render them as you probably expect. But for an author, that page would not be valid HTML5. (More importantly, the DOM tree you get from using this kind of illegal syntax can be seriously screwed up; self-closed <span /> tags, for example, tend to mess things up a lot).(In the unusual case that your server knows how to send XHTML files as an XML MIME type, the page needs to conform to the XHTML DTD and XML syntax.  That means self-closing tags are required for those elements defined as such.)HTML5 basically behaves as if the trailing slash is not there.  There is no such thing as a self-closing tag in HTML5 syntax.Self-closing tags on non-void elements like <p/>, <div/> will not work at all.  The trailing slash will be ignored, and these will be treated as opening tags.  This is likely to lead to nesting problems.This is true regardless of whether there is whitespace in front of the slash: <p /> and <div /> also won\'t work for the same reason.Self-closing tags on void elements like <br/> or <img src="" alt=""/> will work, but only because the trailing slash is ignored, and in this case that happens to result in the correct behaviour.The result is, anything that worked in your old "XHTML 1.0 served as text/html" will continue to work as it did before: trailing slashes on non-void tags were not accepted there either whereas the trailing slash on void elements worked.One more note: it is possible to represent an HTML5 document as XML, and this is sometimes dubbed "XHTML 5.0".  In this case the rules of XML apply and self-closing tags will always be handled.  It would always need to be served with an XML mime type.Self-closing tags are valid in HTML5, but not required.<br> and <br /> are both fine.I would be very careful with self closing tags as this example demonstrates:My gut feeling would have been <span></span><span></span> instead
