I\'ve been searching the difference between Select and SelectMany but I haven\'t been able to find a suitable answer. I need to learn the difference when using LINQ To SQL but all I\'ve found are standard array examples. Can someone provide a LINQ To SQL example?SelectMany flattens queries that return lists of lists. For exampleSee SelectMany - StackOverFlow DocsLive Demo on .NET FiddleSelect many is like cross join operation in SQL where it takes the cross product.\nFor example if we haveSelect many can be used to get the following setNote that here we take the all the possible combinations that can be made from the elements of set A and set B. Here is a LINQ example you can trythe mix will have following elements in flat structure like  ...SelectMany() lets you collapse a multidimensional sequence in a way that would otherwise require a second Select() or loop.More details at this blog post.There are several overloads to SelectMany. One of them allows you to keep trace of any relationship between parent and children while traversing the hierarchy.Example: suppose you have the following structure: League -> Teams -> PlayerYou can easily return a flat collection of players. However you may lose any reference to the team the player is part of.Fortunately there is an overload for such purpose:The previous example is taken from Dan\'s IK blog: http://blogs.interknowlogy.com/2008/10/10/use-linqs-selectmany-method-to-flatten-collections/I strongly recommend you take a look at it.I understand SelectMany to work like a join shortcut.So you can:Select is a simple one-to-one projection from source element to a result element. Select-\nMany is used when there are multiple from clauses in a query expression: each element in the original sequence is used to generate a new sequence.Some SelectMany may not be necessary. Below 2 queries give the same result. For 1-to-Many relationship, Without getting too technical - database with many Organizations, each with many Users:-both return the same ApplicationUser list for the selected Organization.The first "projects" from Organization to Users, the second queries the Users table directly. It\'s more clear when the query return a string:For example if the list \'Files\' contains the Filename \'afile.txt\'\'Select\' returns the string:\'SelectMany\' flattens the string: It is the best way to understand i think.Multiplication Table example.
