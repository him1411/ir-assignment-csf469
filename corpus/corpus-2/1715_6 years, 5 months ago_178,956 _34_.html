I have the folder application/ which I add to the .gitignore. Inside the  application/ folder is the folder application/language/gr. How can I include this folder?\nI\'ve tried thiswith no luck...If you exclude application/, then everything under it will always be excluded (even if some later negative exclusion pattern (\xe2\x80\x9cunignore\xe2\x80\x9d) might match something under application/).To do what you want, you have to \xe2\x80\x9cunignore\xe2\x80\x9d every parent directory of anything that you want to \xe2\x80\x9cunignore\xe2\x80\x9d. Usually you end up writing rules for this situation in pairs: ignore everything in a directory, but not some certain subdirectory.Note\nThe trailing /* is significant:  Commit 59856de from Karsten Blees (kblees) for Git 1.9/2.0 (Q1 2014) clarifies that case:An optional prefix "!" which negates the pattern; any matching file excluded by a previous pattern will become included again.  It is not possible to re-include a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded. (*)\n  (*: unless certain conditions are met in git 2.8+, see below)\n  Git doesn\'t list excluded directories for performance reasons, so any patterns on contained files have no effect, no matter where they are defined.Put a backslash ("\\") in front of the first "!" for patterns that begin with a literal "!", for example, "\\!important!.txt".Example to exclude everything except a specific directory foo/bar (note the /* - without the slash, the wildcard would also exclude everything within foo/bar):Update Feb/March 2016:Note that with git 2.9.x/2.10 (mid 2016?), it might be possible to re-include a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded if there is no wildcard in the path re-included.Nguy\xe1\xbb\x85n Th\xc3\xa1i Ng\xe1\xbb\x8dc Duy (pclouds) is trying to add this feature:So with git 2.9+, this could have actually worked, but was ultimately reverted:@Chris Johnsen\'s answer is great, but with a newer versions of Git (1.8.2 or later), there is a double asterisk pattern you can leverage for a bit more shorthand solution:This way you don\'t have to "unignore" parent directory of the subfolder you want to track.There are a bunch of similar questions about this, so I\'ll post what I wrote before:The only way I got this to work on my machine was to do it this way:Notice how you have to explicitly allow content for each level you want to include. So if I have subdirectories 5 deep under themes, I still need to spell that out.This is from @Yarin\'s comment here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/5250314/1696153These were useful topics:I also tried and **/wp-content/themes/**or /wp-content/themes/**/*None of that worked for me, either. Lots of trail and error!So , since many programmers uses node . the use case which meets this question is to exclude node_modules except one module module-a for example: Just another example of walking down the directory structure to get exactly what you want. Note: I didn\'t exclude Library/ but Library/**/*> git add Library> git statusI\'ve found only this actually works.Especially for the older Git versions, most of the suggestions won\'t work that well.\nIf that\'s the case, I\'d put a separate .gitignore in the directory where I want the content to be included regardless of other settings and allow there what is needed.For example:\n/.gitignore/dependency_files/.gitignoreSo everything in /dependency_files (even .dll files) are included just fine.
