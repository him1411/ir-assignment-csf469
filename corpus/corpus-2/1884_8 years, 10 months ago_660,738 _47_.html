If you know the Index, Value or Text. also if you don\'t have an ID for a direct reference.This, this and this are all helpful answers.Example markupA selector to get the middle option-element by value isFor an index:For a known text:EDIT: As commented above the OP might have been after changing the selected item of the dropdown. In version 1.6 and higher the prop() method is recommended:In older versions:EDIT2, after Ryan\'s comment. A match on "Selection 10" might be unwanted. I found no selector to match the full text, but a filter works:None of the methods above provided the solution I needed so I figured I would provide what worked for me.You can just use val() method:By value, what worked for me with jQuery 1.7 was the below code, try this:You could name the select and use this:It should select the option you want.Answering my own question for documentation. I\'m sure there are other ways to accomplish this, but this works and this code is tested.There are a number of ways to do this, but the cleanest approach has been lost among the top answers and loads of arguments over val(). Also some methods changed as of jQuery 1.6, so this needs an update.For the following examples I will assume the variable $select is a jQuery object pointing at the desired <select> tag, e.g. via the following:For value matching, using val() is far simpler than using an attribute selector: https://jsfiddle.net/yz7tu49b/6/The setter version of .val() is implemented on select tags by setting the selected property of a matching option with the same value, so works just fine on all modern browsers.If you want to set the selected state of an option directly, you can use prop (not attr) with a boolean parameter (rather than the text value selected):e.g. https://jsfiddle.net/yz7tu49b/If you use val() to select an <option>, but the val is not matched (might happen depending on the source of the values), then "nothing" is selected and $select.val() will return null.So, for the example shown, and for the sake of robustness, you could use something like this https://jsfiddle.net/1250Ldqn/:If you want to match by exact text, you can use a filter with function. e.g. https://jsfiddle.net/yz7tu49b/2/:although if you may have extra whitespace you may want to add a trim to the check as in If you want to match by index just index the children of the select e.g. https://jsfiddle.net/yz7tu49b/3/Although I tend to avoid direct DOM properties in favour of jQuery nowadays, to future-proof code, so that could also be done as https://jsfiddle.net/yz7tu49b/5/:In all the above cases, the change event does not fire. This is by design so that you do not wind up with recursive change events.To generate the change event, if required, just add a call to .change() to the jQuery select object. e.g. the very first simplest example becomes https://jsfiddle.net/yz7tu49b/7/There are also plenty of other ways to find the elements using attribute selectors, like [value="SEL2"], but you have to remember attribute selectors are relatively slow compared to all these other options.I use this, when i know the index of the list.This allows the list to change, and fire the change event.\nThe ":nth(n)" is counting from index 0Using jquery-2.1.4, I found the following answer to work for me:If you have a string value try the following:Other examples did not work for me so that\'s why I\'m adding this answer.I found the original answer at: \nhttps://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-to-dynamically-select-option-in-dropdown-menui\'ll go with:-For Jquery chosen if you send the attribute to function and need to update-select optionFor setting select value with triggering selected: For setting option from a scope:This code use selector to find out the select object with condition, then change the selected attribute by attr().Futher, I recommend to add change() event after setting attribute to selected, by doing this the code will close to changing select by user.Thanks for the question. Hope this piece of code will work for you.The $(\'select\').val(\'the_value\'); looks the right solution and if you have data table rows then:if you want to not use jQuery, you can use below code:you just use select field id instead of #id (ie.#select_name)instead of option value use your select option value
