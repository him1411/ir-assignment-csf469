What are the differences between die() and exit() functions in PHP?I think both have the same functionality, but I doubt there is something different in both... what is it?There\'s no difference - they are the same.PHP Manual for exit:Note: This language construct is equivalent to die().PHP Manual for die:This language construct is equivalent to exit(). The difference between die() and exit() in PHP is their origin.die() and exit() are equivalent functions.PHP Manual for die:This language construct is equivalent to exit().PHP Manual for exit:Note: This language construct is equivalent to die().PHP Manual for List of Function Aliases:die is an alias for master function exit()die() and exit() are different in other languages but in PHP they are identical.From Yet another PHP rant:...As a C and Perl coder, I was ready to answer, "Why, exit() just bails\n  off the program with a numeric exit status, while die() prints out the\n  error message to stderr and exits with EXIT_FAILURE status." But then\n  I remembered we\'re in messy-syntax-land of PHP.In PHP, exit() and die() are identical.The designers obviously thought "Hmm, let\'s borrow exit() from C. And Perl\n  folks probably will like it if we take die() as is from Perl too.\n  Oops! We have two exit functions now! Let\'s make it so that they both\n  can take a string or integer as an argument and make them identical!"The end result is that this didn\'t really make things any "easier",\n  just more confusing. C and Perl coders will continue to use exit() to\n  toss an integer exit value only, and die() to toss an error message\n  and exit with a failure. Newbies and PHP-as-a-first-language people\n  will probably wonder "umm, two exit functions, which one should I\n  use?" The manual doesn\'t explain why there\'s exit() and die().In general, PHP has a lot of weird redundancy like this - it tries to\n  be friendly to people who come from different language backgrounds,\n  but while doing so, it creates confusing redundancy.As stated before, these two commands produce the same parser token.BUTThere is a small difference, and that is how long it takes the parser to return the token.I haven\'t studied the PHP parser, but if it\'s a long list of functions starting with "d", and a shorter list starting with "e", then there must be a time penalty looking up the function name for functions starting with "e". And there may be other differences due to how the whole function name are checked.I doubt it will be measurable unless you have a "perfect" environment dedicated to parsing php, and a lot of requests with different parameters.\nBut there must be a difference, after all, PHP is an interpreted language.PHP manual on die:die \xe2\x80\x94 Equivalent to exitYou can even do die; the same way as exit; - with or without brackets.The only advantage of choosing die() over exit(), might be the time you spare on typing an extra letter ;-)As all the other correct answers says, die and exit are identical/aliases.Although I have a personal convention that when I want to end the execution of a script when it is expected and desired, I use exit;. And when I need to end the execution due to some problems (couldn\'t connect to db, can\'t write to file etc.), I use die("Something went wrong."); to "kill" the script.When I use exit:When I use die:This way, when I see exit at some point in my code, I know that at this point I want to exit because the logic ends here.\nWhen I see die, I know that I\'d like to continue execution, but I can\'t or shouldn\'t due to error in previous execution.Of course this only works when working on a project alone. When there is more people nobody will prevent them to use die or exit where it does not fit my conventions...They are essentially the same, though this article suggest otherwise. This page says die is an alies of exit, so they are identical. But also explains that:there are functions which changed names because of an API cleanup or some other reason and the old names are only kept as aliases for backward compatibility. It is usually a bad idea to use these kind of aliases, as they may be bound to obsolescence or renaming, which will lead to unportable script.So, call me paranoid, but there may be no dieing in the future.When using command line,Will print to "Error" to STDOUT and exit with error code 0.if you want to exit with error code 1, you have to:It could be useful while executing php scripts from command line or shell scripts and you want to see if the script terminated with a non zero exit code.\ncopied answer of charanjeet from QuoraThis output from https://3v4l.org demonstrates that die and exit are functionally identical.\n Something I have noticed in my scripts at least is that exit() will stop the currently executing script and pass control back to any calling script, while die will stop php in its tracks. I would say that is quite a big difference?Functionally, they are identical. So to choose which one to use is totally a personal preference. Semantically in English, they are different. Die sounds negative. When I have a function which returns JSON data to the client and terminate the program, it can be awful if I call this function jsonDie(), and it is more appropriate to call it jsonExit(). For that reason, I always use exit instead of die.In w3schools Quiz: \nThe die() and exit() functions do the exact same thing?\nmy answer is false. That is incorrect answer.\nThe right answer is true. Here is the screenshot:\nThey sound about the same, however, the exit() also allows you to set the exit code of your PHP script.Usually you don\'t really need this, but when writing console PHP scripts, you might want to check with for example Bash if the script completed everything in the right way.Then you can use exit() and catch that later on.\nDie() however doesn\'t support that.Die() always exists with code 0.\nSo essentially a die() command does the following:Which is the same as:
