Is there an easy way to create a multiline string literal in C#?Here\'s what I have now:I know PHP hasDoes C# have something similar?You can use the @ symbol in front of a string to form a verbatim string literal:You also do not have to escape special characters when you use this method, except for double quotes as shown in Jon Skeet\'s answer.It\'s called a verbatim string literal in C#, and it\'s just a matter of putting @ before the literal. Not only does this allow multiple lines, but it also turns off escaping. So for example you can do:The only bit of escaping is that if you want a double quote, you have to add an extra double quote symbol:One other gotcha to watch for is the use of string literals in string.Format. In that case you need to escape curly braces/brackets \'{\' and \'}\'. The problem with using string literal I find is that it can make your code look a bit "weird" because in order to not get spaces in the string itself, it has to be completely left aligned:Yuck.So the solution I like to use, which keeps everything nicely aligned with the rest of your code is:And of course, if you just want to logically split up lines of an SQL statement like you are and don\'t actually need a new line, you can always just substitute Environment.NewLine for " ".As a side-note, with C# 6.0 you can now combine interpolated strings with the verbatim string literal:Why do people keep confusing strings with string literals? The accepted answer is a great answer to a different question; not to this one.I know this is an old topic, but I came here with possibly the same question as the OP, and it is frustrating to see how people keep misreading it. Or maybe I am misreading it, I don\'t know.Roughly speaking, a string is a region of computer memory that, during the execution of a program, contains a sequence of bytes that can be mapped to text characters. A string literal, on the other hand, is a piece of source code, not yet compiled, that represents the value used to initialize a string later on, during the execution of the program in which it appears.In C#, the statement...... does not produce a three-line string but a one liner; the concatenation of three strings (each initialized from a different literal) none of which contains a new-line modifier.What the OP seems to be asking -at least what I would be asking with those words- is not how to introduce, in the compiled string, line breaks that mimick those found in the source code, but how to break up for clarity a long, single line of text in the source code without introducing breaks in the compiled string. And without requiring an extended execution time, spent joining the multiple substrings coming from the source code. Like the trailing backslashes within a multiline string literal in javascript or C++.Suggesting the use of verbatim strings, nevermind StringBuilders, String.Joins or even nested functions with string reversals and what not, makes me think that people are not really understanding the question. Or maybe I do not understand it.As far as I know, C# does not (at least in the paleolithic version I am still using, from the previous decade) have a feature to cleanly produce multiline string literals that can be resolved during compilation rather than execution.Maybe current versions do support it, but I thought I\'d share the difference I perceive between strings and string literals.I haven\'t seen this, so I will post it here (if you are interested in passing a string you can do this as well.) The idea is that you can break the string up on multiple lines and add your own content (also on multiple lines) in any way you wish. Here "tableName" can be passed into the string.If you don\'t want spaces/newlines, string addition seems to work:You can run the above here if you like. You can use this two methods :In the SplitLineToMultiline() , you need to define the string you want to use and the row length , it\'s very simple .\nThank you .
