We create a Set as:How do we create a List in Java?or with genericsAdditionally, if you want to create a list that has things in it:Let me summarize and add something:JDKGuavaImmutable ListEmpty immutable ListList of CharactersList of IntegersFirst read this, then read this and this. 9 times out of 10 you\'ll use one of those two implementations.In fact, just read Sun\'s Guide to the Collections framework.List is just an interface just as Set.Like HashSet is an implementation of a Set which has certain properties in regards to add / lookup / remove performance, ArrayList is the bare implementation of a List.If you have a look at the documentation for the respective interfaces you will find "All Known Implementing Classes" and you can decide which one is more suitable for your needs.Chances are that it\'s ArrayList.Since Java 7 you have type inference for generic instance creation, so there is no need to duplicate generic parameters on the right hand side of the assignment:A fixed-size list can be defined as:For immutable lists you can use the Guava library:List is an interface like Set and has ArrayList and LinkedList as general purpose implementations. We can create List as:We can also create a fixed-size list as:We would almost always be using ArrayList opposed to LinkedList implementation:Or with genericsYou can, of course, replace string with any type of variable, such as Integer, also.Sometimes - but only very rarely - instead of a new ArrayList, you may want a new LinkedList.  Start out with ArrayList and if you have performance problems and evidence that the list is the problem, and a lot of adding and deleting to that list - then - not before - switch to a LinkedList and see if things improve.  But in the main, stick with ArrayList and all will be fine.One example:You can look at the javadoc for List and find all known implementing classes of the List interface that are included with the java api.Using Google Collections, you could use the following methods in the Lists classThere are overloads for varargs initialization and initialising from an Iterable<T>. The advantage of these methods is that you don\'t need to specify the generic parameter explicitly as you would with the constructor - the compiler will infer it from the type of the variable.You need to import List and ArrayList.Its better you use generics as suggested below:Incase you use LinkedList.There are many ways to create a Set and a List. HashSet and ArrayList are just two examples.  It is also fairly common to use generics with collections these days. I suggest you have a look at what they areThis is a good introduction for java\'s builtin collections. http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/collections/overview.htmlAs an option you can use double brace initialization:More options to do the same thing with Java 8, not better, not worse, just different and if you want to do some extra work with the lists, Streams will provide you more alternatives (filter, map, reduce, etc.)Using Eclipse Collections you can create a List like this:If you want an immutable list: You can avoid auto-boxing by using primitive lists. Here\'s how you\'d create int lists:There are variants for all 8 primitives.Note: I am a committer for Eclipse Collections. With Java 9, you are able to do the following to create an immutable List:This will create a list with fixed size, adding/removing elements is not possible, it will throw a java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException if you try to do so.List<String> fixedSizeList = Arrays.asList(new String[] {"Male", "Female"});The following version is a simple list where you can add/remove any number of elements.List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();This is how to create a LinkedList in java, If you need to do frequent insertion/deletion of elements on the list, you should use LinkedList instead of ArrayListList<String> linkedList = new LinkedList<>();An instance of List can be created in any of the following manner
