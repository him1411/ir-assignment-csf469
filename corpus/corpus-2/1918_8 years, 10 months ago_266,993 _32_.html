How can I check whether a variable is defined in Ruby?  Is there an isset-type method available?Use the defined? keyword (documentation). It will return a String with the kind of the item, or nil if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist.As skalee commented: "It is worth noting that variable which is set to nil is initialized."This is useful if you want to do nothing if it does exist but create it if it doesn\'t exist.This only creates the new instance once. After that it just keeps returning the var.The correct syntax for the above statement is:substituting (var) with your variable. This syntax will return a true/false value for evaluation in the if statement.defined?(your_var) will work. Depending on what you\'re doing you can also do something like your_var.nil?Try "unless" instead of "if"Use defined? YourVariable\nKeep it simple silly .. ;)Here is some code, nothing rocket science but it works well enoughClearly, the colouring code is not necessary, just a nice visualation in this toy example.You can try:Because it returns a boolean.As many other examples show you don\'t actually need a boolean from a method to make logical choices in ruby. It would be a poor form to coerce everything to a boolean unless you actually need a boolean. But if you absolutely need a boolean. Use !! (bang bang) or "falsy falsy reveals the truth".Why it doesn\'t usually pay to coerce:Here\'s an example where it matters because it relies on the implicit coercion of the boolean value to its string representation.Please note the distinction between "defined" and "assigned".x is defined even though it is never assigned!It  should be mentioned that using defined to check if a specific field is set in a hash might behave unexpected:The syntax is correct here, but defined? var[\'unknown\'] will be evaluated to the string "method", so the if block will be executedThis is the key answer: the defined? method. The accepted answer above illustrates this perfectly. But there is a shark, lurking beneath the waves...Consider this type of common ruby pattern: Let\'s stop and think about this for a sec. method 2 always returns nil. The first time you call method1, the @x variable is not set - therefore method2 will be run. and method 2 will set @x to nil. That is fine, and all well and good. But what happens the second time you call method1?Remember @x has already been set to nil. But method 2 will still be run again? If method2 is a costly undertaking this might not be something that you want.Let the defined? method come to the rescueIf you didn\'t know about that trick, well then "you\'re gonna need a bigger boat".Also, you can check if it\'s defined while in a string via interpolation, if you code: The system will tell you the type if it is defined.\nIf it is not defined it will just return a warning saying the variable is not initialized.Hope this helps! :)
