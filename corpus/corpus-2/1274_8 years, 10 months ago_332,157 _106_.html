When I type git diff, I want to view the output with my visual diff tool of choice (SourceGear "diffmerge" on Windows). How do I configure git to do this?Since Git1.6.3, you can use the git difftool script: see my answer below.May be this article will help you. Here are the best parts:There are two different ways to specify an external diff tool. The first is the method you used, by setting the GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF variable. However, the variable is supposed to point to the full path of the executable. Moreover, the executable specified by GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF will be called with a fixed set of 7 arguments:As most diff tools will require a different order (and only some) of the arguments, you will most likely have to specify a wrapper script instead, which in turn calls the real diff tool.The second method, which I prefer, is to configure the external diff tool via "git\nconfig". Here is what I did:1) Create a wrapper script "git-diff-wrapper.sh" which contains something likeAs you can see, only the second ("old-file") and fifth ("new-file") arguments will be\npassed to the diff tool.2) Typeat the command prompt, replacing  with the path to "git-diff-wrapper.sh", so your ~/.gitconfig containsBe sure to use the correct syntax to specify the paths to the wrapper script and diff\ntool, i.e. use forward slashed instead of backslashes. In my case, I havein .gitconfig andin the wrapper script. Mind the trailing "cat"!(I suppose the \'| cat\' is needed only for some programs which may not return a proper or consistent return status. You might want to try without the trailing cat if your diff tool has explicit return status)That (the article quoted above) is the theory for external tool defined through config file (not through environment variable).\nIn practice (still for config file definition of external tool), you can refer to:To complete my previous "diff.external" config answer above:As mentioned by Jakub, Git1.6.3 introduced git difftool, originally proposed in September 2008:USAGE=\'[--tool=tool] [--commit=ref] [--start=ref --end=ref] [--no-prompt] [file to merge]\'\n(See --extcmd in the last part of this answer)$LOCAL contains the contents of the file from the starting revision and $REMOTE contains the contents of the file in the ending revision.\n$BASE contains the contents of the file in the worIt\'s basically git-mergetool modified to operate on the git index/worktree.  The usual use case for this script is when you have either staged or unstaged changes and you\'d like to see the changes in a side-by-side diff viewer (e.g. xxdiff, tkdiff, etc).Another use case is when you\'d like to see the same information but are comparing arbitrary commits (this is the part where the revarg parsing could be better)The last use case is when you\'d like to compare your current worktree to something other than HEAD (e.g. a tag)Note: since Git 2.5, git config diff.tool winmerge is enough!\nSee "git mergetool winmerge"Before Git 2.5:Practical case for configuring difftool with your custom diff tool:With winmerge.sh stored in a directory part of your PATH:If you have another tool (kdiff3, P4Diff, ...), create another shell script, and the appropriate difftool.myDiffTool.cmd config directive.\nThen you can easily switch tools with the diff.tool config.You have also this blog entry by Dave to add other details.\n(Or this question for the winmergeu options)The interest with this setting is the winmerge.shscript: you can customize it to take into account special cases.See for instance David Marble\'s answer below for an example which deals with:As Kem Mason mentions in his answer, you can also avoid any wrapper by using the --extcmd option:Specify a custom command for viewing diffs. git-difftool ignores the configured defaults and runs $command $LOCAL $REMOTE when this option is specified.For instance, this is how gitk is able to run/use any diff tool.In the spirit of answering questions that are somewhat different than asked.  Try this solution:Meld understands git and provides navigating around the recent changes.Since git version 1.6.3 there is "git difftool" which you can configure to use your favorite graphical diff tool.  Currently supported out-of-the-box are kdiff3, kompare, tkdiff, meld, xxdiff, emerge, vimdiff, gvimdiff, ecmerge, diffuse and opendiff; if the tool you want to use isn\'t on this list, you can always use \'difftool.<tool>.cmd\' configuration option."git difftool" accepts the same options as "git diff".With new git difftool, its as simple as adding this to your .gitconfig file:Also check out diffall, a simple script I wrote to extend the annoying (IMO) default diff behaviour of opening each in serial.I have one addition to this.  I like to regularly use a diff app that isn\'t supported as one of the default tools (e.g. kaleidoscope), via I also like to have the default diff just be the regular command line, so setting the GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF variable isn\'t an option.You can use an arbitrary diff app as a one-off with this command:It just passes the 2 files to the command you specify, so you probably don\'t need a wrapper either.Building on VonC\'s answer to deal with file removals and additions, use the following commands and scripts:Which is the same as putting this in your global .gitconfig:Then put the following in winmerge.shwhich must be on your path:After reading the answers, I discovered a simpler way that involves changing only one file. Create a batch file to invoke your diff program, with argument 2 and 5. This file must be somewhere in your path. (If you don\'t know where that is, put it in c:\\windows). Call it, for example, "gitdiff.bat". Mine is:Set the environment variable to point to your batch file. For example:GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF=gitdiff.bat. Or through powershell by typing git config --global diff.external gitdiff.bat.It is important to not use quotes, or specify any path information, otherwise it won\'t work. That\'s why gitdiff.bat must be in your path.Now when you type "git diff", it will invoke your external diff viewer.If you\'re doing this through cygwin, you may need to use cygpath:this works for me on windows 7. No need for intermediary sh scriptscontents of .gitconfig:A short summary of the above great answers:Then use it by typing (optionally specifying file name as well):For reference I\'d like to include my variation on VonC\'s answer. Keep in mind that I am using the MSys version of Git (1.6.0.2 at this time) with modified PATH, and running Git itself from Powershell (or cmd.exe), not the Bash shell.I introduced a new command, gitdiff. Running this command temporarily redirects git diff to use a visual diff program of your choice (as opposed to VonC\'s solution that does it permanently). This allows me to have both the default Git diff functionality (git diff) as well as visual diff functionality (gitdiff). Both commands take the same parameters, so for example to visually diff changes in a particular file you can typeNote that $GitInstall is used as a placeholder for the directory where Git is installed.Create a new file, $GitInstall\\cmd\\gitdiff.cmdCreate a new file, $GitInstall\\bin\\git-diff-visual.cmd (replacing [visual_diff_exe] placeholder with full path to the diff program of your choice)You\'re now done. Running gitdiff from within a Git repository should now invoke your visual diff program for every file that was changed.Here\'s a batch file that works for Windows - assumes DiffMerge installed in default location, handles x64, handles forward to backslash replacement as necessary and has ability to install itself.  Should be easy to replace DiffMerge with your favourite diff program.To install:gitvdiff.bat:If you\'re on a Mac and have XCode, then you have FileMerge installed. The terminal command is opendiff, so you can just do git difftool -t opendiffFor a linux version of how to configure a diff tool on git versions prior to 1.6.3 (1.6.3 added difftool to git) this is a great concise tutorial,in brief:Step 1: add this to your .gitconfigStep 2: create a file named git_diff_wrapper, put it somewhere in your $PATHInstall meldThen choose that as difftoolIf tou want to run it on console type:If you want to use graphic mode type:And the output would be:So just press enter to use meld(default), this would open graphic mode, make the magic save and press that that resolve the merge. That\'s allOn Mac OS X, does the job for me in the git folder. For installing diffuse, one can use port - I tried the fancy stuff here (with tkdiff) and nothing worked for me.  So I wrote the following script, tkgitdiff.  It does what I need it to do.you can use git difftool.for example if you have meld, you can edit the branchs master and devel by:I use kompare on ubuntu:To compare two branches:I\'ve been using this bit in ~/.gitconfig for a long time:With git-meld:But now I got tired of always using meld in graphical environment,\nand it\'s not trivial to invoke the normal diff with this setup, so I switched to this:With this setup, things like this work:And I still get to keep the good old git diff.If you happen to already have a diff tool associated with filetypes (say, because you installed TortoiseSVN which comes with a diff viewer) you could just pipe the regular git diff output to a "temp" file, then just open that file directly without needing to know anything about the viewer:Setting it as a global alias works even better: git whatIf you\'re not one for the command line then if you install tortoise git you can right click on a file to get a tortoisegit submenu with the "Diff later" option.When you select this on the first file you can then right click on the second file, go to the tortoisegit submenu and select "Diff with ==yourfilehere=="\nThis will give the tortoisegitmerge gui for the result.After looking at some other external diff tools, I found that the diff view in IntelliJ IDEA (and Android Studio) is the best one for me.If you want to use IntelliJ IDEA as your diff tool you should first setup IntelliJ IDEA to be run from the command line following the instructions here:On macOS or UNIX:On Windows:Following the instructions on this blog post:BashFishNow add the following to your git config:You can try it out with git difftool or git difftool HEAD~1You may want to try out xd http://github.com/jiqingtang/xd, which is GUI wrapper for GIT/SVN diff. It is NOT a diff tool itself. You run xd when you want to run git diff or svn diff and it will show you a list of files, a preview window and you can launch any diff tool you like, including tkdiff, xxdiff, gvimdiff, emacs(ediff), xemacs(ediff), meld, diffuse, kompare and kdiff3. You can also run any custom tool.Unfortunately the tool doesn\'t support Windows.Disclosure: I am the author of this tool.
