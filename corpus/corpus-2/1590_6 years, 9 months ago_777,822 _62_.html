I\'m trying to create a randomized string in PHP, and I get absolutely no output with this:What am I doing wrong?To answer this question specifically, two problems: Here\'s a code snippet with the corrections:Output the random string with the call below:Please note that this generates predictable random strings. If you want to create secure tokens, see this answer.Note: str_shuffle() internally uses rand(), which is unsuitable for cryptography purposes (e.g. generating random passwords). You want a secure random number generator instead. It also doesn\'t allow characters to repeat.UPDATED (now this generates any length of string):That\'s it. :) There are a lot of answers to this question, but none of them leverage a Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator (CSPRNG).The simple, secure, and correct answer is to use RandomLib and don\'t reinvent the wheel.For those of you who insist on inventing your own solution, PHP 7.0.0 will provide random_int() for this purpose; if you\'re still on PHP 5.x, we wrote a PHP 5 polyfill for random_int() so you can use the new API even before you upgrade to PHP 7.Safely generating random integers in PHP isn\'t a trivial task. You should always check with your resident StackExchange cryptography experts before you deploy a home-grown algorithm in production.With a secure integer generator in place, generating a random string with a CSPRNG is a walk in the park.Usage:Demo: https://3v4l.org/KKlc3 (Ignore the PHP 5 failures; it needs random_compat)@tasmaniski: your answer worked for me. I had the same problem, and I would suggest it for those who are ever looking for the same answer. Here it is from @tasmaniski:Creates a 20 char long hexdec string:In PHP 7 (random_bytes()):Depending on your application (I wanted to generate passwords), you could useBeing base64, they may contain = or - as well as the requested characters. You could generate a longer string, then filter and trim it to remove those.openssl_random_pseudo_bytes seems to be the recommended way way to generate a proper random number in php. Why rand doesn\'t use /dev/random I don\'t know.I know this may be a bit late to the game, but here is a simple one-liner that generates a true random string without any script level looping or use of openssl libraries.To break it down so the parameters are clearThis method works by randomly repeating the character list, then shuffles the combined string, and returns the number of characters specified.You can further randomize this, by randomizing the length of the returned string, replacing $chrRandomLength with mt_rand(8, 15) (for a random string between 8 and 15 characters).A better way to implement this function is:mt_rand is more random according to this and this in php7. rand function is an alias of mt_rand.$randstring in the function scope is not the same as the scope where you call it. You have to assign the return value to a variable.Or just directly echo the return value:Also, in your function you have a little mistake. Within the for loop, you need to use .= so each character gets appended to the string. By using = you are overwriting it with each new character instead of appending.Tada!First, you define the alphabet you want to use:Then, use openssl_random_pseudo_bytes() to generate proper random data:Finally, you use this random data to create the password. Because each character in $random can be chr(0) until chr(255), the code uses the remainder after division of its ordinal value with $alphabet_length to make sure only characters from the alphabet are picked (note that doing so biases the randomness):Alternatively, and generally better, is to use RandomLib and SecurityLib:Here are some shortest method to generate the random stringThis one was taken from adminer sources:Adminer, database management tool written in PHP.One very quick way is to do something like:This will generate a random string with the length of 10 chars. Of course, some might say it\'s a bit more heavy on the computational side, but nowadays processors are optimized to run md5 or sha256 algorithm very quickly. And of course, if the rand() function returns the same value, the result will be the same, having a 1 / 32767 chance of being the same. If security\'s the issue, then just change rand() to mt_rand() The edited version of the function works fine, just one issue I found: You used the wrong character to enclose $characters, so the \xe2\x80\x99 character is sometimes part of the random string that is generated.To fix this, change:to:This way only the enclosed characters are used, and the \xe2\x80\x99 character will never be a part of the random string that is generated.Another one-liner, which generates a random string of 10 chars with letters and numbers. It will create an array with range (adjust the second parameter to set the size), loops over this array and assigns a random ascii-char (range 0-9 or a-z), then implodes the array to get a string.Note: only works in PHP 5.3+Helper function from Laravel 5 frameworkI liked the last comment which used openssl_random_pseudo_bytes, but it wasn\'t a solution for me as I still had to remove the characters I didn\'t want, and I wasn\'t able to get a set length string.   Here is my solution...one line.fast for huge strings with some uniqueness.Another way to generate a random string in PHP is:There is a simple code:There is simple guide:finally i have found a solution to get random and unique value \nmy solution is time always return timstamp and it is always unique. you can use it with md5 to make it better. Here is how I am doing it to get a true unique random key:You can use time() since it is a Unix timestamp and is always unique compared to other random mentioned above. You can then generate the md5sum of that and take the desired length you need from the generated MD5 string. In this case I am using 10 characters, and I could use a longer string if I would want to make it more unique.I hope this helps.Source: PHP Function that Generates Random CharactersThis PHP function worked for me:Usage: The following function generates pseudo string of any length.
