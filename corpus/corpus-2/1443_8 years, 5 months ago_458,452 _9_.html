This question already has an answer here:Given a string:How do I convert it to an InputStream?Like this:Note that this assumes that you want an InputStream that is a stream of bytes that represent your original string encoded as UTF-8.For versions of Java less than 7, use "UTF-8" instead.I find that using Apache Commons IO makes my life much easier.You may find that the library also offer many other shortcuts to commonly done tasks that you may be able to use in your project.You could use a StringReader and convert the reader to an input stream using the solution in this other stackoverflow post.
