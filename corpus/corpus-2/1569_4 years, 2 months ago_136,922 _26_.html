Visual Studio 2013 introduced a new feature where it shows you how many times each of your methods are used.I don\'t find it very useful, and it messes up the spacing of my file. How do I disable it? Can\'t seem to find the option.I guess you probably are running the preview of VS2013 Ultimate, because it is not present in my professional preview. But looking online I found that the feature is called Code Information Indicators or CodeLens, and can be located under  Tools \xe2\x86\x92 Options \xe2\x86\x92 Text Editor \xe2\x86\x92 All Languages \xe2\x86\x92 CodeLens (for RC/final version)orTools \xe2\x86\x92 Options \xe2\x86\x92 Text Editor \xe2\x86\x92 All Languages \xe2\x86\x92 Code Information Indicators (for preview version)That was according to this link. It seems to be pretty well hidden.In Visual Studio 2013 RTM, you can also get to the CodeLens options by right clicking the indicators themselves in the editor:documented in the Q&A section of the msdn CodeLens documentationAnother option is to use mouse, right click on "x reference". Context menu "CodeLens Options" will appear, saving all the navigation headache.In VSCode for Mac (0.10.6) I opened "Preferences -> User Settings" and placed the following code in the settings.json fileUser and Workspace SettingsWorkaround....In VS 2015 Professional (and probably other versions).\nGo to Tools / Options / Environment / Fonts and Colours.\nIn the "Show Settings For" drop-down, select "CodeLens"\nChoose the smallest font you can find e.g. Calibri 6.\nChange the foreground colour to your editor foreground colour (say "White")\nClick OK.The other features of CodeLens like: Show Bugs, Show Test Status, etc (other than Show Reference) might be useful.However, if the only way to disable Show References is to disable CodeLens altogether.Then, I guess I could do just that.Furthermore, I would do like I always have, \'right-click on a member and choose Find all References or Ctrl+K, R\'If I wanted to know what references the member -- I too like not having any extra information crammed into my code, like extra white-space.In short, uncheck Codelens...
