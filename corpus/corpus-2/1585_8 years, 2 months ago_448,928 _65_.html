I\'ve been learning Functions and Stored Procedure for quite a while but I don\'t know why and when I should use a function or a stored procedure. They look same to me, maybe because I am kinda newbie about that.Can some one tell me why?Functions are computed values and cannot perform permanent environmental changes to SQL Server (i.e. no INSERT or UPDATE statements allowed).A Function can be used inline in SQL Statements if it returns a scalar value or can be joined upon if it returns a result set.The difference between SP and UDF is listed below:Functions and stored procedures serve separate purposes. Although it\'s not the best analogy, functions can be viewed literally as any other function you\'d use in any programming language, but stored procs are more like individual programs or a batch script.Functions normally have an output and optionally inputs. The output can then be used as the input to another function (a SQL Server built-in such as DATEDIFF, LEN, etc) or as a predicate to a SQL Query - e.g., SELECT a, b, dbo.MyFunction(c) FROM table or SELECT a, b, c FROM table WHERE a = dbo.MyFunc(c).Stored procs are used to bind SQL queries together in a transaction, and interface with the outside world. Frameworks such as ADO.NET, etc. can\'t call a function directly, but they can call a stored proc directly.Functions do have a hidden danger though: they can be misused and cause rather nasty performance issues: consider this query:Where MyFunction is declared as:What happens here is that the function MyFunction is called for every row in the table MyTable. If MyTable has 1000 rows, then that\'s another 1000 ad-hoc queries against the database. Similarly, if the function is called when specified in the column spec, then the function will be called for each row returned by the SELECT.So you do need to be careful writing functions. If you do SELECT from a table in a function, you need to ask yourself whether it can be better performed with a JOIN in the parent stored proc or some other SQL construct (such as CASE ... WHEN ... ELSE ... END).Write a user-defined function when you want to compute and return a value for use in other SQL statements; write a stored procedure when you want instead is to group a possibly-complex set of SQL statements. These are two pretty different use cases, after all!Differences between stored procedures and user-defined functions:a User Defined Function is an important tool available to a sql server programmer. You can use it inline in a SQL statement like sowhere lookupValue will be an UDF. This kind of functionality is not possible when using a stored procedure. At the same time you cannot do certain things inside a UDF. The basic thing to remember here is that UDF\'s:a stored procedure can do those things. For me the inline usage of a UDF is the most important usage of a UDF.Basic DifferenceFunction must return a value but in Stored Procedure it is optional( Procedure can return zero or n values).Functions can have only input parameters for it whereas Procedures can have input/output parameters .Function takes one input parameter it is mandatory but Stored Procedure may take o to n input parameters..Functions can be called from Procedure whereas Procedures cannot be called from Function.Advance DifferenceProcedure allows SELECT as well as DML(INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) statement in it whereas Function allows only SELECT statement in it.Procedures can not be utilized in a SELECT statement whereas Function can be embedded in a SELECT statement.Stored Procedures cannot be used in the SQL statements anywhere in the WHERE/HAVING/SELECT section whereas Function can be.Functions that return tables can be treated as another rowset. This can be used in JOINs with other tables.Inline Function can be though of as views that take parameters and can be used in JOINs and other Rowset operations.Exception can be handled by try-catch block in a Procedure whereas try-catch block cannot be used in a Function.We can go for Transaction Management in Procedure whereas we can\'t go in Function.sourceStored Procedures are used as scripts. They run series of commands for you and you can schedule them to run at certain times. Functions are used as methods. You pass it something and it returns a result. Should be small and fast - does it on the fly.To decide on when to use what the following points might help-Stored procedures can\'t return a table variable where as function can do that.You can use stored procedures to alter the server environment parameters where as using functions you can\'t.cheersSQL Server functions, like cursors, are meant to be used as your last weapon! They do have performance issues and therefore using a table-valued function should be avoided as much as possible. Talking about performance is talking about a table with more than 1,000,000 records hosted on a server on a middle-class hardware; otherwise you don\'t need to worry about the performance hit caused by the functions.for further reference see: http://databases.aspfaq.com/database/should-i-use-a-view-a-stored-procedure-or-a-user-defined-function.htmlStored procedure:Function:Can only be used to select records. However, it can be called\nvery easily from within standard SQL, such as:orFor simple reusable select operations, functions can simplify code.\nJust be wary of using JOIN clauses in your functions.  If your\nfunction has a JOIN clause and you call it from another select\nstatement that returns multiple results, that function call with JOIN\nthose tables together for each line returned in the result set. So\nthough they can be helpful in simplifying some logic, they can also be a\nperformance bottleneck if they\'re not used properly.Start with functions that return a single value.  The nice thing is you can put frequently used code into a function and return them as a column in a result set.Then, you might use a function for a parameterized list of cities.  dbo.GetCitiesIn("NY")  That returns a table that can be used as a join.It\'s a way of organizing code.  Knowing when something is reusable and when it is a waste of time is something only gained through trial and error and experience.Also, functions are a good idea in SQL Server.  They are faster and can be quite powerful.  Inline and direct selects.  Careful not to overuse.Functions can be used in a select statement where as procedures cannot.Stored procedure takes both input and output parameters but Functions takes only input parameters.Functions cannot return values of type text, ntext, image & timestamps where as procedures can.    Functions can be used as user defined datatypes in create table but  procedures cannot.***Eg:-create table <tablename>(name varchar(10),salary getsal(name))Here getsal is a user defined function which returns a salary type, when table is created no storage is allotted for salary type, and getsal function is also not executed, But when we are fetching some values from this table, getsal function get\xe2\x80\x99s executed and the return\nType is returned as the result set.Here\'s a practical reason to prefer functions over stored procedures.  If you have a stored procedure that needs the results of another stored procedure, you have to use an insert-exec statement.  This means that you have to create a temp table and use an exec statement to insert the results of the stored procedure into the temp table.  It\'s messy.  One problem with this is that insert-execs cannot be nested.If you\'re stuck with stored procedures that call other stored procedures, you may run into this.  If the nested stored procedure simply returns a dataset, it can be replaced with a table-valued function and you\'ll no longer get this error.(this is yet another reason we should keep business logic out of the database)In SQL Server, functions and stored procedure are two different types of entities. Function: In SQL Server database, the functions are used to perform some actions and the action returns a result immediately.\nFunctions are two types:System defined User definedStored Procedures: In SQL Server, the stored procedures are stored in server and it can be return zero, single and multiple values.\nStored Procedures are two types:Differences between Stored Procedure and User Defined Function
