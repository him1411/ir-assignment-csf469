I\'ve renamed some files in a fairly large project and want to remove the .pyc files they\'ve left behind. I tried the bash script:But that doesn\'t recurse through the folders as I thought it would. What am I doing wrong?as mentioned in the comments, you can also use the -delete actionfind . -name \'*.pyc\' -deleteSurely the simplest.In current version of debian you have pyclean script which is in python-minimal package. Usage is simple:Add to your ~/.bashrc:This removes all .pyc and .pyo files, and __pycache__ directories. It\'s also very fast.Usage is simply:If you\'re using bash >=4.0 (or zsh)Note that */*.pyc selects all .pyc files in the immediate first-level subdirectories while **/*.pyc recursively scans the whole directory tree. As an example, foo/bar/qux.pyc will be deleted by rm **/*.pyc but not by */*.pyc.The globstar shell options must be enabled. To enable globstar:and to check its status:I used to use an alias for that:The find recursively looks for *.pyc files.  The xargs takes that list of names and sends it to rm.  The -print0 and the -0 tell the two commands to seperate the filenames with null characters.  This allows it to work correctly on file names containing spaces, and even a file name containing a new line.  The solution with -exec works, but it spins up a new copy of rm for every file.  On a slow system or with a great many files, that\'ll take too long.You could also add a couple more args:iname adds case insensitivity, like *.PYC .  The no-run-if-empty keeps you from getting an error from rm if you have no such files.This is faster thanJust to throw another variant into the mix, you can also use backquotes like this:Note: This answer is very specific to Django project that have already been using Django Extension.The implementation can be viewed in its source code.full recursiveFor windows users:First run:Then add:To ~/.profileFurther, people usually want to remove all *.pyc files and __pycache__ directories recursively in the current directory.Command:rm -r recurses into directories, but only the directories you give to rm. It will also delete those directories. One solution is:find will find all *.pyc files recursively in the current directory, and the for loop will iterate through the list of files found, removing each one.
