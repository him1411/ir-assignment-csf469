I want to know what the difference is between null and undefined in JavaScript.In JavaScript, undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value, such as:null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value:From the preceding examples, it is clear that undefined and null are two distinct types: undefined is a type itself (undefined) while null is an object.andI picked this from here The undefined value is a primitive value used when a variable has not\n  been assigned a value.The null value is a primitive value that represents the null, empty,\n  or non-existent reference.When you declare a variable through var and do not give it a value, it will have the value undefined. By itself, if you try to WScript.Echo() or alert() this value, you won\'t see anything. However, if you append a blank string to it then suddenly it\'ll appear:You can declare a variable, set it to null, and the behavior is identical except that you\'ll see "null" printed out versus "undefined". This is a small difference indeed.You can even compare a variable that is undefined to null or vice versa, and the condition will be true:They are, however, considered to be two different types. While undefined is a type all to itself, null is considered to be a special object value. You can see this by using typeof() which returns a string representing the general type of a variable:Running the above script will result in the following output:Regardless of their being different types, they will still act the same if you try to access a member of either one, e.g. that is to say they will throw an exception. With WSH you will see the dreaded "\'varname\' is null or not an object" and that\'s if you\'re lucky (but that\'s a topic for another article).You can explicitely set a variable to be undefined, but I highly advise against it. I recommend only setting variables to null and leave undefined the value for things you forgot to set. At the same time, I really encourage you to always set every variable. JavaScript has a scope chain different than that of C-style languages, easily confusing even veteran programmers, and setting variables to null is the best way to prevent bugs based on it.Another instance where you will see undefined pop up is when using the delete operator. Those of us from a C-world might incorrectly interpret this as destroying an object, but it is not so. What this operation does is remove a subscript from an Array or a member from an Object. For Arrays it does not effect the length, but rather that subscript is now considered undefined.The result of the above script is:You will also get undefined returned when reading a subscript or member that never existed.The difference between null and undefined is: JavaScript will never set anything to null, that\'s usually what we do. While we can set variables to undefined, we prefer null because it\'s not something that is ever done for us. When you\'re debugging this means that anything set to null is of your own doing and not JavaScript. Beyond that, these two special values are nearly equivalent.null is a special keyword that indicates an absence of value. think about it as a value, like:undefined property indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value including null too .\nLikedefined empty variable is null of datatype undefinedBoth of them are representing a  value of a variable with no valueAND\nnull doesn\'t represent a string that has no value - empty string-LikeNow if BUTSO each one has it own way to use undefined use it to compare the variable data type null use it to empty a value of a variable null: absence of value for a variable; undefined: absence of variable itself;..where variable is a symbolic name associated with a value.JS could be kind enough to implicitly init newly declared variables with null, but it does not.Undefined means a variable has been declared but has no value:Null is an assignment:You might consider undefined to represent a system-level, unexpected, or error-like absence of value and null to represent program-level, normal, or expected absence of value.via JavaScript:The Definitive GuideI\'ll explain undefined, null and Uncaught ReferenceError:1 - Uncaught ReferenceError : variable has not been declared in your script, there is no reference to this varaible \n2 - undefined: Variable declared but does not initialised \n3 - null : Variable declared and is an empty value null and undefined are two distinct object types which have the following in common:The similarities however end here. For once, there is a fundamental difference in the way how keywords null and undefined are implemented. This is not obvious, but consider the following example:undefined, NaN and Infinity are just names of preinitialized "superglobal" variables - they are initialized at run-time and can be overridden by normal global or local variable with the same names. Now, let\'s try the same thing with null:Oops! null, true and false are reserved keywords - compiler won\'t let you use them as variable or property namesAnother difference is that undefined is a primitive type, while null is an object type (indicating the absense of an object reference). Consider the following:Also, there is an important difference in the way null and undefined are treated in numeric context:null becomes 0 when used in arithmetic expressions or numeric comparisons - similarly to false, it is basically just a special kind of "zero". undefined, on the other hand, is a true "nothing" and becomes NaN ("not a number") when you try to use it in numeric context.Note that null and undefined receive a special treatment from == and != operators, but you can test true numeric equality of a and b with the expression (a >= b && a <= b).null is a special value meaning "no value". null is a special object because typeof null returns \'object\'.On the other hand, undefined means that the variable has not been declared, or has not been given a value.Source.Please read the following carefully. It shall remove all your doubts regarding\nthe the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript. Also you can use the utility function given below to exactly determine types.In JavaScript we can have following types of variables. Following explains each of these cases one by one Undeclared Variables: Following holds true for undeclared variablesDeclared but Unassigned VariablesVariables  assigned with literal undefined: These variables are treated similarly as the Declared But Unassigned Variables.Variables assigned with  literal nullVariables assigned with anything other than undefined or nullFollowing provides the algorithm for correct type checking of a variable:You can also use the following utility function for determining types. It currently supports all ECMA 262 2017 types.In JavasSript there are 5 primitive data types String , Number , Boolean , null and undefined.\nI will try to explain with some simple examplelets say we have a simple functionalso in above function if(a == null) is same as if(!a)now when we call this function without passing the parameter aalsothis will give undefined; we have declared a variable but we have not asigned any value to this variable;\n but if we writeso null is an object. in a way we have assigned a value null to \'a\'Both Null and undefined in JavaScript indicate absence of value.Despite the fact both exist for absence of value but: Undefined\n  actually means the variable is not initialized. Functions that return\n  nothing and function parameters for which no value is supplied,\n  undefined value is returned. Use strict equality operator === to\n  distinguish between null and undefined.Reference: http://www.thesstech.com/javascript/null-and-undefinedOK, we may get confused when we hear about null and undefined, but let\'s start it simple, they both are falsy and similar in many ways, but weird part of JavaScript, make them couple of significant differences, for example, typeof null is \'object\' while typeof undefined is \'undefined\'.But if you check them with == as below, you see they are both falsy:Also you can assign null to an object property or to a primitive, while undefined can simply be achieved by not assigning to anything.I create a quick image to show the differences for you at a glance.null is a language keyword that evaluates to a special value that is usually used to\nindicate the absence of a value. Using the typeof operator on null returns the string\n\xe2\x80\x9cobject\xe2\x80\x9d, indicating that null can be thought of as a special object value that indicates\n\xe2\x80\x9cno object\xe2\x80\x9d. In practice, however, null is typically regarded as the sole member of its\nown type, and it can be used to indicate \xe2\x80\x9cno value\xe2\x80\x9d for numbers and strings as well as\nobjects. Most programming languages have an equivalent to JavaScript\xe2\x80\x99s null: you may\nbe familiar with it as null or nil.JavaScript also has a second value that indicates absence of value. The undefined value\nrepresents a deeper kind of absence. It is the value of variables that have not been\ninitialized and the value you get when you query the value of an object property or array\nelement that does not exist. The undefined value is also returned by functions that have\nno return value, and the value of function parameters for which no argument is supplied.\nundefined is a predefined global variable (not a language keyword like null) that\nis initialized to the undefined value. In ECMAScript 3, undefined is a read/write variable,\nand it can be set to any value. This error is corrected in ECMAScript 5 and\nundefined is read-only in that version of the language. If you apply the typeof operator\nto the undefined value, it returns \xe2\x80\x9cundefined\xe2\x80\x9d, indicating that this value is the sole\nmember of a special type.Despite these differences, null and undefined both indicate an absence of value and\ncan often be used interchangeably. The equality operator == considers them to be equal.\n(Use the strict equality operator === to distinguish them.) Both are falsy values\xe2\x80\x94they\nbehave like false when a boolean value is required. Neither null nor undefined have\nany properties or methods. In fact, using . or [] to access a property or method of these\nvalues causes a TypeError.You might consider undefined to represent a system-level, unexpected, or error-like\nabsence of value and null to represent program-level, normal, or expected absence of\nvalue. If you need to assign one of these values to a variable or property or pass one of\nthese values to a function, null is almost always the right choice.As typeof returns undefined, undefined is a type where as null is an initializer indicates the variable points to no object(virtually everything in Javascript is an object).null and undefined are both are used to represent the absence of some value.a is initialized and defined.null is an object in JavaScriptb is undefined and uninitializedundefined object properties are also undefined. For example "x" is not defined on object c and if you try to access c.x, it will return undefined.Generally we assign null to variables not undefined.For the undefined type, there is one and only one value: undefined. For the null type, there is one and only one value: null. So for both of them, the label is both its type and its value. The difference between them. For example:Or:Actually, null is a special keyword, not an identifier, and thus you cannot treat it as a variable to assign to.However, undefined is an identifier. In both non-strict mode and strict mode, however, you can create a local variable of the name undefined. But this is one terrible idea!tl;drUse null for set a variable you know it is an Object.Use undefined for set a variable whose type is mixed.This is my usage of both 5 primitives and Object type, and that explain the difference between \xc2\xab use case \xc2\xbb of undefined or null.StringIf you know a variable is only a string while all lifecycle, by convention, you could initialize it, to "":NumberIf you know a variable is only a number while all lifecycle, by convention, you could initialize it, to 0 (or NaN if 0 is an important value in your usage):orBooleanIf you know a variable is only a boolean while all lifecycle, by convention, you could initialize it, to false:ObjectIf you know a variable is only an Object while all lifecycle, by convention, you could initialize it, to null:Note: the smart usage off null is to be the falsy version of an Object because an Object is always true, and because typeof null return object. That means typeof myVarObject return consistent value for both Object and null type.AllIf you know a variable has a mixed type (any type while all lifecycle), by convention, you could initialize it, to undefined.null - It is an assignment value. Which is used with variable to represent no value. (its an object)undefined - It is an variable which do not have any value assigned to it. So javascript will assign a undefined to it. (its an data type)undeclared - If variable is not created at all it is known as undeclared.The difference between undefined and null is minimal, but there is a difference. A variable whose value is undefined has never been initialized. A variable whose value is null was explicitly given a value of null, which means that the variable was explicitly set to have no value. If you compare undefined and null by using the null==undefined expression, they will be equal.Per Ryan Morr\'s thorough article on this subject..."Generally, if you need to assign a non-value to a variable or property, pass it to a function, or return it from a function, null is almost always the best option. To put it simply, JavaScript uses undefined and programmers should use null."See Exploring the Eternal Abyss of Null and UndefinedWith JavaScript, null is for objects, undefined is for variables, properties, and methods.To be null, an object has to be defined, otherwise it will be undefined.If you want to test if an object exists, this will throw an error if the object is undefined:Incorrect:Because of this, you must test typeof() first:Correct:When a value is null, it is nothing and contains nothing. An empty value or variable is still full; it\xe2\x80\x99s just full of emptiness. Emptiness is different from null, which is just plain nothing. For example, defining a variable and setting its value to an empty string looks like this: The variable myVariable is empty, but it is not null.Undefined is a state, sometimes used like a value, to represent a variable that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet contained a value. such as var abcd; . This state is different from null, although both null and undefined can evaluate the same way.undefined is a type itself (undefined) \nwhile null is an object.Basically, Undefined is a global variable that javascript create at the run time whether null means that no value has assigned to the variable (actually null is itself an object).Let\'s take an example:Undefined that\'s what you will get as output.Now,       and you will get 5 as output. That\'s the main difference between the Undefined and nullIn javascript all variables are stored as key value pairs.  Each variable is stored as variable_name : variable_value/reference.undefined means a variable has been given a space in memory, but no value is assigned to it.  As a best practice, you should not use this type as an assignment.In that case how to denote when you want a variable to be without value at a later point in the code?  You can use the type\nnull ,which is also a type that is used to define the same thing, absence of a value, but it is not the same as undefined, as in this case you actually have the value in memory.  That value is nullBoth are similar but usage and meaning are different.If a variable is not initialized then it is undefined.\nundefined is not a object.\nExample:  var MyName;\n          console.log(typeof MyName);Check the console log in development tool, it will be printed as undefined.null is a a object.If you want some variable to be null then null is used.null variable exists but value is not known.It should be assigned to a variable pro grammatically.  null is not automatically initialized.Example : var MyName = null;\n          console.log(typeof MyName);\nCheck the csole log in development tool, it will be an object.Just to add my views - A variable that is declared only, and never used anywhere, is removed off by an optimizing compiler in case of compiled languages like C++[or a warning is flagged in the IDE]. It ultimately means that the variable is non-existent because it\'s memory is never allocated.In case of javascript interpreter, [I guess] a variable is treated as existing only from the point onwards where it is given a value. Before that point, it\'s type is "undefined", and no memory is allocated for it. And, so its type is undefined.A null in javascript is a value that represents an address, but that address points to nothing yet[non-existent reference]. Nevertheless, its a value.Null is ALWAYS an unknown object that exists in memory, whereas undefined is not.
