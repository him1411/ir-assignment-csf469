C++17 is now feature complete, so unlikely to experience large changes. Hundreds of proposals were put forward for C++17.Which of those features were added to C++ in C++17?When using a C++ compiler that supports "C++1z", which of those features are going to be available when the compiler updates to C++17?Template argument deduction for class templatestemplate <auto>Non-type template arguments fixestemplate<template<class...>typename bob> struct foo {}( Folding + ... + expressions )  and Revisionsauto x{8}; is an intmodernizing using with ... and listsconstexpr lambdasCapturing *this in lambdas[[fallthrough]], [[nodiscard]], [[maybe_unused]] attributes [[attributes]] on namespaces and enum { erator[[s]] }using in attributes to avoid having to repeat an attribute namespace.Compilers are now required to ignore non-standard attributes they don\'t recognize.Inline variablesnamespace A::BSimple static_assert(expression); with no stringno throw unless throw(), and throw() is noexcept(true).Structured bindingsif (init; condition) and switch (init; condition)Generalizing range-based for loopsif constexprHexadecimal float point literalsDynamic memory allocation for over-aligned dataGuaranteed copy elisionFixed order-of-evaluation for (some) expressions with some modificationsDirect list-initialization of enumsForward progress guarantees (FPG) (also, FPGs for parallel algorithms)u8\'U\', u8\'T\', u8\'F\', u8\'8\' character literals (string already existed)"noexcept" in the type system__has_includeArrays of pointer conversion fixesinherited constructors fixes to some corner cases (see P0136R0 for examples of behavior changes)aggregate initialization with inheritance.std::launder, type punning, etcstd::variant<Ts...>std::optionalstd::anystd::string_viewstd::byte off more than they could chew.std::make_from_tuple, std::apply applied to object constructionis_invocable, is_invocable_r, invoke_result[class.path][class.filesystem.error][class.file_status][class.directory_entry][class.directory_iterator] and [class.recursive_directory_iterator][fs.ops.funcs]fstreams can be opened with paths, as well as with const path::value_type* strings.for_each_nreducetransform_reduceexclusive_scaninclusive_scantransform_exclusive_scantransform_inclusive_scanAdded for threading purposes, exposed even if you aren\'t using them threadedstd::shared_mutexatomic<T>::is_always_lockfreescoped_lock<Mutexes...>Parallelism TS v1hardware_*_interference_size[pmr]std::sample, sampling from a range?try_emplace and insert_or_assignSplicing for map<>, unordered_map<>, set<>, and unordered_set<>non-const .data() for string.non-member std::size, std::empty, std::dataMinimal incomplete type support in containersContiguous iterator "concept"constexpr iteratorsThe emplace family of functions now returns a reference to the created object.C++17 library is based on C11 instead of C99Reserved std[0-9]+ for future standard librariesdestroy(_at|_n), uninitialized_move(_n), uninitialized_value_construct(_n), uninitialized_default_construct(_n)Isocpp.org has has an independent list of changes since C++14; it has been partly pillaged.Naturally TS work continues in parallel, so there are some TS that are not-quite-ripe that will have to wait for the next iteration.  The target for the next iteration is C++20 as previously planned, not C++19 as some rumors implied.  C++1\xce\xa9 has been avoided.Initial list taken from this reddit post and this reddit post, with links added via googling or from the above isocpp.org page.Additional entries pillaged from SD-6 feature-test list.clang\'s feature list and library feature list are next to be pillaged.  This doesn\'t seem to be reliable, as it is C++1z, not C++17.these slides had some features missing elsewhere.While "what was removed" was not asked, here is a short list of a few things ((mostly?) previous deprecated) that are removed in C++17 from C++:There were rewordings.  I am unsure if these have any impact on code, or if they are just cleanups in the standard:P0505R0 (constexpr chrono)P0418R2 (atomic tweaks)P0512R0 (template argument deduction tweaks)P0490R0 (structured binding tweaks)P0513R0 (changes to std::hash)P0502R0 (parallel exceptions)P0509R1 (updating restrictions on exception handling)P0012R1 (make exception specifications be part of the type system)P0510R0 (restrictions on variants)P0504R0 (tags for optional/variant/any)P0497R0 (shared ptr tweaks)P0508R0 (structured bindings node handles)P0521R0 (shared pointer use count and unique changes?)papers grouped by year; not all acceptedhttps://isocpp.org/files/papers/p0636r0.html
