Is there a method to be able to remove an item from an JavaScript array like from this array:And I do an function like whereas:I\'ve looked into splice() but that only removes by the position number, where I need something to remove an item by its value.This can be a global function  or a method of a custom object, if you aren\'t allowed to add to native prototypes. It removes all of the items from the array that match any of the arguments.To make it a global-And to take care of IE8 and below-You\'re looking for the indexOf method\nFor example:Note that you\'ll need to add it for IE 8 and below.A one-liner will do it,This makes use of the filter function in JS. It\'s supported in IE9 and up.What it does (from the doc link)filter() calls a provided callback function once for each element in an array, and constructs a new array of all the values for which callback returns a value that coerces to true. callback is invoked only for indexes of the array which have assigned values; it is not invoked for indexes which have been deleted or which have never been assigned values. Array elements which do not pass the callback test are simply skipped, and are not included in the new array.So basically, this is the same as all the other for (var key in ary) { ... } solutions, except that the for in construct is supported as of IE6.Basically, filter is a convenience method that looks a lot nicer (and is chainable) as opposed to the for in construct (AFAIK).You can use underscore.js. It really makes things simple.For example, with this:And result will be [\'three\',\'eleven\'].In your case the code that you will have to write is:It reduces the code that you write.Check out this way:and in a function:Here\'s a version that uses jQuery\'s inArray function:What you\'re after is filterhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filterThis will allow you to do the following:This was also noted in this thread somewhere else:  https://stackoverflow.com/a/20827100/293492Removing all matching elements from the array (rather than just the first as seems to be the most common answer here):I used jQuery for the heavy lifting, but you get the idea if you want to go native.Seeing as there isn\'t a pretty one, here\'s a simple and reusable ES6 function.Usage:indexOf is an option, but it\'s implementation is basically searching the entire array for the value, so execution time grows with array size. (so it is in every browser I guess, I only checked Firefox).I haven\'t got an IE6 around to check, but I\'d call it a safe bet that you can check at least a million array items per second this way on almost any client machine. If [array size]*[searches per second] may grow bigger than a million you should consider a different implementation.Basically you can use an object to make an index for your array, like so:Any sane JavaScript environment will create a searchable index for such objects so that you can quickly translate a key into a value, no matter how many properties the object has.This is just the basic method, depending on your need you may combine several objects and/or arrays to make the same data quickly searchable for different properties. If you specify your exact needs I can suggest a more specific data structure.a very clean solution working in all browsers and without any framework is to asign a new Array and simply return it without the item you want to delete:The trick is to go through the array from end to beginning, so you don\'t mess up the indices while removing elements.arr is now  ["red", "black", "white"]Please do not use the variant with delete - it makes a hole in the array as it does not re-index the elements after the deleted item.I used the most voted option and created a function that would clean one array of words using another array of unwanted words: To use, do the following: Non-destructive removal:If you have unique values in your array, you can use Set, and it has delete:I tried using the function method from jbaron above but found that I needed to keep the original array intact for use later, and creating a new array like this:apparently creates by reference instead of value because when I removed an element from newArray the referenceArray also had it removed.  So I decided to create a new array each time like this:Then I use it like this in another function:Now the vesselArr remains intact while each time I execute the above code the otherVessels array includes all but the latest vesselID element.CoffeeScript+jQuery variant:it remove only one, not all.Example of usingAnother variation:It\'s indexOf() inside a loop again, but on the assumption that the array to remove is small relative to the array to be cleaned; every removal shortens the while loop.Highly recommend Lodash for trivial operations like that://edited thanks to MarcoCI for the advicetry this:hope this help youES6 way.
