Is it possible to pipe to/from the clipboard in Bash?Whether it is piping to/from a device handle or using an auxiliary application, I can\'t find anything.For example, if /dev/clip was a device linking to the clipboard we could do:You\'re a little ambiguous.  I expect you\'re probably a Linux user inside X who wants to put stuff in the X PRIMARY clipboard.It\'s important to understand that bash doesn\'t have a clipboard.  There is no such thing as "the" clipboard, because bash can run on Windows, Mac OS X, lots of other OSes, inside X, outside X, ...  Not to mention that X itself has three different clipboards.  There\'s a wealth of clipboards you could be dealing with.  Usually the clipboard you want to talk to has a utility that lets you talk to it.In case of X, yes, there\'s xclip (and others). xclip -selection c will send data to the clipboard that works with Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V in most applications.If you\'re trying to talk to the Mac OS X clipboard, there\'s pbcopy.If you\'re in Linux terminal mode (no X) then maybe you need to look into gpm.There\'s also GNU screen which has a clipboard.  To put stuff in there, look at the screen command "readreg".Under Windows/cygwin, use /dev/clipboard or clip for newer versions of Windows (at least Windows 10).Make sure you are using alias xclip="xclip -selection c"\notherwise you can\'t just use to Ctrl+v to paste it back in a different place.Ctrl+v === testOn Mac OS X you might find these command line tools handy:EXAMPLE:After that command content of the ~/.bashrc file will be available for pasting with cmd+v shortcut.If you do not have access to apt-get nor pacman, nor dnf, the sources are available on sourceforge.In ~/.bash_aliases, add:Do not forget to load your new configuration using . ~/.bash_aliases or by restarting your profile.In ~/.config/fish/config.fish, add:Do not forget to restart your fish instance by restarting your terminal for changes to apply.You can now use setclip and getclip, e.g:Tryxclipmanxsel on Debian/Ubuntu/MintInstallOn Windows (with Cygwin) try \ncat /dev/clipboard or echo "foo" > /dev/clipboard as mentioned in this article.Here is a ready to use bash script for reading the clipboard which works on multiple platforms.\nPlease edit the script here if you add functionality (e.g. more platforms).There are different clipboards in Linux; the X server has one, the window manager might have another one, etc. There is no standard device.Oh, yes, on CLI, the screen program has its own clipboard as well, as do some other applications like Emacs and vi.In X, you can use xclip.You can check this thread for other possible answers:\nhttp://unix.derkeiler.com/Newsgroups/comp.unix.shell/2004-07/0919.htmlFor Mac only:These are located /usr/bin/pbcopy and /usr/bin/pbpaste.Copy and paste to clipboard in Windows (Cygwin):see:$ clip.exe -?CLIP \nDescription:\n    Redirects output of command line tools to the Windows clipboard.\n    This text output can then be pasted into other programs.\nParameter List:\n/?                  Displays this help message.\nExamples:\nDIR | CLIP          Places a copy of the current directory\n                        listing into the Windows clipboard.\nCLIP < README.TXT   Places a copy of the text from readme.txt\n                        on to the Windows clipboard.Also exists getclip (can be used instead of shift+ins!), putclip (echo oaeuoa | putclip.exe to put it into clip) Does the job for x11, it is mostly already installed. \nA look in the man page of xsel is worth the effort.If you\'re like me and run on a linux server without root privileges and there\'s no xclip or gpm you could workaround this issue by just using a temporary file. For example:A few Windows programs I wrote years ago. They allow you dump, push, append and print the clipboard. It works like this:It includes source code: cmd_clip.zipThis is a simple Python script that does just what you need:Save this as an executable somewhere in your path (I saved it to /usr/local/bin/clip. You can pipe in stuff to be saved to your clipboard...And you can pipe what\'s in your clipboard to some other program...Running it by itself will simply output what\'s in the clipboard.There are a couple ways. Some of the ways that have been mentioned include (I think) tmux, screen, vim, emacs, and the shell. I don\'t know emacs or screen, so I\'ll go over the other three.While not an X selection, tmux has a copy mode accessible via prefix-[ (prefix is Ctrl+B by default). The buffer used for this mode is separate and exclusive to tmux, which opens up quite a few possibilities and makes it more versatile than the X selections in the right situations.To exit this mode, hit q; to navigate, use your vim or emacs binding (default = vim), so hjkl for movement, v/V/C-v for character/line/block selection, etc. When you have your selection, hit Enter to copy and exit the mode.To paste from this buffer, use prefix-].Any installation of X11 seems to come with two programs by default: xclip and xsel (kinda like how it also comes with both startx and xinit). Most of the other answers mention xclip, and I really like xsel for its brevity, so I\'m going to cover xsel.From xsel(1x):append standard input to the selection. Implies -i.append to selection as standard input grows. Implies -i.read standard input into the selection.write the selection to standard output.clear the selection. Overrides all input options.Request that the current selection be deleted. This not only clears the selection, but also requests to the program in which the selection resides that the selected contents be deleted. Overrides all input options.operate on the PRIMARY selection (default).operate on the SECONDARY selection.operate on the CLIPBOARD selection.And that\'s about all you need to know. p (or nothing) for PRIMARY, s for SECONDARY, b for CLIPBOARD, o for output.Example: say I want to copy the output of foo from a TTY and paste it to a webpage for a bug report. To do this, it would be ideal to copy to/from the TTY/X session. So the question becomes how do I access the clipboard from the TTY?For this example, we\'ll assume the X session is on display :1.Then I can Ctrl-V it into the form as per usual.Now say that someone on the support site gives me a command to run to fix the problem. It\'s complicated and long.Pizza ordering seems like a productive use of the command line....moving on.If compiled with +clipboard (This is important! Check your vim --version), Vim should have access to the X PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD selections. The two selections are accessible from the * and + registers, respectively, and may be written to and read from at your leisure the same as any other register. For example:If your copy of vim doesn\'t directly support access to X selections, though, it\'s not the end of the world. You can just use the xsel technique as described in the last section.Bind a couple key combos and you should be good.There is also xclip-copyfile.Although >1 year later, I share a slightly different solution. Hope this is useful for somebody.Yesterday I found myself with the question: "How to share the clipboard between different user sessions?". When switching between sessions with ctrlaltF7 - ctrlaltF8, in fact, you can\'t paste what you copied.I came up with the following quick & dirty solution, based on a named pipe. It is surely quite bare and raw, but I found it functional:then in the sending terminallast, in the receiving terminal:Now, you type or paste anything in the first terminal, and (after hitting return), it will appear immediately in the receiving terminal, from where you can Copy/Paste again anywhere you like.Of course this doesn\'t just strictly take the content from user1\'s clipboard to make it available in user2\'s clipboard, but rather it requires an additional pair of Paste & Copy clicks.From this thread, there is an option which does not require installing any gclip/xclip/xsel third-party software.A perl script (since perl is usually always installed)
