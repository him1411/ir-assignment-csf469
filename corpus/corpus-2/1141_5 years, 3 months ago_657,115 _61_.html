My version of node is always v0.6.1-pre even after I install brew node and NVM install v0.6.19.My node version is:NVM says this (after I install a version of node for the first time in one bash terminal):But when I restart bash, this is what I see:So where is this phantom node 0.6.1-pre version and how can I get rid of it? I\'m trying to install libraries via NPM so that I can work on a project.I tried using BREW to update before NVM, using "brew update" and "brew install node". \nI\'ve tried deleting the "node" directory in my /usr/local/include and the "node" and "node_modules" in my "/usr/local/lib".\nI\'ve tried uninstalling npm and reinstalling it following these instructions.All of this because I was trying to update an older version of node to install the "zipstream" library. Now there\'s folders in my users directory, and the node version STILL isn\'t up to date, even though NVM says it\'s using 0.6.19.Ideally, I\'d like to uninstall nodejs, npm, and nvm, and just reinstall the entire thing from scratch on my system.Apparently, there was a /Users/myusername/local folder that contained a include with node and lib with node and node_modules. How and why this was created instead of in my /usr/local folder, I do not know.Deleting these local references fixed the phantom v0.6.1-pre. If anyone has an explanation, I\'ll choose that as the correct answer.EDIT:You may need to do the additional instructions as well:which is the equivalent of (same as above)...or (same as above) broken down...To completely uninstall node + npm is to do the following:Then download nvm and follow the instructions to install node. The latest versions of node come with npm, I believe, but you can also reinstall that as well.To remove:To install: You can run brew info node for more details regarding your node installs.NVM (node version manager) is a portable solution for managing multiple versions of nodeI know this post is a little dated but just wanted to share the commands that worked for me in Terminal when removing Node.js.Thanks to jguix for this quick tutorial.First, create an intermediate file:Manually review your file (located in your Home folder)Then delete the files:Thanks Lenar HoytGist Comment Source: gistcomment-1572198Original Gist: TonyMtz/d75101d9bdf764c890efOn Mavericks I install it from the node pkg (from nodejs site) and I uninstall it so I can re-install using brew. I only run 4 commands in the terminal:If there is still a node installation, repeat step 2. After all is ok, I install using brew install nodeFirst:To recap, the best way (I\'ve found) to completely uninstall node + npm is to do the following:go to /usr/local/lib and delete any node and node_modulesgo to /usr/local/include and delete any node and node_modules directoryif you installed with brew install node, then run brew uninstall node in your terminalcheck your Home directory for any "local" or "lib" or "include" folders, and delete any "node" or "node_modules" from therego to /usr/local/bin and delete any node executableYou may need to do the additional instructions as well:Source: tonyMtzdowngrade node to 0.10.36upgrade node to stable vI\'m not sure if it\'s because I had an old version (4.4.5), or if it\'s because I used the official installer, but most of the files referenced in other answers didn\'t exist on my system. I only had to remove the following:I decided to keep ~/.npm because I was planning on reinstalling Node with Homebrew.I have been hit by an issue during uninstall of Node.js on my mac. I had some strange behavior like npm is still their even after having removing it with all this.It was because I had an old install done with macport. So you also have to uninstall it using port:It may have install many different versions of Node.js so uninstall them all (one by one).Expanding on Dominic Tancredi\'s awesome answer, I\'ve rolled this into a bash package and stand-alone script. If you are already using the "Back Package Manager" called bpkg you can install the script by running:Or you can have a look at the script on Github at brock/node-reinstall. The script allows you to re-install node using nvm or nave, and to specify a node version as your default.Additional to the main answer I needed to remove all npm instances found in:I had installed Node.js from source downloaded from the git repository.  I installed with:Because the make file supports it, I can do:You can clone https://github.com/brock/node-reinstall and run the simple command as given in the repository.After that just restart your system.\nThis is the simplest method and also worked for me.maybe you need to makeit helps with problem of symlinkThis fixed it for me Fixing npm On Mac OS X for Homebrew Users. And it does not require too many steps.Just go to the solution part if you don\'t care about the why.(server: ubuntu 14)1.) install nvm (node version manager) https://github.com/creationix/nvm2.) nvm install node3.) npm -v \n(inquire npm version => 3.8.6)4.) node -v\n(inquire node version => v6.0.0)
