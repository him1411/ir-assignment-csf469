I would like to manipulate the HTML inside an iframe using jQuery.I thought I\'d be able to do this by setting the context of the jQuery function to be the document of the iframe, something like:However this doesn\'t seem to work. A bit of inspection shows me that the variables in frames[\'nameOfMyIframe\'] are undefined unless I wait a while for the iframe to load. However, when the iframe loads the variables are not accessible (I get permission denied-type errors).Does anyone know of a work-around to this?I think what you are doing is subject to the same origin policy. This should be the reason why you are getting permission denied type errors.If the <iframe> is from the same domain, the elements are easily accessible asReference If the iframe src is from another domain you can still do it. You need to read the external page into PHP and echo it from your domain. Like this:Then something like this:The above is an example of how to edit an external page through an iframe without the access denied etc...Useinstead ofI find this way cleaner:You need to attach an event to an iframe\'s onload handler, and execute the js in there, so that you make sure the iframe has finished loading before accessing it.    The above will solve the \'not-yet-loaded\' problem, but as regards the permissions, if you are loading a page in the iframe that is from a different domain, you won\'t be able to access it due to security restrictions.You can use window.postMessage to call a function between page and his iframe (cross domain or not).Documentationpage.htmliframe.htmlI prefer to use other variant for accessing.\nFrom parent you can have a access to variable in child iframe.\n$ is a variable too and you can receive access to its just call\nwindow.iframe_id.$For example, window.view.$(\'div\').hide() - hide all divs in iframe with id \'view\'But, it doesn\'t work in FF. For better compatibility you should use$(\'#iframe_id\')[0].contentWindow.$I create a sample code . Now you can easily understand from different domain you can\'t access\ncontent of iframe .. Same domain we can access iframe contentI share you my code , Please run this code\ncheck the console . I print image src at console. There are four iframe , two iframe coming from same domain  & other two from other domain(third party) .You can see two image src( https://www.google.com/logos/doodles/2015/googles-new-logo-5078286822539264.3-hp2x.gifandhttps://www.google.com/logos/doodles/2015/arbor-day-2015-brazil-5154560611975168-hp2x.gif\n )\n at console and also can see two permission error(\n2\nError: Permission denied to access property \'document\'...irstChild)},contents:function(a){return m.nodeName(a,"iframe")?a.contentDocument...)  which is coming from third party iframe. Have you tried the classic, waiting for the load to complete using jQuery\'s builtin ready function?K
