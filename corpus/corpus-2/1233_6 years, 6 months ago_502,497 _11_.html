I\'m trying to install version 1.2.2 of the MySQL_python adaptor, using a fresh virtualenv created with the --no-site-packages option. The current version shown in PyPi is 1.2.3. Is there a way to install the older version? I found an article stating that this should do it:When installed, however, it still shows MySQL_python-1.2.3-py2.6.egg-info in the site packages. Is this a problem specific to this package, or am I doing something wrong?First, I see two issues with what you\'re trying to do. Since you already have an installed version, you should either uninstall the current existing driver or use pip install -I MySQL_python==1.2.2However, you\'ll soon find out that this doesn\'t work. If you look at pip\'s installation log, or if you do a pip install -Iv MySQL_python==1.2.2 you\'ll find that the PyPI URL link does not work for MySQL_python v1.2.2. You can verify this here: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python/1.2.2The download link 404s and the fallback URL links are re-directing infinitely due to sourceforge.net\'s recent upgrade and PyPI\'s stale URL.So to properly install the driver, you can follow these steps:You can even use a version range with pip install command. Something like this:One way as suggested in this post is to mention version in pip as pip install -Iv MySQL_python==1.2.2i.e. Use == and mention the version number to install only that version. -I, --ignore-installed ignores already installed packages.I believe that if you already have a package it installed, pip will not overwrite it with another version.  Use -I to ignore previous versions.
