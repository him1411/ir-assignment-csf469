Reading the changes in Python 3.1, I found something... unexpected:The sys.version_info tuple is now a named tuple:I never heard about named tuples before, and I thought elements could either be indexed by numbers (like in tuples and lists) or by keys (like in dicts). I never expected they could be indexed both ways.Thus, my questions are:Named tuples are basically easy-to-create, lightweight object types.  Named tuple instances can be referenced using object-like variable dereferencing or the standard tuple syntax.  They can be used similarly to struct or other common record types, except that they are immutable.  They were added in Python 2.6 and Python 3.0, although there is a recipe for implementation in Python 2.4.For example, it is common to represent a point as a tuple (x, y).  This leads to code like the following:Using a named tuple it becomes more readable:However, named tuples are still backwards compatible with normal tuples, so the following will still work:Thus, you should use named tuples instead of tuples anywhere you think object notation will make your code more pythonic and more easily readable.  I personally have started using them to represent very simple value types, particularly when passing them as parameters to functions.  It makes the functions more readable, without seeing the context of the tuple packing.Furthermore, you can also replace ordinary immutable classes that have no functions, only fields with them.  You can even use your named tuple types as base classes:However, as with tuples, attributes in named tuples are immutable:If you want to be able change the values, you need another type.  There is a handy recipe for mutable recordtypes which allow you to set new values to attributes.I am not aware of any form of "named list" that lets you add new fields, however.  You may just want to use a dictionary in this situation. Named tuples can be converted to dictionaries using pt1._asdict() which returns {\'x\': 1.0, \'y\': 5.0} and can be operated upon with all the usual dictionary functions.  As already noted, you should check the documentation for more information from which these examples were constructed.namedtuple is a factory function for making a tuple class. With that class we can create tuples that are callable by name also.namedtuples are a great feature, they are perfect container for data. When you have to "store" data you would use tuples or dictionaries, like:or:The dictionary approach is overwhelming, since dict are mutable and slower than tuples. On the other hand, the tuples are immutable and lightweight but lack readability for a great number of entries in the data fields.namedtuples are the perfect compromise for the two approaches, the have great readability, lightweightness and immutability (plus they are polymorphic!).To understand named tuples, you first need to know what a tuple is. A tuple is essentially an immutable (can\'t be changed in-place in memory) list.Here\'s how you might use a regular tuple:You can expand a tuple with iterable unpacking:Named tuples are tuples that allow their elements to be accessed by name instead of just index! You make a namedtuple like this:You can also use a single string with the names separated by spaces, a slightly more readable use of the API:You can do everything tuples can do (see above) as well as do the following:Use them when it improves your code to have the semantics of tuple elements expressed in your code. You can use them instead of an object if you would otherwise use an object with unchanging data attributes and no functionality. You can also subclass them to add functionality, for example:It would probably be a regression to switch from using named tuples to tuples. The upfront design decision centers around whether the cost from the extra code involved is worth the improved readability when the tuple is used. There is no extra memory used by named tuples versus tuples. You\'re looking for either a slotted object that implements all of the functionality of a statically sized list or a subclassed list that works like a named tuple (and that somehow blocks the list from changing in size.) A now expanded, and perhaps even Liskov substitutable, example of the first:And to use, just subclass and define __slots__:named tuples allow backward compatibility with code that checks for the version like thiswhile allowing future code to be more explicit by using this syntaxis one of the easiest ways to clean up your code and make it more readable. It self-documents what is happening in the tuple. Namedtuples instances are just as memory efficient as regular tuples as they do not have per-instance dictionaries, making them faster than dictionaries. Without naming each element in the tuple, it would read like this:It is so much harder to understand what is going on in the first example. With a namedtuple, each field has a name. And you access it by name rather than position or index. Instead of p[1], we can call it p.saturation. It\'s easier to understand. And it looks cleaner.Creating an instance of the namedtuple is easier than creating a dictionary.The syntaxYou can still access namedtuples by their position, if you so choose. p[1] == p.saturation. It still unpacks like a regular tuple.All the regular tuple methods are supported. Ex: min(), max(), len(), in, not in, concatenation (+), index, slice, etc. And there are a few additional ones for namedtuple. Note: these all start with an underscore. _replace, _make, _asdict._replace\nReturns a new instance of the named tuple replacing specified fields with new values.The syntaxExampleNotice: The field names are not in quotes; they are keywords here.\nRemember: Tuples are immutable - even if they are namedtuples and have the _replace method. The _replace produces a new instance; it does not modify the original or replace the old value. You can of course save the new result to the variable. p = p._replace(hue=169)_makeMakes a new instance from an existing sequence or iterable.The syntaxExampleWhat happened with the last one? The item inside the parenthesis should be the iterable. So a list or tuple inside the parenthesis works, but the sequence of values without enclosing as an iterable returns an error._asdictReturns a new OrderedDict which maps field names to their corresponding values.The syntaxExampleReference: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/38ee9d/intro_to_namedtuple/There is also named list which is similar to named tuple but mutable\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/namedlistWhat is namedtuple ?As the name suggests, namedtuple is a tuple with name.  In standard tuple, we access the elements using the index, whereas namedtuple allows user to define name for elements.  This is very handy especially processing csv (comma separated value) files and working with complex and large dataset, where the code becomes messy with the use of indices (not so pythonic).How to use them ?Reading Interesting Scenario in CSV Processing :In Python inside there is a good use of container called a named tuple, it can be used to create a definition of class and has all the features of the original tuple.Using named tuple will be directly applied to the default class template to generate a simple class, this method allows a lot of code to improve readability and it is also very convenient when defining a class.
