I thought they could be, but as I\'m not putting my money where my mouth was (so to speak) setting the readonly attribute doesn\'t actually seem to do anything.I\'d rather not use Disabled, since I want the checked check boxes to be submitted with the rest of the form, I just don\'t want the client to be able to change them under certain circumstances.you can use this:This works because returning false from the click event stops the chain of execution continuing.READONLY doesn\'t work on checkboxes as it prevents you from editing a field\'s value, but with a checkbox you\'re actually editing the field\'s state (on || off)From faqs.org:It\'s important to understand that READONLY merely prevents the user from changing the value of the field, not from interacting with the field. In checkboxes, for example, you can check them on or off (thus setting the CHECKED state) but you don\'t change the value of the field.If you don\'t want to use disabled but still want to submit the value, how about submitting the value as a hidden field and just printing its contents to the user when they don\'t meet the edit criteria? e.g.This is a checkbox you can\'t change: Just add disabled="disabled" as an attribute.\nEdit to address the comments:If you want the data to be posted back, than a simple solutions is to apply the same name to a hidden input:This way, when the checkbox is set to \'disabled\', it only serves the purpose of a visual representation of the data, instead of actually being \'linked\' to the data. In the post back, the value of the hidden input is being sent when the checkbox is disabled.But you absolutely MUST validate the data on the server to ensure it hasn\'t been changed.another "simple solution":disabled="disabled" / disabled=trueThis presents a bit of a usability issue.If you want to display a checkbox, but not let it be interacted with, why even a checkbox then? However, my approach would be to use disabled (The user expects a disabled checkbox to not be editable, instead of using JS to make an enabled one not work), and add a form submit handler using javascript that enables checkboxes right before the form is submitted. This way you you do get your values posted.ie something like this:with jquery:it still might be a good idea to give some visual hint (css, text,...), that the control won\'t accept inputs.I happened to notice the solution given below. In found it my research for the same issue. \nI don\'t who had posted it but it wasn\'t made by me. It uses jQuery:This would make the checkboxes read only which would be helpful for showing readonly data to the client.I used this to achieve the results:worked for me atleast.<input type="checkbox" onclick="return false"  /> will work for you , I am using this Some of the answers on here seem a bit roundabout, but here\'s a small hack.then in jquery you can either choose one of two options:\xe2\x80\x8bdemo:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/5WFYt/onclick="javascript: return false;"Building on the above answers, if using jQuery, this may be an good solution for all inputs:I\'m using this with Asp.Net MVC to set some form elements read only. The above works for text and check boxes by setting any parent container as .readonly such as the following scenarios:I would have commented on ConroyP\'s answer, but that requires 50 reputation which I don\'t have.  I do have enough reputation to post another answer.  Sorry.The problem with ConroyP\'s answer is that the checkbox is rendered unchangeable by not even including it on the page.  Although Electrons_Ahoy does not stipulate as much, the best answer would be one in which the unchangeable checkbox would look similar, if not the same as, the changeable checkbox, as is the case when the "disabled" attribute is applied.  A solution which addresses the two reasons Electrons_Ahoy gives for not wanting to use the "disabled" attribute would not necessarily be invalid because it utilized the "disabled" attribute.Assume two boolean variables, $checked and $disabled :The checkbox is displayed as checked if $checked is true.  The checkbox is displayed as unchecked if $checked is false.  The user can change the state of the checkbox if and only if $disabled is false.  The "my_name" parameter is not posted when the checkbox is unchecked, by the user or not.  The "my_name=1" parameter is posted when the checkbox is checked, by the user or not.  I believe this is what Electrons_Ahoy was looking for.I know that "disabled" isn\'t an acceptable answer, since the op wants it to post.  However, you\'re always going to have to validate values on the server side EVEN if you have the readonly option set.  This is because you can\'t stop a malicious user from posting values using the readonly attribute.I suggest storing the original value (server side), and setting it to disabled. Then, when they submit the form, ignore any values posted and take the original values that you stored.  It\'ll look and behave like it\'s a readonly value.  And it handles (ignores) posts from malicious users.  You\'re killing 2 birds with one stone.an alternative idea is to use an overlay and cover up your readonly inputshttp://pure-essence.net/2011/09/22/jquery-read-only-elements/The main reason people would like a read-only check-box and (as well) a read-only radio-group is so that information that cannot be changed can be presented back to the user in the form it was entered. OK disabled will do this -- unfortunately disabled controls are not keyboard navigable and therefore fall foul of all accessibility legislation. This is the BIGGEST hangup in HTML that I know of.Contributing very very late...but anyway. On page load, use jquery to disable all checkboxes except the currently selected one. Then set the currently selected one as read only so it has a similar look as the disabled ones. User cannot change the value, and the selected value still submits.I just don\'t want the client to be able to change them under certain circumstances.READONLY itself won\'t work. You may be able to do something funky w/CSS but we usually just make them disabled. WARNING: If they\'re posted back then the client can change them, period. You can\'t rely on readonly to prevent a user from changing something. The could always use fiddler or just chane the html w/firebug or some such thing.My solution is actually the opposite of FlySwat\'s solution, but I\'m not sure if it will work for your situation. I have a group of checkboxes, and each has an onClick handler that submits the form (they\'re used for changing filter settings for a table). I don\'t want to allow multiple clicks, since subsequent clicks after the first are ignored. So I disable all checkboxes after the first click, and after submitting the form:onclick="document.forms[\'form1\'].submit(); $(\'#filters input\').each(function() {this.disabled = true});"The checkboxes are in a span element with an ID of "filters" - the second part of the code is a jQuery statement that iterates through the checkboxes and disables each one. This way, the checkbox values are still submitted via the form (since the form was submitted before disabling them), and it prevents the user from changing them until the page reloads.When posting an HTML checkbox to the server, it has a string value of \'on\' or \'\'. Readonly does not stop the user editing the checkbox, and disabled stops the value being posted back.\nOne way around this is to have a hidden element to store the actual value and the displayed checkbox is a dummy which is disabled. This way the checkbox state is persisted between posts. Here is a function to do this. It uses a string of \'T\' or \'F\' and you can change this any way you like. This has been used in an ASP page using server side VB script.At the top of an ASP page you can pickup the persisted value...and when you want to output your checkbox you can do this...I have tested this and it works just fine. It also does not rely upon JavaScript.When submitting the form, we actually pass the value of the checkbox, not the state (checked/unchecked). Readonly attribute prevents us to edit the value, but not the state. If you want to have a read-only field that will represent the value you want to submit, use readonly text.If you need the checkbox to be submitted with the form but effectively read-only to the user, I recommend setting them to disabled and using javascript to re-enable them when the form is submitted.This is for two reasons. First and most important, your users benefit from seeing a visible difference between checkboxes they can change and checkboxes which are read-only. Disabled does this.Second reason is that the disabled state is built into the browser so you need less code to execute when the user clicks on something. This is probably more of a personal preference than anything else. You\'ll still need some javascript to un-disable these when submitting the form.It seems easier to me to use some javascript when the form is submitted to un-disable the checkboxes than to use a hidden input to carry the value.If anyone else is using MVC and an editor template, this is how I control displaying a read only property (I use a custom attribute to get the value in the if statement)Very late to the party but I found an answer for MVC (5) \nI disabled the CheckBox and added a HiddenFor BEFORE the checkbox, so when it is posting if finds the Hidden field first and uses that value. This does work.In old HTML you can usebut actually is not recommended to use just simply old HTML, now you should use XHTML.In well formed XHTML you have to usewell formed XHTML requires a XML form, thats the reason to use disabled="disabled" instead of simply use disabled.Or just:
