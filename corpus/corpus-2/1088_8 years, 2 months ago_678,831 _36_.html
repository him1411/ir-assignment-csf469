What characters must be escaped in XML documents, or where could I find such a list?If you use an appropriate class or library, they will do the escaping for you. Many XML issues are caused by string concatenation.There are only five:Escaping characters depends on where the special character is used. The examples can be validated at W3C Markup Validation Service.The safe way is to escape all five characters in text, however, the three characters ", \' and > needn\'t be escaped in text:The safe way is to escape all five characters in attributes, however, the > character needn\'t be escaped in attributes:The \' character needn\'t be escaped in attributes if the quotes are ":Likewise, the " needn\'t be escaped in attributes if the quotes are \':All 5 special characters must not be escaped in comments:All 5 special characters must not be escaped in CDATA sections:All 5 special characters must not be escaped in XML processing instructions:HTML has its own set of escape codes which cover a lot more characters.Perhaps this will help:List of XML and HTML character entity references:In SGML, HTML and XML documents, the\n  logical constructs known as character\n  data and attribute values consist of\n  sequences of characters, in which each\n  character can manifest directly\n  (representing itself), or can be\n  represented by a series of characters\n  called a character reference, of which\n  there are two types: a numeric\n  character reference and a character\n  entity reference. This article lists\n  the character entity references that\n  are valid in HTML and XML documents.That article lists the following five predefined XML entities:According to the specifications of the World Wide Web Consortium (w3C), there are 5 characters that must not appear in their literal form in an XML document, except when used as markup delimiters or within a comment, a processing instruction, or a CDATA section. In all the other cases, these characters must be replaced either using the corresponding entity or the numeric reference according to the following table:Original CharacterXML entity replacementXML numeric replacement\n<                              &lt;                                    &#60;                                    \n>                              &gt;                                   &#62;                                    \n"                               &quot;                               &#34;                                    \n&                              &amp;                               &#38;                                    \n\'                               &apos;                               &#39;                                    Notice that the aforementioned entities can be used also in HTML, with the exception of &apos;, that was introduced with XHTML 1.0 and is not declared in HTML 4. For this reason, and to ensure retro-compatibility, the XHTML specification recommends the use of &#39; instead.Escaping characters is different for tags and attributes.For tags:For attributes:http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/#syntaxThe ampersand character (&) and the left angle bracket (<) must not\n  appear in their literal form, except when used as markup delimiters,\n  or within a comment, a processing instruction, or a CDATA section. If\n  they are needed elsewhere, they must be escaped using either numeric\n  character references or the strings " &amp; " and " &lt; "\n  respectively. The right angle bracket (>) may be represented using the\n  string " &gt; ", and must, for compatibility, be escaped using either\n  " &gt; " or a character reference when it appears in the string " ]]>\n  " in content, when that string is not marking the end of a CDATA\n  section.To allow attribute values to contain both single and double quotes,\n  the apostrophe or single-quote character (\') may be represented as "\n  &apos; ", and the double-quote character (") as " &quot; ".in addition to the commonly known five characters [<, >, &, ", \'] I would also escape the vertical tab character (0x0B). It is valid UTF-8, but not valid XML 1.0, and even many libraries (including libxml2) miss it and silently output invalid XML.Abridged from:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML#EscapingThere are five predefined entities:"All permitted Unicode characters may be represented with a numeric character reference. "  For example:Most of the control characters and other unicode ranges are specifically excluded, meaning (I think) they can\'t occur either escaped or direct:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valid_characters_in_XMLIt depends on the context. For the content, it is < and &, and ]]>(though string of 3 instead of one char). For attribute values, it is < and & and " and \'. For CDATA, it is ]]>.Only < and & are required to be escaped if the are to be treated character data and not markup:http://www.w3.org/TR/xml11/#syntaxThese need to be escaped:
