How can I make an outbound HTTP POST request, with data, in node.js?Here\'s an example of using node.js to make a POST request to the Google Compiler API:I\'ve updated the code to show how to post data from a file, instead of the hardcoded string. It uses the async fs.readFile command to achieve this, posting the actual code after a successful read. If there\'s an error, it is thrown, and if there\'s no data the process exits with a negative value to indicate failure.This gets a lot easier if you use the request library.Aside from providing a nice syntax it makes json requests easy, handles oauth signing (for twitter, etc.), can do multi-part forms (e.g. for uploading files) and streaming.To install request use command npm install requestYou can use request library. https://www.npmjs.com/package/requestTo post JSON data:To post xml data:I use Restler and Needle for production purposes.\nThey are both much more powerful than native httprequest. It is possible to request with basic authentication, special header entry or even upload/download files.As for post/get operation, they also are much simpler to use than raw ajax calls using httprequest.You can also use Requestify, a really cool and simple HTTP client I wrote for nodeJS + it supports caching.Just do the following:For those coming here in the later years. There are now a wide variety of different libraries that can accomplish this with minimal coding. I much prefer elegant light weight libraries for HTTP requests unless you absolutely need control of the low level HTTP stuff.One such library is UnirestTo install it, use npm. \n$ npm install unirestAnd onto the Hello, World! example that everyone is accustomed to.Extra:\nA lot of people are also suggesting the use of request [ 2 ]It should be worth noting that behind the scenes Unirest uses the request library. Unirest provides methods for accessing the request object directly.Example:This is the simplest way I use to make request: using \'request\' module. Command to install \'request\' module : Example code:You can also use Node.js\'s built-in \'http\' module to make request.I like the simplicity of superagent (https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent).  Same api on both node and browser.To Post Rest/JSON Request\nWe can simply use request package and save the values we have to send in Json variable.First install the require package in your console by\n        npm install request --save I found a video which explains on how to achieve this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuw48-u3YrgIt uses default "http" module together with "querystring" and "stringbuilder" modules. The application takes two numbers (using two textboxes) from a web page and upon submit, returns sum of those two (along with persisting the values in the textboxes). This is the best example I could find anywhere else.This my solution for POST and GET.About the Post method:If the body is a JSON object, so it\'s important to deserialize it with JSON.stringify and possibly set the Content-Lenght header accordingly:before writing it to the request:About both Get and Post methods:The timeout can occur as a socket disconnect, so you must register its handler like:while the request handler isI strongly suggest to register both the handlers.The response body is chunked, so you must concat chunks at the data handler:At the end the body will contain the whole response body:It is safe to wrap with a try...catchtheJSON.parse` since you cannot be sure that it is a well-formatted json actually and there is no way to be sure of it at the time you do the request.Module: SimpleAPIUsage:You can simplifiy the proccess by using "Requestify":Here\'s how to get it:Getting a request:And posting the request into Json:After struggling a lot while creating a low level utility to handle the post and get requests for my project, I decided to post my effort here. Much on the lines of accepted answer, here is a snippet for making http and https POST requests for sending JSON data.
