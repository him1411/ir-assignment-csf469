I know I can do git branch --all and that shows me both local and remote branches, but it\'s not that useful in showing me the relationships between them.How do I list branches in a way that shows which local branch is tracking which remote?Very much a porcelain command, not good if you want this for scripting:Note that with git 1.8.3, that upstream branch is displayed in blue (see "What is this branch tracking (if anything) in git?")If you want clean output, see arcresu\'s answer - it uses a porcelain command that I don\'t believe existed at the time I originally wrote this answer, so it\'s a bit more concise and works with branches configured for rebase, not just merge.git remote show originReplace \'origin\' with whatever the name of your remote is.If you look at the man page for git-rev-parse, you\'ll see the following syntax is described:<branchname>@{upstream}, e.g. master@{upstream}, @{u}The suffix @{upstream} to a branchname (short form\n  <branchname>@{u}) refers to the branch that the branch specified by\n  branchname is set to build on top of. A missing branchname defaults\n  to the current one.Hence to find the upstream of the branch master, you would do:To print out the information for each branch, you could do something like:This is cleaner than parsing refs and config manually.An alternative to kubi\'s answer is to have a look at the .git/config file which shows the local repository configuration:cat .git/configFor the current branch, here are two good choices:orThat answer is also here, to a slightly different question which was (wrongly) marked as a duplicate.will show a line for each local branch. A tracking branch will look like:A non-tracking one will look like:For the current branch, you could also say git checkout (w/o any branch). This is a no-op with a side-effects to show the tracking information, if exists, for the current branch.I use this aliasthenBased on Olivier Refalo\'s answerIt shows only local with track configured.Write it on a script called git-track on your path an you will get a git track commandA more elaborated version on https://github.com/albfan/git-showupstream
