This question already has an answer here:I keep seeing people using doubles in C#. I know I read somewhere that doubles sometimes lose precision. \nMy question is when should a use a double and when should I use a decimal type?\nWhich type is suitable for money computations? (ie. greater than $100 million)For money, always decimal. It\'s why it was created.If numbers must add up correctly or balance, use decimal. This includes any financial storage or calculations, scores, or other numbers that people might do by hand.If the exact value of numbers is not important, use double for speed. This includes graphics, physics or other physical sciences computations where there is already a "number of significant digits".My question is when should a use a\n  double and when should I use a decimal\n  type?decimal for when you work with values in the range of 10^(+/-28) and where you have expectations about the behaviour based on base 10 representations - basically money.double for when you need relative accuracy (i.e. losing precision in the trailing digits on large values is not a problem) across wildly different magnitudes - double covers more than 10^(+/-300). Scientific calculations are the best example here.which type is suitable for money\n  computations?decimal, decimal, decimalAccept no substitutes.The most important factor is that double, being implemented as a binary fraction, cannot accurately represent many decimal fractions (like 0.1) at all and its overall number of digits is smaller since it is 64-bit wide vs. 128-bit for decimal. Finally, financial applications often have to follow specific rounding modes (sometimes mandated by law). decimal supports these; double does not.System.Single / float - 7 digits\nSystem.Double / double - 15-16 digits\nSystem.Decimal / decimal - 28-29 significant digitsThe way I\'ve been stung by using the wrong type (a good few years ago) is with large amounts:You run out at 1 million for a float.A 15 digit monetary value:9 trillion with a double. But with division and comparisons it\'s more complicated (I\'m definitely no expert in floating point and irrational numbers - see Marc\'s point). Mixing decimals and doubles causes issues:A mathematical or comparison operation\n  that uses a floating-point number\n  might not yield the same result if a\n  decimal number is used because the\n  floating-point number might not\n  exactly approximate the decimal\n  number.When should I use double instead of decimal? has some similar and more in depth answers. Using double instead of decimal for monetary applications is a micro-optimization - that\'s the simplest way I look at it.Decimal is for exact values. Double is for approximate values.For money: decimal. It costs a little more memory, but doesn\'t have rounding troubles like double sometimes has.I think that the main difference beside bit width is that decimal has exponent base 10 and double has 2http://software-product-development.blogspot.com/2008/07/net-double-vs-decimal.htmlDefinitely use integer types for your money computations. This cannot be emphasized enough, since at first glance it might seem that a floating point type is adequate. Here an example in python code:looks pretty normal. Now try this again with 10^20 Zimbabwe dollarsAs you can see, the dollar disappeared. If you use the integer type, it works fine:
