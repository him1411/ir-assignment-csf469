How do I remove the ability to move the cursor after then end of line in IntelliJ?File menu -> Settings -> Editor -> General -> Virtual Space and uncheck \'Allow placement of caret after end of line\' . You may also uncheck the other options in the Virtual Space panel.If the other answers don\'t seem to be working, you might have Column Selection Mode enabled. On my Mac it\'s mapped to Cmd+Shift+8. It\'s located under the Edit menu. That menu item will show a little checkmark when the mode is enabled.Note that for Intellij IDEA 11 for mac, settings are placed under the IntelliJ IDEA menu and called preferences. (Maybe some sort of mac default ?)To get the expected behavior where indentations are respected when you click on a line :In Preferences > Editor > Virtual Space Check : Allow placement of caret inside tabs.Uncheck : Allow placement of caret after end of line.This was really annoying to me and makes very little sense as a default behavior to me.What Matt_Bro said (first answer), but if you\'ve already got the box unchecked in preferences, try re-checking it (I checked all the virtual space boxes) and restarting. Then uncheck and hit apply--at this point unlimited space was disabled for me.By default, it\'s turned off (unchecked).If it is turned on, you can use one of the following 2 approaches:File > Settings... (or Ctrl+Alt+S) > Editor > General > Virtual Space section > uncheck Allow placement of caret after end of lineHelp > Find Action... (or Ctrl+Shift+A) > type "Virtual Space: Allow end" > Enter or left click (to switch between On and Off) > Esc
