I want to delete all keys. I want everything wiped out and give me a blank database. Is there a way to do this in Redis client?With redis-cli:Redis documentation:For example, in your shell: Heads up that FLUSHALL may be overkill. FLUSHDB is the one to flush a database only. FLUSHALL will wipe out the entire server.  As in every database on the server. Since the question was about flushing a database I think this is an important enough distinction to merit a separate answer.Answers so far are absolutely correct; they delete all keys.However, if you also want to delete all Lua scripts from the Redis instance, you should follow it by:SCRIPT FLUSHThe OP asks two questions; this completes the second question (everything wiped).If you\'re using the redis-rb gem then you can simply call:FLUSHALL \nRemove all keys from all databasesFLUSHDB \nRemove all keys from the current databaseSCRIPT FLUSH \nRemove all the scripts from the script cache.This method worked for me - delete everything of current connected Database on your Jedis cluster.One more option from my side:In our production and pre-production databases there are thousands of keys. Time to time we need to delete some keys (by some mask), modify by some criteria etc. Of course, there is no way to do it manually from CLI, especially having sharding (512 logical dbs in each physical).For this purpose I write java client tool that does all this work. In case of keys deletion the utility can be very simple, only one class there:Writing such kind of tools I find very easy and spend no more then 5-10 min.You can use FLUSHALL which will delete all keys from your every database.\nWhere as FLUSHDB will delete all keys from our current database.FLUSHALL Deletes all the Keys of All exisiting databases .\nFOr Redis version > 4.0 ,  FLUSHALL ASYNC is  supported  which runs in a background thread wjthout blocking the server\nhttps://redis.io/commands/flushallFLUSHDB - Deletes all the keys in the selected Database . \nhttps://redis.io/commands/flushdbThe time complexity to perform the operations will be O(N)   where  N being the number of keys in the database.The Response from the redis will be a  simple string  "OK"Use FLUSHALL ASYNC if using (Redis 4.0.0 or greater) else FLUSHALLhttps://redis.io/commands/flushalli think sometimes stop the redis-server and delete rdb\xef\xbc\x8caof files\xe3\x80\x82\nmake sure there\xe2\x80\x99s no data can be reloading.\nthen start the redis-server,now it\'s new and empty.
