I have been trying to work out the syntax for this command:or I need to see all files that have been modified except for those named error_log.I\'ve read about it here, but only found one not-regex pattern.grep -v is your friend:-v, --invert-match        select non-matching linesAlso check out the related -L (the complement of -l).-L, --files-without-match only print FILE names containing no matchYou can also use awk for these purposes, since it allows you to perform more complex checks in a clearer way:Lines not containing foo:Lines not containing neither foo nor bar:Lines not containing neither foo nor bar but containing either foo2 or bar2:And so on.In your case, you presumably don\'t want to use grep, but add instead a negative clause to the find command, e.g.If you want to include wildcards in the name, you\'ll have to escape them, e.g. to exclude files with suffix .log:
