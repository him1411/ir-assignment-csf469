I was trying to install rails on Ubuntu Natty Narwhal 11.04, using ruby1.9.1.I installed ruby using apt-get install ruby1.9.1-full which contains the dev package. I googled the error and all have suggested I install the 1.9.1-dev which I already have.After some search for a solution it turns out the -dev package is needed, not just ruby1.8. So if you have ruby1.9.1 doingor to install generic ruby version, use (as per @lamplightdev comment):should fix it.Try locate mkmf to see if the file is actually there.This is the answer that worked for me.  Was in the comments above, but deserves its rightful place as answer for ubuntu 12.04 ruby 1.8.7I also needed build-essential installed:The problem is still is recursive on Ubuntu 13/04/13.10/14.04 and worked out for me okay.  So If you are using Ubuntu 13.04/13.10/14.04 then using this will really come in handy. This works even if ruby version is 1.9.3. This is because there is no ruby1.9.3-dev available in the Repository...Have you tried:I got the similar error when install bundleWorks great for me and solve the problem\nMint 16 ruby1.9.3I think is a little late but worked for me on fedora.http://nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.htmlYou\'ve Ruby 1.8 so you need to upgrade to at least 1.9 to make it working.If so, then check How to install a specific version of a ruby gem?If this won\'t help, then reinstalling ruby-dev again.You can use RVM(Ruby version manager) which helps in managing all versions of ruby on your machine , which is very helpful for you development (when migrating to unstable release to stable release )or for Linux (ubuntu) go for\nsudo apt-get install ruby1.8-devthen sudo gem install rails to verify it do  rails -v it will show version on railsafter that you can install bundles (required gems for development)
