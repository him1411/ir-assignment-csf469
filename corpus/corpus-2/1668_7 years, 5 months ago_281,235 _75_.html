I am an old-school MySQL user and have always preferred JOIN over sub-query. But nowadays everyone uses sub-query and I hate it, I don\'t know why.   I lack the theoretical knowledge to judge for myself if there is any difference.\nIs a sub-query as good as a JOIN and therefore there is nothing to worry about?Taken from the manual (13.2.10.11 Rewriting Subqueries as Joins):A LEFT [OUTER] JOIN can be faster than an equivalent subquery because the server might be able to optimize it better\xe2\x80\x94a fact that is not specific to MySQL Server alone.So subqueries can be slower than LEFT [OUTER] JOINS, but in my opinion their strength is slightly higher readability.Sub-queries are the logically correct way to solve problems of the form, "Get facts from A, conditional on facts from B". In such instances, it makes more logical sense to stick B in a sub-query than to do a join. It is also safer, in a practical sense, since you don\'t have to be cautious about getting duplicated facts from A due to multiple matches against B.Practically speaking, however, the answer usually comes down to performance. Some optimisers suck lemons when given a join vs a sub-query, and some suck lemons the other way, and this is optimiser-specific, DBMS-version-specific and query-specific.Historically, explicit joins usually win, hence the established wisdom that joins are better, but optimisers are getting better all the time, and so I prefer to write queries first in a logically coherent way, and then restructure if performance constraints warrant this.In most cases JOINs are faster than sub-queries and it is very rare for a sub-query to be faster.In JOINs RDBMS can create an execution plan that is better for your query and can predict what data should be loaded to be processed and save time, unlike the sub-query where it will run all the queries and load all their data to do the processing.The good thing in sub-queries is that they are more readable than JOINs: that\'s why most new SQL people prefer them; it is the easy way; but when it comes to performance, JOINS are better in most cases even though they are not hard to read too.Use EXPLAIN to see how your database executes the query on your data. There is a huge "it depends" in this answer...PostgreSQL can rewrite a subquery to a join or a join to a subquery when it thinks one is faster than the other. It all depends on the data, indexes, correlation, amount of data, query, etc.First of all, to compare the two first you should distinguish queries with subqueries to:     For the first class of queries a good RDBMS will see joins and subqueries as equivalent and will produce same query plans.These days even mysql does that.Still, sometimes it does not, but this does not mean that joins will always win - I had cases when using subqueries in mysql improved performance. (For example if there is something preventing mysql planner to correctly estimate the cost and if the planner doesn\'t see the join-variant and subquery-variant as same then subqueries can outperform the joins by forcing a certain path).   Conclusion is that you should test your queries for both join and subquery variants if you want to be sure which one will perform better.For the second class the comparison makes no sense as those queries can not be rewritten using joins and in these cases subqueries are natural way to do the required tasks and you should not discriminate against them.MSDN Documentation for SQL Server says Many Transact-SQL statements that include subqueries can be alternatively formulated as joins. Other questions can be posed only with subqueries. In Transact-SQL, there is usually no performance difference between a statement that includes a subquery and a semantically equivalent version that does not. However, in some cases where existence must be checked, a join yields better performance. Otherwise, the nested query must be processed for each result of the outer query to ensure elimination of duplicates. In such cases, a join approach would yield better results.so if you need something like try to use join instead. In other cases, it makes no difference.I say: Creating functions for subqueries eliminate the problem of cluttter and allows you to implement additional logic to subqueries. So I recommend creating functions for subqueries whenever possible. Clutter in code is a big problem and the industry has been working on avoiding it for decades.Run on a very large database from an old Mambo CMS:0 seconds~3 secondsAn EXPLAIN shows that they examine the exact same number of rows, but one takes 3 seconds and one is near instant. Moral of the story? If performance is important (when isn\'t it?), try it multiple ways and see which one is fastest.And...0 secondsAgain, same results, same number of rows examined. My guess is that DISTINCT mos_content.catid takes far longer to figure out than DISTINCT mos_categories.id does.Subqueries have ability to calculate aggregation functions on a fly.\nE.g. Find minimal price of the book and get all books which are sold with this price.\n1) Using Subqueries:2) using JOINsMySQL version: 5.5.28-0ubuntu0.12.04.2-logI was also under the impression that JOIN is always better than a sub-query in MySQL, but EXPLAIN is a better way to make a judgment. Here is an example where sub queries work better than JOINs.Here is my query with 3 sub-queries:EXPLAIN shows:The same query with JOINs is:and the output is:A comparison of the rows column tells the difference and the query with JOINs is using Using temporary; Using filesort.Of course when I run both the queries, the first one is done in 0.02 secs, the second one does not complete even after 1 min, so EXPLAIN explained these queries properly.If I do not have the INNER JOIN on the list_tag table i.e. if I remove from the first query and correspondingly:from the second query, then EXPLAIN returns the same number of rows for both queries and both these queries run equally fast.Subqueries are generally used to return a single row as an atomic value, though they may be used to compare values against multiple rows with the IN keyword. They are allowed at nearly any meaningful point in a SQL statement, including the target list, the WHERE clause, and so on. A simple sub-query could be used as a search condition. For example, between a pair of tables:Note that using a normal value operator on the results of a sub-query requires that only one field must be returned. If you\'re interested in checking for the existence of a single value within a set of other values, use IN:This is obviously different from say a LEFT-JOIN where you just want to join stuff from table A and B even if the join-condition doesn\'t find any matching record in table B, etc.If you\'re just worried about speed you\'ll have to check with your database and write a good query and see if there\'s any significant difference in performance.I think what has been under-emphasized in the cited answers is the issue of duplicates and problematic results that may arise from specific (use) cases.(although Marcelo Cantos does mention it)I will cite the example from Stanford\'s Lagunita courses on SQL.(applications made to specific universities and majors)Let\'s try to find the GPA scores for students that have applied to CS major (regardless of the university)Using a subquery:The average value for this resultset is:Using a join:average value for this resultset:It is obvious that the second attempt yields misleading results in our use case, given that it counts duplicates for the computation of the average value.\nIt is also evident that usage of distinct with the join - based statement will not eliminate the problem, given that it will erroneously keep one out of three occurrences of the 3.9 score. The correct case is to account for TWO (2) occurrences of the 3.9 score given that we actually have TWO (2) students with that score that comply with our query criteria.It seems that in some cases a sub-query is the safest way to go, besides any performance issues.As per my observation like two cases\nif table have less then 100000 of record then join will work fast.But in case of table have more then 100000 table then subquery is best result. I have one table have 5 lac record on that i create below query and its result time is likeSELECT * FROM crv.workorder_details wd inner join  crv.workorder wr on wr.workorder_id = wd.workorder_id;Result : 13.3 Secondsselect * from crv.workorder_details where workorder_id in (select workorder_id from crv.workorder)Result : 1.65 SecondsThese days, many dbs can optimize subqueries and joins. Thus, you just gotto examine your query using explain and see which one is faster. If there is not much difference in performance, I prefer to use subquery as they are simple and easier to understand.The difference is only seen when the second joining table has significantly more data than the primary table. I had an experience like below...We had a users table of one hundred thousand entries and their membership data (friendship) about 3 hundred thousand entries. It was a join statement in order to take friends and their data, but with a great delay. But it was working fine where there was only a small amount of data in the membership table. Once we changed it to use a sub-query it worked fine.But in the mean time the join queries are working with other tables that have fewer entries than the primary table.So I think the join and sub query statements are working fine and it depends on the data and the situation.Joins and subqueries are both used to combine data from different tables into a\nsingle result.  They share many similarities and differences.Subqueries can be\nused to return either a scalar (single) value or a row set; whereas, joins are used to return rows.A common use for a subquery may be to calculate a summary value for use in a query.  For instance we can use a subquery to help us obtain all products have a greater than average product price. For exampleThere are two subqueries in this SELECT statement.  The first\xe2\x80\x99s purpose is to display the average list price of all products, the second\xe2\x80\x99s purpose is for filtering out products less than or equal to the average list price. \n        Contrast this with a join whose main purpose of a join is to combine rows from one or more tables based on a match condition.  For example we can use a join display product names and models.In this statement we\xe2\x80\x99re using an INNER JOIN to match rows from both the Product and ProductModel tables.  Notice that the column ProducModel.Name is available for use throughout the query.The combined row set is then available by the select statement for use to display, filter, or group by the columns.This is different than the subquery.  There the subquery returns a result, which is immediately used.Note that he join is an integral part of the select statement.  It can not stand on its own as a subquery can.
