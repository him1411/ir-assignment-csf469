The Resources.getColor(int id) method has been deprecated.What can I do?Starting from Android Support Library 23,\na new getColor() method has been added to ContextCompat.Its description from the official JavaDoc:Returns a color associated with a particular resource IDStarting in M, the returned color will be styled for the specified Context\'s theme.So, just call:You can check the ContextCompat.getColor() source code on GitHub.You will need to use ContextCompat.getColor(), which is part of the Support V4 Library (so it will work for all the previous APIs).If you don\'t already use the Support Library, you will need add the following line to the dependencies array inside your app build.gradle (note: it\'s optional if you already use the appcompat (V7) library):If you care about themes, the documentation specifies that:Starting in M, the returned color will be styled for the specified\n  Context\'s theme I don\'t want to include the Support library just for getColor, so I\'m using something likeI guess the code should work just fine, and the deprecated getColor cannot disappear from API < 23.In Android Marshmallow many methods are deprecated.For example, to get color use Also to get drawable useFor DrawableFor ColorThe getColor() method is deprecated in API 23, and it was introduced in ContextCompat. Before using the getColor() method using ContextCompat, add the dependencies in the build.gradle script, which is:Then the getColor() method can be used like:The shortest answer is:You can use:I hope it helps. I tested it on Android Marshmallow, and it worked.Use the getColor(Resources, int, Theme) method of the ResourcesCompat from the Android Support Library.I think it reflect better your question than the getColor(Context, int) of the ContextCompat since you ask about Resources. Prior to API level 23, the theme will not be applied and the method calls through to getColor(int) but you\'ll not have the deprecated warning. The theme also may be null.In Mono / xamarin.android I had the same issue and the following code worked perfectly:In my case the context is my activity (Android.Support.V7.App.AppCompatActivity) so a my real-usage example is:make use of this .It helps Even though getColor() is deprecated in marshmallow, the replacement method\ngetColor(int, Theme) is available. Which can be used as an alternative to ContextCompat.getColor(context, R.color.your_color);refer this for more information.This way:I got frustrated too. My need was very straightforward. All I wanted was the ARGB color from the resources, so I wrote a simple static method.
