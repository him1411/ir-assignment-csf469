How can I check whether a file exists, before opening it for reading in Java? (equivalent of Perl\'s -e $filename).  The only similar question on SO deals with writing the file and was thus answered using FileWriter which is obviously not applicable here.If possible I\'d prefer a real API call returning true/false as opposed to some "Call API to open a file and catch when it throws an exception which you check for \'no file\' in text", but I can live with the latter.Using java.io.File:I would recommend using isFile() instead of exists(). Most of the time you are looking to check if the path points to a file not only that it exists. Remember that exists() will return true if your path points to a directory.new File("C:/").exists() will return true but will not allow you to open and read from it as a file.By using nio in Java SE 7,If both exists and notExists return false, the existence of the file cannot be verified. (maybe no access right to this path)You can check if path is directory or regular file.Please check this Java SE 7 tutorial.This will not create a physical file. Will just create an object of the class File. To physically create a file you have to explicitly create it:So f.exists() can be used to check whether such a file exists or not.Using Java 8:first hit for "java file exists" on google:You can use the following: File.exists()Don\'t. Just catch the FileNotFoundException. The file system has to test whether the file exists anyway. There is no point in doing all that twice, and several reasons not to, such as:Don\'t try to second-guess the system. It knows. And don\'t try to predict the future. In general the best way to test whether any resource is available is just to try to use it.For me a combination of the accepted answer by Sean A.O. Harney and the resulting comment by Cort3z seems to be the best solution.Used the following snippet:Hope this could help someone.There are multiple ways to achieve this. new File("/path/to/file").exists();  In case of just for existence. It could be file or a directory.  File f = new File("/path/to/file"); \n   if(f.exists() && f.isFile()) {}Check for file File f = new File("/path/to/file"); \n   if(f.exists() && f.isDirectory()) {}Check for Directory.Java 7 way. Path path = Paths.get("/path/to/file");\nFiles.exists(path)  - Existence \nFiles.isDirectory(path) - is Directory\nFiles.isRegularFile(path) - Regular file \nFiles.isSymbolicLink(path) - Symbolic LinkIt\'s also well worth getting familiar with Commons FileUtils\nhttp://commons.apache.org/io/api-release/org/apache/commons/io/FileUtils.html\nThis has additional methods for managing files and often better than JDK.and check the check resultwill do the trickDon\'t use File constructor with String.\nThis may not work! \nInstead of this use URI:File.exists() to check if a file exists, it will return a boolean value to indicate the check operation status; true if the file is existed; false if not exist.I know I\'m a bit late in this thread. However, here is my answer, valid since Java 7 and up.The following snippetis perfectly satifactory, because method isRegularFile returns false if file does not exist. Therefore, no need to check if Files.exists(...).Note that other parameters are options indicating how links should be handled. By default, symbolic links are followed.From Java Oracle documentationYou can use the following code to check:
