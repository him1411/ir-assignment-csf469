What\'s the simplest way to undo thecommand?\nCurrently, the only way I can think of is doing a "git clone http://..." from a remote repo.Git keeps a log of all ref updates (e.g., checkout, reset, commit, merge). You can view it by typing:Somewhere in this list is the commit that you lost. Let\'s say you just typed git reset HEAD~ and want to undo it. My reflog looks like this:The first line says that HEAD 0 positions ago (in other words, the current position) is 3f6db14; it was obtained by resetting to HEAD~. The second line says that HEAD 1 position ago (in other words, the state before the reset) is d27924e. It was obtained by checking out a particular commit (though that\'s not important right now). So, to undo the reset, run git reset HEAD@{1} (or git reset d27924e).If, on the other hand, you\'ve run some other commands since then that update HEAD, the commit you want won\'t be at the top of the list, and you\'ll need to search through the reflog.One final note: It may be easier to look at the reflog for the specific branch you want to un-reset, say master, rather than HEAD:This should have less noise it in than the general HEAD reflog.Old question, and the posted answers work great.  I\'ll chime in with another option though.git reset ORIG_HEADORIG_HEAD references the commit that HEAD previously referenced.My situation was slightly different, I did git reset HEAD~ three times.To undo it I had to do so you should be able to do But if you have done git reset usingyou will need to do As  {N} represents number of operations in Reflog. As Mark pointed out in the comments.
