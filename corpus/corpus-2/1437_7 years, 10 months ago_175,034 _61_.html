What NoSQL solutions are out there for .NET?You also should consider using Redis. It\'s an advanced NoSQL database with support for rich server-side data structures such as lists, sets, sorted sets and hashes. It runs in memory but supports both a "snapshot" persistence mode as well as an Append only file journal for integrity in-between snapshots.It is also one of the fastest NoSQL databases in existence: 110000 SETs/second, 81000 GETs/second in an entry level Linux box. Check the benchmarks. In wanting to stay true to Redis I\'ve developed a very fast C# Redis Client with a strong-focus on performance. Running Raven DB\'s own benchmarks the default redis-server configuration is 16.9x faster than Raven DB. When adjusted to use the appendfsync always option (though not recommended) it is still 11.75x faster.@marcgravell has developed a very fast async C# Redis Client used to handle Stack Overflows and other Stack Exchange sites distributed caching.Like most NoSQL data stores, Redis is schema-less allowing you to use it straight away without having to define any schemas upfront - providing a major productivity boost.\nThe beauty of Redis is that it\'s like accessing .NET\'s generic collection classes you\'re used to in C# so there is very little projection that needs to be done since its API is already a close match to the Lists and in-memory data structures your program already uses. It\'s this elegance of offering fundamental comp-sci data structures that sets Redis apart, it allows it to be extremely versatile whilst only supporting a limited operation set. i.e. Redis has been commonly seen as a distributed cache, message queue, IPC broker between languages/processes, Pub/Sub, push/event-based comms, distributed-locking, CQRS Event Source, Unique Id generator, etc. Even if you\'re not using it as your primary data store, its speed and simplicity gives you access to a versatile swiss-army toolbox that can fulfil a wealth of use-cases.There are a number of C#/.NET Redis clients available, and on NuGet. The Example below uses my ServiceStack\'s open source C# client.All the documentation and tutorials for the ServiceStack\'s C# Redis Client is available at:\nhttp://www.servicestack.net/docs/redis-client/redis-clientThe client provides a rich interface providing wrappers for .NET\'s generic IList, IDictionary and ICollection mapping to Redis\'s rich server side data structures. For a quick overview of its features check out the API image map.A good tutorial showing how you to develop a real-world applications is at:\nhttp://www.servicestack.net/docs/redis-client/designing-nosql-databaseSee the source code of Redis StackOverflow for another example of a real-world app built entirely with Redis.Sample code showing a complete CRUD app:To play with this example live see ServiceStack\'s Backbone\'s TODO application retro-fitted with a C# Redis back-end.As a result of its simplicity it has language bindings for nearly every language in use today:\nhttp://redis.io/clientsIt\'s even more terse in dynamic languages, here\'s how easy it is to create a non-blocking web server hosting named counters in node.js/CoffeeScript:One of the benefits of NoSQL is that you get to mix with developers from different language backgrounds coming together to work out how best we can leverage redis to meet our demanding needs.Because of its simplicity, stability and speed it\'s used by many large companies including:I\'ve provided installation instructions and downloads for the 2 most popular ways of running Redis on windows at: https://github.com/mythz/redis-windows that shows how to:You don\'t state what your requirements are (i.e. has to run on Windows), so I\'ll throw out the 2 that I\'ve used successfully.MongoDB is a document database that has prebuilt binaries for 32bit and 64bit Windows.  That\'s always a nice thing to see.Client access can be done with this driver.  It isn\'t an official client from the MongoDB team itself, but I\'ve used it.  And in my usage, it has supported what I need.  There is some LINQ stuff in the repo, but I haven\'t tried it.I was able to run both client and server on Windows with no problems.CouchDB is an option as well.  There are some native .NET clients, but all of CouchDB is done with REST.  So HttpWebRequest/Response will serve you well here.  A blog post by Rinat Abdullin shows how some of the pieces fit together.  There is also CouchBrowse.  I\'ve never used a native client.  GET/PUT/POST have worked very well for me.I got CouchDB to work on Windows (it\'s written in Erlang), but my performance testing showed that Linux was faster.  My guess is maybe in how Erlang itself is implemented?  I dunno.  But it runs on both Windows and Linux.  And I was able to call the Linux instance from Windows easily (it\'s just REST).This next one I\'ve never tried, but I\'ve got a friend who is a committer on the HBase project.  And he thinks that the Thrift interface to HBase should be usable from .NET (since Thrift will generate C#).  The big thing here is the fact that Hadoop/HBase are focused more on *nix environments.  But there is no reason you couldn\'t run HBase on a Linux cluster and connect to it from .NET on Windows for production.  For development, you can run HBase on Windows using Cygwin.  A good set of instructions on how to do this is here.There are others (Valdemort, Cassandra, etc.) but I have no real experience with them so I won\'t pretend to say how they integrate with C#/.NET.  The big thing to look at is what their API looks like - if it has a Thrift interface, REST, etc. you should be able to connect to them with no problems.  You might not be able to run the NoSQL Service on Windows OS as efficiently as Linux, but maybe that isn\'t a big deal.EDIT Changed that there are some native CouchDB clients.  I\'m not familiar with them as I always use raw HTTP and my own little wrapper classes.Ayende is just writing one in .net, it\'s called RavenDB.Check out his Git repository:\nhttp://github.com/ravendb/ravendb...and his blog entries about it:\nhttp://ayende.com/blog/tags/ravenEDIT:\nNow it\'s finished. You can check it out at http://ravendb.net/.  RavenDB from Ayende is a .NET based backend and client NoSQL (specifically document database). The source is freely available. The performance is on par with MongoDB (last tests were around the 6000 inserts per second). Indexing is done in a very clever way using LINQ. REST interface, Web UI. Very very smart in fact. RavenDB can run as a service, in IIS or via a console (exe). It requires .NET 4 for server-side.Client can be .NET 3.5. In fact the client will run in Mono I believe.http://groups.google.com/group/ravendb/web - all the documentation there isI went to launch event, amazing features added and lots more to come. Everyone was blown away by Raven so it is definitely one to check out. I\'ve been using BrightstarDB for the latest project I\'ve been working on. It\'s native .NET NoSQL with a full Entity Framework (which made it a matter of minutes to get an application up and running from first downloading).I tried RavenDB first, but although that was pretty simple to install all the MapReduce and indexing setup stuff took too long for me to get my head round and was slow and clunky whenever I wanted to navigate relationships between "things" in both directions. BrightstarDB has been brilliant to develop with, and it\'s really similar to code first Entity Framework, but without the pain of a database set up, and I can do loads of changes to my datamodel without the pain I had to go through with SQL.It is definitely worth taking a look!Take a look at db4o. It\'s object-based, easy, self-contained (like sqlite3) works with LINQ and it\'s open source.If you want light database engines that work well with .NET and with LINQ support, you can try Eloquera, STSdb, and Siaqodb.\nSee this post on my blog to get a feel for what they offer. Microsoft is releasing soon (end 2011 quarter) a "NoSQL" solution on SQL Azure.It is based on the new Federations feature, and uses XML for semi-structured storage.[Edit] Before downvoting, read the articles which explain how to use "NoSQL" features in SQL Azure which has obviously perfect .NET/C#/LINQ integration!You can use the famous Cassandra database. It also uses the thrift interface.The Lucene.net project would fit your general requirement. It provides an API for storing and indexing documents, storing the database on a file system. The project is primarily a full text search library, originally written in Java and later ported to .NET. Therefore, it doesn\'t have Linq support, but is very well established and quite a mature project.A downside could be the complexity of the project, it sounds like you\'re looking for plug and play solution, however the Lucene project requires you to spend a little time understanding the specifics of full text indexing and search.A major plus however is the performance of the Lucene library is blazing fast, especially for concurrent searching over large datasets so is a great solution for running a standalone website without the need to run a database server too.RavenDB has the best .NET/LINQ support. It\'s very easy to get the .NET client using NuGet; a Visual Studio online extension manager (similar to App Store from Apple).If development tools are more important to you than extreme performance, you should consider RavenDB.db4o is great, but be aware that it has an open source version, but it is not free for commercial use.Another option is MemcacheDB.It\'s based around Memcache, but adds persistent storage. Here\'s their blurb:MemcacheDB is a distributed key-value storage system designed for persistent. It is NOT a cache solution, but a persistent storage engine for fast and reliable key-value based object storage and retrieval. It conforms to memcache protocol (not completed, see below), so any memcached client can have connectivity with it. MemcacheDB uses Berkeley DB as a storing backend, so lots of features including transaction and replication are supported. Amazon supplies a .NET SDK for interfacing to its SimpleDB (as well as to the rest of the AWS family of services).http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/http://aws.amazon.com/sdkfornet/The best part: A free tier in the cloud (as of now: "New and existing customers receive 25 SimpleDB machine hours and 1 GB of storage for free each month.")
