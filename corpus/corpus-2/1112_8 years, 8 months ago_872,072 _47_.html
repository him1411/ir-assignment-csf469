Is there a way to make an Oracle query behave like it contains a MySQL limit clause?In MySQL, I can do this:to get the 21st to the 30th rows (skip the first 20, give the next 10). The rows are selected after the order by, so it really starts on the 20th name alphabetically.In Oracle, the only thing people mention is the rownum pseudo-column, but it is evaluated before order by, which means this:will return a random set of ten rows ordered by name, which is not usually what I want. It also doesn\'t allow for specifying an offset.Starting from Oracle 12c R1 (12.1), there is a row limiting clause. It does not use familiar LIMIT syntax, but it can do the job better with more options. You can find the full syntax here.To answer the original question, here\'s the query:(For earlier Oracle versions, please refer to other answers in this question)Following examples were quoted from linked page, in the hope of preventing link rot.You can use a subquery for this likeHave also a look at the topic On ROWNUM and limiting results at Oracle/AskTom for more information.Update:\nTo limit the result with both lower and upper bounds things get a bit more bloated with(Copied from specified AskTom-article)Update 2:\nStarting with Oracle 12c (12.1) there is a syntax available to limit rows or start at offsets.See this answer for more examples. Thanks to Krumia for the hint.I did some performance testing for the following approaches:Table had 10 million records, sort was on an unindexed datetime row:Selecting first 10 rows took:Selecting rows betwwen 100,000 and 100,010:Selecting rows between 9,000,000 and 9,000,010:An analytic solution with only one nested query:Rank() could be substituted for Row_Number() but might return more records than you are expecting if there are duplicate values for name.On Oracle 12c (see row limiting clause in SQL reference):Pagination queries with ordering are really tricky in Oracle. Oracle provides a ROWNUM pseudocolumn that returns a number indicating the order in which the database selects the row from a table or set of joined views. ROWNUM is a pseudocolumn that gets many people into trouble. A ROWNUM value is not permanently assigned to a row (this is a common misunderstanding). It may be confusing when a ROWNUM value is actually assigned. A ROWNUM value is assigned to a row after it passes filter predicates of the query but before query aggregation or sorting. What is more, a ROWNUM value is incremented only after it is assigned.This is why the followin query returns no rows:The first row of the query result does not pass ROWNUM > 1 predicate, so ROWNUM does not increment to 2. For this reason, no ROWNUM value gets greater than 1, consequently, the query returns no rows.Correctly defined query should look like this:Find out more about pagination queries in my articles on Vertabelo blog:Less SELECT statements. Also, less performance consuming. Credits to: anibal@upf.brIf you are not on Oracle 12C, you can use TOP N query like below.You can even move this from clause in with clause as followsHere actually we are creating a inline view and renaming rownum as rnum. You can use rnum in main query as filter criteria.greater then values find out  less then values find outI\'v started preparing for Oracle 1z0-047 exam, validated against 12c\nWhile prepping for it i came across a 12c enhancement known as \'FETCH FIRST\'\nIt enables you to fetch rows /limit rows as per your convenience.\nSeveral options are available with itExample: I used in Oracle SQL Developer the following statement in order to retrieve the first 10 rows, and works for me:In oracle 5 rows selected.SQL>(untested) something like this may do the jobThere is also the analytic function rank, that you can use to order by.Same as above with corrections.  Works but definitely not pretty.Honestly, better to use the above answers.
