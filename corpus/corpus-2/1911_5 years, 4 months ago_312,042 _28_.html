How do I resolve a git merge conflict in favor of pulled changes? Basically I need to remove all conflicting changes from a working tree without having to go through all of the conflicts with a git mergetool while keeping all conflict-free changes. Preferably doing this while pulling, not afterwards.Or, simply, for the default repository:If you\'re already in conflicted state...You can use the recursive "theirs" strategy option:git merge --strategy-option theirsFrom the man:Note: as the man page says, the "ours" merge strategy option is very different from the "ours" merge strategy.OK so, picture the scenario I was just in:You attempt a merge, or maybe a cherry-pick, and you\'re stopped withNow, you view the conflicted file and you really don\'t want to keep your changes. In my case above, the file was conflicted on just a newline my IDE had auto-added. To undo your changes and accept their\'s, the easiest way is:The converse of this (to overwrite the incoming version with your version) isSurprisingly, I couldn\'t find this answer very easily on the Net.If you\'re already in conflicted state, and you want to just accept all of theirs:If you want to do the opposite:This is pretty drastic, so make sure you really want to wipe everything out like this before doing it.To resolve all conflicts with the version in a particular branch:So, if you are already in the merging state, and you want to keep the master version of the conflicting files: For a default repository this is as simple as:If you\'re already in conflicted state the solution is slightly different, but still manageable. Please not that sometimes this will not work:git checkout --ours path/to/fileor git checkout --theirs path/to/fileI did this instead, assuming HEAD is ours and MERGE_HEAD is theirsor:After we do this and we are good:If you want to understand more, see wonderful post of torek here : \ngit checkout --ours does not remove files from unmerged files list
