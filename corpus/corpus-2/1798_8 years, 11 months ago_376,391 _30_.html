There is this example code, but then it starts talking about millisecond / nanosecond problems.The same question is on MSDN, Seconds since the Unix epoch in C#.This is what I\'ve got so far:Here\'s what you need:Or, for Java (which is different because the timestamp is in milliseconds, not seconds):DateTime to UNIX timestamp:The latest version of .NET (v4.6) has added built-in support for Unix time conversions. That includes both to and from Unix time represented by either seconds or milliseconds.Note: These methods convert to and from DateTimeOffset. To get a DateTime representation simply use the DateTimeOffset.DateTime property:"UTC does not change with a change of seasons, but local time or civil time may change if a time zone jurisdiction observes daylight saving time (summer time). For example, UTC is 5 hours ahead of (that is, later in the day than) local time on the east coast of the United States during winter, but 4 hours ahead while daylight saving is observed there."So this is my code:See IdentityModel.EpochTimeExtensionsBe careful!\nAddSeconds and AddMilliseconds cut off the microseconds in the double.\nThese versions have high precision.Unix -> DateTimeDateTime -> UnixTo supplement ScottCher\'s answer, I recently found myself in the annoying scenario of having both seconds and milliseconds UNIX timestamps arbitrarily mixed together in an input data set.  The following code seems to handle this well:Unix time conversion is new in .NET Framework 4.6.You can now more easily convert date and time values to or from .NET Framework types and Unix time. This can be necessary, for example, when converting time values between a JavaScript client and .NET server. The following APIs have been added to the DateTimeOffset structure:I found the right answer just by comparing the conversion to 1/1/1970 w/o the local time adjustment;Of course, one can make unixEpoch a global static, so it only needs to appear once in your project, and one can use AddSeconds if the UNIX time is in seconds.To go the other way:Truncate to Int64 and/or use TotalSeconds as needed.A Unix tick is 1 second (if I remember well), and a .NET tick is 100Â nanoseconds. If you\'ve been encountering problems with nanoseconds, you might want to try using AddTick(10000000 * value).I needed to convert a timeval struct (seconds, microseconds) containing UNIX time to DateTime without losing precision and haven\'t found an answer here so I thought I just might add mine:DateTime to Unix timestamp including daylight saving time (DST)For .NET 4.6 and later:
