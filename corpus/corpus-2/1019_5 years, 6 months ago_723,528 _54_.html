Does Python have something like an empty string variable where you can do?:Regardless what\'s the most elegant way to check for empty string values? I find hard coding "" every time for checking an empty string not as good.Empty strings are "falsy" which means they are considered false in a Boolean context, so you can just do this:This is the preferred way if you know that your variable is a string.  If your variable could also be some other type then you should use myString == "".  See the documentation on Truth Value Testing for other values that are false in Boolean contexts.From PEP 8, in the \xe2\x80\x9cProgramming Recommendations\xe2\x80\x9d section:For sequences, (strings, lists, tuples), use the fact that empty sequences are false.So you should use:or:Just to clarify, sequences are evaluated to False or True in a Boolean context if they are empty or not. They are not equal to False or True.The most elegant way would probably be to simply check if its true or falsy, e.g.:However, you may want to strip white space because:You should probably be a bit more explicit in this however, unless you know for sure that this string has passed some kind of validation and is a string that can be tested this way.I would test noneness before stripping. Also, I would use the fact that empty strings are False (or Falsy). This approach is similar to Apache\'s StringUtils.isBlank or Guava\'s Strings.isNullOrEmptyThis is what I would use to test if a string is either None OR Empty OR Blank:And, the exact opposite to test if a string is not None NOR Empty NOR Blank:More concise forms of the above code:I once wrote something similar to Bartek\'s answer and javascript inspired:Test:If you want to differentiate between empty and null strings, I would suggest using if len(string), otherwise, I\'d suggest using simply if string as others have said.  The caveat about strings full of whitespace still applies though, so don\'t forget to strip.Test empty or blank string (shorter way):I find hardcoding(sic) "" every time for checking an empty string not as good.Doing this: foo == "" is very bad practice. "" is a magical value. You should never check against magical values (more commonly known as magical numbers)What you should do is compare to a descriptive variable name.One may think that "empty_string" is a descriptive variable name. It isn\'t.Before you go and do empty_string = "" and think you have a great variable name to compare to. This is not what "descriptive variable name" means.A good descriptive variable name is based on its context.\nYou have to think about what the empty string is.You are building a form where a user can enter values. You want to check if the user wrote something or not.A good variable name may be not_filled_inThis makes the code very readableYou are parsing CSV files and want the empty string to be parsed as None(Since CSV is entirely text based, it cannot represent None without using predefined keywords)A good variable name may be CSV_NONEThis makes the code easy to change and adapt if you have a new CSV file that represents None with another string than ""There are no questions about if this piece of code is correct. It is pretty clear that it does what it should do.Compare this toThe first question here is, Why does the empty string deserve special treatment?This would tell future coders that an empty string should always be considered as None.This is because it mixes business logic (What CSV value should be None) with code implementation (What are we actually comparing to)There needs to be a separation of concern between the two.if stringname: gives a false when the string is empty. I guess it can\'t be simpler than this.for those who expect a behaviour like the apache StringUtils.isBlank or Guava Strings.isNullOrEmpty :Responding to @1290. Sorry, no way to format blocks in comments. The None value is not an empty string in Python, and neither is (spaces). The answer from Andrew Clark is the correct one: if not myString. The answer from @rouble is application-specific and does not answer the OP\'s question. You will get in trouble if you adopt a peculiar definition of what is a "blank" string. In particular, the standard behavior is that str(None) produces \'None\', a non-blank string.However if you must treat None and (spaces) as "blank" strings, here is a better way:Examples:Meets the @rouble requirements while not breaking the expected bool behavior of strings.You may have a look at this Assigning empty value or string in PythonThis is about comparing strings that are empty. So instead of testing for emptiness with not, you may test is your string is equal to empty string with "" the empty string...How about this?  Perhaps it\'s not "the most elegant", but it seems pretty complete, clear, and safe to me:Is there a possibility for an exception or a false positive with this?When you are reading file by lines and want to determine, which line is empty, make sure you will use .strip(), because there is new line character in "empty" line:As prmatta posted above, but with mistake.In my experience testing for "" doesn\'t always work. This simple tests has always worked for me:orReading an Excel spreadsheet I want to stop when a column gets empty using the following while loop:
