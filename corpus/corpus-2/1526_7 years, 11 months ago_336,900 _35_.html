I need to split a string into newlines in .NET and the only way I know of to split strings is with the Split method. However that will not allow me to (easily) split on a newline, so what is the best way to do it?To split on a string you need to use the overload that takes an array of strings:Edit:\nIf you want to handle different types of line breaks in a text, you can use the ability to match more than one string. This will correctly split on either type of line break, and preserve empty lines and spacing in the text:What about using a StringReader?You should be able to split your string pretty easily, like so:Based on Guffa\'s answer, in an extension class, use:Try to avoid using string.Split for a general solution, because you\'ll use more memory everywhere you use the function -- the original string, and the split copy, both in memory. Trust me that this can be one hell of a problem when you start to scale -- run a 32-bit batch-processing app processing 100MB documents, and you\'ll crap out at eight concurrent threads. Not that I\'ve been there before...Instead, use an iterator like this;This will allow you to do a more memory efficient loop around your data;Of course, if you want it all in memory, you can do this;For a string variable s:This uses your environment\'s definition of line endings. On Windows, line endings are CR-LF (carriage return, line feed) or in C#\'s escape characters \\r\\n.This is a reliable solution, because if you recombine the lines with String.Join, this equals your original string:What not to do:Regex is also an option:I\'m currently using this function (based on other answers) in VB.NET:It tries to split on the platform-local newline first, and then falls back to each possible newline.I\'ve only needed this inside one class so far. If that changes, I will probably make this Public and move it to a utility class, and maybe even make it an extension method.Here\'s how to join the lines back up, for good measure:Just thought I would add my two-bits because the other solutions on this question do not fall into the reusable code classification and are not convenient. The following block of code extends the string object so that it is available as a natural method when working with strings.You can now use the .Split() function from any string as follows :To split on a newline char, simply pass "\\n" or "\\r\\n" as the delimiter parameter.Comment : It would be nice if Microsoft implemented this overload.Well, actually split should do:The RemoveEmptyStrings option will make sure you don\'t have empty entries due to \\n following a \\r(Edit to reflect comments:) Note that it will also discard genuine empty lines in the text. This is usually what I want but it might not be your requirement.I did not know about Environment.Newline, but I guess this is a very good solution.My try would have been:The additional .Trim removes any \\r or \\n that might be still present (e. g. when on windows but splitting a string with os x newline characters). Probably not the fastest method though.EDIT:As the comments correctly pointed out, this also removes any whitespace at the start of the line or before the new line feed. If you need to preserve that whitespace, use one of the other options. Silly answer: write to a temporary file so you can use the venerable\nFile.ReadLinesVery easy, actually.VB.NET:C#:
