Is there a way to deserialize JSON content into a C# 4 dynamic type? It would be nice to skip creating a bunch of classes in order to use the DataContractJsonSerializer. If you are happy to have a dependency upon the System.Web.Helpers assembly, then you can use the Json class:It is included with the MVC framework as an additional download to the .NET 4 framework. Be sure to give Vlad an upvote if that\'s helpful! However if you cannot assume the client environment includes this DLL, then read on.An alternative deserialisation approach is suggested here.  I modified the code slightly to fix a bug and suit my coding style.  All you need is this code and a reference to System.Web.Extensions from your project:You can use it like this:So, given a JSON string:The following code will work at runtime:It\'s pretty simple using Json.NET:Also using Newtonsoft.Json.Linq :Documentation: Querying JSON with dynamicYou can do this using System.Web.Helpers.Json - its Decode method returns a dynamic object which you can traverse as you like.It\'s included in the System.Web.Helpers assembly (.NET 4.0)..Net 4.0 has a built-in library to do this:This is the simplest way.Simple "string json data" to object without any third party dllNote : You can also using your custom object. JsonFx can deserialize json into dynamic objects.https://github.com/jsonfx/jsonfxI made a new version of the DynamicJsonConverter that uses Expando Objects.  I used expando objects because I wanted to Serialize the dynamic back into json using Json.net.Another way using Newtonsoft.Json:Simplest way is Just include this dll use the code like thisYou can extend the JavaScriptSerializer to recursively copy the dictionary it created to expando object(s) and then use them dynamically:Then you just need to having a using statement for the namespace you defined the extension in (consider just defining them in System.Web.Script.Serialization... another trick is to not use a namespace, then you don\'t need the using statement at all) and you can consume them like so:I am using like this in my code and it\'s working fineFor that I would use JSON.NET to do the low-level parsing of the JSON stream and then build up the object hierarchy out of instances of the ExpandoObject class.Deserializing in JSON.NET can be dynamic using the JObject class, which is included in that library.  My JSON string represents these classes:Now we deserialize the string WITHOUT referencing the above classes:Or if you want to go deeper:See post for a complete example.Its probably a little late to help you but the object you want DynamicJSONObject is included in the System.Web.Helpers.dll from the ASP.NET Web Pages package, which is part of WebMatrix.There is a lightweight json library for C# called SimpleJson which can be found at http://simplejson.codeplex.com https://github.com/facebook-csharp-sdk/simple-jsonIt supports .net 3.5+, silverlight and windows phone 7.Supports dynamic for .net 4.0Can also be installed as a nuget packageuse DataSet(C#) With javascript\nsimple function for create json stream with DataSet input\ncreate json like(multi table dataset)\n[[{a:1,b:2,c:3},{a:3,b:5,c:6}],[{a:23,b:45,c:35},{a:58,b:59,c:45}]]just client side use eval for examplevar d=eval(\'[[{a:1,b:2,c:3},{a:3,b:5,c:6}],[{a:23,b:45,c:35},{a:58,b:59,c:45}]]\')then use d[0][0].a //out 1 from table 0 row 0d[1][1].b //out 59 from table 1 row 1To get an ExpandoObject:try this - Look at the article I wrote on CodeProject, one that answers the question precisely:Dynamic types with JSON.NETThere is way too much for re-posting it all here, and even less point since that article has an attachment with the key/required source file.I use:\nhttp://json2csharp.com/\nto get A class representing the Json Object.Input:Output:After that I use Newtonsoft.Json to fill the Class:You can call it like that:PS: If your json variable name is no valid C# name (name starts with $) you can fix that like this:You can use using Newtonsoft.JsonresolvedEvent.Event.Data is my response getting from calling core Event .
