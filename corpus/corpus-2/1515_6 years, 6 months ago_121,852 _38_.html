Despite knowing JavaScript quite well, I\'m confused what exactly these three projects in Node.js ecosystem do. Is it something like Rails\' Rack? Can someone please explain?[Update: As of its 4.0 release, Express no longer uses Connect. However, Express is still compatible with middleware written for Connect. My original answer is below.]I\'m glad you asked about this, because it\'s definitely a common point of confusion for folks looking at Node.js. Here\'s my best shot at explaining it:Node.js itself offers an http module, whose createServer method returns an object that you can use to respond to HTTP requests. That object inherits the http.Server prototype.Connect also offers a createServer method, which returns an object that inherits an extended version of http.Server. Connect\'s extensions are mainly there to make it easy to plug in middleware. That\'s why Connect describes itself as a "middleware framework," and is often analogized to Ruby\'s Rack.Express does to Connect what Connect does to the http module: It offers a createServer method that extends Connect\'s Server prototype. So all of the functionality of Connect is there, plus view rendering and a handy DSL for describing routes. Ruby\'s Sinatra is a good analogy.Then there are other frameworks that go even further and extend Express! Zappa, for instance, which integrates support for CoffeeScript, server-side jQuery, and testing.Here\'s a concrete example of what\'s meant by "middleware": Out of the box, none of the above serves static files for you. But just throw in connect.static (a middleware that comes with Connect), configured to point to a directory, and your server will provide access to the files in that directory. Note that Express provides Connect\'s middlewares also; express.static is the same as connect.static. (Both were known as staticProvider until recently.)My impression is that most "real" Node.js apps are being developed with Express these days; the features it adds are extremely useful, and all of the lower-level functionality is still there if you want it.The accepted answer is really old (and now wrong). Here\'s the information (with source) based on the current version of Connect (3.0) / Express (4.0).http / https createServer which simply takes a callback(req,res) e.g. Middleware is basically any software that sits between your application code and some low level API. Connect extends the built-in HTTP server functionality and adds a plugin framework. The plugins act as middleware and hence connect is a middleware frameworkThe way it does that is pretty simple (and in fact the code is really short!). As soon as you call var connect = require(\'connect\'); var app = connect(); you get a function app that can: Because of 1.) you can do the following : Combine with 2.) and you get: Connect provides a utility function to register itself with http so that you don\'t need to make the call to http.createServer(app). Its called listen and the code simply creates a new http server, register\'s connect as the callback and forwards the arguments to http.listen. From sourceSo, you can do: It\'s still your good old http.createServer with a plugin framework on top.ExpressJS and connect are parallel projects. Connect is just a middleware framework, with a nice use function. Express does not depend on Connect (see package.json). However it does the everything that connect does i.e: In addition to what connect provides (which express duplicates), it has a bunch of more features. e.g. The use function of ExpressJS and connect is compatible and therefore the middleware is shared. Both are middleware frameworks, express just has more than a simple middleware framework.My opinion: you are informed enough ^based on above^ to make your own choice.Most people should just use ExpressJS.These might have been true as some point in time, but wrong now: that inherits an extended version of http.ServerWrong. It doesn\'t extend it and as you have seen ... uses itExpress does to Connect what Connect does to the http moduleExpress 4.0 doesn\'t even depend on connect. see the current package.json dependencies sectionNode.js is a javascript motor for the server side.\nIn addition to all the js capabilities, it includes networking capabilities (like HTTP), and access to the file system.\nThis is different from client-side js where the networking tasks are monopolized by the browser, and access to the file system is forbidden for security reasons.  Something that runs in the server, understands HTTP and can access files sounds like a web server. But it isn\'t one.\nTo make node.js behave like a web server one has to program it: handle the incoming HTTP requests and provide the appropriate responses.\nThis is what Express does: it\'s the implementation of a web server in js.\nThus, implementing a web site is like configuring Express routes, and programming the site\'s specific features.  Serving pages involves a number of tasks. Many of those tasks are well known and very common, so node\'s Connect module (one of the many modules available to run under node) implements those tasks.\nSee the current impressing offering: Connect is the framework and through it you can pick the (sub)modules you need.\nThe Contrib Middleware page enumerates a long list of additional middlewares.\nExpress itself comes with the most common Connect middlewares.  Install node.js.\nNode comes with npm, the node package manager.\nThe command npm install -g express will download and install express globally (check the express guide).\nRunning express foo in a command line (not in node) will create a ready-to-run application named foo. Change to its (newly created) directory and run it with node with the command node <appname>, then open http://localhost:3000 and see.\nNow you are in. Connect offers a "higher level" APIs for common HTTP server functionality like session management, authentication, logging and more. Express is built on top of Connect with advanced  (Sinatra like) functionality.Node.js itself offers an HTTP module, whose createServer method returns an object that you can use to respond to HTTP requests. That object inherits the http.Server prototype.Related information, especially if you are using NTVS for working with the Visual Studio IDE. The NTVS adds both NodeJS and Express tools, scaffolding, project templates to Visual Studio 2012, 2013.Also, the verbiage that calls ExpressJS or Connect as a "WebServer" is incorrect. You can create a basic WebServer with or without them. A basic NodeJS program can also use the http module to handle http requests, Thus becoming a rudimentary web server.Connect and Express are web servers for nodejs. Unlike Apache and IIS, they can both use the same modules, referred to as "middleware".
