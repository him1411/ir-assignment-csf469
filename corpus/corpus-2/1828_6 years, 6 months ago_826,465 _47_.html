I have a string like this: I want to remove the whitespaces in the string. I tried trim() but this removes only whitespaces before and after the whole string. I also tried replaceAll("\\\\W", "") but then the = also gets removed.How can I achieve a string with:st.replaceAll("\\\\s+","") removes all whitespaces and non-visible characters (e.g., tab, \\n).st.replaceAll("\\\\s+","") and st.replaceAll("\\\\s","") produce the same result.The second regex is 20% faster than the first one, but as the number consecutive spaces increases, the first one performs better than the second one.Assign the value to a variable, if not used directly:\\w = Anything that is a word character\\W = Anything that isn\'t a word character (including punctuation etc)\\s = Anything that is a space character (including space, tab characters etc)\\S = Anything that isn\'t a space character (including both letters and numbers, as well as punctuation etc)(Edit: As pointed out, you need to escape the backslash if you want \\s to reach the regex engine, resulting in \\\\s.)The most correct answer to the question is:I just adapted this code from the other answers. I\'m posting it because besides being exactly what the question requested, it also demonstrates that the result is returned as a new string, the original string is not modified as some of the answers sort of imply.(Experienced Java developers might say "of course, you can\'t actually modify a String", but the target audience for this question may well not know this.)How about replaceAll("\\\\s", ""). Refer here.If you prefer utility classes to regexes, there is a method trimAllWhitespace(String) in StringUtils in the Spring Framework.You\'ve already got the correct answer from Gursel Koca but I believe that there\'s a good chance that this is not what you really want to do. How about parsing the key-values instead?output:\n  name = john\n  age = 13\n  year = 2001  One way to handle String manipulations is StringUtils from Apache commons.You can find it here.\ncommons-lang includes lots more and is well supported.You should useinstead of:This way, it will work with more than one spaces between each string. \nThe + sign in the above regex means "one or more \\s"If you need to remove unbreakable spaces too, you can upgrade your code like this :You can do it so simply by//it work fine with any spaces \n*don\'t forget space in sting bThe easiest way to do this is by using the org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils class of commons-lang3 library such as "commons-lang3-3.1.jar" for example.Use the static method "StringUtils.deleteWhitespace(String str)" on your input string & it will return you a string after removing all the white spaces from it. I tried your example string "name=john age=13 year=2001" & it returned me exactly the string that you wanted - "name=johnage=13year=2001". Hope this helps.\\W means "non word character". The pattern for whitespace characters is \\s. This is well documented in the Pattern javadoc.In java we can do following operation:for this you need to import following packages to your program:i hope it will help you.there are many ways to solve this problem.\nyou can use split function or replace function of Strings.for more info refer smilliar problem http://techno-terminal.blogspot.in/2015/10/how-to-remove-spaces-from-given-string.htmlUsing Pattern And Matcher it is more Dynamic.First with space, second without space. Then it is done. This works for me and locates ll white spaces, not just spaces of a certain size.To remove spaces in your example, this is another way to do it:What this does is it converts it into an array with the spaces being the separators, and then it combines the items in the array together without the spaces.It works pretty well and is easy to understand. You can achieve this without using replaceAll() or any Predefined Method in Java.\nthis way is preferred:-TRY THIS Use mysz.replaceAll("\\\\s+","");The code you want isThis will remove all the white spaces.
