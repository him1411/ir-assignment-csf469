Imagine that you have:What is the simplest way to produce the following dictionary ?This code works, but I\'m not really proud of it :Like this:Voila :-)  The pairwise dict constructor and zip function are awesomely useful: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-dictTry this:In Python 2, it\'s also more economical in memory consumption compared to zip.Imagine that you have:What is the simplest way to produce the following dictionary ?A possible improvement on using the dict constructor is to use the native syntax of a dict comprehension (not a list comprehension, as others have mistakenly put it):In Python 2, zip returns a list, to avoid creating an unnecessary list, use izip instead (aliased to zip can reduce code changes when you move to Python 3).So that is still:izip from itertools becomes zip in Python 3. izip is better than zip for Python 2 (because it avoids the unnecessary list creation), and ideal for 2.6 or below:In Python 3, zip becomes the same function that was in the itertools module, so that is simply:A dict comprehension would be more performant though (see performance review at the end of this answer).In all cases:If we look at the help on dict we see that it takes a variety of forms of arguments:The optimal approach is to use an iterable while avoiding creating unnecessary data structures. In Python 2, zip creates an unnecessary list:In Python 3, the equivalent would be:and Python 3\'s zip merely creates an iterable object:Since we want to avoid creating unnecessary data structures, we usually want to avoid Python 2\'s zip (since it creates an unnecessary list).This is a generator expression being passed to the dict constructor:or equivalently:And this is a list comprehension being passed to the dict constructor:In the first two cases, an extra layer of non-operative (thus unnecessary) computation is placed over the zip iterable, and in the case of the list comprehension, an extra list is unnecessarily created. I would expect all of them to be less performant, and certainly not more-so.In 64 bit Python 3.4.3, on Ubuntu 14.04, ordered from fastest to slowest:You can also use dictionary comprehensions in Python \xe2\x89\xa5 2.7:If you need to transform keys or values before creating a dictionary then a generator expression could be used. Example:Take a look Code Like a Pythonista: Idiomatic Python.A more natural way is to use dictionary comprehension with Python 3.x, goes for dict comprehensionsMore on dict comprehensions here, an example is there:For those who need simple code and aren\xe2\x80\x99t familiar with zip:This can be done by one line of code:method without zip function
