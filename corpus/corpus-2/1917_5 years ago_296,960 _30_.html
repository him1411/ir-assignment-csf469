I am working on writing some scripts to grep certain directories, but these directories contain all sorts of file types.I want to grep just .h and .cpp for now, but maybe a few others in the future.So far I have:Can anyone show me how I would now add just the specific file extensions?Just use the --include parameter, like this:that should do what you want.Some of these answers seemed too syntax-heavy, or they produced issues on my Debian Server.  This worked perfectly for me....or case-insensitive version...grep: command-r: recursively-i: ignore-case--include: all *.txt: text files (escape with \\ just in case you have a directory with asterisks in the filenames)\'searchterm\': What to search./: Start at current directory.How about:There is no -r option on HP and Sun servers, this way worked for me on my HP server-i is for case insensitive search of stringSince this is a matter of finding files, let\'s use find!Using GNU find you can use the -regex option to find those files in the tree of directories whose extension is either .h or .cpp:Then, it is just a matter of executing grep on each of its results:If you don\'t have this distribution of find you have to use an approach like Amir Afghani\'s, using -o to concatenate options (the name is either ending with .h or with .cpp):And if you really want to use grep, follow the syntax indicated to --include:I am aware this question is a bit dated, but I would like to share the method I normally use to find .c and .h files:or if you need the line number as well:The easiest way is ag (the silver searcher) has pretty simple syntax for thissoShould write "-exec grep " for each "-o -name "Or group them by ( )option \'-Hn\' show the file name and line.
