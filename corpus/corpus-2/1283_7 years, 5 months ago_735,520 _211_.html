I am attempting to debug an application on a Motorola Droid, but I am having some difficulty connecting to the device via USB. My development server is a Windows 7 64-bit VM running in Hyper-V, and so I cannot connect directly via USB in the guest or from the host.I installed a couple of different USB-over-TCP solutions, but the connection appears to have issues since the ADB monitor reports "devicemonitor failed to start monitoring" repeatedly. Is there a way to connect directly from the client on the development machine to the daemon on the device using the network instead of the USB connection or possibly another viable options?According to a post on xda-developers, you can enable ADB over Wi-Fi from the device with the commands:And you can disable it and return ADB to listening on USB withIt is even easier to switch to using Wi-Fi, if you already have USB. From a command line on the computer that has the device connected via USB, issue the commandsBe sure to replace 192.168.0.101 with the IP address that is actually assigned to your device.You can find the IP address of a tablet in two ways:Manual IP Discovery:Go into Android\'s WiFi settings, click the menu button in the action bar (the vertical ellipsis), hit Advanced and see the IP address at the bottom of the screen.Use ADB to discover IP:Execute the following command via adb:To tell the ADB daemon return to listening over USBThere are also several apps on Google Play that automate this process. A quick search suggests adbWireless, WiFi ADB and ADB WiFi. All of these require root access, but adbWireless requires fewer permissions.This is really simple if your phone is rooted.Download a terminal emulator from Google Play (there are lots that are free). Make sure that your Android device is connected to your Wi-Fi and get the Wi-Fi IP address. Open the terminal program and type:Now go to your computer (assuming that you are using Windows) and create a shortcut on the desktop for "cmd.exe" (without the quotations).Right click on the cmd shortcut and choose "Run as Administrator"Change to your android-sdk-windows\\tools folderType:adb should now say that you are connected.Note: if you are too fast to give the connect command it may fail. So try at least two times five seconds apart before you say this doesn\'t work.Connect device via USB and make sure debugging is working, then run:Disconnect USB and proceed with wireless debugging.When you\'re done and want to switch back to USB debugging, run:To find the IP address of your device, go to Settings > Wi-Fi > Advanced > IP Address on your device or run adb shell netcfg.No root required. Only one device can be debugged at a time.See this XDA post.The adb command is located in the platform-tools folder of the Android SDK.From adb --help:That\'s a command-line option by the way.You should try connecting the phone to your Wi-Fi, and then get its IP address from your router. It\'s not going to work on the cell network.The port is 5554.I needed to get both USB and TCPIP working for ADB (don\'t ask), so I did the following (using directions others have posted from xda-developers)Using adb shell:For PC users:Step 1:\nYou have to enable Developer options in your Android phone.\n You can enable Developer options using this way.\n   \xe2\x80\xa2     Open Settings> About> Software Information> More.\n   \xe2\x80\xa2    Then tap \xe2\x80\x9cBuild number\xe2\x80\x9d seven times to enable Developer options.\n   \xe2\x80\xa2    Go back to Settings menu and now you\'ll be able to see \xe2\x80\x9cDeveloper options\xe2\x80\x9d    there.  \n   \xe2\x80\xa2    Tap it and turn on USB Debugging from the menu on the next screen.Step 2:Open cmd and type adb.\nif you find that adb is not valid command then you have to add a path to the environment variable.\xe2\x80\xa2First go to you SDK installed folder\n  Follow this path and this path is just for an example.\n  D:\\softwares\\Development\\Andoird\\SDK\\sdk\\platform-tools\\; \n  D:\\softwares\\Development\\Andoird\\SDK\\sdk\\tools;\n \xe2\x80\xa2 Now search on windows system advanced setting\xe2\x80\xa2\nOpen the  Environment variable.then open path and paste the following path\n this is an example.\n You SDK path is different from mine please use yours.      D:\\softwares\\Development\\Andoird\\SDK\\sdk\\platform-tools\\;\nD:\\softwares\\Development\\Andoird\\SDK\\sdk\\tools;Step 3:Open cmd and type adb. if you still see that adb is not valid command then your path has not set properly follow above steps.Now you can connect your android phone to PC.Open cmd and type adb devices and you can see your device.\nFind you phone ip address.Type:- adb tcpip 5555Get the IP address of your phoneNow,Now run your android project and if not see you device then type again adb connect IP address of your phoneFor Linux and MAC User:Step 1: open terminal and install adb using Connect your phone via USB cable to PC.\nType following command in terminalUsing adb, connect your android phone ip address.Remove your phone.To connect your tablet using TCP port. \nMake sure your system and device is connected to same network.Connected using port forward\nTry to do port forwarding,adb forward tcp:<PC port> tcp:<device port>like:adb forward tcp:5555 tcp:5555.C:\\Users\\abc>adb forward tcp:7612 tcp:7612C:\\Users\\abc>adb tcpip 7612 restarting in TCP mode port: 7612C:\\Users\\abc>adb connect 10.0.0.1:7612connected to 10.0.0.1:7612If you get message error: device not found connect a usb device to system then follow same procedure.\nfor a rooted device First you must connect your device via USBThen connect your device to WIFI and get the IP address.\nWhile still connect via usb type this in command line or via Android Studio TerminalYou will see these messages:Now remove the USB cable and you will still see your logcat as normalDone. Enjoy I do not know how to connect the device without any USB connection at all, but if you manage to connect it maybe at another computer you can switch the adbd to TCP mode by issuing from a terminal and connect to your device over wifi from any PC on the network by:Maybe it is also possible to switch to TCP mode from a terminal on the device.If you want to easily connect your device to run, debug or deploy your Android apps over WiFi you can use an open source IntelliJ Plugin I\'ve developed. Here is the code and here the plugin ready to be used.The usage is quite simple. Here you have a gif:Assume you saved adb path into your windows environment pathNow in command prompt you should see the result like: connected to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:5555As Brian said:According to a post on xda-developers, you can enable ADB over WiFi from the device with the commandssetprop service.adb.tcp.port 5555stop adbdstart adbdAnd you can disable it and return ADB to listening on USB withsetprop service.adb.tcp.port -1stop adbdstart adbdIf you have USB access already, it is even easier to switch to using WiFi. From a command line on the computer that has the device connected via USB, issue the commandsadb tcpip 5555adb connect 192.168.0.101:5555To tell the ADB daemon return to listening over USBadb usbThere are also several apps on the Android Market that automate this process.It works.You just need to access the android shell and type those commands...One other (easier) solution is on the Market: adbWireless, it will automatically set your phone.Root is required! for both...(Note that this can be done using a rooted device as well, but you can use a shell on a rooted device which doesn\'t require a USB connection)Firstly, open command prompt (CMD). If you use Android Studio or IntelliJ there is a console included in there you can use.If possible, open the SDK location, right click and press "start command prompt here". Not all have this option so you have to do this(/these) commands as well:Change the drive(if applicable)And access the sdk and platform tools. Replace this path with your SDK location:Now you have access to the android debug bridge.Now, with the device connected to the computer, do:Where  is the port you want to connect to (default is 5555) and  is the IP of the device you want to connect to.Please note: 5555 is the default port and just writing the IP address connects it. If you use a custom port you can at least improve the security a bit. USB debugging over wifi can be abused, but only if the device is connected to the computer who wants to abuse the device. Using a non-default port at least makes it a bit harder to connect.If you use a custom port, make sure to add it after the IP. Writing no port connects to 5555 and if you didn\'t use that the connection will fail.You can find the IP address of a device in two ways:Depending on your device, the exact names may vary. Open settings and go to About device -> Status -> IP addressUse ADB to get the IPFrom the console, do:And once you are finished with the connection, you can disconnect the device from your computer by doing:Or no ip to disconnect all devices. If you used a custom port, you must specify which port to disconnect from. The default is 5555 here as well.To disable the port (if that is something you want to do) you do this command with the device connected:Or you can restart the device to remove the tcpip connectionFirstly, you need access to the shell. You either connect the device using a usb cable and use adb shell or download an app from Google Play, FDroid or some other source.Then you do:And to connect the device, you do as in the non-rooted version by doing adb connect <ip>:<port>.And if you want to disable the port and go back to USB listening:Weird, but this only works for me if I have the USB cable connected, then I can unplug the usb and go for it with everything else adb. and the same when returning to usb,will only work if usb is connected.It doesn\'t matter if I issue the or then stop & start adbd, I still need the usb cable in or it doesn\'t work.So, if my ADB over usb wasn\'t working, I bet I wouldn\'t be able to enable ADB over WiFi either.To switch between TCP and USB modes with just one command, you can add this to /init.rc:And now you can use property service.adb.tcp.enable to enable or disable listening on port 5555. Run netstat to check whether it\'s listening. As you can see it will also trigger if you do wish to change service.adb.tcp.port manually.Make sure both your adb host computer and Android device are on the same Wifi network.\n\nConnect the Android device with the computer using your USB cable. As soon as you do that, your host computer will detect your device and adb will start running in the USB mode on the computer. You can check the attached devices with adb devices whereas ensure that adb is running in the USB mode by executing adb usb.Restart adb in tcpip mode with this command:Find out the IP address of the Android device. There are several ways to do that:Now that you know the IP address of your device, connect your adb host to it.Remove the USB cable and you should be connected to your device. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t see it in adb devices then just reconnect using the previous step\xe2\x80\x99s command:Either you\xe2\x80\x99re good to go now or you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to kill your adb server by executing adb kill-server and go through all the steps again once more.Hope that helps!\n\n\n\nReference: You can also use SSH local port forwarding. But it still involves a USB cable. Connect your phone using USB to a computer (host) with an sshd running. On a remote (guest) pc start an SSH client capable of portforwarding/tunneling. Example:I use this construction to connect my device to a virtual machine. Eltima USB to Ethernet wasn\'t stable enough (timeouts during debug).SSH tunneling works for free and is more reliable.I find the other answers confusing. Far simpler to use adbWireless:http://ppareit.github.com/AdbConnect/Simply install an app on your phone to toggle debugging over wifi, install an eclipse plug-in and you\'re done.I put together a batch file for automatic enabling and connecting ADB via TCP, to a device connected via USB. With it you don\'t have to put in the IP manually.Here\'s an extension to Brian\'s answer using Bluetooth:On Linux, use Blueman to share PC internet with your device via Bluetooth:Use the Bluetooth network for ADB commands:Once done to return to USB mode:Note: Bluetooth 3.0 and 4.0 can go up to 24 Mbit/s.Steps :this works perfectly with ssh from my windows PCI try to do this on the boot on my cyanogen mobile or launch this with plink. With plink I can\'t launch shell with su right ... sudo or su command not works. On boot I don\'t know how it\'s works! \nMy shell program works from ssh with su -c "sh /storage/sdcard1/start_adb.sh" with the last 3 commands (without su --)ThanksYou Need to do following things:Use the adbwireless app to enable the phone, then use adb connect from the Windows machine to talk to it.  The adbwireless app on the phone tells you how to connect to it, giving the IP address and everything.The much less fun alternative is to connect via USB, tell the phone to use TCPIP via adb tcpip 5555, then disconnect USB, then use adb connect.  This is much harder because this way you have to figure out the IP address of the phone yourself (adbwireless tells you the IP), you have to connect via USB, and you have to run adb tcpip (adbwireless takes care of that too).So: install adbwireless on your phone.  Use it. It is possible, I do it routinely on Linux and on Windows.On my system it went like this:On my Android device in my Linux shell, a simple "ifconfig" did not give me my IP address.  I had to type:ifconfig eth0-or-netcfgto get my IP address.  (I knew eth0 was configured because I saw it in my dmesg.)  Then I did the :setprop service.adb.tcp.port -1stop adbdstart adbdThen on my Win7 box (the one running Eclipse 3.7.1).  I opened a command prompt to  \\android-sdk\\platform-tools>without running as admin.  Then I did aadb connect 12.345.678.90I never put a port.  If I did a adb tcpip 5555it said it couldn\'t find the device then nothing appeared in my "adb devices" list.  I.e. it only works if I DON\'T do the tcpip command above.  I can do an "adb shell" and mess with my Android Device.  But my Android Device does not appear in my Run->Run Configurations->Target tab right now.  On the other hand, if I keep the Target Tab set to automatic.  Then when I run my app via Run->Run it does run on my Android device even though my Android device is not even listed as one of my targets.I did get this working.  Didn\'t use any usb cable.Run it. That will set ip and port; Then in dosConnected.I\'ve found a convenient method that i would like to share.For WindowsHaving USB Access OnceNo root requiredConnect your phone and pc to a hotspot or run portable hotspot from your phone and connect your pc to it.Get the ip of your phone as prescribed by brian (Wont need if you\'re making hotspot from your phone)Open NotepadWrite theseChange the location given above to where your pc contains the abd.exe fileChange the ip to your phone ip. Note : The IP given above is the basic IP of an android device when it makes a hotspot. If you are connecting to a wifi network and if your device\'s IP keeps on changing while connecting to a hotspot every time, you can make it static by configuring within the wifi settings. Google it.Now save the file as ABD_Connect.bat (MS-DOS batch file).Save it somewhere and refer a shortcut to Desktop or Start button.Connect through USB once, and try running some application. After that whenever you want to connect wirelessly, double click the shortcut.Note : Sometimes you need to open the shortcut each time you debug the application. So making a shortcut key for the shortcut in desktop will be more convenient. I\'ve made a shortcut key like Ctrl+Alt+S. So whenever i wish to debug, i\'ll press Shift+F9 and Ctrl+Alt+SNote : If you find device=null error on cmd window, check your IP, it might have changed.One additional note (learned the hard way): You should not have your company VPN-connection active at the same time... I just followed following steps and it started working, so that i can connect to my android device.Step 1: Open the terminal Window in Android Devices and execute the following command.Step 2: Through ADB, Execute the bellow command.(From the path where ADB is configured)adb connect 10.10.10.50:5555  - Here 10.10.10.50 is the IP address of the android device and 5555 is the port number.adb can communicate with adb server over tcp socket.\nyou can verify this by telnet.generally, command has the format %04x%s with <message.length><msg>\nthe following is the ruby command witch sends adb command cmd against tcp socket socketthe first example sends the command host:version which length is 12(000c in hex).\nyou can enjoy more exciting command like framebuffer: which takes screenshot from framebuffer as you can guess from its name.If you want to be able to do it on a button click then:Note: If it did not work:
