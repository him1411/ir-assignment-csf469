I have a char and I need a String. How do I convert from one to the other?You can use Character.toString(char). Note that this method simply returns a call to String.valueOf(char), which also works.As others have noted, string concatenation works as a shortcut as well:But this compiles down to:which is less efficient because the StringBuilder is backed by a char[] (over-allocated by StringBuilder() to 16), only for that array to be defensively copied by the resulting String.String.valueOf(char) "gets in the back door" by wrapping the char in a single-element array and passing it to the package private constructor String(char[], boolean), which avoids the array copy.Nice question. I\'ve got of the following five 6 methods to do it.Note: Character.toString(char) returns String.valueOf(char). So effectively both are same.String.valueOf(char[] value) invokes new String(char[] value), which in turn sets the value char array.On the other hand String.valueOf(char value) invokes the following package private constructor.Source code from String.java in Java 8 source codeHence String.valueOf(char) seems to be most efficient method, in terms of both memory and speed, for converting char to String.Below are various ways to convert to char c to String s (in decreasing order of speed and efficiency)Use any of the following:Use the Character.toString() method like soTry this: Character.toString(aChar) or just this: aChar + ""We have various ways to convert a char to String. One way is to make use of static method toString() in Character class:Actually this toString method internally makes use of valueOf method from String class which makes use of char array:So second way is to use this directly:This valueOf method in String class makes use of char array:So the third way is to make use of an anonymous array to wrap a single character and then passing it to String constructor:The fourth way is to make use of concatenation:This will actually make use of append method from StringBuilder class which is actually preferred when we are doing concatenation in a loop. Here are a few methods, in no particular order:As @WarFox stated - there are 6 methods to convert char to string. However, the fastest one would be via concatenation, despite answers above stating that it is String.valueOf. Here is benchmark that proves that:And result:As you can see, the fastest one would be c + "" or "" + c;This performance difference is due to -XX:+OptimizeStringConcat optimization. You can read about it here.I\'ve tried the suggestions but ended up implementing it as followsI am converting Char Array to String
