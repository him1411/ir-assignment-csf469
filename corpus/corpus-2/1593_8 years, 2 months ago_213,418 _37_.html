For example:I don\'t know what the + means. What\'s the difference between this and just defining a style for p without + p?This selector means that the style applies only to paragraphs directly following another paragraph.\nA plain p selector would apply the style to every paragraph in the page.See adjacent selectors on W3.org.This will only work on IE7 or above. In IE6, the style will not be applied to any elements.

It will select any p DIRECTLY AFTER  a p (not a child or parent though, a sibling).+ selector is called Adjacent Sibling Selector. For example, the selector p + p, selects the p elements immediately following the p elements It can be thought of as a looking outside selector which checks for the immediately following element. Here is a sample snippet to make things more clear: Since we are one the same topic,  it is worth mentioning another selector, ~ selector, which is General Sibling SelectorFor example, p ~ p selects all the p which follows the p doesn\'t matter where it is, but both p should be having the same parent.
