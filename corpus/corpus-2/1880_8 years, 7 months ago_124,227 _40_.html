I\'m merging in a remote branch that may have a lot of conflicts.  How can I tell if it will have conflicts or not?I don\'t see anything like a --dry-run on git-merge.  As noted previously, pass in the --no-commit flag, but to avoid a fast-forward commit, also pass in --no-ff, like so:This will allow you to examine/undo the merge, even if it is a fast-forward merge:I just had to implement a method that automatically finds conflicts between a repository and its remote. This solution does the merge in memory so it won\'t touch the index, nor the working tree. I think this is the safest possible way you can solve this problem. Here\'s how it works:Now suppose that you want to merge the remote master with your local master, but you can use any branches. git merge-tree will execute the merge in memory and print the result to the standard output. Grep for the pattern << or >>. Or you can print the output to a file and check that. If you find a line starting with \'changed in both\' then most probably there will be a conflict.Undoing a merge with git is so easy you shouldn\'t even worry about the dry run:EDIT: As noted in the comments below, if you have changes in your working directory or staging area you\'ll probably want to stash them before doing the above (otherwise they will disappear following the git reset above)My brute-force simple solution to this is:1: create a pre-master branch (from master of course)\n2: merge all the things you want to do to this pre-master\n   then you can see how the merging happened without touching master then.\n3a: merge pre-master into master or\n3b: merge all wannabe-released branches into masterAnyway I would follow @orange80 advise.I made an alias for doing this and works like a charm, I do this:Now I just callTo find out if there are any conflicts.Just diff your current branch against the remote branch, this will tell you what is going to change when you do a pull/merge.I use the request-pull git command to do so. It allows you to see every change that would happen when merging, but without doing anything on your local or remote repositories.For instance, imagine you want to merge a branch named "feature-x" into your master branchwill show you a summary of what would happen (without doing anything):If you add the -pparameter, you will also get the full patch text, exactly like if you were doing a git diff on every changed file.This might be interesting: From the documentation:If you tried a merge which resulted in complex conflicts and want to\n  start over, you can recover with git merge --abort.But you could also do it the naive (but slow) way:(Note: It won\'t work just cloning to /tmp, you\'d need a copy, in order to be sure that uncommitted changes will not conflict).I am aware that this is an old question, but it is the first to appear on a Google search.Git introduced a --ff-only option when merging. From: http://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge--ff-onlyRefuse to merge and exit with a non-zero status unless the current HEAD is already up-to-date or the merge can be resolved as a fast-forward.Doing this will attempt to merge and fast-forward, and if it can\'t it aborts and prompts you that the fast-forward could not be performed, but leaves your working branch untouched. If it can fast-forward, then it will perform the merge on your working branch. This option is also available on git pull. Thus, you could do the following:I use git log to see what has changed on a feature branch from master branche.g. - to see what commits are in a feature branch that has/not been merged to master:If you want to fast forward from B to A, then you must make sure that git log B..A shows you nothing, i.e. A has nothing that B doesn\'t have. But even if B..A has something, you might still be able to merge without conflicts, so the above shows two things: that there will be a fast-forward, and thus you won\'t get a conflict.I\'m surprised nobody has suggested using patches yet.Say you\'d like to test a merge from your_branch into master (I\'m assuming you have master checked out):That should do the trick.If you get errors likethat means that the patch wasn\'t successful and a merge would produce conflicts. No output means the patch is clean and you\'d be able to easily merge the branchNote that this will not actually change your working tree (aside from creating the patch file of course, but you can safely delete that afterwards). From the git-apply documentation:Note to anyone who is smarter/more experienced with git than me: please do let me know if I\'m wrong here and this method does show different behaviour than a regular merge. It seems strange that in the 8+ years that this question has existed noone would suggest this seemingly obvious solution.Make a temporary copy of your working copy, then merge into that, and diff the two.
