Suppose that I have a <div> that I wish to center in the browser\'s display (viewport). To do so, I need to calculate the width and height of the <div> element. What should I use? Please include information on browser compatibility.You should use the .offsetWidth and .offsetHeight properties.\nNote they belong to the element, not .style.var width = document.getElementById(\'foo\').offsetWidth;Take a look at Element.getBoundingClientRect().This method will return an object containing the width, height, and some other useful values:For Example:I believe this does not have the issues that .offsetWidth and .offsetHeight do where they sometimes return 0 (as discussed in the comments here)Another difference is getBoundingClientRect() may return fractional pixels, where .offsetWidth and .offsetHeight will round to the nearest integer.IE8 Note: getBoundingClientRect does not return height and width on IE8 and below.*If you must support IE8, use .offsetWidth and .offsetHeight:Reference:NOTE: this answer was written in 2008. At the time the best cross-browser solution for most people really was to use jQuery. I\'m leaving the answer here for posterity and, if you\'re using jQuery, this is a good way to do it. If you\'re using some other framework or pure JavaScript the accepted answer is probably the way to go.As of jQuery 1.2.6 you can use one of the core CSS functions, height and width (or outerHeight and outerWidth, as appropriate).Just in case it is useful to anyone, I put a textbox, button and div all with the same css:I tried it in chrome, firefox and ie-edge, I tried with jquery and without, and I tried it with and without box-sizing:border-box. Always with <!DOCTYPE html>The results:You only need to calculate it for IE7 and older (and only if your content doesn\'t have fixed size). I suggest using HTML conditional comments to limit hack to old IEs that don\'t support CSS2. For all other browsers use this:This is the perfect solution. It centers <div> of any size, and shrink-wraps it to size of its content. element.offsetWidth and element.offsetHeight should do, as suggested in previous post. However, if you just want to center the content, there is a better way of doing so. Assuming you use xhtml strict DOCTYPE. set the margin:0,auto property and required width in px to the body tag. The content gets center aligned to the page.... seems CSS help to put div on center ...also you can use this code:If offsetWidth returns 0, you can get element\'s style width property and search it for a number. "100px" -> 100/\\d*/.exec(MyElement.style.width)
