I get this error message as I execute my JUnit tests:I know what an OutOfMemoryError is, but what does GC overhead limit mean? How can I solve this?This message means that for some reason the garbage collector is taking an excessive amount of time (by default 98% of all CPU time of the process) and recovers very little memory in each run (by default 2% of the heap).This effectively means that your program stops doing any progress and is busy running only the garbage collection at all time.To prevent your application from soaking up CPU time without getting anything done, the JVM throws this Error so that you have a chance of diagnosing the problem.The rare cases where I\'ve seen this happen is where some code was creating tons of temporary objects and tons of weakly-referenced objects in an already very memory-constrained environment.Check out this article for details (specifically this part).The GC throws this exception when too much time is spent in garbage collection for too little return, eg. 98% of CPU time is spent on GC and less than 2% of heap is recovered.This feature is designed to prevent applications from running for an extended period of time while making little or no progress because the heap is too small.You can turn this off with the command line option \n-XX:-UseGCOverheadLimitMore info hereEDIT: looks like someone can type faster than me :)If you are sure there are no memory leaks in your program, try to:If necessary, the limit check can be disabled by adding the option -XX:-UseGCOverheadLimit to the command line.It\'s usually the code. Here\'s a simple example:Using java 1.6.0_24-b07 On a Windows7 32 bit.java -Xloggc:gc.log GarbageCollectorThen look at gc.logNow granted, this is not the best test or the best design but when faced with a situation where you have no choice but implementing such a loop or when dealing with existing code that behaves badly, choosing to reuse objects instead of creating new ones can reduce the number of times the garbage collector gets in the way...Just increase the heap size a little by setting this option inRun \xe2\x86\x92 Run Configurations \xe2\x86\x92 Arguments \xe2\x86\x92 VM argumentsXms - for minimum limitXmx - for maximum limitCause for the errorGC overhead limit exceeded" indicates that the garbage collector is running all the time and Java program is making very slow progress. After a garbage collection, if the Java process is spending more than approximately 98% of its time doing garbage collection and if it is recovering less than 2% of the heap and has been doing so far the last 5 (compile time constant) consecutive garbage collections, then a java.lang.OutOfMemoryError is thrownApart from setting heap memory with -Xms1g -Xmx2g , tryHave a look at some more related questions regarding G1GCJava 7 (JDK 7) garbage collection and documentation on G1Java G1 garbage collection in productionOracle technetwork article for GC finetuningFor me, the following steps worked:ChangetoRestart EclipseSee hereThe following worked for me. Just add the following snippet:try thisopen the build.gradle file  You need to increase the memory size in Jdeveloper go to setDomainEnv.cmd.and increase javaMaxHeapsize in your build.gradle(Module:app) fileto (Add this line in gradle)In netbeans, it may be helpful to design a max heap size. Go to \'Run\', then go to \'Set Project Configuration\', then select \'Customise\', in the \'run\' of its popped up window, go to \'VM Option\', fill in \'-Xms2048m -Xmx2048m\'. It could solve heap size problem.
