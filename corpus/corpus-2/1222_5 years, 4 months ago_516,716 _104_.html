I need to add some rules to my .gitignore file, however, I can\'t find it in my project folder. Isn\'t it created automatically by Xcode? If not, what command allows me to create one?If you\'re using Windows it will not let you create a file without a filename in Windows Explorer. It will give you the error "You must type a file name" if you try to rename a text file as .gitignoreTo get around this I used the following stepsAs simple as things can (sometimes) be: Just add the following into your preferred command line interface (GNU Bash, Git Bash, etc.)testmenowUpdate: Tested with Windows CMD and it does not work on Win 8.1+. Nevertheless it does work using Git Bash which you should have installed in Windows if you are using Git.Update: As @Wardy pointed out in the comments, touch works on Windows as well as long as you provide the full path. This might also explain why it does not work for some users on Windows: The touch command seems to not be in the $PATH on some Win versions per default.The easiest way to create the .gitignore file in Windows Explorer is to create a new file named .gitignore..\nThis will skip the validation of having a file extension, since is actually has an empty file extension.The .gitignore file is not added to a repository by default.  Use vi or your favorite editor to create the .gitignore file then issue a git add .gitignore followed by git commit -m "message" .gitignore.  That will take care of it.======== Easy peasy!  No command line required! ========On Windows you can use cmd\necho "" >.gitignoreOr use Git Bash cmd\ntouch .gitignore,\nthis useful for Linux and Mac SystemHere a nice tip under Windows:Tested under Windows 7 and 8.This tip assumes that your Windows Explorer displays the file extensions.Using Git Bash console.-Navigate to your project\n-Type "touch .gitignore"the .gitignore file will be created for you.An easy way to get a default git ignore without messing about with create/copy/paste is to use the curl command from the terminal. First cd into your projects root directory and then run the command by replacing MY_API_NAME with your API name from one of the following two sources:You can find your API name by searching from the list here and clicking Generate.Java Example:Alternatively you can use the ones at GitHub. Find the filename for your API here.Java Example:Here are some similar alternatives for Windows.But honestly setting that up looks like more trouble that it is worth. If I had Windows then I would just create an empty file called .gitignore in my project\'s root folder and then copy and paste the default text from gitignore.io or GitHub. My contribution is aimed at those on a mac, it can be applied to not only those working on an iOS project (as implied by the question mentioning Xcode), but any type of project.\n\nStep 1\nWhile in your project runvim .gitnore\nStep 2\nYou now have your file open with vim. Press i to insert text. You will see that the file is ready when you see the --INSERT-- at the bottom.\nStep 3 (option 1)\nFor Objective-C projects, you can copy from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/master/Objective-C.gitignore and paste it into your .gitignoreThen press esc then type in :wq then press return. Which saves the file. \nStep 3 (option 2)\nAdd whatever files apply to your project. If you are not sure what to add, the best keywords to use in your search engine would be to include your project type and text editor. For example, if you use Sublime you would want to add And if you are working with a Cordova project in Dreamweaver you would want to add Here\'s my personal favorite, http://help.github.com/ignore-files/Also just in case you wanted to ignore xcode files, refer to this answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/49488/126235in windows, open a dos prompt(cmd) windows, use command line:Create a .gitignore file in include all files and directories that you don\'t want to commit.Ex:http://gitignore.io is an open source utility that can help you create useful .gitignore files for your project.

For example mine looks like this:Once you have this, you need to add it to your git repository. You have to save the file where your repository is. Then in your git bash you have to write the following line:If the respository already exists then you have to do the following:1)    git rm -r --cached .\n2)    git add .\n3)    git commit -m ".gitignore is now working"If the step 2 dowsn\xc2\xb4t work then you should write the hole route of the files that you would like to add.Hope it helps!With copy con command: \n With start notepad .gitignore command:\n With edit .gitignore command (Windows x86 only):If you don\'t want to have your .gitignore interfere with anyone else\'s repository, you can also use .git/info/exclude.
