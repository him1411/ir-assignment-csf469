I was reading about AsyncTask, and I tried the simple program below. But it does not seem to work. How can I make it work?I am just trying to change the label after 5 seconds in the background process.This is my main.xml:Ok you are trying to access the GUI via another thread. This, in the main, is not good practice. The AsyncTask executes everything in doInBackground() inside of another thread, which does not have access to the GUI where your views are.preExecute() and postExecute() offer you access to GUI before and after the heavy lifting occurs in this new thread, you can even pass the result of the long operation to postExecute() to then show any results of processing.See these lines where you are later updating your TextView:put them in PostExecute()You will then see your TextView text updated after the doInBackground completes.EDIT: I noticed that your onClick listener does not check to see which View has been selected. I find the easiest way to do this is via switch statements. I have a complete class edited below with all suggestions to save confusion.My full answer is here, but here is an explanatory image to supplement the other answers on this page. For me, understanding where all the variables were going was the most confusing part in the beginning.I\'m sure it is executing properly, but you\'re trying to change the UI elements in the background thread and that won\'t do.Revise your call and AsyncTask as follows:Calling ClassNote: I personally suggest using onPostExecute() wherever you execute your AsyncTask thread and not in the class that extends AsyncTask itself. I think it makes the code easier to read especially if you need the AsyncTask in multiple places handling the results slightly different.LongThread class (extends AsyncTask):Concept and code hereI have created a simple example for using AsyncTask of Android. It starts with onPreExecute(), doInBackground(), publishProgress() and finally onProgressUpdate().In this doInBackground() works as a background thread, while other works in the UI Thread. You can\'t access an UI element in doInBackground(). The sequence is same as I have mentioned.However if you need to update any widget from doInBackground you can publishProgress from doInBackground which will call onProgressUpdate to update your UI widget.Call it like this in your activity:Developer Reference HereMove these two lines:out of your AsyncTask\'s doInBackground method and put them in the onPostExecute method. Your AsyncTask should look something like this:Shortest example for just doing something asynchronously:To run it:When an asynchronous task is executed, the task goes through 4 steps:Below is an demo exampleand once you created, a task is executed very simply:I hope this will help you...When you are in the worker thread, you can not directly manipulate UI elements on Android.When you are using AsyncTask please understand the callback methods.For example:FYI:\nTo access the UI thread from a worker thread, you either use runOnUiThread() method or post method on your view.For instance:This will help you know the things better. Hence in you case, you need to set your textview in the onPostExecute() method.I would recommend making your life easier by using this library for background works\nhttps://github.com/Arasthel/AsyncJobLibraryits this simple..Sample Async Task with POST request:Simply:You need to declare the button onclicklistener, once click it calls AsyncTask class DownloadJson ,the process will be shown below:Change your code as given below:AsyncTask allows you to run a task on a background thread, while publishing results to the UI thread.The user should always able to interact with the app and it is\n  important to avoid blocking the main (UI) thread with tasks such as\n  downloading content from the web.  This is when we would use an\n  AsyncTask.The UI thread has a message queue and a handler that allows you to send and process runnable objects and messages, often from other threads.  AsyncTask wraps this behaviour with a straight forward interface.AsyncTask is a generic class.  (Meaning it takes parameterized types in its constructor. Each generic parameter is defined as a Java variable argument with the three dots: ... and so is technically passed as an array).The three types used by an AsyncTask are Params, Progress, and Result:These three parameters correspond to three primary functions you can override in AsyncTask:onPostExecute()also:To execute AsyncTaskcall Execute with parameters to be sent to the background task.What happensUsing again the example of the blocking task being to download something from the web, the following example downloads an image and displays it in an ImageView.  The doInBackground() method downloads the image and stores it in an object of type BitMap.  The onPostExecute() method takes the bitmap and places it in the ImageView.
