I have a local git repository called \'skeleton\' that I use for storing project skeletons. It has a few branches, for different kinds of projects:If I want to check out the master branch for a new project, I can doand everything is how I want it. Specifically, the new master branch points to skeleton master branch, and I can push and pull to move around changes to the basic project setup.What doesn\'t work, however, is if I want to clone another branch. I can\'t get it so that I only pull the branch I want, for instance the rails branch, and then the new repo has a \'master\' branch that pushes to and pulls from the skeleton repo\'s \'rails\' branch, by default.Is there a good way to go about doing this? Or, maybe this isn\'t the way that git wants me to structure things, and I\'m certainly open to that. Perhaps I should have multiple repos, with the rails skeleton repo tracking the master skeleton repo? And any individual project cloning the rails skeleton repo.Any thoughts and suggestions are appreciated!Note: the git1.7.10 (April 2012) actually allows you to clone only one branch:You can see it in t5500-fetch-pack.sh:Tobu comments that:This is implicit when doing a shallow clone.\n  This makes git clone --depth 1 the easiest way to save bandwidth.And since Git 1.9.0 (February 2014), shallow clones support data transfer (push/pull), so that option is even more useful now.\nSee more at "Is git clone --depth 1 (shallow clone) more useful than it makes out?"."Undoing" a shallow clone is detailed at "Convert shallow clone to full clone" (git 1.8.3+)As Chris comments:the magic line for getting missing branches to reverse --single-branch is (git v2.1.4):One way is to execute the following Where branch_name is the branch of your choice and "/your/folder" is the destination folder for that branch.  It\'s true that this will bring other branches giving you the opportunity to merge back and forth.  Now, starting with GIT 1.7.10, you can now do thisUsing git version 1.7.3.1 (on Windows),  here\'s what I do ($BRANCH is the name of the branch I want to checkout and $REMOTE_REPO is the URL of the remote repository I want to clone from):The advantage of this approach is that subsequent git pull (or git fetch) calls will also just download the requested branch.You can try the long winded way:What this does is:Hopefully that will be something like what you are after.from git-clone man  page--single-branch is your friend during clone\nremember to use with --branch <branch name> or only remote primary HEAD will be cloned (master by default)always remember to do CTRL+F5 to read fresh source, not the one from cache :-)\n(I didn\'t so didn\'t know about this option for long time)You can do it by using the below command:Just put url and branch nameCan be done in 2 stepsClone the repositoryCheckout the branch you wantAfter cloning was complete, I had to enter git submodule update --init --recursive to download all submodulesopen the cmd\ncd folder_name (Enter the path where to clone the branch)\nJust a command for cloning branch of git you don\'t have public key the use this
