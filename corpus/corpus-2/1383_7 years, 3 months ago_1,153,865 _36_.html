Hoping someone can assist but I need assistance with overlaying one individual div over another individual div.My code looks like this:Unfortunately I cannot nest the div#infoi or the img, inside the first div.navi.It has to be two separate divs as shown but I need to know how I could place the div#infoi over the div.navi and to the right most side and centered on top of the div.navi.Would appreciate any help in achieving this.I would suggest learning about position: relative and child elements with position: absolute.By using a div with style z-index:1; and position: absolute; you can overlay your div on any other div.z-index determines the order in which divs \'stack\'. A div with a higher z-index will appear in front of a div with a lower z-index. Note that this property only works with positioned elements.This is what you need:Here follows a simple solution 100% based on CSS. The "secret" is to use the display: inline-block in the wrapper element. The vertical-align: block in the image is a hack to overcome the 4px padding that some browsers add after the element.Advice: if the element before the wrapper is inline they can end up nested. In this case you can "wrap the wrapper" inside a container with display: block - usually a good and old div.I am not much of a coder nor an expert in CSS but I am still using your idea in my web designs. I have tried different resolutions too:Of course there will be a wrapper around both of them. You can control the location of the menu div which will be displayed within the header div with left margins and top positions. You can also set the div menu to float right if you like. Hope this helps.The accepted solution works great, but imo lacks an explanation as to why it works. The example below is boiled down to the basics and separates the parts of the CSS which are only for styling, and I\'ve also included a detailed explaination of how CSS positioning works. Note: if you only want the solution, scroll down to The Result. There are 2 separate, sibling, elements and the goal is to position the 2nd element (with an id ofinfoi) so it appears within the previous element (the one with a class ofnavi`). The HTML structure cannot be changed. To achieve the desired result we\'re going to move, or position, the 2nd element, which we\'ll call #infoi so it appears within the 1st element, which we\'ll call .navi. Specifically, we want #infoi to be positioned in the top-right corner of .navi.CSS has several properties for positioning elements. By default, all elements are position: static. This means the element will be positioned according to its order in the HTML structure, with few exceptions. The other position values are relative, absolute, and fixed. By setting an element\'s position to one of these 3 values it\'s now possible the use a combination of the following 4 properties to position the element:In other words, by setting position: absolute, we can add top: 100px to position the element 100px from the top of the page. Conversely, if we set bottom: 100px the element would be positioned 100px from the bottom of the page. Here\'s where many CSS newcomers get lost - position: absolute has a frame of reference. In the example above, the frame of reference is the body element. position: absolute with top: 100px means the element is positioned 100px from the top of the body element. The position frame of reference, or context, can be altered by setting the position of a parent element to any value other than position: static. That is, we can create a new position context by giving a parent element:For example, if a <div class="parent"> element is given position: relative, any child elements use the <div class="parent"> as their frame of reference. If a child element were given position: absolute and top: 100px, the element would be positioned 100px from the top of the <div class="parent"> element, because the <div class="parent"> is now the position context. We\'ll use position context to solve this issueAs stated above, our goal is to position the #infoi element so it appears within the .navi element. To do this, we\'ll wrap the .navi and #infoi elements in a new element <div class="wrapper"> so we can create a new position context. Then create a new position context by giving .wrapper a position: relative.With this new position context, we can position #infoi within .wrapper.  First, give #infoi a position: absolute, allowing us to position #infoi absolutely in .wrapper. Then add top: 0 and right: 0 to position the #infoi element in the top-right corner. Remember, because the #infoi element is using .wrapper as its position context, it will be in the top-right of the .wrapper element. Because .wrapper is merely a container for .navi, positioning #infoi in the top-right corner of .wrapper gives the effect of being positioned in the top-right corner of .navi.And there we have it, #infoi now appears to be in the top-right corner of .navi.The example below is boiled down to the basics, and contains some minimal styling.\n
