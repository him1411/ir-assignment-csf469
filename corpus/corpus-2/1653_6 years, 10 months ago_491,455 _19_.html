I want to add a row to a database table, but if a row exists with the same unique key I want to update the row.For example,Let\xe2\x80\x99s say the unique key is id, and in my database there is a row with id = 1. In that case I want to update that row with these values. Normally this gives an error. If I use insert IGNORE it will ignore the error, but it still won\xe2\x80\x99t update.Use INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATEQUERY:Check out REPLACEhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/replace.htmlTry this out:Hope this helps.Try this:   INSERT INTO table (id,name,age) VALUES(\'1\',\'Mohammad\',\'21\') ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE name=\'Mohammad\',age=\'21\' Note:\nHere if id is the primary key then after first insertion with id=\'1\' every time attempt to insert id=\'1\' will update name and age  and previous name age will change.When using batch insert use the following syntax:When using SQLite:Provided that id is the primary key. Or else it just inserts another row. See INSERT (SQLite).Just because I was here looking for this solution but for updating from another identically-structured table (in my case website test DB to live DB):As mentioned elsewhere, only the columns you want to update need to be included  after ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE.No need to list the columns in the INSERT or SELECT, though I agree it\'s probably better practice.Also do not forget to concern about the unique key constraint.
