I\'m looking for a function which return boolean value if user has mobile browser or not.I know that I can use navigator.userAgent and write that function by using regex, but user-agents are too various for different platforms. I doubt that match all possible devices would be easy, and I think this problem has been solved before many times so there should be some kind of complete solution for such task.I was looking at this site, but sadly the script is so cryptic that I have no idea how to use it for my purpose, which is to create a function which return true / false.Here\'s a function that uses an insanely long and comprehensive regex which returns a true or false value depending on whether or not the user is browsing with a mobile.For those wishing to include tablets in this test (though arguably, you shouldn\'t), you can use the following function:You can do this by simply running through a list of devices and checking if the useragent matches anything like so:However since you believe that this method is unreliable, You could assume that any device that had a resolution of 800x600 or less was a mobile device too, narrowing your target even more (although these days many mobile devices have much greater resolutions than this)i.e Reference: How about:...since smartphones usually support this property and desktop browsers don\'t.How to useTo check to see if the user is on a specific mobile device:Ref: http://www.abeautifulsite.net/blog/2011/11/detecting-mobile-devices-with-javascriptEnhanced version on github : https://github.com/smali-kazmi/detect-mobile-browserHere is a simple solution from the source of facebook\'s slingshotFeature detection is much better than trying to figure out which device you are on and very hard to keep up with new devices coming out all the time, a library like Modernizr lets you know if a particular feature is available or not.To add an extra layer of control I use the HTML5 storage to detect if it is using mobile storage or desktop storage. If the browser does not support storage I have an array of mobile browser names and I compare the user agent with the browsers in the array.It is pretty simple. Here is the function:How about something like this?Came here looking for a simple, clean way to detect "touch screens devices", which I class as mobile and tablets. Did not find a clean choice in the current answers but did work out the following which may also help someone.Here is a userAgent solution that is more efficent than match...There\'s no perfect solution for detecting whether JS code is executed on a mobile browser, but the following two options should work in most cases.This particular browser sniffing code is that of a library called isMobile.Test if window.orientation is defined :Here is my re-thought solution for the problem. Still not perfect. The only true solution would be if the device manufacturers start to take seriously the "Mobile" and "Tablet" user-agent strings.What happens when the Nexus 7 tablet only have the Android UA string? First, the Mobile become true, than later on the Tablet also become true, but Tablet will delete the Mobile UA string from the body tag.CSS:alert lines added for development. Chrome console can emulate many handheld devices. Test there.EDIT:Just don\'t use this, use feature detection instead. There are so many devices and brands out there that targeting a brand NEVER will be the right solution.I advise you check out http://wurfl.io/In a nutshell, if you import a tiny JS file:you will be left with a JSON object that looks like:(that\'s assuming you are using a Nexus 7, of course) and you will be able to do things like:This is what you are looking for.Disclaimer: I work for the company that offers this free service. Thanks.Once the element gains focus, you immediately blur it. Bootstrap-datepicker, which is a very popular and well-maintained component with almost 10,000 stars in GitHub, uses this approach:https://github.com/uxsolutions/bootstrap-datepickerThanks to Tigger for assistance.what about using "window.screen.width" ?orI guess this is the best way because there is a new mobile device every day !(although I think it\'s not that supported in old browsers, but give it a try :) ) The best must be :But like like Yoav Barnea says...After this 3 tests, i hope var isMobile is... okHere is he full function also you can follow this tutorial to detect a specific mobile. Click here.According to MDN\'s article on Browser detection using the user agent, it is encouraged to avoid this approach if possible and suggest other avenues such as feature detection.However, if one must use the user agent as a means to detect if the device is mobile, they suggest:In summary, we recommend looking for the string \xe2\x80\x9cMobi\xe2\x80\x9d anywhere in the\n  User Agent to detect a mobile device.Therefore, this one-liner will suffice:const isMobileDevice = window.navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase().includes("mobi");Here\'s an ECMAScript 6 solution (TypeScript ready)In any case, checking for type of device must be called just ONE TIME: your phone can\'t surprisingly stay a desktop in a moment :)So, code for checking by userAgent, suggested here sometime ago, have to be look like that:Note that Most newer-gen mobile devices now have resolutions greater than 600x400. ie, an iPhone 6....Proof of test: \nran the most upvoted and most recent posts here, with an optional check once run like so:Somehow, the following results were returned on the following Browser Apps. Specs: iPhone 6S, iOS 10.3.1.Safari (latest): Detected it as a mobile.Chrome (latest): Did not detect it as a mobile.SO, i then tested the suggestion from Lanti (https://stackoverflow.com/a/31864119/7183483), and it did return the proper results (mobile for all iOS devices, and desktop for my Mac). Therefore, i proceeded to edit it a little since it would fire twice (for both mobile and Tablet). I then noticed when testing on an iPad, that it also returned as a mobile, which makes sense, since the Parameters that Lanti uses check the OS more than anything. Therefore, i simply moved the tablet IF statement inside the mobile check, which would return mobile is the Tablet check was negative, and tablet otherwise. I then added the else clause for the mobile check to return as desktop/laptop, since both qualify, but then noticed that the browser detects CPU and OS brand. So i added what is returned in there as part of else if statement instead. To cap it, I added a cautionary else statement in case nothing was detected.\nSee bellow, will update with a test on a Windows 10 PC soon. Oh, and i also added a \'debugMode\' variable, to easily switch between debug and normal compiling.Dislaimer: Full credit to Lanti, also that this was not tested on Windows Tablets... which might return desktop/laptop, since the OS is pure Windows. Will check once I find a friend who uses one.This could also be a solution. If you use both methods, you will get a perfect way to detect different devices. If you\'re looking for a mobile phone, since they\'re portrait oriented in most cases, you can use this simple check:
