Android Studio 0.4.5Android documentation for creating custom dialog boxes: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/dialogs.htmlIf you want a custom dialog, you can instead display an Activity as a dialog instead of using the Dialog APIs. Simply create an activity and set its theme to Theme.Holo.Dialog in \nthe <activity> manifest element:However, when I tried this I get the following exception:I am supporting the following, and I can\'t using something greater than 10 for the min:In my styles I have the following:And in my manifest I have this for the activity:Creating the dialog box like this was something I was hopping to do, as I have already completed the layout.Can anyone tell me how I can get around this problem?The reason you are having this problem is because the activity you are trying to apply the dialog theme to is extending ActionBarActivity which requires the AppCompat theme to be applied. Update: Extending  AppCompatActivity would also  have this problem In this case, change the Java inheritance from ActionBarActivity to Activity and leave the dialog theme in the manifest as it is, a non Theme.AppCompat value The general rule is that if you want your code to support older versions of Android,  it should have the AppCompat theme and the java code should extend AppCompatActivity. If you have *an activity that doesn\'t need this support, such as you only care about the latest versions and features of Android, you can apply any theme to it but the java code must extend plain old Activity.NOTE: When change from AppCompatActivity (or a subclass, ActionBarActivity), to Activity, must also change the various calls with "support" to the corresponding call without "support".  So, instead of getSupportFragmentManager, call getFragmentManager.All you need to do is add android:theme="@style/Theme.AppCompat.Light" to your application tag in the AndroidManifest.xml file.Copying answer from @MarkKeen in the comments above as I had the same problem.I had the error stated at the top of the post and happened after I added an alert dialog. I have all the relevant style information in the manifest. My problem was cured by changing a context reference in the alert builder - I changed: to: And no more problems.min sdk is 10. ActionBar is available from api level 11. So for 10 you would be using AppCompat from the support library for which you need to use Theme.AppCompat or descendant of the same.UseMore info @http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/actionbar.htmlEidt:I might have misread op post.Seems op wants a Dialog with a Activity Theme. So as already suggest by Bobbake4 extend Activity instead of ActionBarActivity.Also have a look @ Dialog Attributes in the below linkhttp://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/4.4_r1/frameworks/base/core/res/res/values/themes.xml/This worked for me, I just changed:to this:This is what fixed it for me: instead of specifying the theme in manifest, I defined it in onCreate for each activity that extends ActionBarActivity:Here MyAppTheme is a descendant of Theme.AppCompat, and is defined in xml. Note that the theme must be set before super.onCreate and setContentView.go to your styles and put the parentinstead of I was experiencing this problem even though my Theme was an AppCompat Theme and my Activity was an AppCompatActivity (or Activity, as suggested on other\'s answers). So I cleaned, rebuild and rerun the project. (Build -> Clean Project ; Build -> Rebuild Project ; Run -> Run)It may seem dumb, but now it works great!Just hope it helps!If you need to extend ActionBarActivity you need on your style.xml:If you set as main theme of your application as android:Theme.Material.Light instead of AppTheme.Base then you\xe2\x80\x99ll get an \xe2\x80\x9cIllegalStateException:You need to use a Theme.AppCompat theme (or descendant) with this activity\xe2\x80\x9d error.I had such crash on Samsung devices even though the activity did use Theme.AppCompat.\nThe root cause was related to weird optimizations on Samsung side:My solution was just removing android:launchMode="singleTask"I had the same problem, but it solved when i put this on manifest: android:theme="@style/Theme.AppCompat.In my case i have no values-v21 file in my res directory. Then i created it and added in it following codes:Change the theme of the desired Activity. Its work for meYou have came to this because you want to apply Material Design in your theme style in previous sdk versions to 21. ActionBarActivity requires AppThemeso if you also want to prevent your own customization about your AppTheme, only you have to change in your styles.xml (previous to sdk 21) so this way, can inherit for an App Compat theme.for this:Change your theme style parent to This worked for me ...This one worked for me:You have many solutions to that error.You should use Activity or FragmentActivity instead of ActionbarActivity or AppCompatActivityIf you want use ActionbarActivity or AppCompatActivity, you should change in styles.xml Theme.Holo.xxxx to Theme.AppCompat.Light (if necessary add to DarkActionbar)If you don\'t need advanced attributes about action bar or AppCompat you don\'t need to use Actionbar or AppCompat.In Android manifest just change theme of activity to AppTheme as follow code snippetYour Activity is extending ActionBarActivity which requires the AppCompat.theme to be applied.\nChange from ActionBarActivity to Activity or FragmentActivity, it will solve the problem. If you use no Action bar then :for me was solution to use ContextThemeWrapper:from Android - How to create FAB programmatically?This is when you want a AlertDialog in a Fragment My Activity with SectionsPagerAdapter and ViewPager & FragmentThis solution worked for me. Design library depends on the Support v4 and AppCompat Support Libraries, so don\'t use different version for appcompat and design library in gradle.use instead ofNOTE: I had intended this as an answer, but further testing reveals it still fails when built using maven from the command line, so I\'ve had to edit it to be a problem! :-(In my case when I got this error I was already using a AppCompat Theme and the error didn\'t make much sense.I was in the process of mavenizing my android build. I had already dependencies on the apklib and jar versions of app compat, thus:Now, when I import the maven project and build and run from IntelliJ it\'s fine.But when I build and deploy and run from the command line with maven I still get this exception.In Android Studio:\nAdd support library to the gradle file and sync.\nEdit build.gradle(Module:app) to have dependencies as follows:My support Library version is 23.1.1; Use your support library version as applicable.For me none of the above answers worked even after I had Theme.AppCompat as my base theme for the application. I was using com.android.support:design:24.1.0 So I just changed the version to 24.1.1. After the gradle sync, Its working again and the exception went away. Seems to me the issue was with gradle build.Just putting this here in case other answers don\'t work for some people.For me issue resolved by changing the inheritance from AppCompatActivity to Activity in my customDialog class. No changes required in manifest for Theme.Dialog. For me, the Android SDK didn\'t seem to be able to find the styles definition. Everything was wired correctly and doing a simple project clean fixed it for me. just make that getApplicationContext().getTheme().applyStyle(R.style.Theme_Mc,\n  true);and In your values/styles.xml \nadd this For my Xamarin Android project (in MainActivity.cs), I changed\xe2\x80\xa6to\xe2\x80\xa6and the error went away. I realise that isn\'t a solution for everyone but it might give a clue to the underlying problem.
