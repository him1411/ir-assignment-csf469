How would I count the total number of lines present in all the files in a git repository?git ls-files gives me a list of files tracked by git.I\'m looking for a command to cat all those files. Something likexargs will do what you want:But with more information and probably better, you can do:This shows the differences from the empty tree to your current working tree.  Which happens to count all lines in your current working tree.If you want this count because you want to get an idea of the project\xe2\x80\x99s scope, you may prefer the output of CLOC (\xe2\x80\x9cCount Lines of Code\xe2\x80\x9d), which gives you a breakdown of significant and insignificant lines of code by language.(This line is equivalent to git ls-files | xargs cloc. It uses sh\xe2\x80\x99s $() command substitution feature.)Sample output:You will have to install CLOC first. You can probably install cloc with your package manager \xe2\x80\x93 for example, brew install cloc with Homebrew.cloc $(git ls-files) is often an improvement over cloc .. For example, the above sample output with git ls-files reports 471 lines of code. For the same project, cloc . reports a whopping 456,279 lines (and takes six minutes to run), because it searches the dependencies in the Git-ignored node_modules folder.I\'ve encountered batching problems with git ls-files | xargs wc -l when dealing with large numbers of files, where the line counts will get chunked out into multiple total lines.Taking a tip from question Why does the wc utility generate multiple lines with "total"?, I\'ve found the following command to bypass the issue:wc -l $(git ls-files)Or if you want to only examine some files, e.g. code:wc -l $(git ls-files | grep \'.*\\.cs\')The best solution, to me anyway, is buried in the comments of @ephemient\'s answer. I am just pulling it up here so that it doesn\'t go unnoticed. The credit for this should go to @FRoZeN (and @ephemient).returns the total of files and lines in the working directory of a repo, without any additional noise. As a bonus, only the source code is counted - binary files are excluded from the tally. The command above works on Linux and OS X. The cross-platform version of it isThat works on Windows, too.For the record, the options for excluding blank lines,don\'t have any effect when used with --shortstat. Blank lines are counted.I was playing around with cmder (http://gooseberrycreative.com/cmder/) and I wanted to count the lines of html,css,java and javascript. While some of the answers above worked, or pattern in grep didn\'t - I found here (https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/37313/how-do-i-grep-for-multiple-patterns) that I had to escape itSo this is what I use now:git ls-files | grep "\\(.html\\|.css\\|.js\\|.java\\)$" | xargs wc -lThis tool on github https://github.com/flosse/sloc can give the output in more descriptive way. It will Create stats of your source code:I use the following:This searches all files versioned by git for the regex ^, which represents the beginning of a line, so this command gives the total number of lines!I did this:this works if you count all text files in the repository as the files of interest. If some are considered documentation, etc, an exclusion filter can be added.This works as of cloc 1.68:cloc --vcs=gitOr:
