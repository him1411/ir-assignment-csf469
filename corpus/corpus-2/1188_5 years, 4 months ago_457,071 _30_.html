In my activity, I\'m calling a second activity from the main activity by startActivityForResult. In my second activity there are some methods that finish this activity (maybe without result), however, just one of them return a result.For example, from the main activity I call a second one. In this activity I\'m checking some features of handset such as does it have a camera. If it doesn\'t have then I\'ll close this activity. Also, during preparation of MediaRecorder or MediaPlayer if a problem happens then I\'ll close this activity.If its device has a camera and recording is done completely, then after recording a video if a user clicks on the done button then I\'ll send the result (address of the recorded video) back to main activity.How do I check the result from the main activity?From your FirstActivity call the SecondActivity using  startActivityForResult() methodFor example:In your SecondActivity set the data which you want to return back to FirstActivity. If you don\'t want to return back, don\'t set any.For example: In secondActivity if you want to send back data:If you don\'t want to return data:Now in your FirstActivity class write following code for the onActivityResult() method.How to check the result from the main activity?You need to override Activity.onActivityResult() then check its parameters: Complementing the answer from @Nishant,the best way to return the activity result is:I was having problem withThen I found out that the correct way is using to get the current intentExampleTo see the entire process in context, here is a supplemental answer. See my fuller answer for more explanation.MainActivity.javaSecondActivity.javaIf you want to update the user interface with activity result, you can\'t to use this.runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {}\nDoing this the UI won\'t refresh with new value. Instead, you can do this:This seems silly but works pretty well.For those who have problem with wrong requestCode in onActivityResultIf you are calling startActivityForResult() from your Fragment, the requestCode is changed by the Activity that owns the Fragment.If you want to get the correct resultCode in your activity try this:Change:startActivityForResult(intent, 1); To:getActivity().startActivityForResult(intent, 1);First you use startActivityForResult() with parameters in first Activity and if you want to send data from second Activity to first Activity then pass value using Intent with setResult() method and get that data inside onActivityResult() method in first Activity.
