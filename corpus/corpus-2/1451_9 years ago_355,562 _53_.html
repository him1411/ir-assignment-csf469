In Maven, dependencies are usually set up like this:Now, if you are working with libraries that have frequent releases, constantly updating the <version> tag can be somewhat annoying. Is there any way to tell Maven to always use the latest available version (from the repository)? NOTE: This answer applies to Maven 2 only! The mentioned LATEST and RELEASE metaversions have been dropped in Maven 3 "for the sake of reproducible builds", over 6 years ago.If you  always want to use the newest version, Maven has two keywords you can use as an alternative to version ranges. You should use these options with care as you are no longer in control of the plugins/dependencies you are using.When you depend on a plugin or a dependency, you can use the a version value of LATEST or RELEASE. LATEST refers to the latest released or snapshot version of a particular artifact, the most recently deployed artifact in a particular repository. RELEASE refers to the last non-snapshot release in the repository. In general, it is not a best practice to design software which depends on a non-specific version of an artifact. If you are developing software, you might want to use RELEASE or LATEST as a convenience so that you don\'t have to update version numbers when a new release of a third-party library is released. When you release software, you should always make sure that your project depends on specific versions to reduce the chances of your build or your project being affected by a software release not under your control. Use LATEST and RELEASE with caution, if at all.See the POM Syntax section of the Maven book for more details. Or see this doc on Dependency Version Ranges, where: Here\'s an example illustrating the various options. In the Maven repository, com.foo:my-foo has the following metadata:If a dependency on that artifact is required, you have the following options (other version ranges can be specified of course, just showing the relevant ones here):Declare an exact version (will always resolve to 1.0.1):Declare an explicit version (will always resolve to 1.0.1 unless a collision occurs, when Maven will select a matching version):Declare a version range for all 1.x (will currently resolve to 1.1.1):Declare an open-ended version range (will resolve to 2.0.0):Declare the version as LATEST (will resolve to 2.0.0) (removed from maven 3.x)Declare the version as RELEASE (will resolve to 1.1.1) (removed from maven 3.x):Note that by default your own deployments will update the "latest" entry in the Maven metadata, but to update the "release" entry, you need to activate the "release-profile" from the Maven super POM. You can do this with either "-Prelease-profile" or "-DperformRelease=true"It\'s worth emphasising that any approach that allows Maven to pick the dependency versions (LATEST, RELEASE, and version ranges) can leave you open to build time issues, as later versions can have different behaviour (for example the dependency plugin has previously switched a default value from true to false, with confusing results).It is therefore generally a good idea to define exact versions in releases. As Tim\'s answer points out, the maven-versions-plugin is a handy tool for updating dependency versions, particularly the versions:use-latest-versions and versions:use-latest-releases goals.Now I know this topic is old, but reading the question and the OP supplied answer it seems the Maven Versions Plugin might have actually been a better answer to his question:In particular the following goals could be of use:The following other goals are also provided:Just thought I\'d include it for any future reference.Please take a look at this page (section "Dependency Version Ranges"). What you might want to do is something like These version ranges are implemented in Maven2.Unlike others I think there are many reasons why you might always want the latest version. Particularly if you are doing continuous deployment (we sometimes have like 5 releases in a day) and don\'t want to do a multi-module project.What I do is make Hudson/Jenkins do the following for every build:That is I use the versions plugin and scm plugin to update the dependencies and then check it in to source control. Yes I let my CI do SCM checkins (which you have to do anyway for the maven release plugin).You\'ll want to setup the versions plugin to only update what you want:I use the release plugin to do the release which takes care of -SNAPSHOT and validates that there is a release version of -SNAPSHOT (which is important).If you do what I do you will get the latest version for all snapshot builds and the latest release version for release builds. Your builds will also be reproducible.UpdateI noticed some comments asking some specifics of this workflow. I will say we don\'t use this method anymore and the big reason why is the maven versions plugin is buggy and in general is inherently flawed.It is flawed because to run the versions plugin to adjust versions all the existing versions need to exist for the pom to run correctly. That is the versions plugin cannot update to the latest version of anything if it can\'t find the version referenced in the pom. This is actually rather annoying as we often cleanup old versions for disk space reasons.Really you need a separate tool from maven to adjust the versions (so you don\'t depend on the pom file to run correctly). I have written such a tool in the the lowly language that is Bash. The script will update the versions like the version plugin and check the pom back into source control. It also runs like 100x faster than the mvn versions plugin. Unfortunately it isn\'t written in a manner for public usage but if people are interested I could make it so and put it in a gist or github.Going back to workflow as some comments asked about that this is what we do:At this point I\'m of the opinion it is a good thing to have the release and auto version a separate tool from your general build anyway.Now you might think maven sort of sucks because of the problems listed above but this actually would be fairly difficult with a build tool that does not have a declarative easy to parse extendable syntax (aka XML).In fact we add custom XML attributes through namespaces to help hint bash/groovy scripts (e.g. don\'t update this version). The dependencies syntax is located at the Dependency Version Requirement Specification documentation. Here it is is for completeness:Dependencies\' version element define version requirements, used to compute effective dependency version. Version requirements have the following syntax:In your case, you could do something like <version>[1.2.3,)</version>Are you possibly depending on development versions that obviously change a lot during development? Instead of incrementing the version of development releases, you could just use a snapshot version that you overwrite when necessary, which means you wouldn\'t have to change the version tag on every minor change. Something like 1.0-SNAPSHOT...But maybe you are trying to achieve something else ;)Who ever is using LATEST, please make sure you have -U otherwise the latest snapshot won\'t be pulled.By the time this question was posed there were some kinks with version ranges in maven, but these have been resolved in newer versions of maven.\nThis article captures very well how version ranges work and best practices to better understand how maven understands versions: https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1212/core/MAVEN/maven_version.htm#MAVEN8855The truth is even in 3.x it still works, surprisingly the projects builds and deploys. But the  LATEST/RELEASE keyword causing problems in m2e and eclipse all over the place, ALSO projects depends on the dependency which deployed through the  LATEST/RELEASE fail to recognize the version. It will also causing problem if you are try to define the version as property, and reference it else where.So the conclusion is use the versions-maven-plugin if you can.Sometimes you don\'t want to use version ranges, because it seems that they are "slow" to resolve your dependencies, especially when there is continuous delivery in place and there are tons of versions - mainly during heavy development.One workaround would be to use the versions-maven-plugin. For example, you can declare a property:and add the versions-maven-plugin to your pom file:Then, in order to update the dependency, you have to execute the goals:If there is a version newer than 1.1.1, it will tell you:
