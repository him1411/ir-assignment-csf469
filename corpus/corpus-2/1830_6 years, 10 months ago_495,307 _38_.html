I have a javascript array dataArray which I want to push into a new array newArray.  Except I don\'t want newArray[0] to be dataArray. I want to push in all the values into the new array:or even better:So now the new array contains all the values of the individual data arrays.  Is there some shorthand like pushValues available so I don\'t have to iterate over each individual dataArray, adding the values 1 by 1?Use the concat function, like so:The value of newArray will be [1, 2, 3, 4] (arrayA and arrayB remain unchanged; concat creates and returns a new array for the result).Provided your arrays are not huge (see caveat below), you can use the push() method of the array to which you wish to append values. push() can take multiple parameters so you can use its apply() method to pass the array of values to be pushed as a list of function parameters. This has the advantage over using concat() of adding elements to the array in place rather than creating a new array.However, it seems that for large arrays (of the order of 100,000 members or more), this trick can fail. For such arrays, using a loop is a better approach. See https://stackoverflow.com/a/17368101/96100 for details.You might want to generalize this into a function:... or add it to Array\'s prototype:... or emulate the original push() method by allowing multiple parameters using the fact that concat(), like push(), allows multiple parameters:Here\'s a loop-based version of the last example, suitable for large arrays and all major browsers, including IE <= 8:I will add one more "future-proof" replyIn ECMAScript 6, you can use the spread operator:Spread operator is not yet included in all major browsers. For the current compatibility, see this (continuously updated) compatibility table. You can, however, use spread operator with Babel.js.Found an elegant way from MDNOr you can use the spread operator feature of ES6:Does that solve your problem ?The following seems simplest to me:As "push" takes a variable number of arguments, you can use the apply method of the push function to push all of the elements of another array. It constructs\na call to push using its first argument ("newArray" here) as "this" and the\nelements of the array as the remaining arguments.The slice in the first statement gets a copy of the first array, so you don\'t modify it.With JavaScript ES6, you can use the ... operator as a spread operator which will essentially convert the array into values. Then, you can do something like this:While the syntax is concise, I do not know how this works internally and what the performance implications are on large arrays.There are a number of answers talking about Array.prototype.push.apply. Here is a clear example:If you have ES6 syntax:The function below doesn\'t have an issue with the length of arrays and performs better than all suggested solutions:unfortunately, jspref refuses to accept my submissions, so here they are the results using benchmark.jswherefor loop and push is:Push Apply:spread operator:and finally the \'set length and for loop\' is the above functionwe have two array a and b. the code what did here is array a value is pushed into array b.\xd0\xa2his is a working code and it works fine:instead of push() function use concat function for IE. example,Most simple:
