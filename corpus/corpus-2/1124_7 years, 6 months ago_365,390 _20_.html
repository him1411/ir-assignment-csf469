Is there a way to have keyup, keypress, blur, and change events call the same function in one line or do I have to do them separately?The problem I have is that I need to validate some data with a db lookup and would like to make sure that there is no way that the validation is missed weather it is typed or pasted into the box.You can use .on() to bind a function to multiple events:Or just pass the function as the parameter to normal event functions:As of jQuery 1.7, the .on() method is the preferred method for attaching event handlers to a document. For earlier versions, the .bind() method is used for attaching an event handler directly to elements. I was looking for a way to get the event type when jQuery listens for several events at once, and Google put me here.So, for those interested, event.type is my answer :More info in the jQuery doc.You can use bind method to attach function to several events. Just pass the event names and the handler function as in this code:Another option is to use chaining support of jquery api.If you attach the same event handler to several events, you often run into the issue of more than one of them firing at once (e.g. user presses tab after editing; keydown, change, and blur might all fire).It sounds like what you actually want is something like this:You could define the function that you would like to reuse as below:And later you can set however many event listeners you want on your object to trigger that function using on(\'event\') leaving a space in between as shown below:This is how i do it.The answer by Tatu is how I would intuitively do it, but I have experienced some problems in Internet Explorer with this way of nesting/binding the events, even though it is done through the .on() method.I havn\'t been able to pinpoint exactly which versions of jQuery this is the problem with. But I sometimes see the problem in the following versions:My workaround have been to first define the function,and then handle the events individuallyThis is not the prettiest solution, but it works for me, and I thought I would put it out there to help others that might stumble upon this issue
