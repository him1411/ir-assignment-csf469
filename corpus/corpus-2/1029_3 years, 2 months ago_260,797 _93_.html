I was exploring RecyclerView and I was surprised to see that RecyclerView does not have onItemClickListener(). Because RecyclerView extends     android.view.ViewGroupand ListView extends android.widget.AbsListView.  However I solved my problem by writing onClick in my RecyclerView.Adapter:But still I want to know why Google removed onItemClickListener()? Is there a performance issue or something else?tl;dr 2016 Use RxJava and a PublishSubject to expose an Observable for the clicks.Original Post:Since the introduction of ListView, onItemClickListener has been problematic. The moment you have a click listener for any of the internal elements the callback would not be triggered but it wasn\'t notified or well documented (if at all) so there was a lot of confusion and SO questions about it.Given that RecyclerView takes it a step further and doesn\'t have a concept of a row/column, but rather an arbitrarily laid out amount of children, they have delegated the onClick to each one of them, or to programmer implementation.Think of Recyclerview not as a ListView 1:1 replacement but rather as a more flexible component for complex use cases. And as you say, your solution is what google expected of you. Now you have an adapter who can delegate onClick to an interface passed on the constructor, which is the correct pattern for both ListView and Recyclerview.and then on your adapterNow look into that last piece of code: onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) the signature already suggest different view types. For each one of them you\'ll require a different viewholder too, and subsequently each one of them can have a different set of clicks. Or you can just create a generic viewholder that takes any view and one onClickListener and applies accordingly. Or delegate up one level to the orchestrator so several fragments/activities have the same list with different click behaviour. Again, all flexibility is on your side.It is a really needed component and fairly close to what our internal implementations and improvements to ListView were until now. It\'s good that Google finally acknowledges it.I like this way and I\'m using itInside Put And create this class anywhere you want itI\'ve read before that there is a better way but I like this way is easy and not complicated.An alternative solution is the one proposed by Hugo Visser, an Android GDE. He made a licence-free class available for you to just drop in your code and use it.Usage:(it also support long item click)Implementation (comments added by me):also create a file values/ids.xml and put this in it:This class works by attaching a RecyclerView.OnChildAttachStateChangeListener to the RecyclerView. This listener is notified every time a child is attached or detached from the RecyclerView. The code use this to append a tap/long click listener to the view. That listener ask the RecyclerView for the RecyclerView.ViewHolder which contains the position.You could also adapt the code to give you back the holder itself if you need more.Keep in mind that it\'s COMPLETELY fine to handle it in your adapter by setting on each view of your list a click listener, like other answer proposed. It\'s just not the most efficient thing to do (you create a new listener every time you reuse a view) but it works and in most cases it\'s not an issue.About the Why RecyclerView does not have an onItemClickListener.The RecyclerView is a toolbox, in contrast of the old ListView it has less build in features and more flexibility. The onItemClickListener is not the only feature being removed from ListView. But it has lot of listeners and method to extend it to your liking, it\'s far more powerful in the right hands ;).In my opinion the most complex feature removed in RecyclerView is the Fast Scroll. Most of the other features can be easily re-implemented.Android Recyclerview With onItemClickListener,\n Why we cant try this is working like ListView only.Source : LinkAnd Set this to RecyclerView:Thanks to @marmor, I updated my answer. I think it\'s a good solution to handle the onClick() in the ViewHolder class constructor and pass it to the parent class via OnItemClickListener interface.MyAdapter.javaUsage of adapter in other classes:MyFragment.javaGuys use this code in Your main activity.   Very Efficient MethodHere is your Adapter class.After this you will get this override method in your activity.> How RecyclerView is different from Listview?One difference is that there is LayoutManager class with RecyclerView by which you can manage your RecyclerView like-Horizontal or Vertical scrolling by LinearLayoutManagerGridLayout by GridLayoutManagerStaggered GridLayout by StaggeredGridLayoutManagerLike for horizontal scrolling for RecyclerView-How to put it all together example...ViewHolder typesAs far as I understand MLProgrammer-CiM  answer, simply it\'s possible to just do this: After reading @MLProgrammer-CiM\'s answer, here is my code:I have done this way, its very simple:Just add 1 Line for Clicked RecyclerView position:Full code for ViewHolder class:Hope this will help you.I use this method to start an Intent from RecyclerView:Here is a way to implement it quite easily if you have a list of POJOs and want to retrieve one on click from outside the adapter.In your adapter, create a listener for the click events and a method to set it:}In your ViewHolder, implement onClickListener and create a class member to temporarily store the POJO the view is presenting, that way (this is an example, creating a setter would be better):Back in your adapter, set the current POJO when the ViewHolder is bound (or to null if the current view doesn\'t have one):That\'s it, now you can use it like this from your fragment/activity:Following up MLProgrammer-CiM\'s excellent RxJava solutionModify the original tl;dr as:PublishSubject#asObservable() was removed.  Just return the PublishSubject which is an Observable.See my approach on this:First declare an interface like this:Then create the adapter:And now let\'s see how to integrate this from a fragment:If you want to add onClick() to the child view of items, for example, a button in item, I found that you can do it easily in onCreateViewHolder() of your own RecyclerView.Adapter just like this:i don\'t know whether it\'s a good way, but it works well. If anyone has a better idea, very glad to tell me and correct my answer! :)This worked for me:Yes you canHere you can handle multiple onclick see below code and it is very efficient  Modified my comment...Check this one in which I have implemented all the things with a proper wayRecyclerViewHolder ClassAdapterThe interfaceInstead of implementing interface View.OnClickListener inside view holder or creating and interface and implementing interface in your activity..\nI used this code for simple on OnClickListener implementation.use PlaceHolderView I wrote a library to handle android recycler view item click event. You can find whole tutorial in https://github.com/ChathuraHettiarachchi/RecycleClickor to handle item long press you can useAccess the mainView of rowLayout(cell) for you RecyclerView and in your OnBindViewHolder write this code:it worked for me. Hope it will help. Most simplest way.Inside View HolderInside OnBindViewHolder()And let me know, do you have any question about this solution ?Easiest way to do this is as follows:Declare global variable at start of Adapter class:Then set the OnClickListener within the onBindViewHolder method:All other answers are lame.
