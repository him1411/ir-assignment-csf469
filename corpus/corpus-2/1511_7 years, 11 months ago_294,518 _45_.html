I have installed a python package with python setup.py install.How do I uninstall it?You need to remove all files manually, and also undo any other stuff that installation did manually.If you don\'t know the list of all files, you can reinstall it with the --record option, and take a look at the list this produces.To record list of installed files, you can use:Once you want to uninstall you can use xargs to do the removal:For me, the following mostly works:have pip installed, e.g.:Check, how is your installed package named from pip point of view:This shall list names of all packages, you have installed (and which were detected by pip).\nThe name can be sometime long, then use just the name of the package being shown at the and after #egg=. You can also in most cases ignore the version part (whatever follows == or -).Then uninstall the package:If it asks for confirmation about removing the package, then you are lucky guy and it will be removed.pip shall detect all packages, which were installed by pip. It shall also detect most of the packages installed via easy_install or setup.py, but this may in some rare cases fail.Here is real sample from my local test with package named ttr.rdstmc on MS Windows.All what is written above still applies, anyway, there are small modifications available now.Recent python versions come with a package ensurepip allowing to install pip even when being offline:$ python -m ensurepip --upgradeOn some systems (like Debian Jessie) this is not available (to prevent breaking system python installation).Examples above assume, you have grep installed. I had (at the time I had MS Windows on my machine) installed set of linux utilities (incl. grep). Alternatively, use native MS Windows find or simply ignore that filtering and find the name in a bit longer list of detected python packages.The #1 answer has problems:Instead, for unix-like:And for windows:There are also unsolvable problems with uninstalling setup.py install which won\'t bother you in a typical case. For a more complete answer, see this wiki page:https://ofswiki.org/wiki/Uninstalling_setup.py_installOr more simply you could just do;This works because the rm command takes a whitespace-seperated list of files to delete and your installation record is just such a list.  Also, using "less" for this type of command could get you in big trouble depending on the local configuration.The lazy way: simply uninstall from the Windows installation menu (if you\'re using Windows), or from the rpm command, provided you first re-install it after creating a distribution package.For example,("foo" being an example of course).Now python gives you the choice to install pip during the installation (I am on Windows, and at least python does so for Windows!). Considering you had chosen to install pip during installation of python (you don\'t actually have to choose because it is default), pip is already installed for you. Then, type in pip in command prompt, you should see a help come up. You can find necessary usage instructions there. E.g. pip list shows you the list of installed packages. You can useto uninstall any package that you don\'t want anymore.

And i was able to uninstall package which was troubling me :)I think you can open the setup.py, locate the package name, and then ask pip to uninstall it.Assuming the name is available in a \'METADATA\' variable:Extending on what Martin said, recording the install output and a little bash scripting does the trick quite nicely.  Here\'s what I do...And presto.  Uninstalled.It might be better to remove related files by using bash to read commands, like the following:
