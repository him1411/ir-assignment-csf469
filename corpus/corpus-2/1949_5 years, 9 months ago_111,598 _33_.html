When we add a database field in django we generally write models.CharField(max_length=100, null=True, blank=True). The same is done with ForeignKey, DecimalField etc. What is the basic difference in having in respect to different (CharField, ForeignKey, ManyToManyField, DateTimeField) fields. What are the advantages/disadvantages of using 1/2/3?null=True sets NULL (versus NOT NULL) on the column in your DB. Blank values for Django field types such as DateTimeField or ForeignKey will be stored as NULL in the DB.blank=True determines whether the field will be required in forms. This includes the admin and your own custom forms. If blank=True then the field will not be required, whereas if it\'s False the field cannot be blank.The combo of the two is so frequent because typically if you\'re going to allow a field to be blank in your form, you\'re going to also need your database to allow NULL values for that field. The exception is CharFields and TextFields, which in Django are never saved as NULL. Blank values are stored in the DB as an empty string (\'\').A few examples:Obviously those two options don\'t make logical sense to use (though, there might be a use case for null=True, blank=False if you want a field to always be required in forms, but optional when dealing with an object through something like the shell.)CHAR and TEXT types are never saved as NULL by Django, so null=True is unnecessary. However, you can manually set one of these fields to None to force set it as NULL. If you have a scenario where that might be necessary, you should still include null=True.This is how the ORM maps blank & null fields for Django 1.8The database fields created for PostgreSQL 9.4 are : The database fields created for MySQL 5.6 are : As said in Django Model Field reference: LinkThe following arguments are available to all field types. All are optional.If True, Django will store empty values as NULL in the database. Default is False.Avoid using null on string-based fields such as CharField and TextField because empty string values will always be stored as empty strings, not as NULL. If a string-based field has null=True, that means it has two possible values for "no data": NULL, and the empty string. In most cases, it\xe2\x80\x99s redundant to have two possible values for "no data"; the Django convention is to use the empty string, not NULL.For both string-based and non-string-based fields, you will also need to set blank=True if you wish to permit empty values in forms, as the null parameter only affects database storage (see blank).NoteWhen using the Oracle database backend, the value NULL will be stored to denote the empty string regardless of this attributeIf True, the field is allowed to be blank. Default is False.Note that this is different than null. null is purely database-related, whereas blank is validation-related. If a field has blank=True, form validation will allow entry of an empty value. If a field has blank=False, the field will be required.Simply null=True defines database should accept NULL values, on other hand blank=True defines on form validation this field should accept blank values or not(If blank=True it accept form without a value in that field and blank=False[default value] on form validation it will show This field is required error.null=True/False related to databaseblank=True/False related to form validationHere is an example of the field with blank= true and null= true\n    description = models.TextField(blank=True, null= True)In this case: \nblank = True: tells our form that it is ok to leave the description field blankandnull = True: tells our database that it is ok to record a null value in our db field and not give an error.When we save anything in Django admin two steps validation happens, on Django level and on Database level. We can\'t save text in a number field.Database has data type NULL, it\'s nothing. When Django creates columns in the database it specifies that they can\'t be empty. And if you will try to save NULL you will get the database error.Also on Django-Admin level, all fields are required by default, you can\'t save blank field, Django will throw you an error.So, if you want to save blank field you need to allow it on Django and Database level.\nblank=True - will allow empty field in admin panel\nnull=True - will allow saving NULL to the database column.
