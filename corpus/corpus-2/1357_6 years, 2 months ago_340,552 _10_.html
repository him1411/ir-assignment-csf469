How can I use grep to show just file-names (no in-line matches) on Linux?I am usually using something like:How can I just get the file-names (with paths) but without the matches? Do I have to use xargs? Didn\'t see a way to do this on my grep man page.The standard option grep -l (that is a lowercase L) could do this.From the unix standard:You also do not need -H in this case.From the grep(1) man page:For a simple file search you could use grep\'s -l and -r options:All the search is done by grep. Of course, if you need to select files on some other parameter, find is the correct solution:The execdir option builds each grep command per each directory, and concatenates filenames into only one command (+).
