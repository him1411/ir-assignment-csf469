How could I achieve the following:Using jQuery where regTitle is my div ID?The html() function can take strings of HTML, and will effectively modify the .innerHTML property.However, the text() function will change the (text) value of the specified element, but keep the html structure.If you instead have a jquery object you want to render instead of the existing content. Then just reset the content and append the new.Or:Here is your answer:jQuery\'s .html() can be used for setting and getting the contents of matched non empty elements (innerHTML).Answer:Explanation:$ is equivalent to jQuery. Both represent the same object in the jQuery library. The "#regTitle" inside the parenthesis is called the selector which is used by the jQuery library to identify which element(s) of the html DOM (Document Object Model) you want to apply code to. The # before regTitle is telling jQuery that regTitle is the id of an element inside the DOM.From there, the dot notation is used to call the html function which replaces the inner html with whatever parameter you place in-between the parenthesis, which in this case is \'Hello World\'.There are already answers which give how to change Inner HTML of element.But I would suggest, you should use some animation like Fade Out/ Fade In to change HTML which gives good effect of changed HTML rather instantly changing inner HTML.If you have many functions which need this, then you can call common function which changes inner Html.you can use either html or text function in jquery to achieve itOR
