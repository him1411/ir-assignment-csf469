I have a PHP array as follows:I want to delete the element containing the value $del_val (for example, $del_val=401), but I don\'t know its key. This might help: each value can only be there once.I\'m looking for the simplest function to perform this task please.Using array_search() and unset, try the following:array_search() returns the key of the element it finds, which can be used to remove that element from the original array using unset(). It will return FALSE on failure, however it can return a false-y value on success (your key may be 0 for example), which is why the strict comparison !== operator is used.The if() statement will check whether array_search() returned a value, and will only perform an action if it did.Well, deleting an element from array is basically just set difference with one element.It generalizes nicely, you can remove as many elements as you like at the same time, if you want.Disclaimer: Note that my solution produces a new copy of the array while keeping the old one intact in contrast to the accepted answer which mutates. It might be a bit slower because of this.One interesting way is by using array_keys():The array_keys() function takes two additional parameters to return only keys for a particular value and whether strict checking is required (i.e. using === for comparison).This can also remove multiple array items with the same value (e.g. [1, 2, 3, 3, 4]).If you know for definite that your array will contain only one element with that value, you can doIf, however, your value might occur more than once in your array, you could do thisNote: The second option only works for PHP5.3+ with ClosuresHave a look at following code:You can do:And that will get you this array:The Best way is array_spliceReason for Best is here at http://www.programmerinterview.com/index.php/php-questions/how-to-delete-an-element-from-an-array-in-php/By the following code, the repetitive values will be removed from the $messages.$messages = array_diff($messages, array(401));Or simply, manual way:This is the safest of them because you have full control on your arrayOutputArray ( [0] => 312 [1] => 1599 [2] => 3 )To delete multiple values try this oneyou can do:Explanation: Delete the element that has the key 401 after flipping the array.If you have > php5.3, there is the one line code :Borrowed the logic of underscoreJS _.reject and created two functions (people prefer functions!!)array_reject_value: This function is simply rejecting the value specified (also works for PHP4,5,7)array_reject: This function is simply rejecting the callable method (works for PHP >=5.3)So in our current example we can use the above functions as follows:or even better: (as this give us a better syntax to use like the array_filter one)The above can be used for more complicated stuff like let\'s say we would like to remove all the values that are greater or equal to 401 we could simply do this:Get the key with array_search().@Bojangles answer did help me. Thank you.In my case, the array could be associative or not, so I added this functionRegardsIf your values you want to delete are, or can, be in an array. Use the array_diff function. Seems to work great for things like this.array_diffOK.. I know this is not efficient at all but is simple, intuitive and easy to read.\nSo if someone is looking for a not so fancy solution which can be extended to work with more values, or more specific conditions .. here is a simple code:If you don\'t know its key it means it doesn\'t matter.You could place the value as the key, it means it will instant find the value. Better than using searching in all elements over and over again.As per your requirement "each value can only be there once" if you are just interested in keeping unique values in your array, then the array_unique() might be what you are looking for.Input:Result:Or a one-liner using the or operator:The accepted answer, converts the array to associative array, so, if you would like to keep it as non associative array with the accepted answer, you may have to use array_values too.The reference is here Another idea to delete a value of an array, use array_diff. If I want to (Doc : http://php.net/manual/fr/function.array-diff.php)you can refer this URL : \n    for function Then output should be,
