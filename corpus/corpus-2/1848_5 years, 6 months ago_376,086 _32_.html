I can run this query to get the sizes of all tables in a mysql database:I would like some help in understanding the results. I am looking for tables with the largest sizes. Which column should I look at?You can use this query to show the size of a table (although you need to substitute the variables first):or this query to list the size of every table in every database, largest first:You can get schema name from "information_schema" -> SCHEMATA table -> "SCHEMA_NAME" columnAdditional\nYou can get size of the mysql databases as following.ResultYou can get additional details in here.This can also sort the sizes (DB Size in MB).There is an easy way to get many informations using Workbench:Right-click the schema name and click "Schema inspector".In the resulting window you have a number of tabs. The first tab\n"Info" shows a rough estimate of the database size in MB.The second tab, "Tables", shows Data length and other details for each table.If you are using phpmyadmin then just go to the table structuree.g.Try the following shell command (replace DB_NAME with your database name):mysql -uroot <<<"SELECT table_name AS \'Tables\', round(((data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024), 2) \'Size in MB\' FROM information_schema.TABLES WHERE table_schema = \\"DB_NAME\\" ORDER BY (data_length + index_length) DESC;" | headFor Drupal/drush solution, check the following example script which will display the biggest tables in use:If you want a query to use currently selected database. simply copy paste this query. (No modification required)Heres another way of working this out from using the bash command line. \nfor i in mysql -NB -e \'show databases\'; do echo $i; mysql -e "SELECT table_name AS \'Tables\', round(((data_length+index_length)/1024/1024),2) \'Size in MB\' FROM information_schema.TABLES WHERE table_schema =\\"$i\\" ORDER BY (data_length + index_length) DESC" ; done\nAdapted from ChapMic\'s answer to suite my particular need.Only specify your database name, then sort all the tables in descending order - from LARGEST to SMALLEST table inside selected database. Needs only 1 variable to be replaced = your database name.If you have ssh access, you might want to simply try du -hc /var/lib/mysql (or different datadir, as set in your my.cnf) as well.Another way of showing the number of rows and space occupied and ordering by it.  The only string you have to substitute in this query is "yourDatabaseName".Suppose your database name is "news_alert". Then this query will show the size of all tables in the database.Size of all tables:Output:For specific table:Output:
