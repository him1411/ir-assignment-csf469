How do I add local jar files (not yet part of the Maven repository) directly in my project\'s library sources?Install the JAR into your local Maven repository as follows:ReferenceYou can add local dependencies directly (as mentioned in build maven project with propriatery libraries included) like this:Firstly I would like to give credit for this answer to anonymous stackoverflow user - I am pretty sure I\'ve seen similar answer here before - but now I cannot find it. The best option for having local jar files as a dependency is to create local maven repository. Such repo is nothing else than proper directory structure with pom files in it. On my example:\nI have master project on ${master_project} location and subroject1 is on ${master_project}/${subproject1}then I am creating mvn repository in:\n${master_project}/local-maven-repoIn pom file in subproject1 located ${master_project}/${subproject1}/pom.xml repository needs to be specified which would take file path as an url parameter:Dependency can be specified as for any other repository. This makes your pom repository independent. For instance once desired jar is available in maven central you just need to delete it from your local repo and it will be pulled from default repo. The last but not least thing to do is to add jar file to local repository using -DlocalRepositoryPath switch like here:Onece jar file is installed such mvn repo can be committed to code repository and whole set up is system independent. (working example in github)I agree that having JARs committed to source code repo is not a good practice but in real life quick and dirty solution sometimes is better than full blown nexus repo to host one jar that you cannot publish. Create a new folder, let\'s say local-maven-repo at the root of your Maven project.Just add a local repo inside your <project> of your pom.xml:Then for each external jar you want to install, go at the root of your project and execute:Yes , you can have but its not good idea.Instead install all these jars to maven reposAlso SeeI\'d like such solution - use maven-install-plugin in pom file:In this case you can perform mvn initialize and jar will be installed in local maven repo. Now this jar is available during any maven step on this machine (do not forget to include this dependency as any other maven dependency in pom with <dependency></dependency> tag). It is also possible to bind jar install not to initialize step, but any other step you like.One way is to upload it to your own Maven repository manager (such as Nexus). It\'s good practice to have an own repository manager anyway.Another nice way I\'ve recently seen is to include the Maven Install Plugin in your build lifecycle: You declare in the POM to install the files to the local repository. It\'s a little but small overhead and no manual step involved.http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-install-plugin/install-file-mojo.htmlOf course you can add jars to that folder. But maybe it does not what you want to achieve...If you need these jars for compilation, check this related question: Can I add jars to maven 2 build classpath without installing them?Also, before anyone suggests it, do NOT use the system scope.The preferred way would be to create your own remote repository.See here for details on how to do it.\nHave a look at the \'Uploading to a Remote Repository\' section.Also take a look at...Maven Dependencies.  This is the default but I\'ve found in some cases explicitly setting that scope also Maven to find local libraries in the local repository.I want to share a code where you can upload a folder full of jars. It\'s useful when a provider doesn\'t have a public repository and you need to add lots of libraries  manually. I\'ve decided to build a .bat instead of call directly to maven because It could be Out of Memory errors. It was prepared for a windows environment but is easy to adapt it to linux OS:After run this main from any IDE, run the update_repo_maven.bat.Add your own local JAR in POM file and use that in maven build.For example:Then add it to the POM like this:Another interesting case is when you want to have in your project private maven jars. You may want to keep the capabilities of Maven to resolve transitive dependencies. The solution is fairly easy.Add the following lines in your pom.xml fileOpen the .m2/repository folder and copy the directory structure of the project you want to import into the libs folder. E.g. suppose you want to import the dependencyJust go on .m2/repository and you will see the following foldercom/mycompany/myproject/1.2.3Copy everything in your libs folder (again, including the folders under .m2/repository) and you are done.Note that it is NOT necessarily a good idea to use a local repo.\nIf this project is shared with others then everyone else will have problems and questions when it doesn\'t work, and the jar won\'t be available even in your source control system!Although the shared repo is the best answer, if you cannot do this for some reason then embedding the jar is better than a local repo. Local-only repo contents can cause lots of problems, especially over time.THIS ANSWER IS ONLY FOR ECLIPSE USERS:If you are using Eclipse, place the jar in lib/, right click on the jar name and click "add to build path". \nEclipse will create a "referenced libraries" and place the jar for youIt resolved the import of the jar right away in the program for me This is a short syntax for newer versions:It works when the JAR was built by Apache Maven - the most common case. Then it\'ll contain a pom.xml in a subfolder of the META-INF directory, which will be read by default.Source: http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-3rd-party-jars-local.htmlOn your local repository you can install your jar by issuing the commandsFollow this useful  link to do the same from mkyoung\'s website. You can also check maven guide for the sameTo install third party jar, Please call the command like belowUsing maven-install-plugin in the parent pom or a synthetic parent pom works for me. Say we put the jar file in lib directory of parent module, we just need then to create a property as lib-path :Then follows as @sphinks describes it above using maven-install-plugin. There will be no manual step and the artifact can be added as any other dependencies to the sub module.NB. You can use also some plugins to fix the lib folder. Some suggest using Maven Directory PluginFor some reason, in the web application I\'m giving maintenance to, neither Alireza Fattahi\'s solution nor JJ Roman\'s solution worked correctly. In both cases, the compilation goes okay (it sees the jar), but the packaging fails to include the jar inside the war.The only way I managed to make it work was by putting the jar on /src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/lib/ and then combining it with either Fattahis\'s or Roman\'s solution.
