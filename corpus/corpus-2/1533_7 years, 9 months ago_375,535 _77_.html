Running git on a Windows XP machine, using bash. I exported my project from SVN, and then cloned a bare repository.I then pasted the export into the bare repositories directory, and did a:I then got a list of messages saying:LF will be replaced by CRLFWhat are the ramifications of this conversion? This is a .NET solution in Visual Studio.Git has three modes of how it treats line endings:You can set the mode to use by adding an additional parameter of true or false to the above command line.If core.autocrlf is set to true, that means that any time you add a file to the git repo that git thinks is a text file, it will turn all CRLF line endings to just LF before it stores it in the commit.  Whenever you git checkout something, all text files automatically will have their LF line endings converted to CRLF endings.  This allows development of a project across platforms that use different line-ending styles without commits being very noisy because each editor changes the line ending style as the line ending style is always consistently LF.The side-effect of this convenient conversion, and this is what the warning you\'re seeing is about, is that if a text file you authored originally had LF endings instead of CRLF, it will be stored with LF as usual, but when checked out later it will have CRLF endings.  For normal text files this is usually just fine.  The warning is a "for your information" in this case, but in case git incorrectly assesses a binary file to be a text file, it is an important warning because git would then be corrupting your binary file.  If core.autocrlf is set to false, no line-ending conversion is ever performed, so text files are checked in as-is.  This usually works ok, as long as all your developers are either on Linux or all on Windows.  But in my experience I still tend to get text files with mixed line endings that end up causing problems.My personal preference is to leave the setting turned ON, as a Windows developer.See http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-config.html for updated info that includes the "input" value.These messages are due to incorrect default value of core.autocrlf on Windows.The concept of autocrlf is to handle line endings conversions transparently. And it does!  Bad news: value needs to be configured manually.\nGood news: it should only be done ONE time per git installation (per project setting is also possible).How autocrlf works:Reminder: crlf = win-style end-of-line marker, lf = unix-style.Note that cr (mac-style) in not affected for any of three options above.When does this warning show up (under Windows)    \xe2\x80\x93  autocrlf = true if you have unix-style lf in one of your files (= RARELY),\n      \xe2\x80\x93  autocrlf = input if you have win-style crlf in one of your files (= almost ALWAYS),\n      \xe2\x80\x93  autocrlf = false \xe2\x80\x93 NEVER!What does this warning meanThe warning "LF will be replaced by CRLF" says that you (having autocrlf=true) will lose your unix-style LF after commit-checkout cycle (it will be replaced by windows-style CRLF). Git doesn\'t expect you to use unix-style LF under windows.The warning "CRLF will be replaced by LF" says that you (having autocrlf=input) will lose your windows-style CRLF after a commit-checkout cycle (it will be replaced by unix-style LF). Don\'t use input under windows.Yet another way to show how autocrlf workswhere x is either CRLF (windows-style) or LF (unix-style) and arrows stand for How to fixDefault value for core.autocrlf is selected during git installation and stored in system-wide gitconfig (%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\git\\etc\\gitconfig).  Also there\'re (cascading in the following order):      \xe2\x80\x93 "global" (per-user) gitconfig located at ~/.gitconfig, yet another\n    \xe2\x80\x93 "global" (per-user) gitconfig at $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config or $HOME/.config/git/config and\n    \xe2\x80\x93 "local" (per-repo) gitconfig at .git/config in the working dir.So, write git config core.autocrlf in the working dir to check the currently used value and     \xe2\x80\x93 add autocrlf=false to system-wide gitconfig                # per-system solution\n    \xe2\x80\x93 git config --global core.autocrlf false           # per-user solution\n    \xe2\x80\x93 git config --local core.autocrlf false             # per-project solution  Moral (for Windows):\n      -  use core.autocrlf = true if you plan to use this project under Unix as well (and unwilling to configure your editor/IDE to use unix line endings),\n      -  use core.autocrlf = false if you plan to use this project under Windows only (or you have configured your editor/IDE to use unix line endings),\n      -  never use core.autocrlf = input unless you have a good reason to (eg if you\'re using unix utilities under windows or if you run into makefiles issues),PS What to choose when installing git for Windows?\nIf you\'re not going to use any of your projects under Unix, don\'t agree with the default first option. Choose the third one (Checkout as-is, commit as-is). You won\'t see this message. Ever.PPS My personal preference is configuring the editor/IDE to use Unix-style endings, and setting core.autocrlf to false.PPPS Warning: git config settings can be overridden by gitattributes settings.If you already have checked out the code, the files are already indexed. After changing your git settings you should refresh the indexes withand re-write git index withhttps://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/#refreshing-a-repository-after-changing-line-endingsBoth unix2dos and dos2unix is available in windows with gitbash. You can use the following command to perform UNIX(LF) -> DOS(CRLF) conversion. Hence, you will not get the warning.orBut, don\'t run this command on any existing CRLF file, then you will get empty newlines every second line.dos2unix -D filename will not work with every operating system. Please check this link for compatibility.If for some reason you need to force the command then use --force. If it says invalid then use -f.I think @Basiloungas\'s answer is close but out of date (at least on Mac).Open the ~/.gitconfig file and set safecrlf to falseThat *will make it ignore the end of line char apparently (worked for me, anyway).In vim open the file (e.g.: :e YOURFILEENTER), thenI had this problem too.SVN doesn\'t do any line ending conversion, so files are committed with CRLF line endings intact. If you then use git-svn to put the project into git then the CRLF endings persist across into the git repository, which is not the state git expects to find itself in - the default being to only have unix/linux (LF) line endings checked in.When you then check out the files on windows, the autocrlf conversion leaves the files intact (as they already have the correct endings for the current platform), however the process that decides whether there is a difference with the checked in files performs the reverse conversion before comparing, resulting in comparing what it thinks is an LF in the checked out file with an unexpected CRLF in the repository.As far as I can see your choices are:Footnote: if you choose option #2 then my experience is that some of the ancillary tools (rebase, patch etc) do not cope with CRLF files and you will end up sooner or later with files with a mix of CRLF and LF (inconsistent line endings). I know of no way of getting the best of both.Removing the below from the ~/.gitattributes file* text=autowill prevent git from checking line-endings in the first-place.A GitHub\'s article on line endings is commonly mentioned when talking about this topic.My personal experience with using the often recommended core.autocrlf config setting was very mixed.I\'m using Windows with Cygwin, dealing with both Windows and UNIX projects at different times. Even my Windows projects sometimes use bash shell scripts, which require UNIX (LF) line endings.  Using GitHub\'s recommended core.autocrlf setting for Windows, if I check out a UNIX project (which does work perfectly on Cygwin - or maybe I\'m contributing to a project that I use on my Linux server), the text files are checked out with Windows (CRLF) line endings, creating problems.Basically, for a mixed environment like I have, setting the global core.autocrlf to any of the options will not work well in some cases. This option might be set on a local (repository) git config, but even that wouldn\'t be good enough for a project that contains both Windows- and UNIX-related stuff (e.g. I have a Windows project with some bash utility scripts).The best choice I\'ve found is to create per-repository .gitattributes files. The GitHub article mentions it.\nExample from that article:In one of my project\'s repository:It\'s a bit more things to set up, but do it once per project, and any contributor on any OS should have no troubles with line endings when working with this project.I don\'t know much about git on Windows, but...Appears to me that git is converting the return format to match that of the running platform (Windows).  CRLF is the default return format in Windows, while LF is the default return format for most other OSes.Chances are, the return format will be adjusted properly when the code is moved to another system.  I also reckon git is smart enough to keep binary files intact rather than trying to convert LFs to CRLFs in, say, JPEGs.In summary, you probably don\'t need to fret too much over this conversion.  However, if you go to archive your project as a tarball, fellow coders would probably appreciate having LF line terminators rather than CRLF.  Depending on how much you care (and depending on you not using Notepad), you might want to set git to use LF returns if you can :)Appendix:  CR is ASCII code 13, LF is ASCII code 10.  Thus, CRLF is two bytes, while LF is one.http://www.rtuin.nl/2013/02/how-to-make-git-ignore-different-line-endings/echo "* -crlf" > .gitattributes Do this on a separate commit or git might still see whole files as modified when you make a single change (depending on if you have changed autocrlf option)This one really works. Git will respect the line endings in mixed line ending projects and not warning you about them.It should read:warning: (If you check it out/or clone to another folder with your current core.autocrlf being true,)LF will be replaced by CRLFThe file will have its original line endings in your (current) working directory.This picture should explain what it means.\nOP\'s question is windows related and I could not use others without going to the directory or even running file in Notepad++ as administrator did not work..\nSo had to go this route:In a GNU/Linux shell prompt, dos2unix & unix2dos commands allow you to easely convert/format your files coming from MS Windows
