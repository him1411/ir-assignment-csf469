I am having a lot of trouble finding good information on how to call a standard SOAP/WSDL web service with Android. All I\'ve been able to find are either very convoluted documents and references to "kSoap2" and then some bit about parsing it all manually with SAX. OK, that\'s fine, but it\'s 2008, so I figured there should be some good library for calling standard web services.The web service is just basically one created in NetBeans. I would like to have IDE support for generating the plumbing classes. I just need the easiest/most-elegant way to contact a WSDL based web service from an Android-based phone.Android does not provide any sort of SOAP library. You can either write your own, or use something like kSOAP 2. As you note, others have been able to compile and use kSOAP2 in their own projects, but I haven\'t had to.Google has shown, to date, little interest in adding a SOAP library to Android. My suspicion for this is that they\'d rather support the current trends in Web Services toward REST-based services, and using JSON as a data encapsulation format. Or, using XMPP for messaging. But that is just conjecture.XML-based web services are a slightly non-trivial task on Android at this time. Not knowing NetBeans, I can\'t speak to the tools available there, but I agree that a better library should be available. It is possible that the XmlPullParser will save you from using SAX, but I don\'t know much about that.org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultHttpClient comes in the Android SDK by default. That\'ll get you connected to the WSDL.It\'s true that due to it\'s overhead SOAP is not the best choice for data exchange with mobile devices. However, you might find yourself in situation in which you do not control the format of server output.So, if you have to stick with SOAP, there is a kSOAP2 library patched for Android here:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/ksoap2-android/To call a web service from a mobile device (especially on an Android phone), I have used a very simple way to do it. I have not used any web service client API in attempt to call the web service. My approach is as follows to make a call.I have implemented this procedure for the Android phone, and it is successfully running. I am able to parse the response even if it is more than 700Â KB.SOAP is an ill-suited technology for use on Android (or mobile devices in general) because of the processing/parsing overhead that\'s required.  A REST services is a lighter weight solution and that\'s what I would suggest.  Android comes with a SAX parser, and it\'s fairly trivial to use.  If you are absolutely required to handle/parse SOAP on a mobile device then I feel sorry for you, the best advice I can offer is just not to use SOAP.DON\'T FORGET TO ADD ksoap2.jar in your project and also add the\n  INTERNET permission in AndroidManifest fileAbout a year ago I was reading this thread trying to figure out how to do SOAP calls on Android - the suggestions to build my own using HttpClient resulted in me building my own SOAP library for Android:IceSoapBasically it allows you to build up envelopes to send via a simple Java API, then automatically parses them into objects that you define via XPath... for example:Becomes:I was using it for my own project but I figured it might help some other people so I\'ve spent some time separating it out and documenting it. I\'d really love it if some of your poor souls who stumble on this thread while googling "SOAP Android" could give it a go and get some benefit.I had my tryst with KSOAP; I chose a rather simpler approach.Given a WSDL file, create SOAP Request templates for each Request(for e.g.: using SOAP UI) and then substitute the values to be passed in code. POST this data to the service end point using DefaultHttpClient instance and get the response stream. Parse the Response Stream using an XML Pull parser.You can have a look at WSClient++I\'ve created a new SOAP client for the Android platform. It is using a JAX-WS generated interface, but it is only a proof-of-concept so far.If you are interested, please try the example and/or watch the source at AndroidSOAP.If you can, go for JSON. Android comes with the complete org.json packageCall ksoap2 methods. It works very fine.Set up the details, likeand then to get the result doI hope Calling a web service from Android helps. I am sure you could make a little SOAP client with Axis. Axis installation instructions.Few months ago I was working with jax-ws web service in j2ee application, There we were using CXF wsdl2java to generate WS client stub from the WSDL file and with those client stubs we consumed the web services. Few weeks ago, when I was trying to consume the web service in the same way in android platform I couldn\'t, because the android jar has not all the "jax-ws" supporting classes in it. That time I didn\'t find any such tool ( if I wasn\'t failed to google efficiently) to meet my requirement -- So, I developed my own Android SOAP Client Generation Tool. Where you have to follow these steps :eg:I think Call SOAP Web Service from Android application  will help you a lot.Follow these steps by the method SOAPFrom the WSDL file, create SOAP Request templates for each Request.Then substitute the values to be passed in code.POST this data to the service end point using DefaultHttpClient instance.Get the response stream and finally Parse the Response Stream using an XML Pull parser.If you can use JSON, there is a whitepaper, a video and the sample.code in Developing Application Services with PHP Servers and Android Phone Clients.For me the easiest way is to use good tool to generate all required classes. Personally I use this site:http://easywsdl.com/It supports quite complex web services and uses ksoap2.I would suggest checking out a very useful tool that helped me a lot.
