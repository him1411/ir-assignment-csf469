The above shows the following error:So I have to do this:But is there not a simpler way to do this?To remove an element\'s first occurrence in a list, simply use list.remove:Mind that it does not remove all occurrences of your element. Use a list comprehension for that.Usually Python will throw an Exception if you tell it to do something it can\'t so you\'ll have to do either:or:An Exception isn\'t necessarily a bad thing as long as it\'s one you\'re expecting and handle properly.You can dobut above need to search 6 in list a 2 times, so try except would be fasterConsider:To take out all occurrences, you could use the filter function in python.\nFor example, it would look like:So, it would keep all elements of a != 2.To just take out one of the items use Here\'s how to do it inplace (without list comprehension):Finding a value in a list and then deleting that index (if it exists) is easier done by just using list\'s remove method:If you do this often, you can wrap it up in a function:If you know what value to delete, here\'s a simple way (as simple as I can think of, anyway):You\'ll get\n[0, 0, 2, 3, 4]Another possibility is to use a set instead of a list, if a set is applicable in your application.IE if your data is not ordered, and does not have duplicates, thenis error-free.Often a list is just a handy container for items that are actually unordered.  There are questions asking how to remove all occurences of an element from a list.  If you don\'t want dupes in the first place, once again a set is handy.doesn\'t change my_set from above.This example is fast and will delete all instances of a value from the list:If your elements are distinct, then a simple set difference will do.We can also use .pop:With a for loop and a condition:And if you want to remove some, but not all:Overwrite the list by indexing everything except the elements you wish to removeSay for example, we want to remove all 1\'s from x. This is how I would go about it:Now, this is a practical use of my method:And this is my method in a single line:Both yield this as an output:Hope this helps. \nPS, pleas note that this was written in version 3.6.2, so you might need to adjust it for older versions.As stated by numerous other answers, list.remove() will work, but throw a ValueError if the item wasn\'t in the list. With python 3.4+, there\'s an interesting approach to handling this, using the suppress contextmanager:Yes. This is what I found to be most useful:Now .remove() only takes one argument, so you can only remove one integer from your list.
