What is the best way to convert a Map<key,value> to a List<value>? Just iterate over all values and insert them in a list or am I overlooking something?assuming:The issue here is that Map has two values (a key and value), while a List only has one value (an element).Therefore, the best that can be done is to either get a List of the keys or the values. (Unless we make a wrapper to hold on to the key/value pair).Say we have a Map:The keys as a List can be obtained by creating a new ArrayList from a Set returned by the Map.keySet method:While the values as a List can be obtained creating a new ArrayList from a Collection returned by the Map.values method:The result of getting the List of keys:The result of getting the List of values:a list of what ?Assuming map is your instance of MapUsing the Java 8 Streams API.map.entrySet() gives you a collection of Map.Entry objects containing both key and value. you can then transform this into any collection object you like, such as new ArrayList(map.entrySet());I guess you want to convert the values contained in the Map to a list? Easiest is to call the values() method of the Map interface. This will return the Collection of value objects contained in the Map.Note that this Collection is backed by the Map object and any changes to the Map object will reflect here. So if you want a separate copy not bound to your Map object, simply create a new List object like an ArrayList passing the value Collection as below.You can do it like thisIf you want to ensure the values in the resultant List<Value> are in the key-ordering of the input Map<Key, Value>, you need to "go via" SortedMap somehow.Either start with a concrete SortedMap implementation (Such as TreeMap) or insert your input Map into a SortedMap before converting that to List. e.g.:Otherwise you\'ll get whatever native ordering the Map implementation provides, which can often be something other than the natural key ordering (Try Hashtable or ConcurrentHashMap, for variety).we can have both key and value pair in list.Also can get key and value using Map.Entry by iterating over list.The "trap" with map.EntrySet is that this interface does not implemet Serializable. In MyFaces, we got exception if you try to loop over the collection to display the data.
