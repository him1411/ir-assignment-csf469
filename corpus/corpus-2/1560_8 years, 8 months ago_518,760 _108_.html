I am creating a free version of my iPhone game. I want to have a button inside the free version that takes people to the paid version in the app store. If I use a standard linkhttp://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=300136119&mt=8the iPhone opens Safari first, and then the app store. I have used other apps that open the app store directly, so I know it is possible.Any ideas? What is the URL Scheme for the app store?Edited on 2016-02-02Starting from iOS 6 SKStoreProductViewController class was introduced. You can link an app without leaving your app. Code snippet in Swift 3.x/2.x and Objective-C is here.A SKStoreProductViewController object presents a store that allows the\n  user to purchase other media from the App Store. For example, your app\n  might display the store to allow the user to purchase another app.From News and Announcement For Apple Developers. Drive Customers Directly to Your App\n  on the App Store with iTunes Links\n  With iTunes links you can provide your\n  customers with an easy way to access\n  your apps on the App Store directly\n  from your website or marketing\n  campaigns. Creating an iTunes link is\n  simple and can be made to direct\n  customers to either a single app, all\n  your apps, or to a specific app with\n  your company name specified.To send customers to a specific\n  application:\n  http://itunes.com/apps/appnameTo send\n  customers to a list of apps you have\n  on the App Store:\n  http://itunes.com/apps/developernameTo send customers to a specific app\n  with your company name included in the\n  URL:\n  http://itunes.com/apps/developername/appnameAdditional notes:You can replace http:// with itms:// or itms-apps:// to avoid redirects.For info on naming, see Apple QA1633: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/qa/qa1633/_index.html.Edit (as of January 2015):itunes.com/apps links should be updated to appstore.com/apps.  See QA1633 above, which has been updated. A new QA1629 suggests these steps and code for launching the store from an app:Sample code:Swift 3.0If you want to open an app directly to the App Store, you should use:itms-apps://...This way it will directly open the App Store app in the device, instead of going to iTunes first, then only open the App Store (when using just itms://)Hope that helps.EDIT: APR, 2017.\nitms-apps:// actually works again in iOS10. I tested it.EDIT: APR, 2013.\nThis no longer works in iOS5 and above. Just use and there are no more redirects.

This appears to be a bug that was resolved in iOS 7.If you want to link to a developer\'s apps and the developer\'s name has punctuation or spaces (e.g. Development Company, LLC) form your URL like this:Otherwise it returns "This request cannot be processed" on iOS 4.3.3You can get a link to a specific item in the app store or iTunes through the link maker at:\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/linkmaker/This is working and directly linking in ios5This is simple and short way to redirect/link other existing application on app store.I can confirm that if you create an app in iTunes connect you get your app id before you submit it. Therefore..Works a treatCreating a link could become a complex issue when supporting multiple OS and multiple platform. For example the WebObjects isn\'t supported on iOS 7 (some of them), some links you create would open another country store then the user\'s etc.There is an open source library called iLink that could help you.There advantages of this library is that the links would be found and created at run time (the library would check the app ID and the OS it is running on and would figure out what link should be created). The best point in this is that you don\'t need to configure almost anything before using it so that is error free and would work always. That\'s great also if you have few targets on same project so you don\'t have to remember which app ID or link to use. This library also would prompt the user to upgrade the app if there is a new version on the store (this is built in and you turn this off by a simple flag) directly pointing to the upgrade page for the app if user agrees.Copy the 2 library files to your project (iLink.h & iLink.m).On your appDelegate.m:and on the place you want to open the rating page for example just use:Don\'t forget to import iLink.h on the same file.There is a very good doc for the whole library there and an example projects for iPhone and for Mac.If you have the app store id you are best off using it. Especially if you in the future might change the name of the application. If you don\'t have tha app store id you can create an url based on this documentation https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1633/_index.htmlPasses this testTry this wayhttp://itunes.apple.com/lookup?id="your app ID here" return json.From this, find key "trackViewUrl" and value is the desired url. use this url(just replace https:// with itms-apps://).This works just fine.For example if your app ID is xyz then go to this link\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/lookup?id=xyzThen find the url for key "trackViewUrl".This is the url for your app in app store and to use this url in xcode try thisThanks
