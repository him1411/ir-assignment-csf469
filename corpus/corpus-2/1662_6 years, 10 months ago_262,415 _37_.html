I couldn\'t find any examples of how to send messages between an activity and a service, and I have spent far too many hours figuring this out. Here is an example project for others to reference.This example allows you to start or stop a service directly, and separately bind/unbind from the service. When the service is running, it increments a number at 10Â Hz. If the activity is bound to the Service, it will display the current value. Data is transferred as an Integer and as a String so you can see how to do that two different ways. There are also buttons in the activity to send messages to the service (changes the increment-by value).Screenshot:AndroidManifest.xml:res\\values\\strings.xml:res\\layout\\main.xml:\nsrc\\com.exampleservice\\MainActivity.java:src\\com.exampleservice\\MyService.java:Look at the LocalService example.Your Service returns an instance of itself to consumers who call onBind. Then you can directly interact with the service, e.g. registering your own listener interface with the service, so that you can get callbacks.For sending data to a service you can use:And after in service in onStartCommand() get data from intent.For sending data or event from a service to an application (for one or more activities):This method is calling from your service. You can simply send data for your Activity.For receiving an event with data, create and register method registerBroadcastReceivers() in your activity:For sending more data, you can modify method sendBroadcastMessage();. Remember: you must register broadcasts in onResume() & unregister in onStop() methods!UPDATEPlease don\'t use my type of communication between Activity & Service.\nThis is the wrong way.\nFor a better experience please use special libs, such us:1)  EventBus from greenrobot2) Otto from Square IncP.S. I\'m only using EventBus from greenrobot in my projects,Note: You don\'t need to check if your service is running, CheckIfServiceIsRunning(), because bindService() will start it if it isn\'t running.Also: if you rotate the phone you don\'t want it to bindService() again, because onCreate() will be called again. Be sure to define onConfigurationChanged() to prevent this.Everything is fine.Good example of activity/service communication using Messenger.One comment : the method MyService.isRunning() is not required.. bindService() can be done any number of times. no harm in that.If MyService is running in a different process then the static function MyService.isRunning() will always return false. So there is no need of this function.So you send it to the service. Afterward receive.This is how I implemeted Activity->Service Communication:\non my Activity i had And then I used this to start my ServiceIn my Service i hadHope this HelpsSeems to me you could\'ve saved some memory by declaring your activity with "implements Handler.Callback"Great tutorial, fantastic presentation. Neat, simple, short and very explanatory.\nAlthough, notification.setLatestEventInfo(this, getText(R.string.service_label), text, contentIntent); method is no more. As trante stated here, good approach would be:Checked myself, everything works like a charm (activity and service names may differ from original).
