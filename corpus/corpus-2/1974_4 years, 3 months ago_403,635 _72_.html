Is there a command I can run to get the container\'s IP address right from the host after a new container is created?Basically, once Docker creates the container, I want to roll my own code deployment and container configuration scripts.First get the container ID:(First column is for container ID)Use the container ID to run:At the bottom,under "NetworkSettings", you can find "IPAddress"The --format option of inspect comes to the rescue.Modern Docker client syntax:Old Docker client syntax:Which will return just the IP address.You can use docker inspect <container id>Example:Add this shell script in your ~/.bashrc or relevant file:Then, to get an IP address of a container, simply do this:For the new version of the Docker, please use the following:To get all container names and their IP addresses in just one single command.If you are using docker-compose the command will be this:The output will be:Show all containers IP addresses:In Docker 1.3+, you can also check it via steps below:Enter the running Docker:Execute:This will display active docker images:Use the CONTAINER ID value:"172.17.0.2"As of Docker version 1.10.3, build 20f81ddUnless you told Docker otherwise, Docker always launches your containers in the bridge network. So you can try this command below:Which should then return a Containers section which will display the IP address for that running container. Reference containers by name:Then grab the IP address address by name:I wrote the following Bash script to get a table of IP addresses from all containers running under docker-compose.You should change the variable network to your own network name.To extend ko-dos\' answer, here\'s an alias to list all container names and their IP addresses:Based on some of the answers I loved, I decided to merge them to a function to get all the IP addresses and another for an specific container. They are now in my .bashrc file.The first command gives the IP address of all the containers and the second a specific container\'s IP address.The above works if the container is deployed to the default bridge network.However, if using a custom bridge network or a overlay network, I found the below to work better:If you installed Docker using Docker Toolbox, you can use the Kitematic application to get the container IP address:NOTE!!! for Docker Compose Usage:Since Docker Compose creates an isolated network for each cluster, the methods below does not work with docker-compose.The most elegant and easy way is defining a shell function as the most-voted answer @WouterD\'s:Docker can write container ids to a file like Linux programs:Running with --cidfile=filename parameter, Docker dumps the ID of the container to this file.Docker runs PID equivalent Sectiona29ac3b9f8aebf66a1ba5989186bd620ea66f1740e9fe6524351e7ace139b909You can use file content to inspect Docker containers:\xe2\x9e\x9c  blog-v4 git:(develop) \xe2\x9c\x97 docker inspect `cat app.cid`\nExtracting Container IP inline Python script:$ docker inspect `cat app.cid` | python -c "import json;import sys;\\\n    sys.stdout.write(json.load(sys.stdin)[0][\'NetworkSettings\'][\'IPAddress\'])"\n172.17.0.2\nhttp://networkstatic.net/10-examples-of-how-to-get-docker-container-ip-address/Here there are 10 alternatives of getting the Docker container IP addresses.Here\'s is a solution that I developed today in Python, using the "docker inspect container" JSON output as the data source.I have a lot of containers and infrastructures that I have to inspect, and I need to obtain basic network information from any container, in a fast and pretty manner. That\'s why I made this script.IMPORTANT: Since the version 1.9, Docker allows you to create multiple networks and attach them to the containers.The output is just like this:For more information, I have a Gist for it, with some other details and comments.Just for completeness:I really like the --format option, but at first I wasn\'t aware of that option so I used a simple Python one-liner to get the same result:Combining previous answers with finding the container id based on the Docker image name.To get the IP address and host port of a container:Output:For those who came from Google to find solution for command execution from terminal (not by script), jid (an interactive JSON drill down util with autocomplete and suggestion) let you achieve same thing with less typing. Type tab .Net tab and you\'ll see following:Type .IPA tab and you\'ll see following:Inspect didn\'t work for me. Maybe as I was using -net host and some namespaces.Anyway, I found this to work nicely:docker inspect <container id> | grep "IPAddress"If you want to quickly see all Docker IP addresses, or without typing the instance name, you can hack the docker ps command adding this to your ~/.bashrc file:This comes from a proposal by Andrew Johnstone at the Docker GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/docker/docker/issues/8786Use:I had to extract docker container IP Adress by docker container name for further usage in deployment scripts.\nFor this purpose I have written the following bash command:Suppose it could be handy to place it into a bash script, which would expect my_container_name as an argument...
