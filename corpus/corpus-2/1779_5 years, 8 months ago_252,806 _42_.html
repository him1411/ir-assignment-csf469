I have made a git commit and subsequent push. I would like to change the commit message. If I understand correctly, this is not advisable because someone might have pulled from the remote repository before I make such changes. What if I know that no one has pulled? Is there a way to do this?If it is the most recent commit, you can simply do this:This brings up the editor with the last commit message and lets you edit the message.  (You can use -m if you want to wipe out the old message and use a new one.)And then when you push, do this:Or you can use "+":Or you can use --force:Be careful when using these commands.If someone else pushed changes to the same branch, you probably want to avoid destroying those changes.  The --force-with-lease option is the safest, because it will abort if there are any upstream changes (If you don\'t specify the branch explicitly, Git will use the default push settings.  If your default push setting is "matching", then you may destroy changes on several branches at the same time. Anyone who already pulled will now get an error message, and they will need to update (assuming they aren\'t making any changes themselves) by doing something like this:Be careful when using reset --hard.  If you have changes to the branch, those changes will be destroyed.The destroyed data is really just the old commit message, but --force doesn\'t know that, and will happily delete other data too.  So think of --force as "I want to destroy data, and I know for sure what data is being destroyed."  But when the destroyed data is committed, you can often recover old commits from the reflog\xe2\x80\x94the data is actually orphaned instead of destroyed (although orphaned commits are periodically deleted).If you don\'t think you\'re destroying data, then stay away from --force... bad things might happen.This is why --force-with-lease is somewhat safer.Just say :and thenMight be late to the party, here is an answer I do not see here.Step1: git rebase -i HEAD~n to do interactive rebase for all those commits affected.git will pop up an editor to handle those commits, notice this command: #  r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message, that is exactly we need.Step2: change pick to r for those commits that you want to update the msg.\nSave and close the editor.Step3: in the following commit files, update the commit msg as you likeStep4: after all commits msgs are updated. you might want to do git push -f to update the remote.Use these two step in console :and thenDone :)It should be noted that if you use push --force with mutiple refs, they will ALL be modified as a result. Make sure to pay attention to where your git repo is configured to push to. Fortunately there is a way to safeguard the process slightly, by specifying a single branch to update. Read from the git man pages:Note that --force applies to all the refs that are pushed, hence using\n  it with push.default set to matching or with multiple push\n  destinations configured with remote.*.push may overwrite refs other\n  than the current branch (including local refs that are strictly behind\n  their remote counterpart). To force a push to only one branch, use a +\n  in front of the refspec to push (e.g git push origin +master to force\n  a push to the master branch).If you want to modify an older commit, not the last one, you will need to use rebase command as explained in here,Github help page , on the Amending the message of older or multiple commit messages sectionCommand 1.Then,Command 2.This works for me pretty fine, git checkout origin/branchnameif you\'re already in branch then it\'s better to do pull or rebaseor Later you can simply useor if you like to open text-editor then useI will prefer using text-editor if you have many comments. You can set your preferred text-editor with commandAnyway, when your are done changing the commit message, save it and exitand then runAnd you\'re done
