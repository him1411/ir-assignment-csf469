A few years ago I installed Apache 2.2x and PHP 5.3.1 on a Linux server I maintain.  I used .tar.gz\'s and built them as instructed (instead of rpms and what-have-you). And all was fine.Today I need to install this which seems like a PHP library.  I went through all the steps up to make install, and I find ibm_db2.so in $PHP_HOME/lib/extensions/somecomplicatedname/ibm_db2.soThe great catch is the last step is to configure php.ini but there is NO php.ini on my system. Horror of horrors. PHP works fine, except of course for this new-fangled ibm_db2 thingamagic that I want to use so somebody can use a GUI to tinker with DB2. (I tried a small php script which fails and indicates that the ibm_db2 functions are not available).I have to deal with PHP once every few years, so please enlighten me at a very basic level about what I could do to enable web-based GUI access to DB2.Best way to find this is:\ncreate a php file and add the following code:and open it in browser, it will show the file which is actually being read!Updates by OP:On the command line execute:You will get something like:That\'s from my local dev-machine. However, the second line is the interesting one. If there is nothing mentioned, have a look at the first one. That is the path, where PHP looks for the php.ini.You can grep the same information using phpinfo() in a script and call it with a browser. Its mentioned in the first block of the output. php -i does the same for the command line, but its quite uncomfortable.This works for me:You should see something like:In command window typeIt will show you the path something likeIf the above command does not work then use thisThis command should help you to find itwill tell you its location, or from the command line Use the following command to find the php.ini file path. \nor try this another way\n[root@AnyDirectory ~]# php --ini\n\nits shows the path resultPHP comes with two native functions to show which config file is loaded : Depending on your setup, Apache and CLI might use different ini files. Here are the two solutions :Just add the following in a php file and open it in your browserCopy-paste in your terminal :Hey... it worked for me!You can get more info about your config files using something like:For SAPI: php-fpmThere is no need to create a php.info file (it is not a good policy to leave it for the world to read anyway). On the command line: Somewhere in its output, it will show this line:Here is a more complete explanation: \nhttps://www.cloudinsidr.com/content/how-to-figure-out-your-php-configuration-parameters-without-info-php/There are several valid ways already mentioned for locating the php.ini file, but if you came across this page because you want to do something with it in a bash script:path_php_ini="$(php -i | grep \'Configuration File (php.ini) Path\' | grep -oP \'(?<=\\=\\>\\s).*\')"\necho ${path_php_ini}
