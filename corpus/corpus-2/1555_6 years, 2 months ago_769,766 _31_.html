This question already has an answer here:I know that in Linux, to redirect output from the screen to a file, I can either use the > or tee. However, I\'m not sure why part of the output is still output to the screen and not written to the file. Is there a way to redirect all output to file?That part is written to stderr, use 2> to redirect it. For example:or if you want in same file:Note: this works in (ba)sh, check your shell for proper syntaxAll POSIX operating systems have 3 streams: stdin, stdout, and stderr. stdin is the input, which can accept the stdout or stderr. stdout is the primary output, which is redirected with >, >>, or |. stderr is the error output, which is handled separately so that any exceptions do not get passed to a command or written to a file that it might break; normally, this is sent to a log of some kind, or dumped directly, even when the stdout is redirected. To redirect both to the same place, use:command &> /some/fileEDIT: thanks to Zack for pointing out that the above solution is not portable--use instead:    If you want to silence the error, do:To get the output on the console AND in a file file.txt for example.Note: & (in 2>&1) specifies that 1 is not a file name but a file descriptor.Use this - "require command here" > log_file_name 2>&1Detail description of redirection operator in Unix/Linux.The > operator redirects the output usually to a file but it can be to a device. You can also use >> to append.If you don\'t specify a number then the standard output stream is assumed but you can also redirect errors/dev/null is the null device it takes any input you want and throws it away. It can be used to suppress any output.It might be the the standard error. You can redirect it:Credits to osexp2003 and j.a. \xe2\x80\xa6Instead of puttingbehind a line inI useat the beginning of a BASH script.Advantage: You have the log definitions within your script. Good for Git etc.Command:appends to the output.txt file, without replacing the content.You can use exec command to redirect all stdout/stderr output of any commands later.sample script:Use >> to append:command >> fileIn Linux Mint, this command string routed executing script and errors to a single txt file. bash -x ./setup.sh > setup.txt 2>&1. Script name was setup.sh and output destination was setup.txt.
