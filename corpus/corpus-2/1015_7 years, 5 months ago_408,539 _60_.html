How can I do this using the new forEach method in JavaScript?There\'s no built-in ability to break in forEach. To interrupt execution you would have to throw an exception of some sort. eg.JavaScript exceptions aren\'t terribly pretty. A traditional for loop might be more appropriate if you really need to break inside it. Instead, use Array#some:This works because some returns true as soon as any of the callbacks, executed in array order, return true, short-circuiting the execution of the rest.some, its inverse every (which will stop on a return false), and forEach are all ECMAScript Fifth Edition methods which will need to be added to the Array.prototype on browsers where they\'re missing.You can use every method:for old browser support use:more details here.There is now an even better way to do this in ECMAScript2015 (aka ES6) using the new for of loop. For example, this code does not print the array elements after the number 5:Quoting from the MDN documentation of Array.prototype.forEach():Note: There is no way to stop or break a forEach() loop other than \n  by throwing an exception. If you need such behaviour, the .forEach() method is the wrong tool, use a plain loop instead. If you are testing the array elements for a predicate and need a boolean return value, you can use every() or some() instead.For your code (in the question), as suggested by @bobince, use Array.prototype.some() instead. It suits very well to your usecase.Array.prototype.some() executes the callback function once for each element present in the array until it finds one where callback returns a truthy value (a value that becomes true when converted to a Boolean). If such an element is found, some() immediately returns true. Otherwise, some() returns false. callback is invoked only for indexes of the array which have assigned values; it is not invoked for indexes which have been deleted or which have never been assigned values.Consider to use jquery\'s each method, since it allows to return false inside callback function:Lodash libraries also provides takeWhile method that can be chained with map/reduce/fold etc:If you would like to use Dean Edward\'s suggestion and throw the StopIteration error to break out of the loop without having to catch the error, you can use the following the function (originally from here):The above code will give you the ability to run code such as the following without having to do your own try-catch clauses:One important thing to remember is that this will only update the Array.prototype.forEach function if it already exists.  If it doesn\'t exist already, it will not modify the it.Short answer: use for...break for this or change your code to avoid breaking of forEach. Do not use .some() or .every() to emulate for...break. Rewrite your code to avoid for...break loop, or use for...break. Every time you use these methods as for...break alternative God kills kitten. Long answer:.some() and .every() both return boolean value, .some() returns true if there any element for which passed function returns true, every returns false if there any element for which passed function returns false. This is what that functions mean. Using functions for what they doesn\'t mean is much worse then using tables for layout instead of CSS, because it frustrates everybody who reads your code.Also, the only possible way to use these methods as for...break alternative is to make side-effects (change some vars outside of .some() callback function), and this is not much different from for...break.So, using .some() or .every() as for...break loop alternative isn\'t free of side effects, this isn\'t much cleaner then for...break, this is frustrating, so this isn\'t better. You can always rewrite your code so that there will be no need in for...break. You can filter array using .filter(), you can split array using .slice() and so on, then use .forEach() or .map() for that part of array.Unfortunately in this case it will be much better if you don\'t use forEach. \nInstead use a regular for loop and it will now work exactly as you would expect. From your code example, it looks like Array.prototype.find is what you are looking for: Array.prototype.find() and Array.prototype.findIndex() Found this solution on another site. You can wrap the forEach in a try / catch scenario.More details here: http://dean.edwards.name/weblog/2006/07/enum/This is just something I came up with to solve the problem... I\'m pretty sure it fixes the problem that the original asker had:And then you would call it by using:Returning false inside the callback function will cause a break. Let me know if that doesn\'t actually work.I use nullhack for that purpose, it tries to access property of null, which is an error:Another concept I came up with:Usage:Might need some tweaking, particularly to support object property iteration.If you don\'t need to access your array after iteration you can bail out by setting the array\'s length to 0. If you do still need it after your iteration you could clone it using slice..Or with a clone:Which is a far better solution then throwing random errors in your code.If you want to keep your forEach syntax, this is a way to keep it efficient (although not as good as a regular for loop). Check immediately for a variable that knows if you want to break out of the loop. This example uses a anonymous function for creating a function scope around the forEach which you need to store the done information.My two cents.Use the array.prototype.every function, which provide you the utility to break the looping. See example here Javascript documentation on Mozilla developer networkAgree with @bobince, upvoted.Also, FYI:Prototype.js has something for this purpose:$break will be catched and handled by Prototype.js internally, breaking the "each" cycle but not generating external errors.See Prototype.JS API for details.jQuery also has a way, just return false in the handler to break the loop early:See jQuery API for details.This isn\'t the most efficient, since you still cycle all the elements, but I thought it might be worth considering the very simple:you can follow the code below which works for me:I know it not right way. It is not break the loop.\nIt is a Jugad\nI prefer to use for infor in works much like forEach, and you can add return to exit function inside. Better performance too.
