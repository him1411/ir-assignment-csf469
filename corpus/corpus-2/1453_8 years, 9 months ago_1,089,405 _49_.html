Is there some way I can show custom exception messages as an alert in my jQuery AJAX error message?For example, if I want to throw an exception on the server side via Struts by throw new ApplicationException("User name already exists");, I want to catch this message (\'user name already exists\') in the jQuery AJAX error message.On the second alert, where I alert the thrown error, I am getting undefined and the status code is 500.I am not sure where I am going wrong. What can I do to fix this problem?Make sure you\'re setting Response.StatusCode to something other than 200.  Write your exception\'s message using Response.Write, then use.....in your javascript.Controller:View script:ServerSide: ClientSide:Generic Ajax Error HandlingIf I need to do some generic error handling for all the ajax requests. I will set the ajaxError handler and display the error on a div named errorcontainer on the top of html content.You need to convert the responseText to JSON. Using JQuery:If making a call to asp.net, this will return the error message title:I didn\'t write all of formatErrorMessage myself but i find it very useful.I found this to be nice because I could parse out the message I was sending from the server and display a friendly message to the user without the stacktrace...This answer is provided for future reference to all those that bump into this problem. Solution consists of two things:This provides the optimal infrastructure for jQuery Ajax calls to use their full potential with success and error handlers.The whole problem is detailed in this blog post where you can find all the code to run this in your application.This is what I did and it works so far in a MVC 5 application. Controller\'s return type is ContentResult.And on client side this is what ajax function looks likeIf someone is here as in 2016 for the answer, use .fail() for error handling as .error() is deprecated as of jQuery 3.0I hope it helpsThis is probably caused by the JSON field names not having quotation marks.Change the JSON structure from:to:I believe the Ajax response handler uses the HTTP status code to check if there was an error.So if you just throw a Java exception on your server side code but then the HTTP response doesn\'t have a 500 status code jQuery (or in this case probably the XMLHttpRequest object) will just assume that everything was fine.I\'m saying this because I had a similar problem in ASP.NET where I was throwing something like a ArgumentException("Don\'t know what to do...") but the error handler wasn\'t firing.I then set the Response.StatusCode to either 500 or 200 whether I had an error or not.jQuery.parseJSON is useful for success and error.Throw a new exception on server using:Response.StatusCode = 500Response.StatusDescription = ex.Message()I believe that the StatusDescription is returned to the Ajax call...Example:Although it has been many years since this question is asked, I still don\'t find xhr.responseText as the answer I was looking for. It returned me string in the following format:which I definitely don\'t want to show to the users. What I was looking for is something like below:xhr.responseJSON.message gives me the exact message from the Json Object which can be shown to the users.You have a JSON object of the exception thrown, in the xhr object. Just useThe JSON object expose two other properties: \'ExceptionType\' and \'StackTrace\'If there is any form is submit with validatesimply use the rest of the code...\n...\n});First we need to set <serviceDebug includeExceptionDetailInFaults="True" /> in web.config:In addition to that at jquery level in error part you need to parse error response that contains exception like:Then using r.Message you can actully show exception text.Check complete code: http://www.codegateway.com/2012/04/jquery-ajax-handle-exception-thrown-by.html
