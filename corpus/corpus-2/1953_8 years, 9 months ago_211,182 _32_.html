The issue is simple really. Instead of creating folders in Visual Studio, I create a directory structure for my project on the file system. How do I include all the folders and files in a project, keeping the structure?If I "Add Existing File" on a folder named Services and navigate to a file in the directory structure .. Services > AccountManagement > CreateAccount.cs, it appears in Visual Studio like so: Services > CreateAccount.cs. I do not want this.I have an entire directory structure worked out already, as I am mimicking our client developers using the same structure for organization. How do I add all the folders and files to the project in Visual Studio? Or do I have to do what most Microsoft users do and "put up with it" and recreate each and every folder through Visual Studio?You need to put your directory structure in your project directory. And then click "Show All Files" icon in the top of Solution Explorer toolbox. After that, the added directory will be shown up. You will then need to select this directory, right click, and choose "Include in Project."You can also drag and drop the folder from WindowsÂ Explorer onto your Visual Studio solution window.Copy & Paste. To Add a folder, all the sub-directories, and files we can also Copy and Paste. \nFor example we can: Right click in Windows explorer on the folder, and Copy on the folder with many files and folders. Then in Visual Studio Solution explorer, right click on the destination folder and click paste. Optional add to TFS; Then in the top folder right click and check in to TFS to check in all sub-folders and files. You can use a symbolic link. This makes modifying the file in one project modify it in the other (as it\'s actually the same file).To do this:This has it\'s drawbacks and pitfalls, but I use it on occasion for duplicate libraries that need different names.Edit for Anoop:\nSteps to add to Visual Studio:These are the steps I follow and works for a couple different projects.In Visual Studio 2015, this is how you do it. If you wanted to automatically include all descendant files below a specific folder:This can be restricted to include only files within the path specified:Or even only files with a specified extension:Reference: http://jamesrpatterson.com/blog/automatic-include-in-project-for-visual-studioIn Visual Studio 2013, I couldn\'t get "Include in Project" to work when right-clicking on a folder.  What did work is expanding the folder, selecting all the files then choosing "Include in Project".  It was quite tedious as you have to do each folder one by one (but at least you can do all files in each folder in one go), and it appears to store the file path (you can see this by viewing properties on the file and looking at the "Relative Path" option.)I am hoping to use this to deploy some data files in a Visual Studio Installer project, and it seems to pick up the included files and preserve their paths.As far as I can tell, the only way to do this in VS2010 is akin to the drag and drop method.  Right click the solution to which you want to add a project.  The application menu will have an add ... item.  Opening that, you find that one of the options is to add an existing project to the solution. In the dialog box that opens, navigate to the folder containing the project file for the solution and select it.  VS will, as part of importing that project file, also import the entire directory and, I assume any subordinate directories which are part of that project.As this does require an existing project file, it won\'t be impossible to import a directory tree until that tree has been converted to a project.To expand on Yuchen\'s answer, you can include files and paths as a link. This is not the same thing as adding the existing items because it doesn\'t make an extra copy in your project\'s folder structure. It is useful if you want one canonical folder / file etc to be used in a lot of different places but you only want to maintain one version/copy of it.Here is an example of what you can add to a *.csproj file to create the link$(Codez) is a Windows Environment variable I defined, you can use the built-in Environment variables in the same manner. The last example group is a bunch of content files I need in the final output. See https://stackoverflow.com/a/11808911/492 and other answers & links there for more on that.
