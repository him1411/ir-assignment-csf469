I have just installed Ctags (to help with C++ development) with my Vim (or rather gVim), and would like to find out your favorite commands, macros, shortcuts, tips that go along with it...Share your best arsenal. What other Vim add-ons you would recommend for C++ on Vim development?EDIT What other add-on you would use in conjunction with Ctags?EDIT2 What version of gVim you use with tags? Does it make a difference? EDIT3 How do you enhance your programming experience for both big and small projects?Ctrl+] - go to definition\nCtrl+T - Jump back from the definition.\nCtrl+W Ctrl+] - Open the definition in a horizontal split  Add these lines in vimrc\n    map <C-\\> :tab split<CR>:exec("tag ".expand("<cword>"))<CR>\n    map <A-]> :vsp <CR>:exec("tag ".expand("<cword>"))<CR> Ctrl+\\ - Open the definition in a new tab\nAlt+] - Open the definition in a vertical splitAfter the tags are generated. You can use the following keys to tag into and tag out of functions:Ctrl+Left MouseClick - Go to definition\nCtrl+Right MouseClick - Jump back from definition One line that always goes in my .vimrc:This will look in the current directory for "tags", and work up the tree towards root until one is found.  IOW, you can be anywhere in your source tree instead of just the root of it.Another useful plugin for C development is cscope\nJust as Ctags lets you jump to definitions, Cscope jumps to the calling functions.If you have cscope in your ~/bin/ directory, add the following to your .vimrc and use g^] to go to the calling function (see :help cscope).Almost forgot... Just as ctags - you have to generate (and periodically update) the database. I use the following scriptWhere \'select_files\' is another script that extracts the list of C and header files from the Makefile. This way I index only the files actually used by the project.You can add directories to your ctags lookup.  For example, I have a ctags index built for Qt4, and have this in my .vimrc:All of the above and...code_complete : function parameter complete, code snippets, and much more. taglist.vim : Source code browser (supports C/C++, java, perl, python, tcl, sql, php, etc) I use ALT-left and ALT-right to pop/push from/to the tag stack.If you use hjkl for movement you can map <M-h> and <M-l> instead.Several definitions of the same name<C-w>g<C-]> open the definition in a split, but also do :tjump which either goes to the definition or, if there are several definitions, presents you with a list of definitions to choose from. The command I am using most is C-] which jumps to the definition of the function under the cursor. You can use it more often to follow more calls. After that, C-o will bring you back one level, C-i goes deeper again.I\'ve found the taglist plug-in a must-have. It lists all tags that it knows about (files that you have opened) in a seperate window and makes it very easy to navigate larger files.I use it mostly for Python development, but it can only be better for C/C++.I\'ve encapsulated tags manipulation in an experimental plugin of mine.Regarding C++ development in vim, I\'ve already answered there: I use my own suite, and a few other plugins.I\'ve been adapting my vim plugins for two years to support big enough c++ project. You can take a look at them.They use ctags and cscsope.http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1638\nhttp://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2507I put the following in my .gvimrc file, which searches up the tree from any point for a tags file when gvim starts:I then periodically regenerate a tags file at the top of my source tree with a script that looks like:I use vim in macos, and the original ctags doesn\'t work well, so I download newest and configure make make install it.\nI install ctgas in /usr/local/bin/ctags(to keep original one)I adapted the SetTags() search function above (which should be replaced by the equivalent set tags+=./tags;/) to work for cscope. Seems to work!Another iteration on the SetCscope() function above. That sets cscope pre-path to get matches without being on the dir where "cscope.out" is:
