How do I, reliably, check in SQLite, whether a particular user table exists?I am not asking for unreliable ways like checking if a "select *" on the table returned an error or not (is this even a good idea?).The reason is like this:In my program, I need to create and then populate some tables if they do not exist already.If they do already exist, I need to update some tables.Should I take some other path instead to signal that the tables in question have already been created - say for example, by creating/putting/setting a certain flag in my program initialization/settings file on disk or something?Or does my approach make sense?I missed that FAQ entry.Anyway, for future reference, the complete query is:If you\'re using SQLite version 3.3+ you can easily create a table with:   In the same way, you can remove a table only if it exists by using:A variation would be to use SELECT COUNT(*) instead of SELECT NAME, i.e.This will return 0, if the table doesn\'t exist, 1 if it does. This is probably useful in your programming since a numerical result is quicker / easier to process. The following illustrates how you would do this in Android using SQLiteDatabase, Cursor, rawQuery with parameters.You could try:If you are getting a "table already exists" error, make changes in the SQL string as below:This way you can avoid the exceptions.SQLite table names are case insensitive, but comparison is case sensitive by default. To make this work properly in all cases you need to add COLLATE NOCASE.Use:If the resulting table is empty then your_table_name doesn\'t exist.See this:If you\'re using fmdb, I think you can just import FMDatabaseAdditions and use the bool function:The following code returns 1 if the table exists or 0 if the table does not exist.Note that to check whether a table exists in the TEMP database, you must use sqlite_temp_master instead of sqlite_master:Here\'s the function that I used:  Given an SQLDatabase Object = dbUse this code:If the returned array count is equal to 1 it means the table exists. Otherwise it does not exist.Useto prevent all records from being read.Using a simple SELECT query is - in my opinion - quite reliable. Most of all it can check table existence in many different database types (SQLite / MySQL).It makes sense when you can use other reliable mechanism for determining if the query succeeded (for example, you query a database via QSqlQuery in Qt).This is my code for SQLite Cordova:And the other one:I thought I\'d put my 2 cents to this discussion, even if it\'s rather old one.. \nThis query returns scalar 1 if the table exists and 0 otherwise.
