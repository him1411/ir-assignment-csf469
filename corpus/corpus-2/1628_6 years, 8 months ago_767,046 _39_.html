I have a number of columns that I would like to remove from a data frame. I know that we can delete them individually using something like:But I was hoping to do this with fewer commands.Also, I know that I could drop columns using integer indexing like this:But I am concerned that the relative position of my variables may change.Given how powerful R is, I figured there might be a better way than dropping each column one by one.You can use a simple list of names :Or, alternatively, you can make a list of those to keep and refer to them by name :EDIT :\nFor those still not acquainted with the drop argument of the indexing function, if you want to keep one column as a data frame, you do:drop=TRUE (or not mentioning it) will drop unnecessary dimensions, and hence return a vector with the values of column y.There\'s also the subset command, useful if you know which columns you want:UPDATED after comment by @hadley: To drop columns a,c you could do:is probably easiest, or for multiple variables:Or if you\'re dealing with data.tables (per How do you delete a column by name in data.table?):or for multiple variablesIn the development version of data.table (installation instructions), with = FALSE is no longer necessary:You could use %in% like this:list(NULL) also works:If you want remove the columns by reference and avoid the internal copying associated with data.frames then you can use the data.table package and the function :=You can pass a character vector names to the left hand side of the := operator, and NULL as the RHS.If you want to predefine the names as as character vector outside the call to [, wrap the name of the object in () or {} to force the LHS to be evaluated in the calling scope not as a name within the scope of DT.You can also use set, which avoids the overhead of [.data.table, and also works for data.frames!There is a potentially more powerful strategy based on the fact that grep() will return a numeric vector. If you have a long list of variables as I do in one of my dataset, some variables that end in ".A" and others that end in ".B" and you only want the ones that end in ".A" (along with all the variables that don\'t match either pattern, do this:For the case at hand, using Joris Meys example, it might not be as compact, but it would be:Out of interest, this flags up one of R\'s weird multiple syntax inconsistencies.  For example given a two-column data frame:This gives a data framebut this gives a vectorThis is all explained in ?[ but it\'s not exactly expected behaviour.  Well at least not to me...Another dplyr answer.  If your variables have some common naming structure, you might try starts_with().  For exampleIf you want to drop a sequence of variables in the data frame, you can use :.  For example if you wanted to drop var2, var3, and all variables in between, you\'d just be left with var1:Another possibility:orOutput: Output:Here is a dplyr way to go about it:I like this because it\'s intuitive to read & understand without annotation and robust to columns changing position within the data frame. It also follows the vectorized idiom using - to remove elements.I keep thinking there must be a better idiom, but for subtraction of columns by name, I tend to do the following:There\'s a function called dropNamed() in Bernd Bischl\'s BBmisc package that does exactly this.The advantage is that it avoids repeating the data frame argument and thus is suitable for piping in magrittr (just like the dplyr approaches):Another solution if you don\'t want to use @hadley\'s above: If "COLUMN_NAME" is the name of the column you want to drop:
