Does C# have extension properties?For example, can I add an extension property to DateTimeFormatInfo called ShortDateLongTimeFormat which would return ShortDatePattern + " " + LongTimePattern?No they do not exist in C# 3.0 and will not be added in 4.0.  It\'s on the list of feature wants for C# so it may be added at a future date.At this point the best you can do is GetXXX style extension methods.  No, they don\'t exist.I know that the C# team was considering them at one point (or at least Eric Lippert was) - along with extension constructors and operators (those may take a while to get your head round, but are cool...) However, I haven\'t seen any evidence that they\'ll be part of C# 4.EDIT: They didn\'t appear in C# 5, and as of July 2014 it doesn\'t look like it\'s going to be in C# 6 either.Eric Lippert, the Principal Developer on the C# compiler team at Microsoft thru November 2012, blogged about this in October of 2009:Until now, the extension properties were not seen as valuable enough to be included in the previous versions of C# standard (ie 5 and 6).There is an extension members item in the C# 7 work list so it may be supported in the near future. The current status of extension property can be found on Github under the related item.However, there is an even more promising topic which is the "extend everything" with a focus on especially properties and static classes or even fields.As specified in this article, you can use the TypeDescriptor capability to attach an attribute to an object instance at runtime. However, it is not using the syntax of the standard properties.\nIt\'s a little bit different from just syntactic sugar adding a possibility to define an extended property like string Data(this MyClass instance) as an alias for extension method string GetData(this MyClass instance) as it stores data into the class.I hope that C#7 will provide a full featured extension everything (properties and fields), however on that point, only time will tell. And feel free to contribute as the software of tomorrow will come from the community.Update: August 2016As dotnet team published what\'s new in C# 7.0 and from a comment of Mads Torgensen:Extension properties: we had a (brilliant!) intern implement them over\n  the summer as an experiment, along with other kinds of extension\n  members. We remain interested in this, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a big change and we\n  need to feel confident that it\xe2\x80\x99s worth it.It seems that extension properties and other members, are still good candidates to be included in a future release of Roslyn, but maybe not the 7.0 one.Update: May 2017The extension members has been closed as duplicate of extension everything issue which is closed too.\nThe main discussion was in fact about Type extensibility in a broad sense.\nThe feature is now tracked here as a proposal and has been removed from 7.0 milestone.As @Psyonity mentioned, you can use the conditionalWeakTable to add properties to existing objects. Combined with the dynamic ExpandoObject, you could implement dynamic extension properties in a few lines:A usage example is in the xml comments:Because I recently needed this, I looked at the source of the answer in: c# extend class by adding propertiesand created a more dynamic version:It can probably be improved a lot (naming, dynamic instead of string), I currently use this in CF 3.5 together with a hacky ConditionalWeakTable (https://gist.github.com/Jan-WillemdeBruyn/db79dd6fdef7b9845e217958db98c4d4)
