I am storing time in a MySQL database as a Unix timestamp and that gets sent to some JavaScript code. How would I get just the time out of it?For example, in HH/MM/SS format.For more information regarding the Date object, please refer to MDN or the ECMAScript 5 specification.JavaScript works in milliseconds, so you\'ll first have to convert the UNIX timestamp from seconds to milliseconds.I\'m partial to Jacob Wright\'s Date.format() library, which implements JavaScript date formatting in the style of PHP\'s date() function.Here is the shortest one-liner solution to format seconds as hh:mm:ss:Method Date.prototype.toISOString() returns time in\n  simplified extended ISO 8601 format, which is always 24 or 27 characters long (i.e. YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ or\n  \xc2\xb1YYYYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ respectively). The timezone is always\n  zero UTC offset.N.B.: This solution does not require any third-party libraries and is supported in all modern browsers and JavaScript engines.UNIX timestamp is number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970 (according to Wikipedia).Argument of Date object in Javascript is number of miliseconds since 00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970 (according to W3Schools Javascript documentation).See code below for example:gives:I\'d think about using a library like momentjs.com, that makes this really simple:Based on a Unix timestamp:Based on a MySQL date string:The problem with the aforementioned solutions is, that if hour, minute or second, has only one digit (i.e. 0-9), the time would be wrong, e.g. it could be 2:3:9, but it should rather be 02:03:09.According to this page it seems to be a better solution to use Date\'s "toLocaleTimeString" method.Using Moment.js, you can get time and date like this:And you can get only time using this:Another way - from an ISO 8601 date.In moment you must use unix timestamp:The modern solution that doesn\'t need a 40Â KB library:Intl.DateTimeFormat is the non-culturally imperialistic way to format a date/time.Based on @shomrat\'s answer, here is a snippet that automatically writes datetime like this:oror (if different but same year than today)or (if another year than today)Pay attention to the zero problem with some of the answers. For example, the timestamp 1439329773 would be mistakenly converted to 12/08/2015 0:49.I would suggest on using the following to overcome this issue:Now results in:See Date/Epoch Converter.You need to ParseInt, otherwise it wouldn\'t work:If you want to convert Unix time duration to real hours, minutes, and seconds, you could use the following code:You can use the following function to convert your timestamp to HH:MM:SS format :Without passing a separator, it uses : as the (default) separator :If you want to use / as a separator, just pass it as the second parameter:See also this Fiddle.
