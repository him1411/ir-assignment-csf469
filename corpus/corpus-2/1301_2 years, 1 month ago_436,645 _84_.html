I\'ve always programmed Android with Eclipse and decided to start migrating to Android Studio. I decided to use the same SDK I already had for Eclipse, then:After a few seconds Gradle finishes the build, and it throws me two errors with the following messages in file Teste4\\app\\build\\intermediates/exploded-aar\\com.android.support\\appcompat-v7\\23.0.0\\res\\values-v23\\values-v23.xml:Error:(2) Error retrieving parent for item: No resource found that matches the given name \'android:TextAppearance.Material.Widget.Button.Inverse\'. \n    \n  Error:(2) Error retrieving parent for item: No resource found that matches the given name \'android:Widget.Material.Button.Colored\'. Under File -> Project Structure -> Modules: app (left column) -> Properties tab, I have the following versions set up:What should I do in order to fix this?I already tried what was suggested in Stack Overflow question appcompat-v7:21.0.0': No resource found that matches the given name: attr 'android:actionModeShareDrawable', but it didn\'t work.Your compile SDK version must match the support library\'s major version.Since you are using version 23 of the support library, you need to compile against version 23 of the Android SDK.Alternatively you can continue compiling against version 22 of the Android SDK by switching to the latest support library v22.This happens because after updates Android Studio uses API version 23 by default.The following worked for me:Press Ctrl + Shift + Alt + S to get to the project structure page.  Go to the properties tab and change 23.0.0 to 22.0.1 (or equivalent to what you were using earlier) in the build tool area and rebuild your project.If that doesn\'t work, go to gradle:app and thenEdit v7:23.0.0 to v7:22.2.1 as shown above and sync gradle. This will definitely work.When you update your Android Studio, it uses API version 23 by default,\nwhich is the main reason of its occurrence. So,At first, check your AppCompat version in build.gradle(Module:app)\nThat is,If after changing to 23 there occurs an error then just downloadCompile Sdk Version to API 23, and Build Tools Version to 23.0.0from SDK Manager. If already downloaded then:Click SDK Manager Button and open the dialog.Click SDK Platform and check if Android 6.0 is downloaded or not.if not, then download that first. After completing the download, click Apply.Now you need to apply changes to your project from setting.\nThen press Ctrl + Alt + Shift + S to open settingDon\'t forget to rebuild your project.Then your error will be gone.If you\'ve tried to change target to a previous GooglePlayServices or AppCompatv7 version and it doesn\'t work, check if you have any project-libraries dependency, this project will be targeting the latest version of any of these libraries. It happened to me with the Google Maps Utils Library project:replace:toThen you can continue full targeting API 22If it still doesn\'t compile, sometimes is useful to set compileSdkVersion API to 23 and targetSdkVersion to 22.I agree with the previous answer. Your compile SDK version must match the support library. Here is what I did.Then it should build without problem.You need to set compileSdkVersion to 23.Since API 23 Android removed the deprecated Apache Http packages, so if you use them for server requests, you\'ll need to add useLibrary \'org.apache.http.legacy\' to build.gradle as stated in this link:This issue is raised because now the compile SDK version must match the Android Support library\'s major version.In my case i have the Android Support Library version 23, so i had to compile against the Android SDK version 23, and I had to change this in my build.gradle file:Well some of you will need to install the SDK, Android 6.0 (API 23)and don\xc2\xb4t forget to Sync project with gradle filesI found the solution, Problem started when I updated sdk, after that I used different buildToolsVersion (\'22.0.1\')  and I was using different support library like compile \'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:23.0.0\', showing you in image belowThis was raising problem of "android.widget.Material..."\nThen I used same version for support library like  compile \'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:22.0.1\' and its DONE. (Showing you in below screenshot) As pointed out by Tanis.7x, the support library version (23) does not match the targetSdkVersion (22)You can fix this by doing the following: In the build.grade file of your app module, change the following line of codeTo This will use the latest version of the appcompat version that is compatible with SdkVersion 22.You should compile your project with latest version so update & install from your SDK. Sync your project with sync project with Gradle file Button.\nYou can also continue with the existing version but check it installed properly below image indicate to API 22 that is properly installed. And sync your project if needed. it may help.In my case it was an higher version of Google-play-services. I set them to 7.0.0 (not 8.x) and all was ok.Your compile SDK version must match the support library major version. This is the solution to your problem. You can check it easily in your Gradle Scripts in build.gradle file.\nFx: if your compileSdkVersion is 23 your compile library must start at 23.And always check that your Android Studoi has the supported API Level. You can check it in your Android SDK, like this:\n I got the same problems. I solved my problem by updating gradle.build for each sub-module to latest compiler version.This is what helped me: Adding specific android platformWhat should be done is the following... In my case it was cordova but the same is relevant for ionic, phonegap and other frameworks like these:remove the android platform: cordova platform remove android.then add the specific android platform: cordova platform add android@5.0.0.Good luck! :)I wanted to downgrade from API 23 to 22 and got this error. I had to change all build.gradle files in a project in order to compile.Another solution :\nnavigate toopen .aar file with 7-zip or winrar , in res folder remove values-23 folder and save changes .on module: app (Gradle)project: nameAppXXXX (Gradle)and edit your activity of AppCompatActivity to for example Activity:Make sure that all these are in upto date.Upgrade Android Studio.I had this issue with Android Studio 1.3.1 and none of the other answers worked for me, but after updating to 1.5.1 there were no problems.If you are using phonegap(cross-platform) and got same issue above,\njust remove the android platform using below command.phonegap platform remove androidAnd add it again.phonegap platform add androidThen problem solved for me.If you are getting errors even after downloading the newest SDK and Android Studio, here is what I did:I hope it helps someone so that he won\'t suffer like I did for these couple of days.
