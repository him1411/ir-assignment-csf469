I learned from somewhere a detached screen can be killed byscreen -X -S [session # you want to kill] killwhere [session # you want to kill] can be gotten fromscreen -ls\n  . But this doesn\'t work. Anything wrong? What\'s the correct way?"kill" will only kill one screen window. To "kill" the complete session, use quit.You can kill a detached session which is not responding within the screen session by doing the following.Type screen -list to identify the detached screen session.Note: 20751.Melvin_Peter_V42 is your session id.Get attached to the detached screen sessionOnce connected to the session press Ctrl + A then type :quitIt\'s easier to kill a session, when some meaningful name is given:List screens:Output:Kill screen session:You can just go to the place where the screen session is housed and run:which results in And just remove it:The uscreens directory will not have the 26727.pts-0.devxxx file in it anymore.

This is from within the screen session.To kill all detached screen sessions, include this function in your .bash_profile:to run it, call killdadd this to your ~/.bashrc:Then use cleanscreen to clean all screen session.Alternatively, while in your screen session all you have to do is type exitThis will kill the shell session initiated by the screen, which effectively terminates the screen session you are on.No need to bother with screen session id, etc.
