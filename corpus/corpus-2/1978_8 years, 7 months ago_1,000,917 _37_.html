I have a select control, and in a javascript variable I have a text string.Using jQuery I want to set the selected element of the select control to be the item with the text description I have (as opposed to the value, which I don\'t have).I know setting it by value is pretty trivial. e.g.But I\'m a bit stumped on doing it via the text description. I guess there must be a way of getting the value out from the text description, but my brain is too Friday afternoon-ed to be able to work it out.Given this HTML:Select by description for jQuery v1.6+:Select by description for jQuery versions below 1.6 and greater than or equal to 1.4:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/3644500/31532Note that while this approach will work in versions that are above 1.6 but less than 1.9, it has been deprecated since 1.6. It will not work in jQuery 1.9+.Select by description for previous versions:val() should handle both cases. Are you not seeing it?Eg:I haven\'t tested this, but this might work for you.Try this...to select the option with text myTextI do it on this way (jQuery 1.9.1)Note: don\'t forget the change(), I had to search to long because of that :)will return the value of the first option containing your text description. Tested this and works.To avoid all jQuery version complications, I honestly recommend using one of these really simple javascript functions...I know this is an old post, but I couldn\'t get it to select by text using jQuery 1.10.3 and the solutions above.\nI ended up using the following code (variation of spoulson\'s solution):Hope it helps someone.The if statement does a exact match with  "two" and "two three" will not be matchedThis line worked:Easiest way with 1.7+ is:1.9+Tested and works.take a look at the jquery selectedbox plugin Select options by value, using a string as the parameter $("#myselect2").selectOptions("Value 1");,  or a regular expression $("#myselect2").selectOptions(/^val/i);. You can also clear already selected options: $("#myselect2").selectOptions("Value 2", true);Just on a side note. My selected value was not being set. And i had search all over the net. Actually i had to select a value after a call back from a web service, because i was getting data from it.So the refresh of the selector was was the only thing that i was missing.I found that by using attr you would end up with multiple options selected when you didn\'t want to - solution is to use prop:$("#myDropDown option:text=" + myText +"").prop("selected", "selected");I had a problem with the examples above, and the problem was caused by the fact that my select box values are prefilled with fixed length strings of 6 characters, but the parameter being passed in wasn\'t fixed length.I have an rpad function which will right pad a string, to the length specified, and with the specified character.  So, after padding the parameter it works.Here is very simple way. plz use it Get the children of the select box; loop through them; when you have found the one you want, set it as the selected option; return false to stop looping.This accepted answer does not seem correct, while .val(\'newValue\') is correct for the function, trying to retrieve a select by its name does not work for me, I had to use the id and classname to get my elementHeres an easy option. Just set your list option then set its text as selected value:
