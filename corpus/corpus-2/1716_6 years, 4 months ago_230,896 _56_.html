As a newbie to Django, I am having difficulty making an upload app in Django 1.3. I could not find any up-to-date example/snippets. May someone post a minimal but complete (Model, View, Template) example code to do so?Phew, Django documentation really does not have good example about this. I spent over 2 hours to dig up all the pieces to understand how this works. With that knowledge I implemented a project that makes possible to upload files and show them as list. To download  source for the project, visit https://github.com/axelpale/minimal-django-file-upload-example or clone it:Update 2013-01-30: The source at GitHub has also implementation for Django 1.4 in addition to 1.3. Even though there is few changes the following tutorial is also useful for 1.4.Update 2013-05-10: Implementation for Django 1.5 at GitHub. Minor changes in redirection in urls.py and usage of url template tag in list.html. Thanks to hubert3 for the effort.Update 2013-12-07: Django 1.6 supported at GitHub. One import changed in myapp/urls.py. Thanks goes to Arthedian.Update 2015-03-17: Django 1.7 supported at GitHub, thanks to aronysidoro.Update 2015-09-04: Django 1.8 supported at GitHub, thanks to nerogit.Update 2016-07-03: Django 1.9 supported at GitHub, thanks to daavve and nerogitA basic Django 1.3 project with single app and media/ directory for uploads. To upload and serve files, you need to specify where Django stores uploaded files and from what URL Django serves them. MEDIA_ROOT and MEDIA_URL are in settings.py by default but they are empty. See the first lines in Django Managing Files for details. Remember also set the database and add myapp to INSTALLED_APPSNext you need a model with a FileField. This particular field stores files e.g. to media/documents/2011/12/24/ based on current date and MEDIA_ROOT. See FileField reference.To handle upload nicely, you need a form. This form has only one field but that is enough. See Form FileField reference for details.A view where all the magic happens. Pay attention how request.FILES are handled. For me, it was really hard to spot the fact that request.FILES[\'docfile\'] can be saved to models.FileField just like that. The model\'s save() handles the storing of the file to the filesystem automatically.Django does not serve MEDIA_ROOT by default. That would be dangerous in production environment. But in development stage, we could cut short. Pay attention to the last line. That line enables Django to serve files from MEDIA_URL. This works only in developement stage.See django.conf.urls.static.static reference for details. See also this discussion about serving media files.To make the view accessible, you must specify urls for it. Nothing special here.The last part: template for the list and the upload form below it. The form must have enctype-attribute set to "multipart/form-data" and method set to "post" to make upload to Django possible. See File Uploads documentation for details.The FileField has many attributes that can be used in templates. E.g. {{ document.docfile.url }} and {{ document.docfile.name }} as in the template. See more about these in Using files in models article and The File object documentation.Just run syncdb and runserver.Finally, everything is ready. On default Django developement environment the list of uploaded documents can be seen at localhost:8000/list/. Today the files are uploaded to /path/to/myproject/media/documents/2011/12/17/ and can be opened from the list.I hope this answer will help someone as much as it would have helped me.Generally speaking when you are trying to \'just get a working example\' it is best to \'just start writing code\'. There is no code here to help you with, so it makes answering the question a lot more work for us.If you want to grab a file, you need something like this in an html file somewhere:That will give you the browse button, an upload button to start the action (submit the form) and note the enctype so Django knows to give you request.FILESIn a view somewhere you can access the file withThere is a huge amount of information in the file upload docsI recommend you read the page thoroughly and just start writing code - then come back with examples and stack traces when it doesn\'t work.Update of Akseli Pal\xc3\xa9n\'s answer. see the github repo, works with Django 1.11Run startproject::now a folder(sample) is created::Create an app::Now a folder(uploader) with these files are created::On sample/settings.py add \'uploader\' to INSTALLED_APPS and add MEDIA_ROOT and MEDIA_URL, ie::in sample/urls.py add::update uploader/models.py::update uploader/views.py::Create a folder templates in folder uploader, then create a file home.html, ie sample/uploader/templates/home.html::Syncronize database and runserver::I must say I find the documentation at django confusing.\nAlso for the simplest example why are forms being mentioned?\nThe example I got to work in the views.py is :-The html file looks like the code below, though this example only uploads one file and the code to save the files handles many :-These examples are not my code, they have been optained from two other examples I found.\nI am a relative beginner to django so it is very likely I am missing some key point.Extending on Henry\'s example:You can call this handle_uploaded_file function from your view with the uploaded file object. This will save the file with a unique name (prefixed with filename of the original uploaded file) in filesystem and return the full path of saved file. You can save the path in database, and do something with the file later.Here it may helps you:\n create a file field in your models.pyFor uploading the file(in your admin.py):and use that field in your template also.I also had the similar requirement. Most of the examples on net are asking to create models and create forms which I did not wanna use. Here is my final code.And in HTML to upload I wrote:Following is the HTML which displays content of file:You can refer to server examples in Fine Uploader, which has django version.\nhttps://github.com/FineUploader/server-examples/tree/master/python/django-fine-uploaderIt\'s very elegant and most important of all, it provides featured js lib. Template is not included in server-examples, but you can find demo on its website.\nFine Uploader: http://fineuploader.com/demos.htmlviews.pyUploadView dispatches post and delete request to respective handlers. forms.pyNot sure if there any disadvantages to this approach but even more minimal, in views.py:I faced the similar problem, and solved by django admin site.
