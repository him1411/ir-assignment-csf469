I\'d like to get a Date object which is 30 minutes later than another Date object.  How do I do it with JavaScript?If you are doing a lot of date work, you may want to look into JavaScript date libraries like Datejs or Moment.js. For example, with Moment.js, this is simply:This is like chaos\'s answer, but in one line:Where diff is the difference in minutes you want from oldDateObj\'s time. It can even be negative.Or as a reusable function, if you need to do this in multiple places:You may think you can add 24 hours to a date to get tomorrow\'s date, right? Wrong!It turns out, if the user observes daylight saving time, a day is not necessarily 24 hours long. There is one day a year that is only 23 hours long, and one day a year that is 25 hours long. For example, in most of the United States and Canada, 24 hours after midnight, Nov 2, 2014, is still Nov 2:This is why using one of the afore-mentioned libraries is a safer bet if you have to do a lot of work with this.Below is a more generic version of this function that I wrote. I\'d still recommend using a library, but that may be overkill/impossible for your project. The syntax is modeled after MySQL DATE_ADD function.Working jsFiddle demo.Maybe something like this?I always create 7 functions, to work with date in JS: addSeconds, addMinutes, addHours, addDays, addWeeks, addMonths, addYears.You can see an example here: http://jsfiddle.net/tiagoajacobi/YHA8x/How to use:This are the functions:This is what I do which seems to work quite well:Then you can just call this like this:Here is the ES6 version:Call it like:Just another option, which I wrote:DP_DateExtensions LibraryIt\'s overkill if this is all the date processing that you need, but it will do what you want.Supports date/time formatting, date math (add/subtract date parts), date compare, date parsing, etc. It\'s liberally open sourced.For the lazy like myself:Kip\'s answer (from above) in coffeescript, using an "enum", and operating on the same object:Use an existing library known to handle the quirks involved in dealing with time calculations. My current favorite is moment.js.I feel many of the answers here are lacking a creative component, very much needed for time travel computations. I present my solution for a temporal translation of 30 minutes. (jsfiddle here)
