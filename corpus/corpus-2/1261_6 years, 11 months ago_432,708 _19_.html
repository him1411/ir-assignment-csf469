How might I convert an ArrayList<String> object to a String[] array in Java?For example:The toArray() method without passing any argument returns Object[]. So you have to pass an array as an argument, which will be filled with the data from the list, and returned. You can pass an empty array as well, but you can also pass an array with the desired size.Important update: Originally the code above used new String[list.size()]. However, this blogpost reveals that due to JVM optimizations, using new String[0] is better now.An alternative in Java 8:Using copyOf, ArrayList to arrays might be done also.You can use the toArray() method for List:Or you can manually add the elements to an array:Hope this helps!In Java 8:in case some extra manipulation of the data is desired, for which the user wants a function, this approach is not perfect (as it requires passing the class of the element as second parameter), but works:import java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.lang.reflect.Array;Generics solution to covert any List<Type> to String []:Note You must override toString() method.You can use Iterator<String> to iterate the elements of the ArrayList<String>Code : Now you can retrive elements from String[] using any Loop.By using toArray() method of ArrayList you can get 0bject[].\nCast that Object[] to String[]\nHere the sample code:This is enough:
