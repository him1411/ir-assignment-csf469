I created a tag on the master branch called v0.1 like this:But then I realised there were still some changes I needed to merge into master for release 0.1, so I did that. But now my v0.1 tag is stuck on (to invoke the post-it note analogy) the wrong commit. I want it to be stuck on the most recent commit on master, but instead it is stuck on the second most recent commit on master.How can I move it to the most recent commit on master?Use the -f option to git tag:You probably want to use -f in conjunction with -a to force-create an annotated tag instead of a non-annotated one.Delete the tag on any remote before you pushReplace the tag to reference the most recent commitPush the tag to the remote originMore precisely, you have to force the addition of the tag, then push with option --tags and -f:Delete it with git tag -d <tagname> and then recreate it on the correct commit.To sum up if your remote is called origin and you\'re working on master branch:You can also exchange line 4 to git push origin --tags to push all the changes with tags from your local changes.Basing on @stuart-golodetz, @greg-hewgill, @eedeep, @ben-hocking answers, comments below their answers and NateS comments below my answer.Alias to move one tag to a different commit.In your sample, to move commit with hash e2ea1639 do: git tagm v0.1 e2ea1639.For pushed tags, use git tagmp v0.1 e2ea1639.Both alias keeps you original date and message.
