I\'d like to get the number of commits of my git repository, a bit like SVN revision numbers.\nThe goal is to use it as a unique, incrementing build number.I currently do like that, on Unix/Cygwin/msysGit:But I feel it\'s a bit of a hack.Is there a better way to do that?\nIt would be cool if I actually didn\'t need wc or even git, so it could work on a bare Windows. Just read a file or a directory structure ...To get a commit count for a revision (HEAD, master, a commit hash):To get the commit count across all branches:I recommend against using this for build identifier, but if you must, it\'s probably best to use the count for the branch you\'re building against. That way the same revision will always have the same number. If you use the count for all branches, activity on other branches could change the number.git shortlog is one way.git rev-list HEAD --countgit rev-listgit rev-list <commit> : \nList commits that are reachable by following the parent links from the given commit (in this case, HEAD).--count : Print a number stating how many commits would have been listed, and suppress all other output.This command returns count of commits grouped by commiters:If you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a unique and still quite readable identifier for commits, git describe might be just the thing for you.You are not the first one to think about a "revision number" in Git, but \'wc\' is quite dangerous, since commit can be erased or squashed, and the history revisited.The "revision number" was especially important for Subversion since it was needed in case of merge (SVN1.5 and 1.6 have improved on that front).What you could end up with is a pre-commit hook which would include in the comment a revision number, with an algo not involving looking up the all history of a branch to determine the correct number.Bazaar actually came up with such an algo and it may be a good starting point for what you want to do.(As Bombe\'s answer points out, Git has actually an algo of its own, based on the latest tag, plus the number of commits, plus a bit of SHA1 key). You should see (and upvote) his answer if it works for you.To illustrate Aaron\'s idea, you can also append the git commit hash into an application\xe2\x80\x99s "info" file you are distributing with your application.That way, the about box would look like:The applicative number is part of the commit, but the \'application\xe2\x80\x99s "info" file\' is generating during the packaging process, effectively linking an applicative build number to a technical revision id.To get it into a variable, the easiest way is:Git shortlog is one way to get the commit details:This will give the number of commits followed by the author name. The -s option removes all the commit messages for each commit that the author made. Remove the same option if you would like to see the commit messages also. The -n option is used for sorting the entire list. Hope this helps.A bit late but a simple way is:Oneline ensures that.There\'s a nice helper script that the Git folks use to help generate a useful version number based on Git describe.  I show the script and explain it in my answer to How would you include the current commit id in a git project\xe2\x80\x99s files?  Hope that helps.git rev-parse --short HEADGenerate a number during the build and write it to a file. Whenever you make a release, commit that file with the comment "Build 147" (or whatever the build number currently is). Don\'t commit the file during normal development. This way, you can easily map between build numbers and versions in Git.If you\'re just using one branch, such as master, I think this would work great.This will only output a number. You can alias it to something liketo make things really convenient. To do so, edit your .git/config file and add this in:EDIT: This will not work on Windows. I do not know the equivalent of "wc" for that OS, but writing a python script to do the counting for you would be a multi-platform solution.In our company, we moved from svn to git. Lack of revision numbers was a big problem!Do git svn clone, and then tag last svn commit by it\'s svn revision number:Then you can get revision number with help of This command gives smth like:Means: last tag is 7603 - it\'s the svn revision. 3 - is count of commits from it. We need to add them.So, revision number can be counted by this script:The one I used to use was:Simple but it worked.Using Bash syntax,looks fine for purely linear history. If you also want to sometimes have \xe2\x80\x9cnumbers\xe2\x80\x9d from branches (based off master), consider:When run from a checkout of master, you get simply 1234.0 or the like. When run from a checkout of a branch you will get something like 1234.13, if there have been 13 commits made on that branch. Obviously this is useful only insofar as you are basing at most one branch off a given master revision.--first-parent could be added to the micro number to suppress some commits arising only from merging other branches, though it is probably unnecessary.You can try or to list all the commits done by the people contributing in the repositorygit config --global alias.count \'rev-list --all --count\'If you add this to your config, you can just reference the command;git countUse git shortlog just like thisgit shortlog -snOr create an alias (for ZSH based terminal)# show contributors by commits\nalias gcall="git shortlog -sn"\n
