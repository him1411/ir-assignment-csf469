I just started using SVN, and I have a cache directory that I don\'t need under source control. How can I ignore the whole directory/folder with SVN?I am using Versions and TextMate on OSÂ X and commandline.Set the svn:ignore property of the parent directory:If you have multiple things to ignore, separate by newlines in the property value.  In that case it\'s easier to edit the property value using an external editor:Here\'s an example directory structure:When in project you see that your cache directory is not added and shows up as such.To set the ignore property, dosvn propset svn:ignore cache .where svn:ignore is the name of the property you\'re setting, cache is the value of the property, and . is the directory you\'re setting this property on. It should be the parent directory of the cache directory that needs the property.To check what properties are set:To see the value of svn:ignore:To delete properties previously set:Important to mention:On the commandline you can\'t useThis will also add the ignored files, because the command line expands * and therefore svn add believes that you want all files to be added. Therefore use this instead:Since I spent a while trying to get this to work, it should be noted that if the files already exist in SVN, you need to svn delete them, and then edit the svn:ignore property.I know that seems obvious, but they kept showing up as ? in my svn status list, when I thought it would just ignore them locally.To expand slightly, if you\'re doing this with the svn command-line tool, you want to type:which will open your text-editor of choice, then type \'*\' to ignore everything inside it, and save+quit - this will include the directory itself in svn, but ignore all the files inside it, to ignore the directory, use the path of the parent, and then type the name of the directory in the file. After saving, run an update (\'svn up\'), and then check in the appropriate path.Set the svn:ignore property on the parent directory:This will overwrite any current value of svn:ignore. You an edit the value with:Which will open your editor. You can add multiple patterns, one per line.You can view the current value with:If you are using a GUI there should be a menu option to do this.Thanks for all the contributions above. I would just like to share some additional information from my experiences while ignoring files.When the folders are already under revision controlAfter svn import and svn co the files, what we usually do for the first time.All runtime cache, attachments folders will be under version control.\nso, before svn ps svn:ignore, we need to delete it from the repository.With SVN version 1.5 above we can use svn del --keep-local your_folder,\nbut for an earlier version, my solution is:When we need more than one folder to be ignoredsvn pe will need to edit the text file, and you can use this command if required to set your text editor using vi:The file looks something simply like this:If your directory foo is already under version control, remove it first with:...and if you want to ignore more than one directory (say build/ temp/ and *.tmp files), you could either do it in two steps (ignoring the first and edit ignore properties (see other answers here) or one could write something likeon the command line.If you are using the particular SVN client TortoiseSVN, then on commit, you have the option of right clicking items and selecting "Add to ignore list".The command to ignore multiple entries is a little tricky and involves the backward slash:This command will ignore anything named cache, tmp, null, and and_so_on in the present directory.I had problems getting nested directories to be ignored; the top directory I wanted to ignore wouldn\'t show with \'svn status\' but all the subdirs did. This is probably self-evident to everyone else, but I thought I\'d share it:EXAMPLE:/trunk/trunk/cache/trunk/cache/subdir1/trunk/cache/subdir2Bash oneliner for multiple ignores:If your project directory is named /Project, and your cache directory is named /Project/Cache, then you need to set a subversion property on /Project. The property name should be "svn:ignore" and the property value should be "Cache".Refer to this page in the Subversion manual for more on properties.Jason\'s answer will do the trick.  However, instead of setting svn:ignore to "." on the cache directory, you may want to include "cache" in the parent directory\'s svn:ignore property, in case the cache directory is not always present.  I do this on a number of "throwaway" folders."Thank-you" svn for such a hideous, bogus and difficult way to ignore files.So I wrote a script svn-ignore-all:Also, to ignore specific list of files / pathnames, we can use this variant svn-ignore.  I guess svn-ignore-all should really be like xargs svn-ignore.One more thing: I tend to pollute my svn checkouts with many random files.  When it\'s time to commit, I move those files into an \'old\' subdirectory, and tell svn to ignore \'old\'.TO KEEP DIRECTORIES THAT SVN WILL IGNORE:svn delete --keep-local path/directory_to_keep/*svn propset svn:ignore "*" path/directory_to_keepIf you are using a frontend for SVN like TortoiseSVN, or some sort of IDE integration, there should also be an ignore option in the same menu are as the commit/add operation.Set the svn:ignore property.  Most UI svn tools have a way to do this as well as the command line discussion in the link.Since you\'re using Versions it\'s actually really easy:Watch your trailing slashes too.  I found that including images/* in my ignore setting file did not ignore ./images/.  When I ran svn status -u it still showed ? images.  So, I just changed the ignore setting to just images, no slashes.  Ran a status check and that cleared it out.Solved with Eclipse in the next way:First of all, do a synchronisation of your folder to the project:team -> synchronise In the next view, team view, you can see all resources that you can commit to the SVN server.So, select the resource folder of the resource that you want to ignore, and then you can ignore it usingteam -> add to svn:ignore. After that, in the confirmation window, do select the first option: "ignore by name".For instance, If I want to ignore the target folder and their .class resources, I\'ll do synchronise, and in the synchronise view, I\'ll select the target folder. After that, I\'ll selectteam->addto svn:ignore and then I\'ll confirm the first option in the confirm window.After losing a lot of time looking for how to do this simple activity, I decided to post it was not hard to find a decent explanation.First let the sample structure$ svn st\n? project/trunk/target\n? project/trunk/myfile.x1 \xe2\x80\x93 first configure the editor,in mycase vim\nexport SVN_EDITOR=vim2 \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9csvn propedit svn:ignore project/trunk/\xe2\x80\x9d will open a new file and you can add your files and subdirectory in us case type \xe2\x80\x9ctarget\xe2\x80\x9d save and close file and works$ svn st\n? project/trunk/myfile.xthanks.
