What is the difference between the dot (.) and the dollar sign ($)?. As I understand it, they are both syntactic sugar for not needing to use parentheses.The $ operator is for avoiding parentheses.  Anything appearing after it will take precedence over anything that comes before.For example, let\'s say you\'ve got a line that reads:If you want to get rid of those parentheses, any of the following lines would also do the same thing:The primary purpose of the . operator is not to avoid parentheses, but to chain functions. It lets you tie the output of whatever appears on the right to the input of whatever appears on the left.  This usually also results in fewer parentheses, but works differently.Going back to the same example:You can chain show to putStrLn like this:If that\'s too many parentheses for your liking, get rid of them with the $ operator:They have different types and different definitions:($) is intended to replace normal function application but at a different precedence to help avoid parentheses. (.) is for composing two functions together to make a new function.In some cases they are interchangeable, but this is not true in general. The typical example where they are is:==>In other words in a chain of $s, all but the final one can be replaced by .Also note that ($) is the identity function specialised to function types. The identity function looks like this:While ($) looks like this:Note that I\'ve intentionally added extra parentheses in the type signature.Uses of ($) can usually be eliminated by adding parenthesis (unless the operator is used in a section). E.g.: f $ g x becomes f (g x). Uses of (.) are often slightly harder to replace; they usually need a lambda or the introduction of an explicit function parameter. For example:becomesbecomesHope this helps!($) allows functions to be chained together without adding parentheses to control evaluation order:The compose operator (.) creates a new function without specifying the arguments:The example above is arguably illustrative, but doesn\'t really show the convenience of using composition.  Here\'s another analogy:If we only use third once, we can avoid naming it by using a lambda:Finally, composition lets us avoid the lambda:The short and sweet version:One application that is useful and took me some time to figure out from the very short description at learn you a haskell: Since:and parenthesizing the right hand side of an expression containing an infix operator converts it to a prefix function, one can write ($ 3) (4+) analogous to (++", world") "hello".Why would anyone do this? For lists of functions, for example. Both:and:are shorter than map (\\x -> x ++ ", world") ... or map (\\f -> f 3) .... Obviously, the latter variants would be more readable for most people.... or you could avoid the . and $ constructions by using pipelining:That\'s after you\'ve added in the helper function:A great way to learn more about anything (any function) is to remember that everything is a function! That general mantra helps, but in specific cases like operators, it helps to remember this little trick:andJust remember to use :t liberally, and wrap your operators in ()!My rule is simple (I\'m beginner too): That is but never:I think a short example of where you would use . and not $ would help clarify things.Note that times6 is a function that is created from function composition.
