This question already has an answer here:Can anyone help out me in getting the URL of the current working page of ASP.NET in C#?Try this :You may at times need to get different values from URL.Below example shows different ways of extracting different parts of URLEXAMPLE: (Sample URL)http://localhost:60527/WebSite1test/Default2.aspx?QueryString1=1&QueryString2=2CODEOUTPUTYou can copy paste above sample code & run it in asp.net web form application with different URL.I also recommend reading ASP.Net Routing in case you may use ASP Routing then you don\'t need to use traditional URL with query string.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc668201%28v=vs.100%29.aspxJust sharing as this was my solution thanks to Canavar\'s post.If you have something like this:or like this:and you only want the part that a user would type in then this will work:which would result in these:if you just want the part between http:// and the first slash  would return stackoverflow.com if called from this pageHere\'s the complete breakdownthe request.rawurl will gives the content of current page \nit gives the exact path that you requireduse HttpContext.Current.Request.RawUrlIf you want to get from then use:a tip for people who needs the path/url in global.asax file;If you need to run this in global.asax > Application_Start and you app pool mode is integrated then you will receive the error below:Request is not available in this context exception in\n  Application_Start.In that case you need to use this:System.Web.HttpRuntime.AppDomainAppVirtualPathHope will help others..A search landed me at this page, but it wasn\'t quite what I was looking for. Posting here in case someone else looking for what I was lands at this page too.There is two ways to do it if you only have a string value..NET way:Same as @Canavar, but you can instantiate a new Uri Objectwhich means you can use the same methods, e.g.Regex way:Getting parts of a URL (Regex)I guess its enough to return absolute path..using System.IO;
