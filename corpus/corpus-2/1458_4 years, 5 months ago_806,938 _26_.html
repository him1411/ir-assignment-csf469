I want to do a condition in an AngularJS template. I fetch a video list from the Youtube API. Some of the videos are in 16:9 ratio and some are in 4:3 ratio.I want to make a condition like this:I\'m iterating the videos using ng-repeat. Have no idea what should I do for this condition:Angularjs (versions below 1.1.5) does not provide the if/else functionality . Following are a few options to consider for what you want to achieve:(Jump to the update below (#5) if you are using version 1.1.5 or greater)As suggested by @Kirk in the comments, the cleanest way of doing this would be to use a ternary operator as follows:can be used something like the following.Alternatively, you might also use ng-show/ng-hide but using this will actually render both a large video and a small video element and then hide the one that meets the ng-hide condition and shows the one that meets ng-show condition. So on each page you\'ll actually be rendering two different elements.This can be used as follows.The above basically will add a large-video css class to the div element if video.large is truthy.In the versions above 1.1.5 you can use the ng-if directive. This would remove the element if the expression provided returns false and re-inserts the element in the DOM if the expression returns true. Can be used as follows.In the latest version of Angular (as of 1.1.5), they have included a conditional directive called ngIf.  It is different from ngShow and ngHide in that the elements aren\'t hidden, but not included in the DOM at all.  They are very useful for components which are costly to create but aren\'t used:Ternary is the most clear way of doing this.Angular itself doesn\'t provide if/else functionality, but you can get it by including this module:https://github.com/zachsnow/ng-elifIn its own words, it\'s just "a simple collection of control flow directives: ng-if, ng-else-if, and ng-else."  It\'s easy and intuitive to use. Example:You could use your video.yt$aspectRatio property directly by passing it through a filter, and binding the result to the height attribute in your template.Your filter would look something like:And the template would be:In this case you want to "calculate" a pixel value depending of an object property.I would define a function in the controller that calculates the pixel values.In the controller:Then in your template you just write:I agree that a ternary is extremely clean.   Seems that it is very situational though as somethings I need to display div or p or table , so with a table I don\'t prefer a ternary for obvious reasons.  Making a call to a function is typically ideal or in my case I did this:you can use the ng-if directive as above.
