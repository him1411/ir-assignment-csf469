Searching for the ~ character isn\'t easy. I was looking over some CSS and found thisWhat does it mean?The ~ selector is in fact the General sibling combinator:The general sibling combinator is made of the "tilde" (U+007E, ~)\n  character that separates two sequences of simple selectors. The\n  elements represented by the two sequences share the same parent in the\n  document tree and the element represented by the first sequence\n  precedes (not necessarily immediately) the element represented by the\n  second one.Consider the following example:.a ~ .b matches the 4th and 5th list item because they:Likewise, .check:checked ~ .content matches all .content elements that are siblings of .check:checked and appear after it.General sibling combinatorThe general sibling combinator selector is very similar to the adjacent sibling combinator selector. The difference is that the element being selected doesn\'t need to immediately succeed the first element, but can appear anywhere after it. More infoGood to also check the other combinators in the family and to get back to what is this specific one.Example checklist: The one we are looking at here is General Sibling SelectorIt is General sibling combinator and is explained in @Salaman\'s answer very well.What I did miss is Adjacent sibling combinator which is + and is closely related to ~.example would be In example above it will mark 2nd li but not 4th.JSFiddle
