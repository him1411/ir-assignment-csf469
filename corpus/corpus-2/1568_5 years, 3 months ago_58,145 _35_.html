I assume the title is self explanatory. Just want to change the look of the Visual Studio 2012 not to show  menu title in all capital letters.Richard Banks posted about a registry key for just such a tweak.In PowerShell, you can run this to set that registry key and the uppercase goes away.The above registry key is not the one that will affect Visual Studio Express 2012 RC. A comment by FormatC showed up on Banks post about the key for Express. You can find that key mentioned in Mike Gleason\'s answer or run the following PowerShell command to set it.Replace 11.0 with 12.0 in the registry keys above.Replace 11.0 with 14.0 in the registry keys above.I have written an extension which will do this for you.You can download it from the Visual Studio Gallery:It can also hide main menu altogether and have it appear only on mouse over or alt key press (like in IE)\n\nAfter years Microsoft has changed their mind on this feature. As of Visual Studio 2013 Update 3 RC, an option has been added to change between mixed case and upper case: Tools -> Options -> Environment -> General -> Turn off upper case in the menu bar\nObviously this is not for VS 2012 but going forward this option will be there.Here is the notification from Brian Harry of Microsoft:Mixed Case Menus \xe2\x80\x93 I know I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get some feedback on this one :)  This is a long standing request by a vocal portion of the VS user base since VS 2012 to change the \xe2\x80\x9cALL CAPS\xe2\x80\x9d menus.  In VS 2013 Update 3, we have added a Tools \xe2\x80\x93> Options setting to control whether you see ALL CAPS or Mixed Case.  The default is still ALL CAPS but, if you change it, it will persist across upgrades and will roam across your IDE instances using the VS Online roaming settings feature (if you log into VS so it knows who you are).And forVisual Studio Express 2012 for Windows DesktopI guess the reason MS omitted any mention of Visual Studio from the keyname is that such a mention might help someone identify the key :)The VS Commands extension can do this and is one of the most popular on the gallery.
