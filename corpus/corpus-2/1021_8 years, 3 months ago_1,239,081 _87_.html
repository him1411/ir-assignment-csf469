I have a URL with some GET parameters as follows:I need to get the whole value of c. I tried to read the URL, but I got only m2. How do I do this using JavaScript?JavaScript itself has nothing built in for handling query string parameters. In a (modern) browser you can use the (experimental at time of writing) URL object;For older browsers, you can use the code from the original version of this answer that predates URL.You could access location.search, which would give you from the ? character on to the end of the URL or the start of the fragment identifier (#foo), whichever comes first.Then you can parse it with this:You can get the query string from the URL of the current page with:Most implementations I\'ve seen miss out URL-decoding the names and the values.Here\'s a general utility function that also does proper URL-decoding:sourceTHIS IS AN EASY WAY TO CHECK JUST ONE PARAMETER:Example URL:Example Javascript:if "myParam" exists in the URL... variable myParam will contain "2", otherwise it will be undefined.Maybe you want a default value, in that case:(UPDATE) THIS WORKS BETTER:And it works right even when URL is full of parameters.You can get the query string in location.search, then you can split everything after the question mark:I found this ages ago, very easy:Then call it like this:Browsers vendors have implemented a native way to do this via URL and URLSearchParams.Currently supported in Firefox, Opera, Safari and Chrome. With the hope of Edge support coming soon. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/URLhttps://url.spec.whatwg.org/Eric Bidelman, an engineer at Google, recommends using this polyfill for unsupported browsers.Here is a recursive solution that has no regex, and has minimal mutation (only the params object is mutated, which I believe is unavoidable in JS).It\'s awesome because it:Code:I wrote a more simple and elegant solution.See thisECMAScript 6 solution:I useI use the parseUri library. It allows you to do exactly what you are asking for:I made a function that does this:Update 5/26/2017, here is an ES7 implementation (runs with babel preset stage 0, 1, 2, or 3):Some tests:For Single Parameter Value like this index.html?msg=1 use following code,For All Parameter Value use following Code,this question has too many answers, so i\'m adding another one.usage:this copes with empty parameters (those keys present without "=value"), exposure of both a scalar and array-based value retrieval API, as well as proper URI component decoding.Or if you don\'t want to reinvent the URI parsing wheel use URI.jsTo get the value of a parameter named foo:What that does is Here\'s a fiddle for this.... http://jsfiddle.net/m6tett01/12/Here is my solution. As advised by Andy E while answering this question, it\'s not good for your script\'s performance if it\'s repeatedly building various regex strings, running loops etc just to get a single value. So, I\'ve come up with a simpler script that returns all the get parameters in an object. You can call it just once, assign the result to a variable and get any value you want using the appropriate key. Note that it also takes care of URI decoding (i.e things like %20) and replaces + with a space:So, here are two tests of the script for you to see:Got from here: http://jquery-howto.blogspot.ru/2009/09/get-url-parameters-values-with-jquery.htmlHere I am posting one example. But it\'s in jQuery. Hope it will help others:Simple waythen call it like getParams(url)Yet another suggestion. There are some good answers already, but I found them needlessly complex and hard to understand. This is short, simple, and returns a simple associative array with key names corresponding to the token names in the URL. I added a version with comments below for those who want to learn.Note this relies on jQuery ($.each) for its loop, which I recommend instead of forEach. I find it simpler to ensure cross-browser compatibility using jQuery across the board rather than plugging in individual fixes to support whichever new functions aren\'t supported in older browsers.Edit: After I wrote this I noticed Eric Elliott\'s answer, which is almost the same, though it uses forEach, while I\'m generally against (for reasons stated above).Commented version: For the examples below we\'ll assume this address:You can assign the URL tokens to your own variable:Then refer to each URL token by name like this:This would print "4".You can also simply refer to a a token name from the function directly:...which would print "murray".Here is the angularJs source code for parsing url query parameters into an Object :You can add this function to window.location:I had the need to read a URL GET variable and complete an action based on the url parameter. I searched high and low for a solution and came across this little piece of code. It basically reads the current page url, perform some regular expression on the URL then saves the url parameters in an associative array, which we can easily access.So as an example if we had the following url with the javascript at the bottom in place.All we\xe2\x80\x99d need to do to get the parameters id and page are to call this:The Code will be:then disregard the first indexreturns an array of your url parametersA bit more verbose/hacky but also functional, paramObject contains all parameters mapped as a js objectThis should work for your case no matter the param is last or not.We can get the c parameter values in a simpler way without looping all the parameters, see the below jQuery to get the parameters.1. To Get the Parameter value:(or)returns as a string"m2-m3-m4-m5"2. To Replace the parameter value:You can add an input box and then ask the user to copy the value into it...it\'s really easy that way:Ok, seriously though...I found this code and it seems to work good:http://www.developerdrive.com/2013/08/turning-the-querystring-into-a-json-object-using-javascript/Here is what I do:
