How do I remove empty elements from an array in JavaScript? Is there a straightforward way, or do I need to loop through it and remove them manually?I use this method, extending the native Array prototype:Or you can simply push the existing elements into other array:or - (only for single array items of type "text")or - Classic way: simple iterationAnother method that removes the "falsey" values of empty string "", 0 and undefinedIf you need to remove ALL empty values ("", null, undefined and 0): To remove empty values and Line breaks:Example:Return:UPDATE (based on Alnitak\'s comment)In some situations you may want to keep "0" in the array and remove anything else (null, undefined and ""), this is one way:arr.filter(function(e){ return e === 0 || e }); Return:Simply one liner:or using underscorejs.org:If you\'ve got Javascript 1.6 or later you can use Array.filter using a trivial return true callback function, e.g.:since .filter automatically skips missing elements in the original array.The MDN page linked above also contains a nice error-checking version of filter that can be used in JavaScript interpreters that don\'t support the official version.Note that this will not remove null entries nor entries with an explicit undefined value, but the OP specifically requested "missing" entries.The clean way to do it.With Underscore/Lodash:General use case:With empties:See lodash documentation for without.If using a library is an option I know underscore.js has a function called compact() http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/ it also has several other useful functions related to arrays and collections.Here is an excerpt from their documentation:_.compact(array)  Returns a copy of the array with all falsy values removed. In JavaScript, false, null, 0, "", undefined and NaN are all falsy._.compact([0, 1, false, 2, \'\', 3]);=> [1, 2, 3]Since nobody else mentioned it and most people have underscore included in their project you can also use _.without(array, *values);. Simple ES6@AlnitakActually Array.filter works on all browsers if you add some extra code. See below.This is the code you need to add for IE, but filter and Functional programmingis worth is imo.You may find it easier to loop over your array and build a new array out of the items you want to keep from the array than by trying to loop and splice as has been suggested, since modifying the length of the array while it is being looped over can introduce problems.You could do something like this:Actually here is a more generic solution:You get the idea - you could then have other types of filter functions. Probably more than you need, but I was feeling generous... ;)What about this(ES6) : To remove Falsy value from an array.What about that:I\'m simply adding my voice to the above \xe2\x80\x9ccall ES5\'s Array..filter() with a global constructor\xe2\x80\x9d golf-hack, but I suggest using Object instead of String, Boolean, or Number as suggested above.Specifically, ES5\'s filter() already doesn\'t trigger for undefined elements within the array; so a function that universally returns true, which returns all elements filter() hits, will necessarily only return non-undefined elements:However, writing out ...(function(){return true;}) is longer than writing ...(Object); and the return-value of the Object constructor will be, under any circumstances, some sort of object. Unlike the primitive-boxing-constructors suggested above, no possible object-value is falsey, and thus in a boolean setting, Object is a short-hand for function(){return true}.When using the highest voted answer above, first example, i was getting individual characters for string lengths greater than 1. Below is my solution for that problem.Instead of not returning if undefined, we return if length is greater than 0. Hope that helps somebody out there.Returns[1,2,3]This works, I tested it in AppJet (you can copy-paste the code on its IDE and press "reload" to see it work, don\'t need to create an account)Another way to do it is to take advantage of the length property of the array : pack the non-null items on the \'left\' of the array, then reduce the length. \nIt is an in-place algorithm -does not allocates memory, too bad for the garbage collector-, and it has very good best/average/worst case behaviour.This solution, compared to others here, is between 2 to 50 times faster on Chrome, and 5 to 50 times faster on Firefox, as you might see here : http://jsperf.com/remove-null-items-from-arrayThe code below adds the non-enumerable \'removeNull\' method to the Array, which returns \'this\' for daisy-chaining : Filtering out invalid entries with a regular expressionreturns\'Misusing\' the for ... in (object-member) loop.\n  => Only truthy values appear in the body of the loop.How about doing it this way \nThis might help you : https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.4#removeHere is an example using variadic behavior & ES2015 fat arrow expression:The best way to remove empty elements, is to use Array.prototype.filter(), as already mentioned in other answers.Unfortunately, Array.prototype.filter() is not supported by IE<9. If you still need to support IE8 or an even older version of IE, you could use the following polyfill to add support for Array.prototype.filter() in these browsers :If anyone is looking for cleaning the whole Array or Object this might help.Output:Removes anything that is null, undefined, "", " ", empty object or empty arrayjsfiddle hereThis one will only remove empty values and not falsey ones, which I think is more desirable.There is an option to also remove null values.This method should be much faster than using splice.I needed to do this same task and came upon this thread. I ended up using the array "join" to create a string using a "_" separator, then doing a bit of regex to:-...then using array "split" to make a cleaned-up array:-...or in 1 line of code:-...or, extending the Array object :-Nice ... very nice \nWe can also replace all array values like this
