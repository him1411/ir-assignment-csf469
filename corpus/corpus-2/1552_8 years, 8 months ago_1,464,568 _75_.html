Which PHP function can return the current date/time?The time would go by your server time. An easy workaround for this is to manually set the timezone by using date_default_timezone_set before the date() or time() functions are called to.I\'m in Melbourne, Australia so I have something like this:Or another example is LA - US:You can also see what timezone the server is currently in via:So something like:So the short answer for your question would be:Then all the times would be to the timezone you just set :)For a time-zone reference, see List of Supported Timezones.Since PHP 5.2.0 you can do it using OOP and DateTime() as well (of course if you prefer OOP):And to specify the timezone:Reference: Here\'s a linkThis can be more reliable than simply adding or subtracting the number of seconds in a day or a month to a timestamp because of daylight saving time.The PHP codeYou can either use the $_SERVER[\'REQUEST_TIME\'] variable (available since PHP 5.1.0) or the time() function to get the current Unix timestamp.PHP\'s time() returns a current unix timestamp. With this, you can use the date() function to format it to your needs.As Paolo mentioned in the comments, the second argument is redundant. The following snippet is equivalent to the one above:PHP\'s date function can do this job date()Description :Returns a string formatted according to the given format string using the given integer timestamp or the current time if no timestamp is given.Examples :You can use both the  $_SERVER[\'REQUEST_TIME\'] variable or the **time()**function.  Both of these return a Unix timestamp.  Most of the time these two solutions will yield the exact same Unix Timestamp.  The difference between these is that $_SERVER[\'REQUEST_TIME\'] returns the time stamp of the most recent server request and time() returns the current time.  This may create minor differences in accuracy depending on your application, but for most cases both of these solutions should suffice.Based on your example code above, you are going to want to format this information once you obtain the Unix Timestamp.   An unformatted Unix timestamp looks like this...Unix Timestamp:  1232659628So in order to get something that will work, you can use the date() function to format it.A good reference for ways to use the date() function is located in the PHP Manual Pages, here...http://us.php.net/dateAs an example, the following code returns a date that looks like this - 01/22/2009 04:35:00 pmUpdateFor the date format, PHP date() Function is useful.works, but how also to know if it\'s EST, PST?According to the article How to Get Current Datetime (NOW) with PHP, there are two common ways to get the current date. To get current datetime (now) with PHP, you can use the date class with any PHP version, or better the datetime class with PHP >= 5.2.Various date format expressions are available here.This expression will return NOW in format Y-m-d H:i:s.This expression will return NOW in format Y-m-d H:i:s.You can use this format alsoorits very simpleecho $date = date(\'Y-m-d H:i:s\');This code will get the date and time of the server that the code runs on.Prints like this Sunday, December 9th, 2012 If you want a different timescale, please use:Set your time zone:Then call the date functionsDate Function returns a string formatted according to the given format string using the given integer timestamp or the current time if no timestamp is given. In other words, timestamp is optional and defaults to the value of time().And the parameters are -format - Required. Specifies the format of the timestamptimestamp - (Optional) Specifies a timestamp. Default is the current date and timeThe required format parameter of the date() function specifies how to format the date (or time).Here are some characters that are commonly used for dates:Other characters, like "/", ".", or "-" can also be inserted between the characters to add additional formatting.The example below formats today\'s date in three different ways:I found that the simplest way of getting the current time in PHP is something like this.Another simple way to take timestamp of current date and time use mktime() functionthen you can convert this to another date format:more date formats here:\nhttp://php.net/manual/en/function.date.phpDate Format depends too : You can use this code.If you are Bangladeshi.
