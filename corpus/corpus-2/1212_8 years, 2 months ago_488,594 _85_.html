What is the main purpose of using CROSS APPLY?I have read (vaguely, through posts on the Internet) that cross apply can be more efficient when selecting over large data sets if you are partitioning. (Paging comes to mind)I also know that CROSS APPLY doesn\'t require a UDF as the right-table.In most INNER JOIN queries (one-to-many relationships), I could rewrite them to use CROSS APPLY, but they always give me equivalent execution plans. Can anyone give me a good example of when CROSS APPLY makes a difference in those cases where INNER JOIN will work as well?Edit:Here\'s a trivial example, where the execution plans are exactly the same.  (Show me one where they differ and where cross apply is faster/more efficient)Can anyone give me a good example of when CROSS APPLY makes a difference in those cases where INNER JOIN will work as well?See the article in my blog for detailed performance comparison:CROSS APPLY works better on things that have no simple JOIN condition.This one selects 3 last records from t2 for each record from t1:It cannot be easily formulated with an INNER JOIN condition.You could probably do something like that using CTE\'s and window function:, but this is less readable and probably less efficient.Update:Just checked.master is a table of about 20,000,000 records with a PRIMARY KEY on id.This query:runs for almost 30 seconds, while this one:is instant.cross apply sometimes enables you to do things that you cannot do with inner join.Example (a syntax error):This is a syntax error, because, when used with inner join, table functions can only take variables or constants as parameters. (I.e., the table function parameter cannot depend on another table\'s column.) However:This is legal.Edit:\nOr alternatively, shorter syntax: (by ErikE)Edit:Note:\nInformix 12.10 xC2+ has Lateral Derived Tables and Postgresql (9.3+) has Lateral Subqueries which can be used to a similar effect.Consider you have two tables.MASTER TABLEDETAILS TABLEThere are many situations where we need to replace INNER JOIN with CROSS APPLY. 1. Join two tables based on TOP n resultsConsider if we need to select Id and Name from Master and last two dates for each Id from Details table.The above query generates the following result.See, it generated results for last two dates with last two date\'s Id and then joined these records only in the outer query on Id, which is wrong. To accomplish this, we need to use CROSS APPLY.and forms the following result.Here\'s how it works. The query inside CROSS APPLY can reference the outer table, where INNER JOIN cannot do this (it throws compile error). When finding the last two dates, joining is done inside CROSS APPLY i.e., WHERE M.ID=D.ID. 2. When we need INNER JOIN functionality using functions.CROSS APPLY can be used as a replacement with INNER JOIN when we need to get result from Master table and a function.And here is the functionwhich generated the following resultADDITIONAL ADVANTAGE OF CROSS APPLY APPLY can be used as a replacement for UNPIVOT. Either CROSS APPLY or OUTER APPLY can be used here, which are interchangeable.Consider you have the below table(named MYTABLE).The query is below.which brings you the resulthere is an example when CROSS APPLY makes a huge difference with performance:Using CROSS APPLY to optimize joins on BETWEEN conditionsNote that besides replacing inner joins you can also reuse code such as truncating dates without paying performance penalty for involing scalar UDFs, for example: Calculating third Wednesday of the month with inline UDFsIt seems to me that CROSS APPLY can fill a certain gap when working with calculated fields in complex/nested queries, and make them simpler and more readable.Simple example: you have a DoB and you want to present multiple age-related fields that will also rely on other data sources (such as employment), like Age, AgeGroup, AgeAtHiring, MinimumRetirementDate, etc. for use in your end-user application (Excel PivotTables, for example).Options are limited and rarely elegant:JOIN subqueries cannot introduce new values in the dataset based on data in the parent query (it must stand on its own).UDFs are neat, but slow as they tend to prevent parallel operations. And being a separate entity can be a good (less code) or a bad (where is the code) thing.Junction tables. Sometimes they can work, but soon enough you\'re joining subqueries with tons of UNIONs. Big mess.Create yet another single-purpose view, assuming your calculations don\'t require data obtained mid-way through your main query.Intermediary tables. Yes... that usually works, and often a good option as they can be indexed and fast, but performance can also drop due to to UPDATE statements not being parallel and not allowing to cascade formulas (reuse results) to update several fields within the same statement. And sometimes you\'d just prefer to do things in one pass.Nesting queries. Yes at any point you can put parenthesis on your entire query and use it as a subquery upon which you can manipulate source data and calculated fields alike. But you can only do this so much before it gets ugly. Very ugly.Repeating code. What is the greatest value of 3 long (CASE...ELSE...END) statements? That\'s gonna be readable!Did I miss something? Probably, so feel free to comment. But hey, CROSS APPLY is like a godsend in such situations: you just add a simple CROSS APPLY (select tbl.value + 1 as someFormula) as crossTbl and voil\xc3\xa0! Your new field is now ready for use practically like it had always been there in your source data.Values introduced through CROSS APPLY can...Dang, there\'s nothing they can\'t do!Cross apply works well with an XML field as well.  If you wish to select node values in combination with other fields.For example, if you have a table containing some xmlUsing the queryWill return a result I guess it should be readability ;)CROSS APPLY will be somewhat unique for people reading to tell them that a UDF is being used which will be applied to each row from the table on the left.Ofcourse, there are other limitations where a CROSS APPLY is better used than JOIN which other friends have posted above.Well I am not sure if this qualifies as a reason to use Cross Apply versus Inner Join, but this query was answered for me in a Forum Post using Cross Apply, so I am not sure if there is an equalivent method using Inner Join:AS\nBEGINENDCross apply can be used to replace subquery\'s where you need a column of the subquery subqueryhere i won\'t be able to select the columns of company table\nso, using cross applyHere is an article that explains it all, with their performance difference and usage over JOINS.SQL Server CROSS APPLY and OUTER APPLY over JOINSAs suggested in this article, there is no performance difference between them for normal join operations (INNER AND CROSS).The usage difference arrives when you have to do a query like this:That is, when you have to relate with function. This cannot be done using INNER JOIN, which would give you the error "The multi-part identifier "D.DepartmentID" could not be bound." Here the value is passed to the function as each row is read. Sounds cool to me. :)This is perhaps an old question, but I still love the power of CROSS APPLY to simplify the re-use of logic and to provide a "chaining" mechanism for results.I\'ve provided a SQL Fiddle below which shows a simple example of how you can use CROSS APPLY to perform complex logical operations on your data set without things getting at all messy.  It\'s not hard to extrapolate from here more complex calculations.http://sqlfiddle.com/#!3/23862/2
