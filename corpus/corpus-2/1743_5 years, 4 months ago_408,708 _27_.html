Which is shortcut to exit scale mode in Oracle VirtualBox Windows 7 host?To exit scale mode Right Ctrl (Host Key) + CIf Right Ctrl (Host Key) + C does not work (there have been some issues on Ubuntu), do the following:1) File > Preferences > Input on the Virtual Machine which is stuck in Scale Mode2) Change or Reset the Host Key. There\'s no need to even save after changing the settings3) Re-open the Virtual Machine and it should be reset!Steps:Tip:I arrived at this page looking to turn off scale mode for good, so I figured I would share what I found:Running this in my host\'s terminal worked like a charm for me.Source: https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=47821Yeah it suck to get stuck in Scale View.Host+Home will popup the Virtual machine settings. (by default Host is Right Control)From there you can change the view settings, as the Menu bar is hidden in Scale View.Had the same issue, especially when you checked the box not to show the \'Switch to Scale view\' dialog.This you can do while the VM is running.I was having the similar issue when using VirtualBox on Ubuntu 12.04LTS. Now if anyone is using or has ever used Ubuntu, you might be aware that how things are hard sometimes when using shortcut keys in Ubuntu. For me, when i was trying to revert back the Host key, it was just not happening and the shortcut keys won\'t just work. I even tried the command line option to revert back the scale mode and it won\'t work either. Finally i found the following when all the other options fails:Fix the Scale Mode Issue in Oracle VirtualBox in Ubuntu using the following steps:Find your machine config files (i.e. /home/<username>/VirtualBox VMs/ANKSVM) where ANKSVM is your VM Name and edit and change the following\nin ANKSVM.vbox and ANKSVM.vbox-prev files:Edit the line: <ExtraDataItem name="GUI/Scale" value="on"/> \nto\n<ExtraDataItem name="GUI/Scale" value="off"/>Restart VirtualBoxYou are done.This works every time specially when all other options fails like how it happened for me.Another solution (poor one do) is exiting VM Box with saving desktop (top option), restart would bring back the screen as it was before the rescale.as @MikeMiller pointed out, To exit scale mode: Right Ctrl (Host Key) + C \nbut for users who DON\'T have a Right Ctrl (Host Key) \n(such as MS Surface Pro users: we only have a Left Ctrl key), u need to go into Virtualbox>>File>>Preferences>>Input>>VirtualMachine tab>>change Host key Combination to one that works for ya(I used Ctrl+Shift+Alt which doesn\'t seem to be in use already)In MacOS Command + C is Useful for Minimizing the Full Screen
