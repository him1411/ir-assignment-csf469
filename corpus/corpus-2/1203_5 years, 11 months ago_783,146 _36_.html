I have recently started studying Python, but I couldn\'t find how to implement multi-line comments. Most languages have block comment symbols like I tried this in Python, but it throws an error, so this probably is not the correct way. Does Python actually have a multiline comment feature?You can use triple-quoted strings. When they\'re not a docstring (first thing in a class/function/module), they are ignored.Guido van Rossum (creator of Python) tweeted this as a "pro tip".However, Python\'s style guide, PEP8, favors using consecutive single-line comments, and this is also what you\'ll find in many projects. Editors usually have a shortcut to do this easily.Python does have a multiline string/comment syntax in the sense that unless used as docstrings, multiline strings generate no bytecode -- just like #-prepended comments. In effect, it acts exactly like a comment. On the other hand, if you say this behavior must be documented in the official\ndocs to be a true comment syntax, then yes, you would be right to say it is not\nguaranteed as part of the language specification.In any case your editor should also be able to easily comment-out a selected\nregion (by placing a # in front of each line individually). If not, switch to\nan editor that does.Programming in Python without certain text editing features can be a painful\nexperience. Finding the right editor (and knowing how to use it) can make a big\ndifference in how the Python programming experience is perceived.Not only should the editor be able to comment-out selected regions, it should\nalso be able to shift blocks of code to the left and right easily, and should\nautomatically place the cursor at the current indentation level when you press\nEnter. Code folding can also be useful.To protect against link decay, here is the content of Guido van Rossum\'s tweet:@BSUCSClub Python tip: You can use multi-line strings as multi-line comments. Unless used as docstrings, they generate no code! :-)In Python 2.7 the multiline comment is:In case you are inside a class you should tab it properly.For example:I hope it helps!AFAIK, Python doesn\'t have block comments. For commenting individual lines, you can use the # character.If you are using Notepad++, there is a shortcut for block commenting. I\'m sure others like gVim and Emacs have similar features.From the accepted answer...You can use triple-quoted strings. When they\'re not a docstring (first thing in a class/function/module), they are ignored.This is simply not true. Unlike comments, triple-quoted strings are still parsed and must be syntactically valid, regardless of where they appear in the source code.If you try to run this code...You\'ll get either......on Python 2.x or......on Python 3.x.The only way to do multi-line comments which are ignored by the parser is...I think it doesn\'t, except that a multiline string isn\'t processed. However, most, if not all Python IDEs have a shortkey for \'commenting out\' multiple lines of code.On Python 2.7.13 :Single:Multiline:\'\'\'\nComment what you want here\n\'\'\'Well you can try thiswhatever enclosed between """ will be commented.If you are looking for single line comment then its #Hope it helped.Happy coding.
