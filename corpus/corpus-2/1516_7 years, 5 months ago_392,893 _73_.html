I am having trouble applying a style that is !important. I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried:This does nothing; no width style whatsoever is applied. Is there a jQuery-ish way of applying such a style without having to overwrite cssText (which would mean I\xe2\x80\x99d need to parse it first, etc.)?Edit: I should add that I have a stylesheet with an !important style that I am trying to override with an !important style inline, so using .width() and the like does not work since it gets overridden by my external !important style.Also, the value that will override the previous value is computed, so I cannot simply create another external style.I think I\'ve found a real solution. I\'ve made it into a new function:jQuery.style(name, value, priority);You can use it to get values with .style(\'name\') just like .css(\'name\'), get the CSSStyleDeclaration with .style(), and also set values - with the ability to specify the priority as \'important\'. See this.Here\'s the output:See this for examples of how to read and set the CSS values. My issue was that I had already set !important for the width in my CSS to avoid conflicts with other theme CSS, but any changes I made to the width in jQuery would be unaffected since they would be added to the style attribute.For setting with the priority using the setProperty function, This Article says there is support for IE 9+ and all other browsers. I have tried with IE 8 and it has failed, which is why I built support for it in my functions (see above). It will work on all other browsers using setProperty, but it will need my custom code to work in < IE 9.The problem is caused by jQuery not understanding the !important attribute, and as such fails to apply the rule.You might be able to work around that problem, and apply the rule by referring to it, via addClass():Or by using attr():The latter approach would unset any previously set in-line style rules, though. So use with care.Of course, there\'s a good argument that @Nick Craver\'s method is easier/wiser.The above, attr() approach modified slightly to preserve the original style string/properties:You can set the width directly using .width() like this:Updated for comments:\nYou have this option as well, but it\'ll replace all css on the element, so not sure it\'s any more viable:David Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s answer describes a way to use $(\'#elem\').attr(\'style\', \xe2\x80\xa6), but warns that using it will delete previously-set styles in the style attribute. Here is a way of using attr() without that problem:As a function:Here is a JS Bin demo.After reading other answers and experimenting, this is what works for me:This doesn\'t work in IE 8 and under, though.You can do this:Using "cssText" as the property name and whatever you want added to the css as it\'s value.You can achieve this in two ways:Kinda late but here is what I did after encountering this problem...\nThere\'s no need to go to the complexity of @AramKocharyan\'s answer, nor the need to insert any style tags dynamically.Just overwrite style, but you don\'t have to parse anything, why would you?\nCan\'t use removeProperty() because it wont remove !important rules in Chrome.\nCan\'t use element.style[property] = \'\' because it only accepts camelCase in FireFox.\nYou could probably make this shorter with jQuery, but this vanilla function will run on modern browsers, IE8 etcIf it is not so relevant and since you\'re dealing with one element which is #elem, you can change its id to something else and style it as you wish...and in your css:hope this helps,\nSinan.This solution doesn\'t override any of the previous styles, it just applies the one you need:Instead of using the css() function try the addClass() function:The easiest and best solution for this problem from me was to simply use addClass() instead of .css() or .attr().  For example:$(\'#elem\').addClass(\'importantClass\');And in your css file:We need first remove previous style. I remove using a regular.\nI send you a example for change color,...An alternative way to append style in headthis appends style after all your css files so it will have higher priority than other css files and will be appliedMay be look\'s like this:cacheset cssremove cssFYI, it doesn\'t work because jQuery doesn\'t support it. There was a ticket filed on 2012 (#11173 $(elem).css("property", "value !important") fails) that was eventually closed as WONTFIX.Why not just doing like this:I would assume you tried it without adding important?\ninline css (which is how js adds styling) overrides stylesheet css.\nI\'m pretty sure that\'s the case even when the stylesheet css rule has !important.Another question (maybe a stupid question but must be asked.):  is the element you are trying to work on, is it display:block; or display:inline-block;  ?not knowing your expertise in CSS..   inline elements don\'t always behave as you would expect.  It may or may not be appropriate for your situation but you can use CSS selectors for a lot of these type of situations. If, for example you wanted of the 3rd and 6th instances of .cssText to have a different width you could write:Or:I also discovered that certain elements or add-on\'s (like Bootstrap) have some special class cases where they do not play well with !important or other work-arounds like .addClass/.removeClass, and thus you have to to toggle them on/off. For example, if you use something like <table class="table-hover">the only way to successfully modify elements like colors of rows is to toggle the table-hover class on/off, like this$(your_element).closest("table").toggleClass("table-hover"); Hopefully this work-around will be helpful to someone! :)we can use setProperty or cssText to add !important to dom element using java script.Eg1:Eg2: https://jsfiddle.net/xk6Ut/256/An alternative approach is  dynamically creating and updating CSS class in JavaScript. To do that, we can use style element and need to employ the ID for the style element so that we can update the CSS class...I had the same problem trying to change a text color of a menu-item when "event".\nThe best way i found when i had this same problem is:1st step: Create, in your css, a new class with this purpose, for example:last step: Apply this class using addClass method as follows:Problem solved. Hope it helps!I had a similar situation, but I used .find() after struggling with .closest() for a long time with many variations.Up vote if you found any use, thanks.Working: http://jsfiddle.net/fx4mbp6c/Another easy method to solve this issue adding the style attribute:
