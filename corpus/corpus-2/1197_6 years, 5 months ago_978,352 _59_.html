How can I convert a JavaScript object into a string?Example:Output:Object { a=1, b=2} // very nice readable output :)\n  Item: [object Object] // no idea what\'s inside :(I would recommend using JSON.stringify, which serializes an object. Most modern browsers support this method natively, but for those that don\'t, you can include a JS version: Sure, to convert an object into a string, you either have to use your own method, such as:Actually, the above just shows the general approach; you may wish to use something like http://phpjs.org/functions/var_export:578 or http://phpjs.org/functions/var_dump:604or, if you are not using methods (functions as properties of your object), you may be able to use the new standard (but not implemented in older browsers, though you can find a utility to help with it for them too), JSON.stringify(). But again, that won\'t work if the object uses functions or other properties which aren\'t serializable to JSON.Use javascript String() function.OR.Keeping it simple with console, you can just use a comma instead of a +. The + will try to convert the object into a string, whereas the comma will display it separately in the console.Example:Output:Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console.logEDIT  Do not use this answer as it does not work in Internet Explorer.  Use Gary Chambers solution.toSource() is the function you are looking for which will write it out as JSON.One option:console.log(\'Item: \' + JSON.stringify(o));Another option (as soktinpk pointed out in the comments), and better for console debugging IMO:console.log(\'Item: \', o);None of the solutions here worked for me. JSON.stringify seems to be what a lot of people say, but it cuts out functions and seems pretty broken for some objects and arrays I tried when testing it.I made my own solution which works in Chrome at least. Posting it here so anyone that looks this up on Google can find it.EDIT: I know this code can be improved but just never got around to doing it. User andrey suggested an improvement here with the comment:Here is a little bit changed code, which can handle \'null\' and \'undefined\', and also do not add excessive commas.Use that at your own risk as I haven\'t verified it at all. Feel free to suggest any additional improvements as a comment.If you\'re just outputting to the console, you can use console.log(\'string:\', obj). Notice the comma.In cases where you know the object is just a Boolean, Date, String, number etc... The javascript String() function works just fine. I recently found this useful in dealing with values coming from jquery\'s $.each function.For example the following would convert all items in "value" to a string:More details here:http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_string.aspI was looking for this, and wrote a deep recursive one with indentation :Usage : objToString({ a: 1, b: { c: "test" } })If you just want to see the object for debugging, you can useJSON methods are quite inferior to the Gecko engine .toSource() primitive.See the SO article response for comparison tests.Also, the answer above refers to http://forums.devshed.com/javascript-development-115/tosource-with-arrays-in-ie-386109.html which, like JSON, (which the other article http://www.davidpirek.com/blog/object-to-string-how-to-deserialize-json uses via "ExtJs JSON encode source code") cannot handle circular references and is incomplete. The code below shows it\'s (spoof\'s) limitations (corrected to handle arrays and objects without content).(direct link to code in //forums.devshed.com/ ... /tosource-with-arrays-in-ie-386109)which displays:andandAs firefox does not stringify some object as screen object ; if you want to have the same result such as : JSON.stringify(obj) : Take a look at the jQuery-JSON pluginAt its core, it uses JSON.stringify but falls back to its own parser if the browser doesn\'t implement it.If you only care about strings, objects, and arrays:If you are using the Dojo javascript framework then there is already a build in function to do this: dojo.toJson() which would be used like so. which will return a string. If you want to convert the object to json data then add a second parameter of true.http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/dojo/toJson.html#dojo-tojsonexample to use:your_object1.txt:your_object2.txt:For your example, I think\nconsole.log("Item:",o)\nwould be easiest. But,\nconsole.log("Item:" + o.toString)\nwould also work.Using method number one uses a nice dropdown in the console, so a long object would work nicely.Since Javascript v1.0 works everywhere (even IE)\nthis is a native approach and allows for a very costomised look of your object while debugging and in production\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/toStringUsefull exampleAlso, as a bonusI hope this example will help for all those who all are working on array of objects
