Possible Duplicate:\n  git replacing LF with CRLF When I create a new rails application I\'m seeing a warning in git about LF replacement. I do \n    git init\n    git add .and then boom! I see this pop up for almost all files. I usually just keep going and build my application and it disappears after many changes to files. Example:The file will have its original line endings in your working directory.\n  warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in Gemfile.The file will have its original line endings in your working directory.\n  warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in Gemfile.lock.The file will have its original line endings in your working directory.\n  warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in README.What\'s the difference between LF and CRLF?Should I be concerned about this in the long run or just ignore it and keep going as I usually do?In Unix systems the end of a line is represented with a line feed (LF). In windows a line is represented with a carriage return (CR) and a line feed (LF) thus (CRLF). when you get code from git that was uploaded from a unix system they will only have an LF.If you want to turn this warning off, type this in the git command lineIf you want to make an intelligent decision how git should handle this, read the documentation Here is a snippetFormatting and WhitespaceFormatting and whitespace issues are some of the more frustrating and\n  subtle problems that many developers encounter when collaborating,\n  especially cross-platform. It\xe2\x80\x99s very easy for patches or other\n  collaborated work to introduce subtle whitespace changes because\n  editors silently introduce them, and if your files ever touch a\n  Windows system, their line endings might be replaced. Git has a few\n  configuration options to help with these issues.If you\xe2\x80\x99re programming on Windows and working with people who are not\n  (or vice-versa), you\xe2\x80\x99ll probably run into line-ending issues at some\n  point. This is because Windows uses both a carriage-return character\n  and a linefeed character for newlines in its files, whereas Mac and\n  Linux systems use only the linefeed character. This is a subtle but\n  incredibly annoying fact of cross-platform work; many editors on\n  Windows silently replace existing LF-style line endings with CRLF, or\n  insert both line-ending characters when the user hits the enter key.Git can handle this by auto-converting CRLF line endings into LF when\n  you add a file to the index, and vice versa when it checks out code\n  onto your filesystem. You can turn on this functionality with the\n  core.autocrlf setting. If you\xe2\x80\x99re on a Windows machine, set it to true\n  \xe2\x80\x93 this converts LF endings into CRLF when you check out code:If you\xe2\x80\x99re on a Linux or Mac system that uses LF line endings, then you\n  don\xe2\x80\x99t want Git to automatically convert them when you check out files;\n  however, if a file with CRLF endings accidentally gets introduced,\n  then you may want Git to fix it. You can tell Git to convert CRLF to\n  LF on commit but not the other way around by setting core.autocrlf to\n  input:This setup should leave you with CRLF endings in Windows checkouts,\n  but LF endings on Mac and Linux systems and in the repository.If you\xe2\x80\x99re a Windows programmer doing a Windows-only project, then you\n  can turn off this functionality, recording the carriage returns in the\n  repository by setting the config value to false:If you want, you can deactivate this feature in your git core config usingBut it would be better to just get rid of the warnings using
