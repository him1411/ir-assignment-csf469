How to transfer docker image from one machine to another one without using a repository, no matter private or public?I am used to play and create my own image in virtualbox, and when it is finished, I try to deploy to other machines to have real usage.Since it is based on own based image (like redhat), it cannot be recreated from Dockerfile.Are there any simple commands I can use? Or another solution?Updated It seems save/export can achieve similar purpose, see  What is the difference between save and export in Docker?, and I prefer the save command for my case.You will need to save the docker image as a tar file:Then copy your image to a new system with regular file transfer tools such as cp or scp. After that you will have to load the image into docker:PS: You may need to sudo all commands.Transferring a Docker image via SSH, bzipping the content on the fly:It\'s also a good idea to put pv in the middle of the pipe to see how the transfer is going:To save image to any file path or shared nfs see following example.Get image id by doing:Say you have image with id "matrix-data"Save image with id:Copy image from path to any host\nNow import to your local docker using :Hope this make make more clear.ThanksFirst save the docker image to a zip fileThen load the exported image to docker using the below commandFor a flattened export of a container\'s filesystem, use; docker export CONTAINER_ID > my_container.tarUse cat my_container.tar | docker import - to import said image.When using docker-machine, you can do docker $(docker-machine config <mach1>) save <image> | docker $(docker-machine config <mach2>) load to copy images between machines mach1 and mach2.And of course you can also stick pv in the middle to get a progess indicator:docker $(docker-machine config <mach1>) save <image> | pv | docker $(docker-machine config <mach2>) load.You may also omit one of the docker-machine config sub-shells, to use your current default docker-host.docker save <image> | docker $(docker-machine config <mach>) load \nto copy image from current docker-host to machor docker $(docker-machine config <mach>) save <image> | docker load to copy from mach to current docker-host.All other answers are very helpful. I just went through the same problem and figure out a easy way with docker machine scp. Since docker machine v0.3.0, scp was introduced to copy files from one docker machine to another. This is very convenient if you want copying file from your local computer to a remote docker machine such as AWS EC2 or Digital Ocean because of docker machine is taking care of ssh credentials for you.Save you images using docker save like:docker save -o docker-images.tar app-webCopy images using docker-machine scpdocker-machine scp ./docker-images.tar remote-machine:/home/ubuntuAssume your remote docker machine is remote-machine and the directory you want the tar file to be is /home/ubuntuLoad docker image docker-machine ssh remote-machine sudo docker load -i docker-images.tarI assume you need to save couchdb-cartridge which has a image id 7ebc8510bc2c:Save the archiveName image to a tar file. I will use the /media/sf_docker_vm/ to save the image.Copy the archiveName.tar file to your new Docker instance using whatever method works in your environment, for example FTP, SCP, etc.Run the docker load command on your new Docker instance and specify the location of the image tar file.Finally, run the docker images command to check that the image is now available.Please find this detailed post.Run docker images to see a list of the images on the host. Let\'s say you have an image called awesomesauce. In your terminal, cd to the directory where you want to export the image to. Now run:docker save awesomesauce:latest > awesomesauce.tarCopy the tar file to a thumb drive or whatever, and then copy it to the new host computer. Now from the new host do:Now go have a coffee and read hacker news...This is how you can move docker images between two remote registers/repositories\nWorks with Docker version 1.10.2, build c3959b1It\'s a handy method if you want to migrate your images to AWS ECS/ECR service.
