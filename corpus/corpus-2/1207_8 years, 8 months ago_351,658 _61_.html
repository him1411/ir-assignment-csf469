I have a page where some event listeners are attached to input boxes and select boxes. Is there a way to find out which event listeners are observing a particular DOM node and for what event?Events are attached using:If you just need to inspect what\'s happening on a page, you might try the Visual Event bookmarklet.Update: Visual Event 2 available;It depends on how the events are attached. For illustration presume we have the following click handler:We\'re going to attach it to our element using different methods, some which allow inspection and some that don\'t.Method A) single event handlerMethod B) multiple event handlersMethod C): jQuery1.3.x1.4.x (stores the handler inside an object)(See jQuery.fn.data and jQuery.data)Method D): Prototype (messy)1.5.x1.6 to 1.6.0.3, inclusive (got very difficult here)1.6.1 (little better)Chrome, Firefox, Vivaldi and Safari support getEventListeners(domElement) in their Developer Tools console.For majority of the debugging purposes, this could be used. Below is a very good reference to use it:\nhttps://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/commandline-api#geteventlistenersobjectWebKit Inspector in Chrome or Safari browsers now does this. It will display the event listeners for a DOM element when you select it in the Elements pane.It is possible to list all event listeners in JavaScript: It\'s not that hard; you just have to hack the prototype\'s method of the HTML elements (before adding the listeners).Now every anchor element (a) will have a lastListenerInfo property wich contains all of its listeners. And it even works for removing listeners with anonymous functions.(Rewriting the answer from this question since it\'s relevant here.)When debugging, if you just want to see the events, I recommend either... If you want to use the events in your code, and you are using jQuery before version 1.8, you can use: to get the events. As of version 1.8, using .data("events") is discontinued (see this bug ticket). You can use:Another example: Write all click events on a certain link to the console:(see http://jsfiddle.net/HmsQC/ for a working example)Unfortunately, using $._data this is not recommended except for debugging since it is an internal jQuery structure, and could change in future releases. Unfortunately I know of no other easy means of accessing the events.1: Prototype.observe uses Element.addEventListener (see the source code)2: You can override Element.addEventListener to remember the added listeners (handy property EventListenerList was removed from DOM3 spec proposal). Run this code before any event is attached:Read all the events by:And don\'t forget to override Element.removeEventListener to remove the event from the custom Element.eventListenerList.3: the Element.onclick property needs special care here:4: don\'t forget the Element.onclick content attribute: these are two different things:So you need to handle it, too:The Visual Event bookmarklet (mentioned in the most popular answer) only steals the custom library handler cache:It turns out that there is no standard method provided by the W3C\n  recommended DOM interface to find out what event listeners are\n  attached to a particular element. While this may appear to be an\n  oversight, there was a proposal to include a property called\n  eventListenerList to the level 3 DOM specification, but was\n  unfortunately been removed in later drafts. As such we are forced to\n  looked at the individual Javascript libraries, which typically\n  maintain a cache of attached events (so they can later be removed and\n  perform other useful abstractions).As such, in order for Visual Event to show events, it must be able to\n  parse the event information out of a Javascript library.Element overriding may be questionable (i.e. because there are some DOM specific features like live collections, which can not be coded in JS), but it gives the eventListenerList support natively and it works in Chrome, Firefox and Opera (doesn\'t work in IE7).You could wrap the native DOM methods for managing event listeners by putting this at the top of your <head>:H/T @les2Use getEventListeners in Google Chrome:If you have Firebug, you can use console.dir(object or array) to print a nice tree in the console log of any JavaScript scalar, array, or object. Try: orThe Firefox developer tools now does this. Events are shown by clicking the "ev" button on the right of each element\'s display, including jQuery and DOM events.Opera 12 (not the latest Chrome Webkit engine based) Dragonfly has had this for a while and is obviously displayed in the DOM structure. In my opinion it is a superior debugger and is the only reason remaining why I still use the Opera 12 based version (there is no v13, v14 version and the v15 Webkit based lacks Dragonfly still)Fully working solution based on answer by Jan Turon - behaves like getEventListeners() from console:(There is a little bug with duplicates. It doesn\'t break much anyway.)Usage:someElement.getEventListeners([name]) - return list of event listeners, if name is set return array of listeners for that eventsomeElement.clearEventListeners([name]) - remove all event listeners, if name is set only remove listeners for that eventPrototype 1.7.1 wayI am trying to do that in jQuery 2.1, and with the "$().click() -> $(element).data("events").click;" method it doesn\'t work.I realized that only the $._data() functions works in my case :There exists nice jQuery Events extension  :\n(topic source)
