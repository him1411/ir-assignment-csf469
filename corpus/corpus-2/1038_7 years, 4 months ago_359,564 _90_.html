I have the following TextView defined: where @string/txtCredits is a string resource that contains <a href="some site">Link text</a>.Android is highlighting the links in the TextView, but they do not respond to clicks.  Can someone tell me what I\'m doing wrong?  Do I have to set an onClickListener for the TextView in my activity for something as simple as this?Looks like it has to do with the way I define my string resource.\nThis does not work:But this does:Which is a bummer because I would much rather show a text link than show the full URL.  Buried in the API demos I found the solution to my problem:Link.java:I removed most of the attributes on my TextView to match what was in the demo.That solved it. Pretty difficult to uncover and fix.Important: Don\'t forget to remove autoLink="web" if you are calling setMovementMethod().I\'m using only android:autoLink="web" and it works fine. A click on the link opens the browser and shows the correct page. One thing I could guess is that some other view is above the link. Something that is transparent fills the whole parent but don\'t displays anything above the link. In this case the click goes to this view instead of the link.After spending some time with this, I have found that:Note that the third option has a hyperlink, but the description of the link (the part between the  tags) itself is not a link. android:autoLink="web" does NOT work with such links.The moral of the story is use view.setMovementMethod(LinkMovementMethod.getInstance()); in your code and make sure you don\'t have android:autoLink="web" in your XML layout if you want all links to be clickable.The above solutions didn\'t work for me, but the following did (and it seems a bit cleaner).\nFirst, in the string resource, define your tag opening chevrons using the HTML entity encoding, i.e.:and NOT:In general, encode all the chevrons in the string like that. BTW, the link must start with http://Then (as suggested here) set this option on your TextView:Finally, in code, do:That\'s it, no regexes or other manual hacks required.If you want to add HTML-like link, all you need to do is:add a resource HTML-like string: add your view to the layout with NO link-specific configuration at all:add appropriate MovementMethod programmatically to your TextView:That\'s it! And yes, having options like "autoLink" and "linksClickable" working on explicit links only (not wrapped into html tags) is very misleading to me too... i used this simplymakes the links clickable given hereI added this line to the TextView: android:autoLink="web" \nBelow is an example of usage in a layout file.layout.xml samplestring.xmlOnly what do you need to add this in text view in xmlI hope this will help you;Richard, next time, you should add this code under TextView at the layout XML instead.This should be like this.You don\'t need to use this code (t2.setMovementMethod(LinkMovementMethod.getInstance());) in order to make the link clickable.Also, here\'s the truth: as long as you set the autoLink and the linksClickable, don\'t forget to add this at String.xml file so that the clickable link will work.by using linkify:\nLinkify take a piece of text and a regular expression and turns all of the regex matches in the text into clickable linksDon\'t forget to I noticed that using android:autoLink="web" thusworked OK for URLs but since I had an e-mail address and phone number that I wanted to link as well, I ended up using this line android:autoLink="all" like this and it worked like a charm.Be sure to not use setAutoLinkMask(Linkify.ALL) when using setMovementMethod(LinkMovementMethod.getInstance()) and Html.fromHTML() on properly formatted HTML links (for example, <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>).You need only this:Insert this line to TextView, that can be clickable with reference to the web. URL address set as a text of this TextView.Example:The accepted answer is correct, BUT it will mean that phone numbers, maps, email addresses, and regular links e.g. http://google.com without href tags will NO LONGER be clickable since you can\'t have autolink in the xml.The only complete solution to have EVERYTHING clickable that I have found is the following:And the TextView should NOT have android:autolink. There\'s no need for android:linksClickable="true" either; it\'s true by default.Here is very one line android code to make phone and url selectable from textView no matter what is string and what is data. You dont need to use any HTML tags for this.This is how I solved clickable and Visible links in a TextView (by code)  Use this...and add permission in manifest fileThe easiest thing that worked for me is to use Linkifyand it will automatically detect the web urls from the text in the textview.The reason you\'re having the problem is that it only tries to match "naked" addresses. things like "www.google.com" or "http://www.google.com".Running your text through Html.fromHtml() should do the trick. You have to do it programatically, but it works.Use below code:Autolink phone does not worked for me. The following worked like a charm,Add CDATA to your string resourceStrings.xmlDon\'t know if it\'s worth adding another answer, but just in case...I had to hunt this down in a couple places but finally got this version of the code to work.strings.xml:myactivity.xml:myactivty.java (in onCreate()):This will create two clickable hyperlinks with the text link text1 and link text2 which redirect the user to google.If using XML based TextView, for your requirement you need to do just two things:Identify your link in the string, such as "this is my WebPage."\nYou can add it in xml or in the code.In the xml that has the TextView, add these:I use the autolink to "auto underline" the text, but just made an "onClick" that manages it. (I ran into this problem myself)Doesn\'t require any permissions, as you are passing the intent off to apps that manage those resources, (I.E. browser).This was what worked for me. Good luck.Just wasted so much time to figure out you have to use getText(R.string.whatever) instead of getString(R.string.whatever)...Anyways, here is how I got mine working. With multiple hyperlinks in the same text view too. string exampleThe following should work for anyone who is looking for a combination of text and hyperlink within an Android app.In string.xml:Now you can utilise this string in any given View like this:Now, in your Activity or Fragment, do the following:By now, you don\'t require to set android:autoLink="web" or android:linksClickable="true" using this approach.I hope you will find this helpful.As the databinding is out I\'d like to share my solution for databinding TextViews supporting html tags with clickable links.To avoid retrieving every textview and giving them html support using From.html we extend the TextView and put the logic in setText()I\'ve made a gist which also shows example entity and view for using this.My code was like this:  My Java code was like this:  This just points the link to another activity. But that link is clickable and works smoothly. Tested in Android Studio 1.5 (Preview)
