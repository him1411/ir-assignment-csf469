Unlike other editors, vim stores copied text in its own clipboard. So, it\'s very hard for me to copy some text from a webpage and paste it into the current working file. It so happens I have to either open gedit or type it manually.Can I make vim paste from and to the system\'s clipboard?The "* and "+ registers are for the system\'s clipboard (:help registers). Depending on your system, they may do different things. For instance, on systems that don\'t use X11 like OSX or Windows, the "* register is used to read and write to the system clipboard. On X11 systems both registers can be used. See :help x11-selection for more details, but basically the "* is analogous to X11\'s PRIMARY selection (which usually copies things you select with the mouse and pastes with the middle mouse button) and "+ is analogous to X11\'s CLIPBOARD selection (which is the clipboard proper).If all that went over your head, try using "*yy or "+yy to copy a line to your system\'s clipboard. Assuming you have the appropriate compile options, one or the other should work. You might like to remap this to something more convenient for you. For example, you could put vnoremap <C-c> "*y in your ~/.vimrc so that you can visually select and press Ctrl+c to yank to your system\'s clipboard.Be aware that copying/pasting from the system clipboard will not work if :echo has(\'clipboard\') returns 0. In this case, vim is not compiled with the +clipboard feature and you\'ll have to install a different version or recompile it. Some linux distros supply a minimal vim installation by default, but generally if you install the vim-gtk package you can get the extra features.You also may want to have a look at the \'clipboard\' option described at :help cb. In this case you can :set clipboard=unnamed or :set clipboard=unnamedplus to make all yanking/deleting operations automatically copy to the system clipboard. This could be an inconvenience in some cases where you are storing something else in the clipboard as it will override it.To paste you can use "+p or "*p (again, depending on your system and/or desired selection) or you can map these to something else. I type them explicitly, but I often find myself in insert mode. If you\'re in insert mode you can still paste them with proper indentation by using <C-r><C-p>* or <C-r><C-p>+. See :help i_CTRL-R_CTRL-P.It\'s also worth mentioning vim\'s paste option (:help paste). This puts vim into a special "paste mode" that disables several other options, allowing you to easily paste into vim using your terminal emulator or multiplexer\'s familiar paste shortcut. Simply type :set paste to enable it, paste your content and then type :set nopaste to disable it. Alternatively, you can use the pastetoggle option to set a keycode that toggles the mode (:help pastetoggle). I recommend using registers instead of these options, but if they are still too scary this can be a convenient workaround while you\'re perfecting your vim chops.See :help clipboard for more detailed information.You can copy into vim. Make the file in insert mode and use Ctrl+Shift+v. Remember beforehand to to avoid messing with the identation ...On my Linux system, the + and * registers map to an X11 selection, which can be pasted with the middle mouse button. When :set clipboard=unnamed and :set clipboard=unnamedplus are used, then the registers map to the clipboard, and can be pasted with CTRL-V.The specifics seem to be somewhat configuration and system dependent, so your mileage will definitely vary. It should definitely get you pointed in the right direction, though.http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Accessing_the_system_clipboardFor my that configuration works for copying and pastingThis would be the lines you need in your vimrc for this purpose:clipboardThere is a special register for storing this selection, it is the "*\nregister.  Nothing is put in here unless the information about what text is\nselected is about to change (e.g. with a left mouse click somewhere), or when\nanother application wants to paste the selected text.  Then the text is put\nin the "* register.  For example, to cut a line and make it the current\nselection/put it on the CLIPBOARD:Similarly, when you want to paste a selection from another application, e.g.,\nby clicking the middle mouse button, the selection is put in the "* register\nfirst, and then \'put\' like any other register.  For example, to put the\nselection (contents of the CLIPBOARD):registers E354Paste from clipboardCheck for X11-clipboard support in terminalWhen you like to run Vim in a terminal you need to look for a version of Vim that was compiled with clipboard support.\nCheck for X11-clipboard support, from the console, type:If you see "+xterm_clipboard", you are good to go.http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Accessing_the_system_clipboardThe X server maintains three selections, called:PRIMARY, SECONDARY and CLIPBOARDThe PRIMARY selection is conventionally used to implement copying and\n  pasting via the middle mouse button. The SECONDARY and CLIPBOARD\n  selections are less frequently used by application programs.http://linux.die.net/man/1/xselI tried the suggestions above and none of them worked in my environment. (Windows PuTTY clone over ssh)Some additional googling turned up:\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/110684/copy-paste-into-sshd-vim-from-local-windows-clipboardOne of the comments suggested using SHIFT+INSERT which did the trick for pasting from my desktop\'s clipboard into Vim\'s buffer. Ctrl-C was already working to copy to the desktop\'s clipboard from Vim.A quick note for people whose vim installation does not support the * and + registers. It is not necessary to download a new vim installation to paste from the clipboard. Here is an alternative method:1) Install parcellite (a clipboard manager with a low memory footprint);2) In your .vimrc file, add the following:3) Restart vim.Now when you type in :Clip as an ex command, the contents of the clipboard will be pasted in at the cursor. You can also map the new command to a function key so as to be able to do this with one keystroke.Didn\'t have +clipboard so I came up with this alternative solution using xsel:Add to your ~/.vimrc:vnoremap <C-C> :w !xsel -b<CR><CR>Following on from Conner\'s answer, which was great, but C-R C-p +  and C-R C-p * in insert mode is a bit inconvenient. Ditto "*p and "+p from command mode.a VIM guru suggested the following to map C-v to what C-r C-p + does.You could have   :inoremap <C-v> <C-o>"+p for insert mode onlyif you really wanted to override blockwise visual mode (not recommended by him as visual\n  mode is good) you could have    map <C-v> "+pThis works for me: Ctrl+Shift+VOn top of the setting :set clipboard=unnamed, you should use mvim -v which you can get with brew install macvim if you\'re using vim on Terminal.app on Mac OS X 10.9. Default vim does not support clipboard option.Based on @lis2 answer, I use a simpler configuration that will not force Insert mode at the end:Mind that all these override default Vim mappings:As an alternative, one can use keys inspired in the "yank", "delete" and "put" Vim verbs: <C-y>, <C-d> and <C-p> respectively. These would only override one default mapping:What you really need is EasyClip. It will do just that and so much more...When I use my Debian vim that is not integrated with Gnome (vim --version | grep clip # shows no clipboard support), I can copy to the clipboard after holding the Shift key and selecting the text with the mouse, just like with any other curses program.  As I figured from a comment by @Conner, it\'s the terminal (gnome-terminal in my case) that turns off its mouse event reporting when it senses my Shift press.  I guess curses-based programs can receive mouse events after sending a certain Escape sequence to the terminal.If you are on windows and you want to paste contents of system clipboard using p then type this command.This solved my problem.It may also be worth mentioning, on OSX using Vim, you can select text with the mouse, Cmd-C to copy to OSX system clipboard, and the copied text will be available in the clipboard outside of Vim. In other words, OSX treats it like it were a regular window, and this is where the much-maligned Apple "Command" button comes in handy.B-30There are two simple ways to do this. Make your file in insert mode and\n1) press the middle button (the scroll wheel) in your mouse, or\n2) Ctrl + Shift + VFor some international keyboards, you may need to press "+Space to get a ".So in those case you would have to press "Space+y or "Space*y to copy.And "Space+p or " Space*p to paste.If you are using vim in MAC OSX, unfortunately it comes with older verion, and not complied with clipboard options. Luckily, homebrew can easily solve this problem.install vim:brew install vim --with-lua --with-override-system-viminstall gui verion of vim:brew install macvim --with-lua --with-override-system-vimrestart the terminal to take effect. \nappend the following line to ~/.vimrc\n\nset clipboard=unnamednow you can copy the line in vim with yy and paste it system-wide.The other solutions are good if you want to change your vimrc, etc... However I wanted an simple way to copy from vim to my system keyboard. This is what I came up with.There are three things you need to do:Install macvim however you want. I used homebrew:Add a symbolic link so you can keep blissfully typing vim:You can read more about this in this blog post.The PATH variable is a list of directories that macOS searches to find binaries. We want macOS to find our symbolic link before it finds the system vim. This configuration lives inside the /etc/paths file:You can read more about this in another answerAdd the following line somewhere in you ~/.vimrc file:You can read more about this on the vim wikiNow, operations such as yy, D, and P work with the system clipboard. No need to prefix them with "+ or "*.The simplest solution to this, that also works between different Linux machines through ssh is:Check whether vim supports X-11 clipboard: vim --version | grep clipboard. If it reports back -clipboard and -xterm_clipboard you should install either vim-gtk or vim-gnome (gvim on arch linux)Add the following lines to your .vimrc:Now copying and pasting should work exactly as expected on a single, and across different machines by only using y for yank and p for paste. NB modify .vimrc on all machines where you want to use this feature.
