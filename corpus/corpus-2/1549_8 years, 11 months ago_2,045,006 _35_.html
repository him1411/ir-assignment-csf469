I\'ve been using Remote Desktop Connection to get into a workstation, but I\'m not able to use the shutdown/restart function in the Start menu while doing this.I\'ve put a few really helpful options in the answer below.Note:\nI wanted to make sure some really good answers were also mentioned along with my own on this.And here they are in no particular order.Here\'s how to do the shutdown functions via a batch file:Additional options:If you are on a remote machine, you may also want to add the -f option to force the reboot.  Otherwise your session may close and a stubborn app can hang the system.I use this whenever I want to force an immediate reboot:For a more friendly "give them some time" option, you can use this:As you can see in the comments, the -f is implied by the timeout.Brutus 2006 is a utility that provides a GUI for these options.No one has mentioned -m option for remote shutdown:Also:Original answer: Oct. 2008You also got all the "rundll32.exe shell32.dll" serie:(see update below)rundll32.exe user.exe,**ExitWindowsExec** [Restart Windows]where n stands for:(can be combined -> 6 = 2+4 FORCE REBOOT)1800 INFORMATION kindly points out in the comments:Don\'t use rundll32.exe for this purpose. It expects that the function you passed on the command line has a very specific method signature - it doesn\'t match the method signature of ExitWindows. Raymond CHEN wrote:The function signature required for functions called by rundll32.exe is:That hasn\'t stopped people from using rundll32 to call random functions that weren\'t designed to be called by rundll32, like user32 LockWorkStation or user32 ExitWindowsEx.(oops)The actual function signature for ExitWindowsEx is:And to make it crystal-clear:Rundll32 is a leftover from Windows 95, and it has been deprecated since at least Windows Vista because it violates a lot of modern engineering guidelines. Another small tip: when going the batch file route, I like to be able to abort it in case I run it accidentally. So the batch file invokes the shutdown but leaves you at the command prompt afterwards.Plus, since it\'s on a timer, you get about the same thrill as you do when hunting in The Oregon Trail.You\'re probably aware of this, but just in case: it\'s much easier to just type "shutdown -r" (or whatever command you like) into the "Run" box and hit enter.Saves leaving batch files lying around everywhere.When remoted into a machine (target is Windows XP anyway; I am not sure about target Windows Vista), although Shutdown on the start menu is replaced by Disconnect Session or something like that, there should be one called \'Windows Security\' which also does the same thing as Ctrl + Alt + End as pointed to by Owen.I would write this in Notepad or WordPad for a basic logoff command:This is basically the same as clicking start and logoff manually, but it is just slightly faster if you have the batch file ready.
