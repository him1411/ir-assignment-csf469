Can we get the variables in the query string in Node.js just like we get them in $_GET in PHP?I know that in Node.js we can get the URL in the request. Is there a method to get the query string parameters?Yes you can access req.url and parse it manually:However, in expressjs it\'s already done for you and you can simply use req.query for that:Since you\'ve mentioned Express.js in your tags, here is an Express-specific answer: use req.query. E.g.In Express, use req.query.req.params only gets the route parameters, not the query string parameters.  See the express or sails documentation:(req.params) Checks route params, ex: /user/:id (req.query) Checks query string params, ex: ?id=12 Checks urlencoded body params (req.body), ex: id=12 To utilize urlencoded request bodies, req.body should be an object. This can be done by using the _express.bodyParser middleware.That said, most of the time, you want to get the value of a parameter irrespective of its source.  In that case, use req.param(\'foo\').The value of the parameter will be returned whether the variable was in the route parameters, query string, or the encoded request body.Side note- if you\'re aiming to get the intersection of all three types of request parameters (similar to PHP\'s $_REQUEST), you just need to merge the parameters together-- here\'s how I set it up in Sails.  Keep in mind that the path/route parameters object (req.params) has array properties, so order matters (although this may change in Express 4)For Express.js you want to do req.params:I learned from the other answers and decided to use this code throughout my site:Then you can just call where the URL for get should beYou should be able to do something like this:There are 2 ways to pass parameters via GET method\nMethod 1 :\nThe MVC approach where you pass the parameters like /routename/:paramname\nIn this case you can use req.params.paramname to get the parameter value For Example refer below code where I am expecting Id as a param\nlink could be like : http://myhost.com/items/23Method 2 :\nGeneral Approach : Passing variables as query string using \'?\' operator \nFor Example refer below code where I am expecting Id as a query parameter\nlink could be like : http://myhost.com/items?id=23UPDATE 4 May 2014 Old answer preserved here: https://gist.github.com/stefek99/b10ed037d2a4a323d6381) Install express: npm install expressapp.js2) Run the app: node app.js3) Visit in the browser: http://localhost:3000/endpoint?id=somethingI have received the ID: something(many things have changed since my answer and I believe it is worth keeping things up to date)A small Node.js HTTP server listening on port 9080, parsing GET or POST data and sending it back to the client as part of the response is:Save it as parse.js, and run it on the console by entering "node parse.js".Whitequark responded nicely. But with the current versions of Node.js and Express.js it requires one more line. Make sure to add the \'require http\' (second line). I\'ve posted a fuller example here that shows how this call can work. Once running, type http://localhost:8080/?name=abel&fruit=apple in your browser, and you will get a cool response based on the code.If you are using ES6 and Express, try this approach:It is so simple:Example URL:You can print all the values of query string by using:OutputAll query strings : { "id":"3","activatekey":"$2a$08$jvGevXUOvYxKsiBt.PpMs.zgzD4C/wwTsvjz\n  fUrqLrgS3zXJVfVRK"}To print specific:Outputactivatekey: $2a$08$jvGevXUOvYxKsiBt.PpMs.zgzD4C/wwTsvjzfUrqLrgS3zXJVfVRKYou can useYou can use with express ^4.15.4:Hope this helps...\nCheers,
