The short: is there a way to have a git repo push to and pull from a list of remote repos (rather than a single "origin")?The long: I often have a situation when I\'m developing an app in multiple computers, with different connectivity -- say a laptop while on transit, a computer "A" while I\'m in a certain location, and another computer "B" while on another. Also, the laptop might have connectivity with only either "A" or "B", and sometimes both.What I would like to is for git to always "pull" from and "push" to all the computers it can currently connect to, so it\'s easier to jump from one machine to the other and continue working seamlessly.You can configure multiple remote repositories with the git remote command:To fetch from all the configured remotes and update tracking branches, but not merge into HEAD, do:If it\'s not currently connected to one of the remotes, it will take time out or throw an error, and go on to the next. You\'ll have to manually merge from the fetched repositories, or cherry-pick, depending on how you want to organize collecting changes.To fetch the master branch from alt and pull it into your current head, do:So in fact git pull is almost shorthand for git pull origin HEAD (actually it looks in the config file to determine this, but you get the idea).For pushing updates, you have to do that to each repo manually. A push was, I think, designed with the central-repository workflow in mind.Doing this manually is no longer necessary, with modern versions of git! See Malvineous\'s solution, below.Reproduced here:This something I\xe2\x80\x99ve been using for quite a while without bad consequences and suggested by Linus Torvalds on the git mailing list.araqnid\xe2\x80\x99s solution is the proper one for bringing code into your repository\xe2\x80\xa6 but when you, like me, have multiple equivalent authoritative upstreams (I keep some of my more critical projects cloned to both a private upstream, GitHub, and Codaset), it can be a pain to push changes to each one, every day.Long story short, git remote add all of your remotes individually\xe2\x80\xa6 and then git config -e and add a merged\xe2\x80\x90remote. Assuming you have this repository config:\xe2\x80\xa6 to create a merged\xe2\x80\x90remote for "Paws" and "Codaset", I can add the following after all of those:Once I\xe2\x80\x99ve done this, when I git push Origin Master, it will push to both Paws/Master and Codaset/Master sequentially, making life a little easier.The latest version of git (as of October 2012) allows you to do this from the command line:Then git push will push to user1@repo1, then push to user2@repo2.  Leave out --push if you also want to be able to git pull from them too.I added these aliases to my ~/.bashrc:You can add remotes with:Then to update all the repos do:Here is my example with bash script inside .gitconfig alias sectionYou\'ll need a script to loop through them. Git doesn\'t a provide a "push all." You could theoretically do a push in multiple threads, but a native method is not available.Fetch is even more complicated, and I\'d recommend doing that linearly.I think your best answer is to have once machine that everybody does a push / pull to, if that\'s at all possible.I took the liberty to expand the answer from nona-urbiz; just add this to your ~/.bashrc: Usage:If you do not provide any branch argument for git-pullall then the pull from non-default remotes will fail; left this behavior as it is, since it\'s analogous to git.For updating the remotes (i.e. the pull case), things have become easier.The statement of LinusSadly, there\'s not even any way to fake this out with a git \n  alias.in the referenced entry at the Git mailing list in elliottcable\'s answer is no longer true.git fetch learned the --all parameter somewhere in the past allowing to fetch all remotes in one go.If not all are requested, one could use the --multiple switch in order to specify multiple remotes or a group.I wanted to work in VSO/TFS, then push publicly to GitHub when ready.  Initial repo created in private VSO.  When it came time to add to GitHub I did:Worked like a champ...For a sanity check, issue "git remote -v" to list the repositories associated with a project.  Sinple way, worked for me...  Hope this helps someone.I added two separate pushurl to the remote "origin" in the .git congfig file. When I run git push origin "branchName" Then it will run through and push to each url. Not sure if there is an easier way to accomplish this but this works for myself to push to Github source code and to push to My.visualStudio source code at the same time.Adding new remoteFetch form multiple locationsPush to locations
