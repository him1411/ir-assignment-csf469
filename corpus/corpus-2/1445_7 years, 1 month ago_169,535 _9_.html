Is there a way I can see the changes that were made to a file after I have done git add file?That is, when I do: no diff is shown. I guess there\'s a way to see the differences since the last commit but I don\'t know what that is.You can show changes that have been staged with the --cached flag:In more recent versions of git, you can also use the --staged flag (--staged is a synonym for --cached):In order to see the changes that have been staged already, you can pass the -\xe2\x80\x93staged option to git diff (in pre-1.6 versions of Git, use \xe2\x80\x93-cached).try git diff HEAD file ?See the EXAMPLE section under git-diff(1)
