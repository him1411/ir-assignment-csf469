In my AJAX call, I want to return a string value back to the calling page.Should I use ActionResult or just return a string? You can just use the ContentResult to return a plain string:ContentResult by default returns a text/plain as its contentType. This is overloadable so you can also do:You can also just return string if you know that\'s the only thing the method will ever return. For example:there is 2 way to return a string from controller to the viewfirst you could return only string but will not be included in html\n  file it will be jus string appear in browser second could return a string as object of View Resulthere is the code samples to do thisin view file to run AutoProperty it will redirect you to Result view and will send s\ncode to viewi run it at http://localhost:60227/Home/AutoProperty
