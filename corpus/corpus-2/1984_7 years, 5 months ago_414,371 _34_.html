I\'m trying to get a list of the names of all the files present in a directory using Node.js.  I want output that is an array of filenames. How can I do this?You can use the fs.readdir or fs.readdirSync methods.fs.readdirfs.readdirSyncThe difference between the two methods, is that the first one is asynchronous, so you have to provide a callback function that will be executed when the read process ends.The second is synchronous, it will returns the file name array, but it will stop any further execution of your code until the read process ends.The answer above does not perform a recursive search into the directory though. Here\'s what I did for a recursive search (using node-walk: npm install walk)IMO the most convinient way to do such tasks is to use a glob tool. Here\'s a glob package for node.js. Install withThen use wild card to match filenames (example taken from package\'s website)Get files in all subdirsHere\'s a simple solution using only the native fs and path modules:or async version (uses fs.readdir instead):Then you just call (for sync version):or async version:The difference is in how node blocks while performing the IO. Given that the API above is the same, you could just use the async version to ensure maximum performance.However there is one advantage to using the synchronous version. It is easier to execute some code as soon as the walk is done, as in the next statement after the walk. With the async version, you would need some extra way of knowing when you are done. Perhaps creating a map of all paths first, then enumerating them. For simple build/util scripts (vs high performance web servers) you could use the sync version without causing any damage.The mz module provides promisified versions of the core node library. Using them is simple. First install the library...Then...Alternatively you can write them in asynchronous functions in ES7:Some of the users have specified a desire to see a recursive listing (though not in the question)... Use fs-promise. It\'s a thin wrapper around mz.then...Dependencies.Definition.Usage.Please note that fileList is way too optimistic. For anything serious, add some error handling.You don\'t say you want to do it recursively so I assume you only need direct children of the directory.Sample code:Here\'s an asynchronous recursive version.Load fs:Read files async:Read files sync:Took the general approach of @Hunan-Rostomyan, made it a litle more concise and added excludeDirs argument. It\'d be trivial to extend with includeDirs, just follow same pattern:Example usage:Just a heads up: if you\'re planning to perform operations on each file in a directory, try vinyl-fs (which is used by gulp, the streaming build system).
