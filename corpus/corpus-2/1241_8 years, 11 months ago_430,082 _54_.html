How do I generate a random number between 0 and n?What is wrong with rand(range)?From Ruby Random Numbers:If you needed a random integer to simulate a roll of a six-sided die, you\'d use: 1 + rand(6). A roll in craps could be simulated with 2 + rand(6) + rand(6).Finally, if you just need a random float, just call rand with no arguments.As Marc-Andr\xc3\xa9 Lafortune mentions in his answer below (go upvote it), Ruby 1.9.2 has its own Random class (that Marc-Andr\xc3\xa9 himself helped to debug, hence the 1.9.2 target for that feature).For instance, in this game where you need to guess 10 numbers, you can initialize them with:Note: Using Random.new.rand(20..30) (using Random.new) generally would not be a good idea, as explained in detail (again) by Marc-Andr\xc3\xa9 Lafortune, in his answer (again).But if you don\'t use Random.new, then the class method rand only takes a max value, not a Range, as banister (energetically) points out in the comment (and as documented in the docs for Random).  Only the instance method can take a Range, as illustrated by generate a random number with 7 digits.This is why the equivalent of Random.new.rand(20..30) would be 20 + Random.rand(11), since Random.rand(int) returns \xe2\x80\x9ca random integer greater than or equal to zero and less than the argument.\xe2\x80\x9d 20..30 includes 30, I need to come up with a random number between 0 and 11, excluding 11.While you can use rand(42-10) + 10 to get a random number between 10 and 42 (where 10 is inclusive and 42 exclusive), there\'s a better way since Ruby 1.9.3, where you are able to call:Available for all versions of Ruby by requiring my backports gem.Ruby 1.9.2 also introduced the Random class so you can create your own random number generator objects and has a nice API:The Random class itself acts as a random generator, so you call directly:Notes on Random.newIn most cases, the simplest is to use rand or Random.rand. Creating a new random generator each time you want a random number is a really bad idea. If you do this, you will get the random properties of the initial seeding algorithm which are atrocious compared to the properties of the random generator itself.If you use Random.new, you should thus call it as rarely as possible, for example once as MyApp::Random = Random.new and use it everywhere else.The cases where Random.new is helpful are the following:If you\'re not only seeking for a number but also hex or uuid it\'s worth mentioning that the SecureRandom module found its way from ActiveSupport to the ruby core in 1.9.2+. So without the need for a full blown framework:It\'s documented here: Ruby 1.9.3 - Module: SecureRandom (lib/securerandom.rb) You can generate a random number with the rand method. The argument passed to the rand method should be an integer or a range, and returns a corresponding random number within the range:Well, I figured it out. Apparently there is a builtin (?) function called rand:If someone answers with a more detailed answer, I\'ll mark that as the correct answer.What about this?Simplest answer to the question:Note that the range option is only available in newer(1.9+ I believe) versions of ruby.You can simply use random_number.If a positive integer is given as n, random_number returns an integer: 0 <= random_number < n.Use it like this:The output will be any number between 0 and 100.This link is going to be helpful regarding this;http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Random.htmlAnd some more clarity below over the random numbers in ruby;Generate an integer from 0 to 10Generate a number from 0 to 10\nIn a more readable wayGenerate a number from 10 to 15\nIncluding 15Non-Random Random NumbersGenerate the same sequence of numbers every time\nthe program is runGenerate 10 random numbersyou can do rand(range)range = 10..50rand(range)orrange.to_a.sampleorrange.to_a.shuffle(this will shuffle whole array and you can pick a random number by first or last or any from this array to pick random one)Try array#shuffle method for randomizationMaybe it help you.
