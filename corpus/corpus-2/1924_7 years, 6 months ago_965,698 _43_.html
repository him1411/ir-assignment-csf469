I want to get the class name using jQueryAnd if it has an id After getting the element as jQuery object via other means than its class, thenshould do the trick. For the ID use .attr(\'id\').If you are inside an event handler or other jQuery method, where the element is the pure DOM node without wrapper, you can use:Both are standard DOM methods and well supported in all browsers.It is better to use .hasClass() when you want to check if an element has a particular class. This is because when an element has multiple class it is not trivial to check.Example:Where:With .hasClass() we can test if the div has the class divhover.Be Careful , Perhaps , you have a class and a subclass . If you use  previous solutions , you will have : So if you want to have the class selector, do the following : and you will have Now if you want to select all elements that have the same class such as div above : that meansThis is to get the second class into multiple classes using into a elementyou can simply use,var className = $(\'#id\').attr(\'class\');If your <div> has an id:...you can try: If your <div> has only a class, you can try: If you\'re going to use the split function to extract the class names, then you\'re going to have to compensate for potential formatting variations that could produce unexpected results.  For example:producesI think you\'re better off using a regular expression to match on set of allowable characters for class names. For example:producesThe regular expression is probably not complete, but hopefully you understand my point.  This approach mitigates the possibility of poor formatting.To complete Whitestock answer (which is the best I found) I did :So for " myclass1  myclass2  " the result will be \'.myclass1 .myclass2\'You can get class Name by two ways : ORWith Javascript With jQueryORIf you do not know the class name BUT you know the ID you can try this:Then Call it using :if we have single or we want first div element we can use $(\'div\')[0].className otherwise we need an id of that elementIf you want to get classes of div and then want to check if any class exists then simple use.e.g;Try itHTMLjQuery
