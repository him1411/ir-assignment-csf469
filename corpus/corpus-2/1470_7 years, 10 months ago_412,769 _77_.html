I can\'t find a way to make Vim show all white spaces as a character.\nAll I found was about tabs, trailing spaces etc.As others have said, you could usewhich will, in combination withdisplay invisible characters.\nNow, there isn\'t an explicit option which you can use to show whitespace, but in listchars, you could set a character to show for everything BUT whitespace. For example, mine looks like thisso, now, after you useeverything that isn\'t explicitly shown as something else, is then, really, a plain old whitespace.As usual, to understand how listchars works, use the help. It provides great information about what chars can be displayed (like trailing space, for instance) and how to do it::set list to enable.:set nolist to disable.As of patch 7.4.710 you can now set a character to show in place of space using listchars!So, to show ALL white space characters as a character you can do the following:Discussion on mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/vim_dev/pjmW6wOZW_QI think other answers here are more comprehensive, but I thought I\'d share a trick I usually use to differentiate tabs and spaces visually:These are syntax highlighting rules for the Whitespace programming language - tabs show in green and spaces in red. :)Can be combined with :set list as mentioned by many other answers, although the tabs will then show as ^I without a green higlight, but the spaces will show in red.If you set:and then perform a search for a space, every space character will be shown as an underline character.You can use this command in a handy function that toggles "underscoring" of spaces.Map the function to a shortcut key with:NB: Define the function in vimrc after the colorscheme has been set.:set list will show all whitespaces as a character. Everything but a space will look different than its normal state, which means that if you still see a plain old space, it\'s really a plain old space. :)Depending on your syntax rules for the current buffer, something like this could work:This needs a vim 7.3 with +conceal feature Update 10/24/2014\nTo expand a little bit on that. It is of course possible to define some highlighting for the conealed characters.You can configure, how the concealed chars look. For highlighting, you would have to at least once configure the \'Conceal\' highlighting group (See the help at :h hl-Conceal This can be done in your colorscheme and then you do not need to reconfigure it again. But this affects all concealed chars (e.g. if your syntax script conceals some more items, they will be displayed as your white space chars). That could look like this::hi Conceal ctermfg=7 ctermbg=NONE guifg=LightGrey guibg=NONEThere seems to be a particularity that Vim will not highlight spaces, if the syntax script uses the skipwhite keyword. There will be no way around (perhaps this will be fixed, I posted a patch)The last two items means, you would have to setup some autocommands that reset the syntax rules and the correesponding options. For the first one, one might want to setup the highlighting using a ColorScheme autocommand (so that the concealed chars always look the same, independent of what a color scheme actually sets up). For a complete solution, look into romainl answer, that should give you a start. If you setup a function, you can easily setup a toggle command to switch displaying special Highlighting on or off.Update 10/26/2014 I made a plugin out of this question.Update 04/22/2015 A patch has been included in Vim that makes this possible using the list option. Simply set set list listchars+=space:\xe2\x90\xa3 \nThis works as of Vim 7.4.711I use thisto highlight white spaces. It searches for all white spaces, and then enables the highlight to make them pop out. However, it does not print a special character.If by whitespaces you mean the \' \' character, my suggestion would just be a search/replace.  As the others have hinted, set list changes non printing characters to a visible character that\'s configured in listchars.To explicitly show spaces as some other character, something similar to the below should do the trick::%s/ /\xe2\x96\x88/gThen just undo the change to go back again.(to get the \xe2\x96\x88 I pressed this exact key sequence: :%s/ /CTRL-KFB/g)To highlight spaces, just search for it:/<space>Notes: \nTo highlight spaces & tabs:\n/[<space><tab>]A quick way to remove the highlights is to search for anything else:\n/asdf(just type any short list of random characters)The code below is based on Christian Brabandt\'s answer and seems to do what the OP wants:Append those lines to your ~/.vimrc and start a new Vim session to see the still imperfect magic happen.Feel free to edit the default colors and conceal character.Caveat: something in the *FuncBody syntax group in several languages prevents the middle dot from showing. I don\'t know (yet?) how to make that solution more reliable.I was frustrated with all of the other answers to this question, because none of them highlight the space character in a useful way. Showing spaces as characters would particularly help for whitespace-formatted languages, where mixing tabs and spaces is harmful.My solution is to show tabs and underline multiple spaces. It borrows from mrucci\'s answer and this tutorial. Because it uses syntax highlighting, it\'s persistent:Using this, tabs are displayed as | and spaces as _, which makes it very easy to tell when I\'m mixing code styles.The only downside I\'ve found is that this snippet doesn\'t adjust background color to match the context (like in a comment).all of the answers above try to make spaces visible from within vim. If you really insist on having visible spaces as dots, there\'s another approach...If it cannot be done in vim, change your font entirely. I copied the Ubuntu One Mono font and edited it using FontForge. Remember to change the font\'s fullname, family, preferred family, compatible full (in FontFoge it\'s under TTF Names in the font info), in order to have it as a separate font.\nSimply edit the space character to have a dot in the middle and save the font to ~/.fonts\nNow you can use it for your gvim or the entire terminal...\nI copied the "!" character, removed the line and moved the dot to the middle. It took a little more than 5 minutes...Note: changing the space character (0x20) results in the inconvenience of having dots on the entire vim screen... (but it will separate the spaces from tabs...)avoids the "you have to search for spaces to get them to show up" bit but afaict can\'t be configured to do non-hilighting things to the spaces.  CursorLine can be any hilighting group and in the default theme it\'s a plain underline.I like using special characters to show whitespace, is more clear. Even a map to toggle is a key feature, for a quick check.You can find this features in an old vim script not updated since 2004:vim-scripts/cream-showinvisibles@vim.orgThanks to project vim-scripts and vundle you can come back to life this pluginvim-scripts/cream-showinvisibles@githubEven better, my two cents on this is to add a configurable shortcut (instead of predefined F4)so add this to ~/.vimrcinstall plugin on vimand there you gohighlight searchin .vimrc that isand search for space tabs and carriage returnsor search for all whitespace charactersof search for all non white space characters (the whitespace characters are not shown, so you see the whitespace characters between words, but not the trailing whitespace characters)to show all trailing white space characters - at the end of the lineYou could useto really see the structure of a line. You will see tabs and newlines explicitly. When you see a blank, it\'s really a blank.:se is enough, :set isn\'t needed.I found adding these to my .vimrc worked most effectivelyyou can also highlight the spaces (replacing the spaces with a block):(before writing undo it)Adding this to my .vimrc works for me. Just make sure you don\'t have anything else conflicting..
