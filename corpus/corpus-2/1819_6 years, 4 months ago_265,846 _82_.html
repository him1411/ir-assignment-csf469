I have been working on a few Node apps, and I\'ve been looking for a good pattern of storing deployment-related settings. In the Django world (where I come from), the common practise would be to have a settings.py file containing the standard settings (timezone, etc), and then a local_settings.py for deployment specific settings, ie. what database to talk to, what memcache socket, e-mail address for the admins and so on.I have been looking for similar patterns for Node. Just a config file would be nice, so it does not have to be jammed in with everything else in app.js, but I find it important to have a way to have server-specific configuration in a file that is not in source control. The same app could well be deployed across different servers with wildly different settings, and having to deal with merge conflicts and all that is not my idea of fun.So is there some kind of framework/tool for this, or does everyone just hack something together themselves?I use a package.json for my packages and a config.js for my configuration, which looks like:I load the config from my project:and then I can access my things from config.db_host, config.db_port, etc...     This lets me either use hardcoded parameters, or parameters stored in environmental variables if I don\'t want to store passwords in source control.I also generate a package.json and insert a dependencies section:When I clone the project to my local machine, I run npm install to install the packages. More info on that here.The project is stored in GitHub, with remotes added for my production server.You can require JSON files as of Node v0.5.x (referencing this answer)config.json:app.js:Much later, I found a pretty good Node.js module for managing configuration: nconf.A simple example:It also supports storing settings in Redis, writing configuration files, and has a fairly solid API, and is also backed by one of the more well-respected Node.js shops, Nodejitsu, as part of the Flatiron framework initiative, so it should be fairly future-proof. Check out nconf at Github.My solution is fairly simple:Load the environment config in ./config/index.jsDefine some defaults in ./config/config.global.jsOverride the defaults in ./config/config.test.jsUsing it in ./models/user.js:Running your app in test environment:This is explained in greater detail here: http://www.chovy.com/node-js/managing-config-variables-inside-a-node-js-application/You might also look to dotenv which follows the tenets of a twelve-factor app.I used to use node-config, but created dotenv for that reason. It was completely inspired by ruby\'s dotenv library.Usage is quite easy:Then you just create a .env file and put your settings in there like so:That\'s dotenv for nodejs.You might also look to node-config which loads configuration file depending on $HOST and $NODE_ENV variable (a little bit like RoR) : documentation.This can be quite useful for different deployment settings (development, test or production).Just do a simple settings.js with exports:Then, in your script, do a require:All your settings now will be availabe via settings variable:Are you guys using npm to start your scripts (env etc) ?If you use .env files you can include them in your package.json\nand use npm to source/start them.Example:then run the npm scripts:Its described here https://gist.github.com/ericelliott/4152984\nAll credit to Eric ElliotConvict is another option that adds a schema for validation.  Like nconf, it supports loading settings from any combination of environment variables, arguments, files, and json objects.Example from the README:Getting started article:\nTaming Configurations with node-convictYou can use Konfig for environment specific config files. It loads json or yaml config files automatically, it has default value and dynamic configuration features.An example from Konfig repo:In development:In production, assume we start application with $ NODE_ENV=production PORT=4567 node app.jsMore details : https://github.com/vngrs/konfigI\'m going to throw my hat into the ring here because none of these answers address all the critical components that pretty much any system needs. Considerations:Here\'s how I do my configuration:I use plain-old javascript files for configuration so I have the full power of the javascript langauge (including comments and the ability to do things like load the default config file in the environment-specific file so they can then be overridden). If you want to use environment variables, you can load them inside those config files (tho I recommend against using env vars for the same reason I don\'t recommend using json files - you don\'t have the power of a programming language to construct your config).The reason each key is in a separate file is for installer use. This allows you to have an installer that creates keys on-machine and stores them in the keys folder. Without this, your installer might fail when you load your configuration file that can\'t access your keys. This way you can traverse the directory and load any key files that are in that folder without having to worry about what exists and what doesn\'t in any given version of your code. Since you probably have keys loaded in your private configuration, you definitely don\'t want to load your private config in any frontend code. While its probably strictly more ideal to completely separate your frontend codebase from your backend, a lot of times that PITA is a big enough barrier to prevent people from doing it, thus private vs public config. But there\'s two things I do to prevent private config being loaded in the frontend:One last thing: your configuration should be loaded into the browser via a completely separate file than any of your other frontend code. If you bundle your frontend code, the public configuration should be built as a completely separate bundle. Otherwise, your config isn\'t really config anymore - its just part of your code. Config needs to be able to be different on different machines. an alt example I just used because I wanted more flexibility than a typical .json file but didn\'t want it abstracted away into a library which would require a dependency is something like this. Basically, exporting a function invoked immediately which returned an object with values I wanted set. Gives a lot of flexibility. There is a much better explanation with full example here. Using Config Files in Node.jsI am a bit late in the game, but I couldn\'t find what I needed here- or anywhere else - so I wrote something myself.My requirements for a configuration mechanism are the following: Even though I care less about supporting environments - the will explain how to add it easily to my solutionsendPublicConfiguration - a route that will expose the public configuration and assign it to a global variable. For example the code below will expose the public configuration as global variable myConf in the front-end. By default it will use the global variable name conf. app.get("/backend/conf", require("conf").sendPublicConfiguration);Even though I don\'t find an "environment support" useful, maybe someone will. To add environment support you need to change the meConf require statement to something like this  (pseudocode) if ( environment == "production" ) {\n        meConf = require("../conf/dev/meConf").production;\n   }if ( environment == "development" ) {\n        meConf = require("../conf/dev/meConf").development;\n   }Similarly you can have a file per environmentand import the right one. \nThe rest of the logic stays the same.I know this is a really old post. But I want to share my module for configuring environment variables, I think it is very flexible solution.\nHere is the module json-configuratorThen you can use process.env.NODE_ENV to get all the variables for your environment.In addition to the nconf module mentioned in this answer, and node-config mentioned in this answer, there are also node-iniparser and IniReader, which appear to be simpler .ini configuration file parsers.I just recently released a small module to load any type of configuration files. \nIt\'s pretty straight-forward, you can check it at https://github.com/flesler/config-nodeYou can use pconf: https://www.npmjs.com/package/pconfExample:For those who are visiting this old thread here is a package I find to be good.https://www.npmjs.org/package/configI tryied some of suggested solutions here, but was not sattisfied with them, so I created my own module. It is called mikro-config and the main difference is that it honors convention over configuration, so you can just require the module and start using it. You store your configuration in either plain js, or json files from /config folder. First it loads default.js file, then all other files from /config directory, then it loads environment specific configuration based on $NODE_ENV variable. It also allows to override this configuration for local development with local.js or environment specific /config/env/$NODE_ENV.local.js. You can take at look at it here:https://www.npmjs.com/package/mikro-confighttps://github.com/B4nan/mikro-configFor long, I used to use the approach mentioned in the solution here. There is a concern however, about security of the secrets in clear text. You can use another package on top of config so that the security bits are taken care of.
