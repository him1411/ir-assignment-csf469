How do I get git to use a proxy server?I need to check out code from a git server, it shows "Request timed out" every time. How do I get around this? Alternatively, how can I set a proxy server?Command to use:If you decide at any time to reset this proxy and work without proxy:Command to use:Finally, to check the currently set proxy:This worked for me, in windows XP behind a corporate firewall.I didnt have to install any local proxy or any other software besides git v1.771  from http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list?can=3proxyuser= the proxy user I was assigned by our IT dept, in my case it is the same windows user I use to log in to my PC, the Active Directory userproxypwd= the password of my proxy userproxy.server.com:8080 = the proxy name and port, I got it from Control Panel, Internet Options, Connections, Lan Settings button, Advanced button inside the Proxy Server section, use the servername and port on the first (http) row.mygithubuser = the user I use to log in to github.commygithubpwd = the password for my github.com userrepoUser = the user owner of the reporepoName = the name of the repoSet a system variable named http_proxy with the value of ProxyServer:Port.\nThat is the simplest solution. Respectively, use https_proxy as daefu pointed out in the comments.Setting gitproxy (as sleske mentions) is another option, but that requires a "command", which is not as straightforward as the above solution.References:\nhttp://bardofschool.blogspot.com/2008/11/use-git-behind-proxy.htmlIf the command line way of configuring your proxy server doesn\'t work,\nyou can probably just edit .gitconfig (in the root of your profile, which may hide both in C:\\Documents and Settings and on some network drive) and add this:YMMV though, this only covers the first step of the command line configuration. You may have to edit the system git configuration too and I have no idea where they hid that.If you are using ubuntu, then do the following ...Step 1 : Install corkscrewStep 2 : Write a script named git-proxy.sh and add the followingStep 3 : Make the script executableStep 4 : Set up the proxy command for GIT by setting the environment variableNow use the git commands,such asAs an alternative to using git config --global http.proxy address:port, you can set the proxy on the command line:The advantage is the proxy is not persistently set.  Under Bash you might set an alias:For the git protocol (git://...), install socat and write a script such as:make it executable, put it in your path, and in your ~/.gitconfig set core.gitproxy to the name of that script.Try to put the following to the ~/.gitconfig file:I work on Windows XP at work(state/gov), so I did my research and found this here and it worked for me. Hope this helps :)The http_proxy Environment VariableIf you use a proxy server or firewall, you may need to set the http_proxy environment variable in order to access some url from commandline.\nExample : Installing ppm for perl or applying rpm in linux ,updating ubuntuSet the http_proxy variable with the hostname or IP address of the proxy server:\nhttp_proxy=http:// [proxy.example.org]If the proxy server requires a user name and password, include them in the following form:\nhttp_proxy=http:// [username:password@proxy.example.org]If the proxy server uses a port other than 80, include the port number:\nhttp_proxy=http:// [username:password@proxy.example.org:8080]Windows XPLinux, Solaris or HP-UXSet the http_proxy environment variable using the command specific to your shell (e.g. set or export). To make this change persistent, add the command to the appropriate profile file for the shell. For example, in bash, add a line like the following to your .bash_profile or .bashrc file:Setting git proxy on terminalif Set it globally onceif you want to set proxy for only one git project\n(there may be some situations where you may not want to use same proxy or any proxy at all for some git connections)if you want to display current proxy settingsif you want to remove proxy globallyif you want to remove proxy for only one git rootIf you have tsocks or proxychains installed and configured, you canorFor windows users: if git config or set http_proxy= doesn\'t work, this answer may help:replace the git:// protocol of the git repository with http://. Note, you\'ll have to set the http_proxy first, anyways.Faced same issue because of multiple .gitconfig files in windows, followed below steps to fix the same:Step 1: Open Git BASHStep 2: Look for .gitconfig, executing following command:Step 3: Copy the below content in .gitconfig:
