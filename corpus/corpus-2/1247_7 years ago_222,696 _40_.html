In YAML, I have a string that\'s very long. I want to keep this within the 80-column (or so) view of my editor, so I\'d like to break the string. What\'s the syntax for this?In other words, I have this:and I\'d like to have this (or something to this effect):I\'d like to use quotes as above, so I don\'t need to escape anything within the string.Using yaml folded style, each line break is replaced by a space. The indention in each line will be ignored.http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/yaml/yaml_format.htmlThere are 5 6 NINE (or 63*, depending how you count) different ways to write multi-line strings in YAML.These allow escaping, and add a new line (\\n) to the end of your string.> Folded style removes the newlines within the string (but adds one at the end):\xe2\x86\x92 this is my very very very long string\\n| Literal style turns newlines within the string into literal newlines, and adds one at the end:\xe2\x86\x92 this is my very very very\\nlong string\\nHere\'s the official definition from the YAML Spec 1.2Scalar content can be written in block notation, using a literal style (indicated by \xe2\x80\x9c|\xe2\x80\x9d) where all line breaks are significant. Alternatively, they can be written with the folded style (denoted by \xe2\x80\x9c>\xe2\x80\x9d) where each line break is folded to a space unless it ends an empty or a more-indented line.You can control the handling of the final new line in the string, and any trailing blank lines (\\n\\n) by adding a block chomping indicator character:These have limited escaping, and construct a single-line string with no new line characters. They can begin on the same line as the key, or with additional newlines first.plain style (no escaping, no # or : combinations, limits on first character):double-quoted style (\\ and " must be escaped by \\, newlines can be inserted with a literal \\n sequence, lines can be concatenated without spaces with trailing \\):→ "this is my very very \\"very\\" loooong string.\\n\\nLove, YAML."single-quoted style (literal \' must be doubled, no special characters, possibly useful for expressing strings starting with double quotes):→ "this is my very very \\"very\\" long string, isn\'t it."In this table, _ means space character. \\n means "newline character" (\\n in JavaScript), except for the "in-line newlines" row, where it means literally a backslash and an n).Note the trailing spaces on the line before "spaces."Just in case the above isn\'t enough for you, you can add a "block indentation indicator" (after your block chomping indicator, if you have one):*2 block styles, each with 2 possible block chomping indicators (or none), and with 9 possible indentation indicators (or none), 1 plain style and 2 quoted styles: 2 x (2 + 1) x (9 + 1) + 1 + 2 = 63To preserve newlines use |, for example:is translated to "This is a very long sentence\xe2\x80\x8c\\n that spans several lines in the YAML\xe2\x80\x8c\\n but which will be rendered as a string\xe2\x80\x8c\\n with newlines preserved."You might not believe it, but YAML can do multi-line keys too:In case you\'re using yml and Twig for translations in Symfony, and want to use multi-line translations in Javascript, a carriage return is added right after the translation. So even the following code:var javascriptVariable = "{{- \'key\'|trans -}}";Which has the following yml translation:Will still result into the following code in html:So, the minus sign in Twig does not solve this. The solution is to add this minus sign after the greater than sign in yml:Will have the proper result, multi line translation on one line in Twig:To concatenate long lines without whitespace, use double quotes and escape the newlines with backslashes:(Thanks @Tobia)For situations were the string might contain spaces or not, I prefer double quotes and line continuation with backslashes:But note about the pitfall for the case that a continuation line begins with a space, it needs to be escaped (because it will be stripped away elsewhere:If the string contains line breaks, this needs to be written in C style \\n.See also this question.
