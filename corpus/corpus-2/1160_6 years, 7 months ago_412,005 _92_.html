Is there any way to select/manipulate CSS pseudo-elements such as ::before and ::after (and the old version with one semi-colon) using jQuery?For example, my stylesheet has the following rule:How can I change \'foo\' to \'bar\' using jQuery?You could also pass the content to the pseudo element with a data attribute and then use jQuery to manipulate that:In HTML:In jQuery:In CSS: If you want to prevent the \'other text\' from showing up, you could combine this with seucolega\'s solution like this:In HTML:In jQuery:In CSS: You\'d think this would be a simple question to answer, with everything else that jQuery can do. Unfortunately, the problem comes down to a technical issue: css :after and :before rules aren\'t part of the DOM, and therefore can\'t be altered using jQuery\'s DOM methods.There are ways to manipulate these elements using JavaScript and/or CSS workarounds; which one you use depends on your exact requirements.I\'m going to start with what\'s widely considered the "best" approach:In this approach, you\'ve already created a class in your CSS with a different :after or :before style. Place this "new" class later in your stylesheet to make sure it overrides:Then you can easily add or remove this class using jQuery (or vanilla JavaScript):It\'s possible to use JavaScript to add styles directly to the document stylesheet, including :after and :before styles. jQuery doesn\'t provide a convenient shortcut, but fortunately the JS isn\'t that complicated:.addRule() and the related .insertRule() methods are fairly well-supported today. As a variation, you can also use jQuery to add an entirely new stylesheet to the document, but the necessary code isn\'t any cleaner:If we\'re talking about "manipulating" the values, not just adding to them, we can also read the existing :after or :before styles using a different approach:We can replace document.querySelector(\'p\') with $(\'p\')[0] when using jQuery, for slightly shorter code.You can also to use attr() in your CSS to read a particular DOM attribute. (If a browser supports :before, it supports attr() as well.) By combining this with content: in some carefully-prepared CSS, we can change the content (but not other properties, like margin or color) of :before and :after dynamically:JS:This can be combined with the second technique if the CSS can\'t be prepared ahead of time:Although they are rendered by browsers through CSS as if they were like other real DOM elements, pseudo-elements themselves are not part of the DOM, and thus you can\'t select and manipulate them directly with jQuery (or any JavaScript APIs for that matter, not even the Selectors API).You can always find other ways around it, though, for example:Applying the styles to the pseudo-elements of one or more arbitrary classes, then toggling between classes using jQuery (see seucolega\'s answer for a quick example) \xe2\x80\x94 this is the idiomatic way as it makes use of simple selectors (which pseudo-elements are not) to distinguish between elements and element states, the way they\'re intended to be usedManipulating the styles being applied to said pseudo-elements, by altering the document stylesheet, which is much more of a hackBut you still can\'t access them directly as ultimately they\'re only visible to the rendering engine, and not available through any scripting APIs (except possibly the CSSOM, which is not exposed by jQuery beyond .css() which only works for actual elements and not pseudo-elements either).This applies to any pseudo-elements whose styles you\'re trying to modify with jQuery, and not just :before and :after.You can\'t select pseudo elements in jQuery because they are not part of DOM.\nBut you can add an specific class to the father element and control its pseudo elements in CSS.EXAMPLEIn jQuery:In CSS:In the line of what Christian suggests, you could also do:Here is the way to access :after and :before style properties, defined in css:I\'ve answered this question here already, but to be super-cool I\'ll repeat myself for you.The answer should be Yes & No. You can not select an element via pseudo-selector, but you can add a new rule to your stylesheet with javascript.I made something that should work for you:http://fiddle.jshell.net/MDyxg/1/IF you want to to manipulate the ::before or ::after sudo elements entirely through CSS, you could do it JS. See below;Notice how the <style> element has an ID, which you can use to remove it and append to it again if your style changes dynamically.This way, your element is style exactly how you want it through CSS, with the help of JS.one working but not very efficient way is to add a rule to the document with the new content and reference it with a class. depending on what is needed the class might need an unique id for each value in content.Here is the HTML:Computed style on \'before\' was content: "VERIFY TO WATCH";Here is my two lines of jQuery, which use the idea of adding an extra class to specifically reference this element and then appending a style tag (with an !important tag) to changes the CSS of the sudo-element\'s content value:$("span.play:eq(0)").addClass(\'G\');$(\'body\').append("<style>.G:before{content:\'NewText\' !important}</style>");Thank you all!\ni managed to do what i wanted :D\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/Tfc9j/42/\nhere take a looki wanted to have the opacity of an outer div to be different from the opacity of the internal div and that change with a click somwewhere ;)\nThanks!You may create a fake property or use an existing one and inherit it in the pseudo-element\'s stylesheet.It seems it doesn\'t work for "content" property :(This is not practical as i did not write this for real world uses, just to give you a example of what can be achieved. this currently add\'s a / or appends a Style element which contains your necessary attribute\'s which will take affect on the target element\'s after Pseudo element.this can be used as and as after: and before: pseudo elements are not directly accessible through DOM it is currently not possible to edit the Specific values of the css freely.my way was just a example and its not good for practice, you can modify it try some of your own tricks and make it correct for real world usage.so do your own experimentation\'s with this and others!regards - Adarsh Hegde. Why adding classes or attributes when you can just append a style to headThere are many answers here but no answer helps to manipulate the css of :before or :after , not even the accepted one.Here is how I propose to do it. Lets suppose your HTML is like this:And then you are setting its :before in CSS and designing it like:Please notice I also set content attribute in element itself so that you can take it out easily later.\nNow there is a button clicking on which, you want to change the color of :before to green and its font-size to 30px. You can achieve that as follows:Define a css with your required style on some class .activeS :Now you can change :before style by adding the class to your :before element as follows:If you just want to get content of :before, it can be done as:Ultimately if you want to dynamically change :before content by jQuery, You can achieve that as follows:Clicking on above "changeBefore" button will change :before content of #something into \'22\' which is a dynamic value.I hope it helpsYou can use my plugin for this purpose.JQuery:The values should be specified, as in the normal function of jQuery.cssIn addition, you can also get the value of the pseudo-element parameter, as in the normal function of jQuery.css:JS:GitHub: https://github.com/yuri-spivak/managing-the-properties-of-pseudo-elements/Someone else commented on appending to the head element with a full style element and that\'s not bad if you\'re only doing it once but if you need to reset it more than once you\'ll end up with a ton of style elements. So to prevent that I created a blank style element in the head with an id and replace the innerHTML of it like this:Then the JavaScript would look like this: Now in my case I needed this to set the height of a before element based on the height of another and it will change on resize so using this I can run setHeight() every time the window is resized and it will  replace the <style> properly.Hope that helps someone who was stuck trying to do the same thing.
