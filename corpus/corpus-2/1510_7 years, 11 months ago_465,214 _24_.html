This question already has an answer here:I cloned a Git repository and then tried to roll it back to a particular commit early on in the development process. Everything that was added to the repository after that point is unimportant to me so I want to omit all subsequent changes from my local source code.However, when I try to roll back in the GUI tool it doesn\'t update my local file system - I always end up with the latest source code for the project.What\'s the correct way to just get the source for a repository as of a particular commit in the project\'s history and omit all later updates?Notes:git reset without the --hard option resets the commit history, but not the files. With the --hard option the files in working tree are also reset. (credited user)If you wish to commit that state so that the remote repository also points to the rolled back commit do: git push <reponame> -f (credited user)Because of changes to how tracking branches are created and pushed I no longer recommend renaming branches. This is what I recommend now:Make a copy of the branch at its current state:(The git branch <name> command will leave you with your current branch still checked out.)Reset your current branch to your desired commit with git reset:(Replace c2e7af2b51 with the commit that you want to go back to.)When you decide that your crazy experiment branch doesn\'t contain anything useful, you can delete it with:It\'s always nice when you\'re starting out with history-modifying git commands (reset, rebase) to create backup branches before you run them. Eventually once you\'re comfortable you won\'t find it necessary. If you do modify your history in a way that you don\'t want and haven\'t created a backup branch, look into git reflog. Git keeps commits around for quite a while even if there are no branches or tags pointing to them.A slightly less scary way to do this than the git reset --hard method is to create a new branch. Let\'s assume that you\'re on the master branch and the commit you want to go back to is c2e7af2b51.Rename your current master branch:Check out your good commit:Make your new master branch here:Now you still have your crazy experiment around if you want to look at it later, but your master branch is back at your last known good point, ready to be added to. If you really want to throw away your experiment, you can use:For those with a git gui bent, you can also use gitk. Right click on the commit you want to return to and select "Reset master branch to here". Then choose hard from the next menu.When you say the \'GUI Tool\', I assume you\'re using Git For Windows.IMPORTANT, I would highly recommend creating a new branch to do this on if you haven\'t already. That way your master can remain the same while you test out your changes.With the GUI you need to \'roll back this commit\' like you have with the history on the right of your view. Then you will notice you have all the unwanted files as changes to commit on the left.\nNow you need to right click on the grey title above all the uncommited files and select \'disregard changes\'. This will set your files back to how they were in this version.
