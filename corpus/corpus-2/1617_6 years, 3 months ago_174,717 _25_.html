I am changing the value of an EditText on keyListener.But when I change the text the cursor is moving to the beginning of the EditText.\nI need the cursor to be at the end of the text.How to move the cursor to the end of the text in a EditText.Try this:There is a function called append for ediitext which appends the string value to current edittext value and places the cursor at the end of the value.\nYou can have the string value as the current ediitext value itself and call append();If you called setText before and the new text didn\'t get layout phase call setSelection in a separate runnable fired by View.post(Runnable) (repost from this topic).So, for me this code works:You could also place the cursor at the end of the text in the EditText view like this:This is another possible solution: Just try this solution if it doesn\'t work for any reason:Below Code is to set the cursor to the starting position:Below Code is to set the cursor to the end of the EditText:Below Code is to place the cursor after the second character:You should be able to achieve that with the EditText\'s method setSelection(), see herei think this can achieve what you want.It work good for me!If your EditText is not clear:All the other codes I\'ve tested didn\'t work good due to the fact that the user could still place the caret/cursor wherever in the middle of the string (ex.: 12|3.00 - where | is the cursor). My solution always puts the cursor in the end of the string whenever the touch occurs on the EditText.The ultimate solution is:@string/amount="0.00"\n@string/zero_value="0.00"Hope it helps!This does the trick safely:        If you want to select all text and just entering new text instead of old one, you can usesimilar to @Anh Duy\'s answer, but it didnt work for me. i also needed the cursor to move to the end only when the user taps the edit text and still be able to select the position of the cursor afterwards, this is the only code that has worked for meThis works
