This question already has an answer here:How can I uncommit my last commit in git?Is it or If you aren\'t totally sure what you mean by "uncommit" and don\'t know if you want to use git reset, please see "Revert to a previous Git commit".If you\'re trying to understand git reset better, please see "Can you explain what "git reset" does in plain English?".If you know you want to use git reset, it still depends what you mean by "uncommit". If all you want to do is undo the act of committing, leaving everything else intact, use:If you want to undo the act of committing and everything you\'d staged, but leave the work tree (your files intact):And if you actually want to completely undo it, throwing away all uncommitted changes, resetting everything to the previous commit (as the original question asked):The original question also asked it\'s HEAD^ not HEAD. HEAD refers to the current commit - generally, the tip of the currently checked-out branch. The ^ is a notation which can be attached to any commit specifier, and means "the commit before". So, HEAD^ is the commit before the current one, just as master^ is the commit before the tip of the master branch.Here\'s the portion of the git-rev-parse documentation describing all of the ways to specify commits (^ is just a basic one among many).To keep the changes from the commit you want to undoTo destroy the changes from the commit you want to undoYou can also sayto go back 2 commits.Edit: As charsi mentioned, if you are on Windows you will need to put HEAD or commit hash in quotes.It\'s the latter.git reset --hard HEAD^, if you want to also throw away the changes you made. git reset --soft HEAD^ will keep the modified changes in your working tree.Be careful, reset --hard will remove your local (uncommitted) modifications, too.note: if you\'re on windows you\'ll need to quote the HEAD^ soJust a note - if you\'re using ZSH and see the errorYou need to escape the ^If you haven\'t pushed your changes yet use git reset --soft [Hash for one commit] to rollback to a specific commit. --soft tells git to keep the changes being rolled back (i.e., mark the files as modified). --hard tells git to delete the changes being rolled back.If you commit to the wrong branchWhile on the wrong branch:Then you can follow one the methods suggested above to remove your commit from the first branch.Be careful with that.But you can use the rebase commandA vi will open and all you have to do is delete the line with the commit. Also can read instructions that was shown in proper edition @ vi, a couple of things can be performed on this mode
