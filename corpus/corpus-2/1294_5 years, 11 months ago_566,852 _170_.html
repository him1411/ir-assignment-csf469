I have created a self-signed SSL certificate for the localhost CN. Firefox accepts this certificate after initially complaining about it, as expected. Chrome and IE, however, refuse to accept it, even after adding the certificate to the system certificate store under Trusted Roots. Even though the certificate is listed as correctly installed when I click "View certificate information" in Chrome\'s HTTPS popup, it still insists the certificate cannot be trusted.What am I supposed to do to get Chrome to accept the certificate and stop complaining about it?This worked for me:You should get the nice green lock on your pages now.EDIT: I tried this again on a new machine and the certificate did not appear on the Manage Certificates window just by continuing from the red untrusted certificate page. I had to do the following:NOT FOR PRODSimply paste this in your chrome:You should see highlighted text saying:\nAllow invalid certificates for resources loaded from localhostClick Enable. On the Mac, you can use the Keychain Access utility to add the self-signed certificate to the System keychain, and Chrome will then accept it. I found the step-by-step instructions here:Google Chrome, Mac OS X and Self-Signed SSL CertificatesBasically:UPDATE 02/2016: Better Instructions for Mac Users Can be Found Here.On the site you want to add, right-click the red lock icon in the address bar:Click the tab labeled Connection, then click Certificate InformationClick the Details tab, the click the button Copy to File.... This will open the Certificate Export Wizard, click Next to get to the Export File Format screen.Choose DER encoded binary X.509 (.CER), click NextClick Browse... and save the file to your computer. Name it something descriptive. Click Next, then click Finish.Open Chrome settings, scroll to the bottom, and click Show advanced settings...Under HTTPS/SSL, click Manage certificates...Click the Trusted Root Certification Authorities tab, then click the Import...\nbutton. This opens the Certificate Import Wizard. Click Next to get to the File to Import screen. Click Browse... and select the certificate file you saved earlier, then click Next.Select Place all certificates in the following store. The selected store should be Trusted Root Certification Authorities. If it isn\'t, click Browse... and select it. Click Next and FinishClick Yes on the security warning.Restart Chrome.If you\'re using Linux, you can also follow this official wiki pages:Basically:Now, the following command will add the certificate (where YOUR_FILE is your exported file):To list all your certificates, run the following command:If it still doesn\'t work, you could be affected by this bug:\nIssue 55050:   Ubuntu SSL error 8179P.S. Please also make sure that you have libnss3-tools, before you can use above commands.If you don\'t have, please install it by:As a bonus, you can use the following handy scripts:Usage:Run Chrome with --auto-ssl-client-auth parametergoogle-chrome --auto-ssl-client-authUPDATE FOR CHROME 58+ (RELEASED 2017-04-19)As of Chrome 58, identifying the host using only commonName is being removed. See further discussion here and bug tracker here. In the past, subjectAltName was used only for multi-host certs so some internal CA tools may not include them.If your self-signed certs worked fine in the past but suddenly started generating errors in Chrome 58, this is why.So whatever method you are using to generate your self-signed cert (or cert signed by a self-signed CA), ensure that the server\'s cert contains a subjectAltName with the proper DNS and/or IP entry/entries, even if it\'s just for a single host.For openssl, this means your config will have something similar to the following for a single host:or for multiple hosts:In Chrome\'s cert viewer (which has moved to "Security" tab under F12) you should see it listed under Extensions as Certificate Subject Alternative Name:TEMPORARY WORKAROUNDIt is possible to fall back to the old commonName behavior until Chrome 65, using the following setting: EnableCommonNameFallbackForLocalAnchorsOn Windows, this can be set on a single PC using the following registry command (thanks @Meengla):On Mac, the following command can be used (thanks @BugsBunny):On Linux, create a policy file such as /etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/EnableCommonNameFallbackFor\xe2\x80\x8c\xe2\x80\x8bLocalAnchors.json with the contents: { "EnableCommonNameFallbackForLocalAnchors": true } (thanks @seanf)More details about setting these policies for various platforms, including setting them via Windows GPO, can be found at the top of the linked page as well as the Chromium policy template guide and the Administrators guide.Again, these workarounds are temporary until version 65!If you\'re on a mac and not seeing the export tab or how to get the certificate this worked for me:Click "Certificate Information"Now you should see this: \nDrag that little certificate icon do your desktop (or anywhere).Double click the .cer file that was downloaded, this should import it into your keychain and open Keychain Access to your list of certificates.In some cases, this is enough and you can now refresh the page.Otherwise:Now reload the page in question and it should be problem solved! Hope this helps.To make this a little easier you can use the following script (source):Save the following script as whitelist_ssl_certificate.sh:Make the script executable (from the shell):Run the script for the domain you want (simply copy/pasting the full url works):For a test environmentYou can use --ignore-certificate-errors as a command line parameter when launching chrome (Working on Version 28.0.1500.52 on Ubuntu).This will cause it to ignore the errors and connect without warning. If you already have a version of chrome running, you will need to close this before relaunching from the command line or it will open a new window but ignore the parameters.I configure Intellij to launch chrome this way when doing debugging, as the test servers never have valid certificates.I wouldn\'t recommend normal browsing like this though, as certificate checks are an important security feature, but this may be helpful to some.On the mac, you can create a certificate that\'s fully trusted by Chrome and Safari, at the system level by doing the followingIf you want to create a new self signed cert that\'s fully trusted using your own root authority, you can do it using these scripts.To allow the self signed certificates to be FULLY trusted in Chrome and Safari, you need to import a new certificate authority into your Mac. To do so follow these instructions, or the more detailed instructions on this general process on the mitmproxy website:and as a bonus, if you need java clients to trust the certificates, you can do so by importing your certs into the java keystore. Note this will remove the cert from the keystore if it already exists, as it needs to to update it in case things change. It of course only does this for the certs being imported.As stated by @smihael in the comments there is a new secret bypass phrase that can be typed into the error page to have Chrome proceed despite the security error: badidea (in earlier versions of Chrome, type danger). DO NOT USE THIS UNLESS YOU UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHY YOU NEED IT!

Otherwise, setup a TCP tunnel to listen on port 8090 locally and connect to broken-remote-site.com on port 443, ensure you have socat installed and run something like this in a terminal window:socat tcp-listen:8090,reuseaddr,fork tcp:broken-remote-site.com:443Go to https://localhost:8090 in your browser.As someone has noted, you need to restart ALL of Chrome, not just the browser windows. The fastest way to do this is to open a tab to...chrome://restartAre you sure the address the site is being served up as is the same as the certificate? I had the same problems with Chrome and a self-signed cert, but in the end I found it was just incredibly picky about the validation of the domain name on the cert (as it should be).Chrome doesn\'t have it\'s own cert store and uses Window\'s own. However Chrome provides no way to import certs into the store so you should add them via IE instead.Installing Certificates in Google ChromeInstalling Certificates in Internet ExplorerAlso take a look at this for a couple of different approaches to creating self-signed certs (I\'m assuming you\'re using IIS as you haven\'t mentioned).How to Create a Self Signed Certificate in IIS 7I went down the process of using what bjnord suggested which was: \nGoogle Chrome, Mac OS X and Self-Signed SSL CertificatesWhat is shown in the blog did not work. However, one of the comments to the blog was gold: sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain site.crtYou\'ll need to follow the blog on how to get the cert file, after that you can use the command above and should be good to go.For development purposes on Windows you canadd to Chrome shortcut flag --ignore-certificate-errorsIt expected to ignore certificate errors and allow you to access invalid certificate websites.\nBetter detailed instructions in https://support.opendns.com/entries/66657664.When clicking the little crossed out lock icon next to the URL, you\'ll get a box looking like this:After clicking the Certificate information link, you\'ll see the following dialog:It tells you which certificate store is the correct one, it\'s the Trusted Root Certification Authorities store.You can either use one of the methods outlined in the other answers to add the certificate to that store or use:WINDOWS JUN/2017 Windows Server 2012I followed @Brad Parks answer. On Windows you should import rootCA.pem in Trusted Root Certificates Authorities store.I did the following steps:Where v3.ext is:Then, in my case I have a self hosted web app, so I need to bind certificate with IP address and port, certificate should be on MY store with private key information, so I exported to pfx format.With mmc console (File/Add or Remove Snap-ins/Certificates/Add/Computert Account/LocalComputer/OK) I imported pfx file in Personal store.Later I used this command to bind certificate (you could also use HttpConfig tool):certhash=Certificate Thumprintappid=GUID (your choice)First I tried to import the certificate "device.crt" on Trusted Root Certificates Authorities in different ways but I\'m still getting same error:But I realized that I should import certificate of root authority not certificate for domain.

Help is appreciated on this point.With makecert it is not possible add SAN information.\nWith New-SelfSignedCertificate (Powershell) you could add SAN information, it also works. As of Chrome 58+ I started getting certificate error on macOS due missing SAN.

Note that when the certificate is not properly installed in the store, the error is ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID.As hinted by the name of the error, this comment, and this question, the problem was lying in the declared domain name in the certificate. When prompted for the "Common Name" while generating the certificate, I had to enter the domain name I was using to access the site (localhost in my case). I restarted Chrome using chrome://restart and it was finally happy with this new certificate.2017-06-27 newest method:then, add yoursite.crt and yoursite.key to your nginx conf.from: https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/854SSL / HTTPS localhost fix on the mac / osx:Click the red lock with the cross in your address bar when trying to open your https localhost environment.

Restart chrome and it should work.What am I supposed to do to get Chrome to accept the certificate and stop complaining about it?You should create a PKI with;1) self-signed Root CA.\n2) sub / intermediate certificate [signed by Root CA].\n3) normal / end-entity certificate [signed either by Root CA or sub-CA]\n   (commonName or subjectAltName (SAN) as localhost)\n   (also include https://localhost/ as the URI in SAN).\n4) Import / Install that Root CA in your Windows OS (because you mentioned IE. Google Chrome is using the same resources while looking for certificates chain - https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy ) as \'Trusted Root Certification Authorities\'.\n5) Install that end-entity certificate as your web server certificate, and it stops complaining that error message.Hope this helps.Fix for Chrome on Windows. First, you need to export the certificate.To importHere is a solution using only Java 8 keytool.exe instead of openssl:You could also use pipes instead of files, but with the files, you can check the intermediate results if something goes wrong.\nSSL tested with IE11, Edge, FF54, Chrome60 on windows and Chrome60 on Android.Please change the default password before using the script.This post is already flooded with responses, but I created a bash script based on some of the other answers to make it easier to generate a self-signed TLS certificate valid in Chrome (Tested in Chrome 61.x).
