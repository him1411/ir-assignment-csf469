How do you set a default value for a MySQL Datetime column?In SQL Server it\'s getdate(). What is the equivalant for MySQL? I\'m using MySQL 5.x if that is a factor.IMPORTANT EDIT:\nIt is now possible to achieve this with DATETIME fields since MySQL 5.6.5, take a look at the other post below...Previous versions can\'t do that with DATETIME...But you can do it with TIMESTAMP:In version 5.6.5, it is possible to set a default value on a datetime column, and even make a column that will update when the row is updated. The type definition:Reference:\nhttp://optimize-this.blogspot.com/2012/04/datetime-default-now-finally-available.htmlMySQL (before version 5.6.5) does not allow functions to be used for default DateTime values.  TIMESTAMP is not suitable due to its odd behavior and is not recommended for use as input data. (See MySQL Data Type Defaults.)That said, you can accomplish this by creating a Trigger.I have a table with a DateCreated field of type DateTime.  I created a trigger on that table "Before Insert" and "SET NEW.DateCreated=NOW()" and it works great.I hope this helps somebody.For me the trigger approach has worked the best, but I found a snag with the approach.  Consider the basic trigger to set a date field to the current time on insert:This is usually great, but say you want to set the field manually via INSERT statement, like so:What happens is that the trigger immediately overwrites your provided value for the field, and so the only way to set a non-current time is a follow up UPDATE statement--yuck!  To override this behavior when a value is provided, try this slightly modified trigger with the IFNULL operator:This gives the best of both worlds: you can provide a value for your date column and it will take, and otherwise it\'ll default to the current time.  It\'s still ghetto relative to something clean like DEFAULT GETDATE() in the table definition, but we\'re getting closer!I was able to solve this using this alter statement on my table that had two datetime fields.This works as you would expect the now() function to work. Inserting nulls or ignoring the created_dt and updated_dt fields results in a perfect timestamp value in both fields. Any update to the row changes the updated_dt. If you insert records via the MySQL query browser you needed one more step, a trigger to handle the created_dt with a new timestamp.The trigger can be whatever you want I just like the naming convention [trig]_[my_table_name]_[insert]You can use triggers to do this type of stuff.this is indeed terrible news.here is a long pending bug/feature request for this. that discussion also talks about the limitations of timestamp data type.I am seriously wondering what is the issue with getting this thing implemented.MySQL 5.6 has fixed this problem.For all those who lost heart trying to set a default DATETIME value in MySQL, I know exactly how you feel/felt. So here is is:Carefully observe that I haven\'t added single quotes/double quotes around the 0I\'m literally jumping after solving this one :DFor all who use the TIMESTAMP column as a solution i want to second the following limitation from the manual:http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/datetime.html"The TIMESTAMP data type has a range of \'1970-01-01 00:00:01\' UTC to \'2038-01-19 03:14:07\' UTC. It has varying properties, depending on the MySQL version and the SQL mode the server is running in. These properties are described later in this section. "So this will obviously break your software in about 28 years.I believe the only solution on the database side is to use triggers like mentioned in other answers.While defining multi-line triggers one has to change the delimiter as semicolon will be taken by MySQL compiler as end of trigger and generate error.\ne.g.You can use now() to set the value of a datetime column, but keep in mind that you can\'t use that as a default value.While you can\'t do this with DATETIME in the default definition, you can simply incorporate a select statement in your insert statement like this:Note the lack of quotes around the table.For MySQL 5.5Here is how to do it on MySQL 5.1:I have no clue why you have to enter the column name twice.If you are trying to set default value as NOW(), I don\'t think MySQL supports that. In MySQL, you cannot use a function or an expression as the default value for any type of column, except for the TIMESTAMP data type column, for which you can specify the CURRENT_TIMESTAMP as the default.In the above query to create \'testtable\', i used \'1999-12-12 12:12:12\' as default value for DATETIME column colnameI\'m running MySql Server 5.7.11 and this sentence:is not working. But the following: just works.  As a sidenote, it is mentioned in the mysql docs:  The DATE type is used for values with a date part but no time part. MySQL retrieves and displays DATE values in \'YYYY-MM-DD\' format. The supported range is \'1000-01-01\' to \'9999-12-31\'.even if they also say:Invalid DATE, DATETIME, or TIMESTAMP values are converted to the \xe2\x80\x9czero\xe2\x80\x9d value of the appropriate type (\'0000-00-00\' or \'0000-00-00 00:00:00\').Use the following code    If you have already created the table then you can use To change default value to current date timeTo change default value to \'2015-05-11 13:01:01\'If you are trying to set default value as NOW(),MySQL supports that you have to change the type of that column TIMESTAMP instead of DATETIME. TIMESTAMP  have current date and time as default..i think it will resolved your problem..Take for instance If I had a table named \'site\' with a created_at and an update_at column that were both DATETIME and need the default value of now, I could execute the following sql to achieve this.The sequence of statements is important because a table can not have two columns of type TIMESTAMP with default values of CUREENT TIMESTAMPThis is my trigger example:You can resolve the default timestamp. First consider which character set you are using for example if u taken utf8 this character set support all languages and if u taken laten1 this character set support only for English. Next setp if you are working under any project you should know client time zone and select you are client zone. This step are mandatory.
