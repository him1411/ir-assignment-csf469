Is there a consistent way across browsers to hide the new spin boxes that some browsers (such as Chrome) render for HTML input of type number?  I am looking for a CSS or JavaScript method to prevent the up/down arrows from appearing.This CSS effectively hides the spin-button for webkit browsers (have tested it in Chrome 7.0.517.44 and Safari Version 5.0.2 (6533.18.5)):You can always use the inspector (webkit, possibly Firebug for Firefox) to look for matched CSS properties for the elements you are interested in, look for Pseudo elemnts. This image shows results for an input element type="number":Firefox 29 currently adds support for number elements, so here\'s a snippet for hiding the spinners in webkit and moz based browsers:To add to existing answer...In current versions of Firefox, the (user agent) default value of the -moz-appearance property on these elements is number-input. Changing that to the value textfield effectively removes the spinner.In some cases, you may want the spinner to be hidden initially, and then appear on hover/focus. (This is currently the default behavior in Chrome). If so, you can use the following:In current versions of Chrome, the (user agent) default value of the -webkit-appearance property on these elements is already textfield. In order to remove the spinner, the -webkit-appearance property\'s value needs to be changed to none on the ::-webkit-outer-spin-button/::-webkit-inner-spin-button pseudo classes (it is -webkit-appearance: inner-spin-button by default).It\'s worth pointing out that margin: 0 is used to remove the margin in older versions of Chrome.Currently, as of writing this, here is the default user agent styling on the \'inner-spin-button\' pseudo class:According to Apple\xe2\x80\x99s user experience coding guide for mobile Safari, you can use the following to display a numeric keyboard in the iPhone browser:A pattern of \\d* will also work.Try using input type="tel" instead. It pops up a keyboard with numbers, and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t show spin boxes. It requires no JavaScript or plugins.I\'ve encountered this problem with a input[type="datetime-local"], which is similar to this problem.And I\'ve found a way to overcome this kind of problems.First, you must turn on chrome\'s shadow-root feature by "DevTools -> Settings -> General -> Elements -> Show user agent shadow DOM"Then you can see all shadowed DOM elements, for example, for <input type="number">, the full element with shadowed DOM is:And according to these info, you can draft some CSS to hide unwanted elements, just as @Josh said.Not what you asked for, but I do this because of a focus bug in WebKit with spinboxes:It might give you an idea to help with what you need.On Firefox for Ubuntu, just usingdid the trick for me.AddingWould lead me toUnknown pseudo-class or pseudo-element \xe2\x80\x98-webkit-outer-spin-button\xe2\x80\x99. \n  Ruleset ignored due to bad selector.everytime I tried. Same for the inner spin button.To make this work in Safari I found adding !important to the webkit adjustment forces the spin button to be hidden.I am still having trouble working out a solution for Opera as well.This is more better answer i would like to suggest on mouse over and without mouse overMaybe change the number input with javascript to text input when you don\'t want a spinner;and stop the user entering text;then have the javascript change it back in case you do want a spinner;it worked well for my purposesYou\'re using stuff that the specification is not final on, so I\'d say that no, there\'s going to be a completely consistent, cross-browser way of fixing this.just use input type="text", and use a form of javascript validation to make sure it\'s a number.
