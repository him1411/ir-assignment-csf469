I have two constructors which feed values to readonly fields.One constructor receives the values directly, and the other does some calculation and obtains the values, then sets the fields.Now here\'s the catch:Any ideas?Like this:If what you want can\'t be achieved satisfactorily without having the initialization in its own method (e.g. because you want to do too much before the initialization code, or wrap it in a try-finally, or whatever) you can have any or all constructors pass the readonly variables by reference to an initialization routine, which will then be able to manipulate them at will.Before the body of the constructor, use either:Example:I am improving upon supercat\'s answer. I guess the following can also be done:Here is an example that calls another constructor, then checks on the property it has set.When you inherit a class from a base class, you can invoke the base class constructor by instantiating the derived classOutput of the program is50 10 20You can also use this keyword invoke a constructor from another constructorThe output is 20.Yeah, you can call other method before of the call base or this!
