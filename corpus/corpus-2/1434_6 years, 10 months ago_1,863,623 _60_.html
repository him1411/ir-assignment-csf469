I\'m working on a project where all conversions from int to String are done like this:I\'m not familiar with Java. Is this usual practice or is something wrong, as I suppose?Normal ways would be Integer.toString(i) or String.valueOf(i).The concatenation will work, but it is unconventional and could be a bad smell as it suggests the author doesn\'t know about the two methods above (what else might they not know?).Java has special support for the + operator when used with strings (see the documentation) which translates the code you posted into:at compile-time. It\'s slightly less efficient (sb.append() ends up calling Integer.getChars(), which is what Integer.toString() would\'ve done anyway), but it works.To answer Grodriguez\'s comment: ** No, the compiler doesn\'t optimise out the empty string in this case - look:Initialise the StringBuilder:Append the empty string:Append the integer:Extract the final string:There\'s a proposal and ongoing work to change this behaviour, targetted for JDKÂ 9.It\'s acceptable, but I\'ve never written anything like that.  I\'d prefer this: It\'s not a good way.When doing conversion from int to string, this should be used:It\'s not only the optimization1. I don\'t likebecause it does not express what I really want to do.I don\'t want to append an integer to an (empty) string. I want to convert an integer to string:Or, not my prefered, but still better than concatenation, get a string representation of an object (integer):1. For code that is called very often, like in loops, optimization sure is also a point for not using concatenation.A lot of introductory University courses seem to teach this style, for two reasons (in my experience):It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require understanding of classes or methods. Usually, this is taught way before the word \xe2\x80\x9cclass\xe2\x80\x9d is ever mentioned \xe2\x80\x93 nor even method calls. So using something like String.valueOf(\xe2\x80\xa6) would confuse students.It is an illustration of \xe2\x80\x9coperator overloading\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 in fact, this was sold to us as the idiomatic overloaded operator (small wonder here, since Java doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow custom operator overloading).So it may either be born out of didactic necessity (although I\xe2\x80\x99d argue that this is just bad teaching) or be used to illustrate a principle that\xe2\x80\x99s otherwise quite hard to demonstrate in Java.The expression leads to string conversion of i at runtime. The overall type of the expression is String. i is first converted to an Integer object (new Integer(i)), then String.valueOf(Object obj) is called. So it is equivalent toObviously, this is slightly less performant than just calling String.valueOf(new Integer(i)) which will produce the very same result.The advantage of ""+i is that typing is easier/faster and some people might think, that it\'s easier to read. It is not a code smell as it does not indicate any deeper problem.(Reference: JLS 15.8.1)Personally, I don\'t see anything bad in this code.It\'s pretty useful when you want to log an int value, and the logger just accepts a string. I would say such a conversion is convenient when you need to call a method accepting a String, but you have an int value.As for the choice between Integer.toString or String.valueOf, it\'s all a matter of taste. String.valueOf calls the Integer.toString method by the way :)The other way I am aware of is from the Integer class:A concrete example (though I wouldn\'t think you need any):It also works for other primitive types, for instance Double.toString.See here for more details.This technique was taught in an undergraduate level introduction-to-Java class I took over a decade ago. However, I should note that, IIRC, we hadn\'t yet gotten to the String and Integer class methods.The technique is simple and quick to type. If all I\'m doing is printing something, I\'ll use it (for example, System.out.println("" + i);. However, I think it\'s not the best way to do a conversion, as it takes a second of thought to realize what\'s going on when it\'s being used this way. Also, if performance is a concern, it seems slower (more below, as well as in other answers).Personally, I prefer Integer.toString(), as it is obvious what\'s happening. String.valueOf() would be my second choice, as it seems to be confusing (witness the comments after darioo\'s answer).Just for grins :) I wrote up classes to test the three techniques:  "" + i,  Integer.toString, and String.ValueOf. Each test just converted the ints from 1 to 10000 to Strings. I then ran each through the Linux time command five times. Integer.toString() was slightly faster than String.valueOf() once, they tied three times, and String.valueOf() was faster once; however, the difference was never more than a couple of milliseconds.The "" + i technique was slower than both on every test except one, when it was 1 millisecond faster than Integer.toString() and 1 millisecond slower than String.valueOf() (obviously on the same test where String.valueOf() was faster than Integer.toString()). While it was usually only a couple milliseconds slower, there was one test where it was about 50 milliseconds slower. YMMV.There are various ways of converting to Strings:It depends on how you want to use your String. This can help:Both of the ways are correct.Mostly ditto on SimonJ. I really dislike the ""+i idiom. If you say String.valueOf(i), Java converts the integer to a string and returns the result. If you say ""+i, Java creates a StringBuilder object, appends an empty string to it, converts the integer to a string, appends this to the StringBuilder, then converts the StringBuilder to a String. That\'s a lot of extra steps. I suppose if you do it once in a big program, it\'s no big deal. But if you\'re doing this all the time, you\'re making the computer do a bunch of extra work and creating all these extra objects that then have to be cleaned up. I don\'t want to get fanatic about micro-optimization, but I don\'t want to be pointlessly wasteful either. Using "" + i is the shortest and simplest way to convert a number to a string.  It is not the most efficient, but it is the clearest IMHO and that is usually more important.  The simpler the code, the less likely you are to make a mistake.There are many way to convert an integer to a string:1)2)3)4)Personally I think that "" + i does look as the original question poster states "smelly". I have used a lot of OO languages besides Java. If that syntax was intended to be appropriate then Java would just interpret the i alone without needing the "" as desired to be converted to a string and do it since the destination type is unambiguous and only a single value would be being supplied on the right. The other seems like a \'trick" to fool the compiler, bad mojo when different versions of Javac made by other manufacturers or from other platforms are considered if the code ever needs to be ported. Heck for my money it should like many other OOL\'s just take a Typecast: (String) i. winksGiven my way of learning and for ease of understanding such a construct when reading others code quickly I vote for the Integer.toString(i) method. Forgetting a ns or two in how Java implements things in the background vs. String.valueOf(i) this method feels right to me and says exactly what is happening: I have and Integer and I wish it converted to a String.A good point made a couple times is perhaps just using StringBuilder up front is a good answer to building Strings mixed of text and ints or other objects since thats what will be used in the background anyways right?Just my two cents thrown into the already well paid kitty of the answers to the Mans question... smilesEDIT TO MY OWN ANSWER AFTER SOME REFLECTION:Ok, Ok, I was thinking on this some more and String.valueOf(i) is also perfectly good as well it says: I want a String that represents the value of an Integer. lol, English is by far more difficult to parse then Java! But, I leave the rest of my answer/comment... I was always taught to use the lowest level of a method/function chain if possible and still maintains readablity so if String.valueOf calls Integer.toString then Why use a whole orange if your just gonna peel it anyways, Hmmm?To clarify my comment about StringBuilder, I build a lot of strings with combos of mostly literal text and int\'s and they wind up being long and ugly with calls to the above mentioned routines imbedded between the +\'s, so seems to me if those become SB objects anyways and the append method has overloads it might be cleaner to just go ahead and use it... So I guess I am up to 5 cents on this one now, eh? lol...There are three ways of converting to StringsTry simple typecasting
