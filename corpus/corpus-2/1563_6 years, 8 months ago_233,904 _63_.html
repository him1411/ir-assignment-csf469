How can I import source code from my computer to my GitHub account?If you\'ve got local source code you want to add to a new remote new git repository without \'cloning\' the remote first, do the following (I often do this - you create your remote empty repository in bitbucket/github, then push up your source)Create the remote repository, and get the URL such as git@github.com:/youruser/somename.git or https://github.com/youruser/somename.gitIf your local GIT repo is already set up, skips steps 2 and 3Locally, at the root directory of your source, git init2a. If you initialize the repo with a .gitignore and a README.md you should do a git pull {url from step 1} to ensure you don\'t commit files to source that you want to ignore ;)Locally, add and commit what you want in your initial repo (for everything, git add . then  git commit -m \'initial commit comment\')to attach your remote repo with the name \'origin\' (like cloning would do)\ngit remote add origin [URL From Step 1]This is explained in the excellent free eBook ProGit. It assumes you already have a local Git repository and a remote one. To connect them use:To push the data from the local repository to GitHub use:If you have not setup a local and/or a remote repository yet, check out the help on GitHub and the previous chapters in the book.One of the comments mentioned using the GitHub GUI, but it didn\'t give any specific help on using and notice that most if not all the answers were useful at the command prompt only.If you want to use the GitHub GUI, you can follow these steps:After a moment with a spinning GitHub icon, your source code will belong to a local repository and pushed/synchronised with a remote repository on your GitHub account. All of this is presuming you\'ve previously set up the GitHub GUI, your GitHub account, and SSH keys.As JB quite rightly points out, it\'s made incredibly easy on GitHub by simply following the instructions.Here\'s an example of the instructions displayed after setting up a new repository on GitHub using http://github.com/new when you\'re logged in.It couldn\'t be easier!!Yes. Create a new repository, doing a git init in the directory where the source currently exists.More here: http://help.github.com/creating-a-repo/I had a bit of trouble with merging when trying to do Pete\'s steps. These are the steps I ended up with.Use your OS to delete the .git folder inside of the project folder that you want to commit. This will give you a clean slate to work with. This is also a good time to make a .gitignore file inside the project folder. This can be a copy of the .gitignore created when you created the repository on github.com. Doing this copy will avoid deleting it when you update the github.com repository.Open Git Bash and navigate to the folder you just deleted the .git folder from.Run git init. This sets up a local repository in the folder you\'re in.Run git remote add [alias] https://github.com/[gitUserName]/[RepoName].git. [alias] can be anything you want. The [alias] is meant to tie to the local repository, so the machine name works well for an [alias]. The URL can be found on github.com, along the top ensure that the HTTP button out of HTTP|SSH|Git Read-Only is clicked. The git:// URL didn\'t work for me.Run git pull [alias] master. This will update your local repository and avoid some merging conflicts.Run git add .Run git commit -m \'first code commit\'Run git push [alias] masterFrom Bitbucket:Push up an existing repository. You already have a Git repository on your computer. Let\'s push it up to Bitbucket:I came here looking for a simple way to add existing source files to a GitHub repository. I saw @Pete\'s excellently complete answer and thought "What?! There must be a simpler way."Here\'s that simpler way in five steps (no console action required!) If you\'re really in a hurry, you can just read step 3. The others are only there for completeness.Done!Add a GitHub repository as remote origin (replace [] with your URL):Switch to your master branch and copy it to develop branch:Push your develop branch to the GitHub develop branch (-f means force):Here are some instructions on how to initiate a GitHub repository and then push code you\'ve already created to it. The first set of instructions are directly from GitHub.Source: https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/In the upper-right corner of any page, click, and then click New repository.Create a short, memorable name for your repository. For example, "hello-world".Optionally, add a description of your repository. For example, "My first repository on GitHub."Choose between creating a public or private repository.Initialize this repository with a README.Create repository.Congratulations! You\'ve successfully created your first repository, and initialized it with a README file.Now after these steps you will want to push the code on your local computer up to the repository you just created and you do this following these steps:git init (in the root folder where your code is located)git add -A (this will add all the files and folders in your directory to be committed)git commit -am "First Project commit"git remote add origin git@github.com:YourGithubName/your-repo-name.git (you\'ll find this address on the GitHub repository you just created under "ssh clone URL" on the main page)git push -u origin masterThat\'s it. Your code will now be pushed up to GitHub. Now every time you want to keep pushing code that has changed just do.git commit -m "New changes"git push origin master (if master is the branch you are working on)Actually, if you opt for creating an empty repo on GitHub it gives you exact instructions that you can almost copy and paste into your terminal which are (at this point in time):Solution for me:The problem is the size of a file, which cannot exceed 100M.Before migrating to github, in the repository do this:Ready!Now make the migration again by the tool: https://github.com/new/importsee more:\nError while pushing to github repo\nand\nhttps://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/I hope I helped you.  :)
