Is it possible to find the number of lines of code in an entire solution?  I\'ve heard of MZ-Tools, but is there an open source equivalent?Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate has this built-in.Analyze -> Calculate Code MetricsI\'ve found powershell useful for this.  I consider LoC to be a pretty bogus metric anyway, so I don\'t believe anything more formal should be required.From a smallish solution\'s directory:That will count the non-blank lines in all the solution\'s .cs and .xaml files.  For a larger project, I just used a different extension list:Why use an entire app when a single command-line will do it?  :)I used Ctrl+Shift+F. Next, put a \\n in the search box and enable regular expressions box. Then in the find results, in the end of the screen are the number of files searched and lines of code found.An open source line counter for VS2005, 2003 and 2002 is available here:http://www.wndtabs.com/There is also discussion of creating a line counting VS addin, complete with code on Codeproject, herehttp://www.codeproject.com/KB/macros/LineCounterAddin.aspxAlso Slick Edit Gadgets have a nice line-counter, here:http://www.slickedit.com/products/slickeditand Microsoft Visual Studio Team System 2008 includes a good line counter.Just remember though:Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.\n  Bill GatesFound this tip:\nLOC with VS Find and replaceNot a plugin though if thats what you are looking for.Here\'s an update for Visual Studio 2012/2013/2015 for those who want to do the "Find" option (which I find to be the easiest):  This RegEx will find all non-blank lines with several exclusions to give the most accurate results.Enter the following RegEx into the "Find" box.  Please make sure to select the "Use Regular Expressions" option.  Change the search option to either "Current Project" or "Entire Solution" depending on your needs.  Now select "Find All".  At the bottom of the Find Results window, you will see "Matching Lines" which is the lines of code count.This RegEx excludes the following items:CommentsMulti-Line comments (assuming the lines are correctly commented with a * in front of each line)XML for IntellisenseHTML Comments:Using statements:Opening curly braces:Closing curly braces:Note:  anything between the braces would be included in the search, but in this example only 4 lines of code would count, instead of 18 actual non-blank lines:I created this to give me a much more accurate LOC count than some previous options, and figured I would share.  The bosses love LOC counts, so I\'m stuck with it for a while.  I hope someone else can find this helpful, let me know if you have any questions or need help getting it to work.cloc is an excellent commandline, Perl-based, Windows-executable which will break down the blank lines, commented lines, and source lines of code, grouped by file-formats.Now it won\'t specifically run on a VS solution file, but it can recurse through directories, and you can set up filename filters as you see fit.Here\'s the sample output from their web page:The third generation equivalent scale is a rough estimate of how much code it would take in a third generation language.  Not terribly useful, but interesting anyway.Answers here are a little bit out of date, may be from vs 2008 time. Because in newer Visual Studio versions 2010/2012, this feature is already built-in. Thus there are no reason to use any extension or tools for it. Feature to count lines of code - Calculate Metrics. With it you can calculate your metrics (LOC, Maintaince index, Cyclomatic index, Depth of inheritence) for each project or solution.Just right click on solution or project in Solution Explorer,and select "Calculate metrics"Later data for analysis and aggregation could be imported to Excel. Also in Excel you can filter out generated classes, or other noise from your metrics. These metrics including Lines of code LOC could be gathered also during build process, and included in build reportRegular expressions have changed between VS2010 and 2012, so most of the regular expression solutions here no longer workWill find all lines that are not blank, are not just a single bracket ( \'{\' or \'}\' ) and not just a #include or other preprocessor.Use Ctrl-shift-f and make sure regular expressions are enabled.The corresponding regular expression for VS 2010 and older is In Visual Studio Team System 2008 you can do from the menu Analyze--> \'Calculate Code Metrics for Solution\' and it will give you a line count of your entire solution (among other things g)For future readers I\'d like to advise the DPack extension for Visual Studio 2010.It\'s got a load of utilities built in including a line counter which says how many lines are blank, code, and etc.A simple solution is to search in all files. Type in "*" while using wildcards. Which would match all lines. At the end of the find results window you should see a line of the sort:Matching lines: 563    Matching files: 17    Total files searched: 17Of course this is not very good for large projects, since all lines are mached and loaded into memory to be dispayed at the find results window.Reference:I prefer OxyProject Metrics VS Addin.You could use:Obviously tools are easier, but I feel cool doing this in powershell:)This script finds all the .csproj references in the .sln file, and then within each csproj file it locates files included for compilation. For each file that is included for compilation it creates an object with properties: Solution, Project, File, Lines. It stores all these objects in a list, and then groups and projects the data as needed.Other simple tool For VS2008 (open source): http://www.accendo.sk/Download/SourceStat.zipUse Menu-> Analyse - > Calculate Code Metrics option in Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate.You can use the Visual Studio Code Metrics PowerTool 10.0. It\'s a command-line utility that calculates a few metrics on managed code for you (including lines of code). You can get a VS 2010 plugin that brings the tool into Visual Studio, and makes it as quick as selecting the menu item and clicking "Analyze Solution."Agree with Ali Parr. The WndTab Line Counter addin is a such tool. \nhttp://www.codeproject.com/KB/macros/linecount.aspxIt\'s also a good idea to search from download site to find some related tool.\nhttp://www.cnet.com/1770-5_1-0.html?query=code+counter&tag=srchHere is the Trick.. It counts the Js file also.http://www.spoiledtechie.com/post/2011/11/22/How-To-Count-Lines-of-Code-in-Visual-Studio.aspxYou can use free tool SourceMonitorGives a lot of measures: Lines of Code, Statement Count, Complexity, Block DepthHas graphical outputs via chartsYou can use the Project Line Counter add-in in Visual Studio 2010.  Normally it doesn\'t work with Visual Studio 2010, but it does with a helpful .reg file from here: http://www.onemanmmo.com/index.php?cmd=newsitem&comment=news.1.41.0I came up with a quick and dirty powershell script for counting lines in a folder structure. It\'s not nearly as full featured as some of the other tools referenced in other answers, but I think it\'s good enough to provide a rough comparison of the size of code files relative to one another in a project or solution.The script can be found here:https://gist.github.com/1674457In Visual Studio 2015 go to the Analyze Menu and select "Calculate Code Metrics".Try neptuner. It also gives you stuff like spaces, tabs, Lines of comments in addition to LoC.\nhttp://neptuner.googlecode.com/files/neptuner_0_30_windows.zip
