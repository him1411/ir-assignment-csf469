In Java, I have text from a text field in a String variable called "text".How can I save the contents of the "text" variable to a file?If you\'re simply outputting text, rather than any binary data, the following will work:Then, write your String to it, just like you would to any output stream:You\'ll need exception handling, as ever. Be sure to call out.close() when you\'ve finished writing.If you are using Java 7 or later, you can use the "try-with-resources statement" which will automatically close your PrintStream when you are done with it (ie exit the block) like so:You will still need to explicitly throw the java.io.FileNotFoundException as before.Apache Commons IO contains some great methods for doing this, in particular FileUtils contains the following method:which allows you to write text to a file in one method call:You might also want to consider specifying the encoding for the file as well.Just did something similar in my project. Use FileWriter will simplify part of your job. And here you can find nice tutorial.Take a look at the Java File APIa quick example:Use FileUtils.writeStringToFile() from Apache Commons IO. No need to reinvent this particular wheel.In Java 7 you can do this:There is more info here:\nhttp://www.drdobbs.com/jvm/java-se-7-new-file-io/231600403You can use the modify the code below to write your file from whatever class or function is handling the text.  One wonders though why the world needs a new text editor...Use Apache Commons IO api. Its simple Use API asMaven DependencyYou can insert this method into your classes. If you are using this method in a class with a main method, change this class to static by adding the static key word. Either way you will need to import java.io.* to make it work otherwise File, FileWriter and BufferedWriter will not be recognized. I prefer to rely on libraries whenever possible for this sort of operation. This makes me less likely to accidentally omit an important step (like mistake wolfsnipes made above). Some libraries are suggested above, but my favorite for this kind of thing is Google Guava. Guava has a class called Files which works nicely for this task:You could do this:Use this, it is very readable:Using Java 7:Using org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils:If you only care about pushing one block of text to file, this will overwrite it each time.This example allows the user to select a file using a file chooser.It\'s better to close the writer/outputstream in a finally block, just in case something happenIn case if you need create text file based on one single string:You can use the ArrayList to put all the contents of the TextArea for exemple, and send as parameter by calling the save, as the writer just wrote string lines, then we use the "for" line by line to write our ArrayList in the end we will be content TextArea in txt file. if something does not make sense, I\'m sorry is google translator and I who do not speak English.Watch the Windows Notepad, it does not always jump lines, and shows all in one line, use Wordpad ok.private void SaveActionPerformed(java.awt.event.ActionEvent evt) {} public void SaveFile(String name, ArrayList< String> message) {}
