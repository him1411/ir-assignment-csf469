How can I download only a specific folder or directory from a remote Git repo hosted on GitHub?Say the example GitHub repo lives here:Its directory structure:I want to download only the foo folder and not clone the whole Test project.Update Sep. 2016: there are a few tools created by the community that can do this for you:GitZip (Credits to Kino - upvote his answer right here!)DownGit (Credits to Minhas Kamal - upvote his answer right here!)Git doesn\'t support this, but Github does via SVN. If you checkout your code with subversion, Github will essentially convert the repo from git to subversion on the backend, then serve up the requested directory.Here\'s how you can use this feature to download a specific folder. I\'ll use the popular javascript library lodash as an example.Get the repo URL. First, copy the URL of the Github repo to your clipboard.\nModify the URL for subversion. I want to download the folder at /docs from the master branch, so I will append trunk/docs. Full URL is now https://github.com/lodash/lodash/trunk/docs. See my note below for a more in-depth explanation of why we must use this URL format.Download the folder. Go to the command line and grab the folder with SVN. \n\nsvn checkout https://github.com/lodash/lodash/trunk/docs\nYou might not see any activity immediately because Github takes up to 30 seconds to convert larger repositories, so be patient.Full URL format explanation:That\'s all! Github supports more subversion features as well, including support for committing and pushing changes.Extension: GitZip for githubUsage:Get Token:http://kinolien.github.io/gitzip by using GitHub API, and JSZip, FileSaver.js libraries.Step1: Input github url to the field at the top-right.\nStep2: Press enter or click download for download zip directly or click search for view the list of sub-folders and files.\nStep3: Click "Download Zip File" or "Get File" button to get files.In most cases, it works fine, except that the folder contains more than 1,000 files, because of the Github Trees API limitation. (refers to Github API#Contents)And it also can support private/public repos and upgrade the rate limit, if you have GitHub account and use "get token" link in this site. If you are a gitzip gh-page user, and also got token on the site; Now, you can install the GitZip for github Chrome Extension and visit gh-page site again after installed, it would sync token automatically.I wished to do similar thing as the question asker, for one of my projects. I not only wanted to download the whole directory, but also create a direct download link for that. But I found nothing that could meet my need. So, I have created a project in GitHub- DownGit, for solving the problem.Go to DownGit, enter your GitHub directory url, and download. Here is a simple demonstration-I believe it will serve as a great help.If you have svn, you can use svn export to do this:Notice the URL format:Before you run svn export, it\'s good to first verify the content of the directory with:If you want to download files, not clone the repository with history, you can do this with git-archive.git-archive makes a compressed zip or tar archive of a git repository. Some things that make it special:An example of creating an archive of the docs/usage directory from a remote repo you\'re connected to with ssh:More information in this blog post and the git documentation.GitHub doesn\'t allow git-archive access. \xe2\x98\xb9\xef\xb8\x8fI\'ve created an open source project, called GitHubFolderDownloader. It lets you to download a single folder of a repository without cloning or downloading the whole repository.You cannot; unlike Subversion, where each subdirectory can be checked out individually, Git operates on a whole-repository basis.For projects where finer-grained access is necessary, you can use submodules -- each submodule is a separate Git project, and thus can be cloned individually.It is conceivable that a Git front-end (e.g. GitHub\'s web interface, or gitweb) could choose to provide an interface for you to extract a given folder, but to my knowledge none of them do that (though they do let you download individual files, so if the folder does not contain too many files, that is an option)Edit - GitHub actually offers access via SVN, which would allow you to do just this (as per comment). See https://github.com/blog/1438-improved-svn-here-to-stay-old-svn-going-away for latest instructions on how to do thisIf you truly just want to just "download" the folder and not "clone" it (for development), the easiest way to simply get a copy of the most recent version of the repository (and therefore a folder/file within it), without needing to clone the whole repo or even install git in the first place, is to download a zip archive (for any repo, fork, branch, commit, etc.) by going to the desired repository/fork/branch/commit on GitHub (e.g. http(s)://github.com/<user>/<repo>/commit/<Sha1> for a copy of the files as they were after a specific commit) and selecting the Downloads button near the upper-right.This archive format contains none of the git-repo magic, just the tracked files themselves (and perhaps a few .gitignore files if they were tracked, but you can ignore those :p) - that means that if the code changes and you want to stay on top, you\'ll have to manually re-download it, and it also means you won\'t be able to use it as a git repository...Not sure if that\'s what you\'re looking for in this case (again, "download"/view vs "clone"/develop), but it can be useful nonetheless...Nothing wrong with other answers but I just thought I\'d share step-by-step instructions for those wandering through this process for the first time.~ To open Terminal just click spotlight and type terminal then hit enterBTW - If you are on Windows or some other platform you can find a binary download of subversion (svn) at http://subversion.apache.org~ If you want to checkout the folder rather than simply download it try using the svn help (tldr: replace export with checkout)1.Click on this link http://kinolien.github.io/gitzip/\n2.Paste link of Github folder you want to download.\n3.Click on search it will shows all files for downloading.\nNote:-Using search there is no need to enter token key ;)..keep it simple(y)It\'s one of the few places where SVN is better then GIT.  In the end we\'ve gravitated towards three options:Whoever is working on specific folder he needs to clone that particular folder itself , todo so please follow below steps ** --- by using SPARSE CHECKOUT --- **Step 1: Create a directory.Step 2: Initialize a Git repository. (git init)Step 3: Enable Sparse Checkouts. (git config core.sparsecheckout true)Step 4: Tell Git which directories you want (echo 2015/brand/May( refer to folder you want to work on) >> .git/info/sparse-checkout)Step 5: Add the remote (git remote -f add origin https://jafartke.com/mkt-imdev/DVM.git)Final Step 6: Fetch the files (git pull origin master )Another specific example:Like I want to download \'iOS Pro Geo\' folder from the urlhttps://github.com/alokc83/APRESS-Books-Source-Code-/tree/master/%20Pro%20iOS%20Geoand I can do so viaNote trunk in the pathEdited: (as per Tommie C\'s comment)Yes, using export  instead of checkout would give a clean copy without extra git repository files.Edited: If tree/master is not there in url then Fork it and it will be there in Forked url. Just to amplify the answers above, a real example from a real GitHub repository to a local directory would be:Sometimes a concrete example helps clarify the substitutions proposed.I work with CentOS 7 servers on which I don\'t have root access, nor git, svn, etc (nor want to!) so made a python script to download any github folder: https://github.com/andrrrl/github-folder-downloaderUsage is simple, just copy the relevant part from a github project, let\'s say the project is https://github.com/MaxCDN/php-maxcdn/, and you want a folder where some source files are only, then you need to do something like:  $ python gdownload.py "/MaxCDN/php-maxcdn/tree/master/src" /my/target/dir/\n(will create target folder if doesn\'t exist) It requires lxml library, can be installed with easy_install lxml\nIf you don\'t have root access (like me) you can create a .pydistutils.py file into your $HOME dir with these contents:\n\n[install]\nuser=1\n\nAnd easy_install lxml will just work (ref: https://stackoverflow.com/a/33464597/591257).If the directoy you want to download is a separated library, it\'s better to create an other git repo, and then to use the git submodule function.Of course, you have to be the owner of the initial repo you wantIf you need to do it programatically and you don\'t want to rely on SVN, you can use GitHub API to download all the contents recursively.For inspiration, here\'s my ruby gist: https://gist.github.com/cvengros/b2a7e82f66519d423b6fTo export a directory from GitHub, replace "/tree/master/" in the directory\'s url with "/trunk/".For example, to export the directory from the following URL:run the following command:Our team wrote a bash script to do this because we didn\'t want to have to install SVN on our bare bones server.https://github.com/ojbc/docker/blob/master/java8-karaf3/files/git-download.shIt uses the github API and can be run from the command line like this:I use linux so , put this in ~/.bashrc , called even :D $HOME/.bashrcthen refresh the shell with then use it with git-downloadfolder blablabla :DYou can do a simple download of the directory tree:But if you mean to check it out, and be able to do commits and push them back, no you can\'t do that.
