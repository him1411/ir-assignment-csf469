I want to test some URLs on a web application I\'m working on. For that I would like to manually create HTTP POST requests (meaning I can add whatever parameters I like).Is there any extension or functionality in Chrome and/or Firefox that I\'m missing?I have been making a Chrome app called Postman for this type of stuff. All the other extensions seemed a bit dated so made my own. It also has a bunch of other features which have been helpful for documenting our own API here.Postman now also has native apps (i.e. standalone) for Windows, Mac and Linux! It is more preferable now to use native apps, read more here.CURL is AWESOME to do what you want ! It\'s a simple but effective command line tool : https://curl.haxx.se/Rest implementation test commands : For Chrome try one of extensions:For Firefox try one of add-ons:FirefoxOpen Network panel in Developer Tools by pressing Ctrl-Shift-Q or by going Firefox -> Developer Tools -> Network Tab (highlighted). Then Click on small door icon on top-right (in expanded form in the screenshot, you\'ll find it just left of the highlighted Headers), second row (if you don\'t see it then reload the page) -> Edit and resend whatever request you wantEDIT: Added image. Unfortunately I\'m on Linux so no simple tool to circle stuff around, but hopefully the highlights would make things clear. . Having been greatly inspired by Postman for Chrome, I decided to write something similar for Firefox.REST Easy* is a restartless Firefox add-on that aims to provide as much control as possible over requests. The add-on is still in an experimental state (it hasn\'t even been reviewed by Mozilla yet) but development is progressing nicely.The project is open source, so if anyone feels compelled to help with development, that would be awesome: https://github.com/nathan-osman/Rest-Easy* the add-on available from http://addons.mozilla.org will always be slightly behind the code available on GitHubIt\'s a bit ugly, but there\'s the Simple REST Client extension for Chrome. It works great for me -- do remember that you can still use the debugger with it. The Network pane is particularly useful; it\'ll give you rendered JSON objects and error pages.For firefox there is also an extension called RESTClient which is quite nice:https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclientYou specifically asked for "extension or functionality in Chrome and/or Firefox", which the answers you have already received provide, but I do like the simplicity of oezi\'s answer to the closed question "how to send a post request with a web browser" for simple parameters. oezi says:with a form, just set method to "post"I.e. build yourself a very simple page to test the post actions.May not be directly related to browsers but fiddler is another good software.You could also use Watir or Watin to automate browsers. Watir is written for ruby and Watin is for .Net languages. Not sure if it\'s what you are looking for though.Try Runscope. A free tool sampling their service is provided at https://www.hurl.it/ . You can set the method, authentication, headers, parameters, and body. Response shows status code, headers, and body. The response body can be formatted from JSON with a collapsable heirarchy. Paid accounts can automate test API calls and use return data to build new test calls. \nCOI disclosure: I have no relationship to Runscope.Check out http-tool for firefox ..https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/http-tool/
