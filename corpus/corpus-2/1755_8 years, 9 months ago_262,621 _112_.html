I\'m trying to use the Html.DropDownList extension method but can\'t figure out how to use it with an enumeration.Let\'s say I have an enumeration like this:How do I go about creating a dropdown with these values using the Html.DropDownList extension method?Or is my best bet to simply create a for loop and create the Html elements manually?I rolled Rune\'s answer into an extension method:This allows you to write:by using MyApp.CommonI know I\'m late to the party on this, but thought you might find this variant useful, as this one also allows you to use descriptive strings rather than enumeration constants in the drop down. To do this, decorate each enumeration entry with a [System.ComponentModel.Description] attribute.For example:Here is my code:You can then do this in your view:Hope this helps you!EDIT 2014-JAN-23: Microsoft have just released MVC 5.1, which now has an EnumDropDownListFor feature. Sadly it does not appear to respect the [Description] attribute so the code above still stands. (See http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/releases/mvc51-release-notes#Enum for Microsoft\'s release notes.)  Update: It does support the Display attribute [Display(Name = "Sample")] though, so one can use that.[Update - just noticed this, and the code looks like an extended version of the code here: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/stuartleeks/archive/2010/05/21/asp-net-mvc-creating-a-dropdownlist-helper-for-enums.aspx, with a couple of additions. If so, attribution would seem fair ;-)]In ASP.NET MVC 5.1, they added the EnumDropDownListFor() helper, so no need for custom extensions:Model:View:I bumped into the same problem, found this question, and thought that the solution provided by Ash wasn\'t what I was looking for; Having to create the HTML myself means less flexibility compared to the built-in Html.DropDownList() function.Turns out C#3 etc. makes this pretty easy. I have an enum called TaskStatus:This creates a good ol\' SelectList that can be used like you\'re used to in the view:The anonymous type and LINQ makes this so much more elegant IMHO. No offence intended, Ash. :)Html.DropDownListFor only requires an IEnumerable, so an alternative to Prise\'s solution is as follows. This will allow you to simply write:[Where SelectedItemType is a field on your model of type ItemTypes, and your model is non-null]Also, you don\'t really need to genericize the extension method as you can use enumValue.GetType() rather than typeof(T).EDIT: Integrated Simon\'s solution here as well, and included ToDescription extension method.Here is a better encapsulated solution:http://www.spicelogic.com/Journal/ASP-NET-MVC-DropDownListFor-Html-Helper-Enum-5Say here is your model:Sample Usage:Generated UI:\nAnd generated HTMLThe Helper Extension Source Code snap shot:You can download the sample project from the link I provided.EDIT: Here\'s the code:So without Extension functions if you are looking for simple and easy.. This is what I didwhere XXXXX.Sites.YYYY.Models.State is an enumProbably better to do helper function, but when time is short this will get the job done.Expanding on Prise and Rune\'s answers, if you\'d like to have the value attribute of your select list items map to the integer value of the Enumeration type, rather than the string value, use the following code:Instead of treating each Enumeration value as a TEnum object, we can treat it as a object and then cast it to integer to get the unboxed value. Note:\nI also added a generic type constraint to restrict the types for which this extension is available to only structs (Enum\'s base type), and a run-time type validation which ensures that the struct passed in is indeed an Enum.Update 10/23/12:\nAdded generic type parameter for underlying type and fixed non-compilation issue affecting .NET 4+.To solve the problem of getting the number instead of text using Prise\'s extension method.The best solution I found for this was combining this blog with Simon Goldstone\'s answer.This allows use of the enum in the model. Essentially the idea is to use an integer property as well as the enum, and emulate the integer property.Then use the [System.ComponentModel.Description] attribute for annotating the model with your display text, and use an "EnumDropDownListFor" extension in your view.This makes both the view and model very readable and maintainable.Model:View:Extension (directly from Simon Goldstone\'s answer, included here for completeness):You want to look at using something like Enum.GetValuesA super easy way to get this done - without all the extension stuff that seems overkill is this:Your enum:Inside of your controller bind the Enum to a List:After that throw it into a ViewBag:Finally simply bind it to the View:This is by far the easiest way I found and does not require any extensions or anything that crazy.UPDATE: See Andrews comment below.This is Rune & Prise answers altered to use the Enum int value as the ID.  Sample Enum:Extension method:Sample of usage:Remember to Import the namespace containing the Extension methodSample of generated HTML:Note that the item that you use to call the ToSelectList on is the selected item.This is version for Razor:I am very late on this one but I just found a really cool way to do this with one line of code, if you are happy to add the Unconstrained Melody NuGet package (a nice, small library from Jon Skeet).This solution is better because:So, here are the steps to get this working:Add a property on your model like so:Now that you have the List of SelectListItem exposed on your model, you can use the @Html.DropDownList or @Html.DropDownListFor using this property as the source.Building on Simon\'s answer, a similar approach is to get the Enum values to display from a Resource file, instead of in a description attribute within the Enum itself. This is helpful if your site needs to be rendered in more than one language and if you were to have a specific resource file for Enums, you could go one step further and have just Enum values, in your Enum and reference them from the extension by a convention such as [EnumName]_[EnumValue] - ultimately less typing!The extension then looks like:Resources in the Enums.Resx file looking like\nItemTypes_Movie : FilmOne other thing I like to do is, instead of calling the extension method directly, I\'d rather call it with a @Html.EditorFor(x => x.MyProperty), or ideally just have the whole form, in one neat @Html.EditorForModel(). To do this I change the string template to look like thisIf this interests you, I\'ve put a much more detailed answer here on my blog:http://paulthecyclist.com/2013/05/24/enum-dropdown/Now this feature is supported out-of-the-box in MVC 5.1 through @Html.EnumDropDownListFor()Check the following link:http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/releases/mvc51-release-notes#EnumIt is really shame that it took Microsoft 5 years to implement such as feature which is so in demand according to the voting above!Another fix to this extension method - the current version didn\'t select the enum\'s current value. I fixed the last line:If you want to add localization support just change the s.toString() method to something like this:In here the typeof(Resources) is the resource you want to load, and then you get the localized String, also useful if your enumerator has values with multiple words.This is my version of helper method.\nI use this:Instead of that:Here it is:You can also use my custom HtmlHelpers in Griffin.MvcContrib. The following code:Generates:https://github.com/jgauffin/griffin.mvccontribWell I\'m really late to the party, but for what it is worth, I have blogged about this very subject whereby I create a EnumHelper class that enables very easy transformation.http://jnye.co/Posts/4/creating-a-dropdown-list-from-an-enum-in-mvc-and-c%23In your controller:In your View:The helper class:@Simon Goldstone: Thanks for your solution, it can be perfectly applied in my case. The only problem is I had to translate it to VB. But now it is done and to save other people\'s time (in case they need it) I put it here:End You use it like this:I ended up creating extention methods to do what is essentially the accept answer here. The last half of the Gist deals with Enum specifically.https://gist.github.com/3813767I found an answer here http://blogs.msdn.com/b/stuartleeks/archive/2010/05/21/asp-net-mvc-creating-a-dropdownlist-helper-for-enums.aspx; however, some of my enums have [Description(...)] attribute, so I\'ve modified the code to provide support for that:Hope that helps.1- Create your ENUM2- Create your Service Class3- Set the ViewBag in your controller4- Bind your DropDownListHere a Martin Faartoft variation where you can put custom labels which is nice for localization.Use in view:
