This question already has an answer here:What is the best way to find if an object is in an array?This is the best way I know:EDIT: \nThis will not work on IE6, 7 or 8 though. The best workaround is to define it yourself if it\'s not present:Mozilla\'s (ECMA-262) version:Daniel James\'s version:roosteronacid\'s version:If you are using jQuery: For more information: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/First, implement indexOf in JavaScript for browsers that don\'t already have it. For example, see Erik Arvidsson\'s array extras (also, the associated blog post). And then you can use indexOf without worrying about browser support. Here\'s a slightly optimised version of his indexOf implementation:It\'s changed to store the length so that it doesn\'t need to look it up every iteration. But the difference isn\'t huge. A less general purpose function might be faster:I prefer using the standard function and leaving this sort of micro-optimization for when it\'s really needed. But if you\'re keen on micro-optimization I adapted the benchmarks that roosterononacid linked to in the comments, to benchmark searching in arrays. They\'re pretty crude though, a full investigation would test arrays with different types, different lengths and finding objects that occur in different places.If the array is unsorted, there isn\'t really a better way (aside from using the above-mentioned indexOf, which I think amounts to the same thing).  If the array is sorted, you can do a binary search, which works like this:Binary search runs in time proportional to the logarithm of the length of the array, so it can be much faster than looking at each individual element.assuming .indexOf() is implemented  !!! do not make Array.prototype.has=function(){... because you\'ll add an enumerable element in every array and js is broken.the use of 2nd arg (flag) forces  comparation by value instead of reference  Here\'s some meta-knowledge for you - if you want to know what you can do with an Array, check the documentation - here\'s the Array page for Mozillahttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayThere you\'ll see reference to indexOf, added in Javascript 1.6It depends on your purpose. If you program for the Web, avoid indexOf, it isn\'t supported by Internet Explorer 6 (lot of them still used!), or do conditional use:indexOf is probably coded in native code, so it is faster than anything you can do in JavaScript (except binary search/dichotomy if the array is appropriate).\nNote: it is a question of taste, but I would do a return false; at the end of your routine, to return a true Boolean...A robust way to check if an object is an array in javascript is detailed here:Here are two functions from the xa.js framework which I attach to a utils = {} \xe2\x80\x98container\xe2\x80\x99. These should help you properly detect arrays.If you then want to check if an object is in an array, I would also include this code:And finally this in_array function:
