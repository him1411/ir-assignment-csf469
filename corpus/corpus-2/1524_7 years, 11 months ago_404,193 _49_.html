What is the easiest way to save PL/pgSQL output from a PostgreSQL database to a CSV file? I\'m using PostgreSQL 8.4 with pgAdmin III and PSQL plugin where I run queries from.Do you want the resulting file on the server, or on the client?If you want something easy to re-use or automate, you can use Postgresql\'s built in COPY command. e.g.This approach runs entirely on the remote server - it can\'t write to your local PC. It also needs to be run as a Postgres "superuser" (normally called "root") because Postgres can\'t stop it doing nasty things with that machine\'s local filesystem.That doesn\'t actually mean you have to be connected as a superuser (automating that would be a security risk of a different kind), because you can use the SECURITY DEFINER option to CREATE FUNCTION to make a function which runs as though you were a superuser. The crucial part is that your function is there to perform additional checks, not just by-pass the security - so you could write a function which exports the exact data you need, or you could write something which can accept various options as long as they meet a strict whitelist. You need to check two things:I\'ve written a blog post expanding on this approach, including some examples of functions that export (or import) files and tables meeting strict conditions.The other approach is to do the file handling on the client side, i.e. in your application or script. The Postgres server doesn\'t need to know what file you\'re copying to, it just spits out the data and the client puts it somewhere.The underlying syntax for this is the COPY TO STDOUT command, and graphical tools like pgAdmin will wrap it for you in a nice dialog.The psql command-line client has a special "meta-command" called \\copy, which takes all the same options as the "real" COPY, but is run inside the client:Note that there is no terminating ;, because meta-commands are terminated by newline, unlike SQL commands.From the docs:Do not confuse COPY with the psql instruction \\copy. \\copy invokes COPY FROM STDIN or COPY TO STDOUT, and then fetches/stores the data in a file accessible to the psql client. Thus, file accessibility and access rights depend on the client rather than the server when \\copy is used.Your application programming language may also have support for pushing or fetching the data, but you cannot generally use COPY FROM STDIN/TO STDOUT within a standard SQL statement, because there is no way of connecting the input/output stream. PHP\'s PostgreSQL handler (not PDO) includes very basic pg_copy_from and pg_copy_to functions which copy to/from a PHP array, which may not be efficient for large data sets.There are several solutions:psql -d dbname -t -A -F"," -c "select * from users" > output.csvThis has the big advantage that you can using it via SSH, like ssh postgres@host command - enabling you to getCOPY (SELECT * from users) To \'/tmp/output.csv\' With CSV;All of them can be used in scripts, but I prefer #1.In terminal (while connected to the db) set output to the cvs file1) Set field seperator to \',\':2) Set output format unaligned:3) Show only tuples:4) Set output:5) Execute your query:6) Output:You will then be able to find your csv file in this location:Copy it using the scp command or edit using nano:If you\'re interested in all the columns of a particular table along with headers, you can useThis is a tiny bit simpler thanwhich, to the best of my knowledge, are equivalent.I had to use the \\COPY because I received the error message: So I used:and it is functioningpsql can do this for you:See man psql for help on the options used here.In pgAdmin III there is an option to export to file from the query window. In the main menu it\'s Query -> Execute to file or there\'s a button that does the same thing (it\'s a green triangle with a blue floppy disk as opposed to the plain green triangle which just runs the query). If you\'re not running the query from the query window then I\'d do what IMSoP suggested and use the copy command.I\'m working on AWS Redshift, which does not support the COPY TO feature. My BI tool supports tab-delimited CSVs though, so I used the following:I\'ve written a little tool called psql2csv that encapsulates the COPY query TO STDOUT pattern, resulting in proper CSV. It\'s interface is similar to psql.The query is assumed to be the contents of STDIN, if present, or the last argument. All other arguments are forwarded to psql except for these:If you have longer query and you like to use psql then put your query to a file and use the following command:JackDB, a database client in your web browser, makes this really easy. Especially if you\'re on Heroku.It lets you connect to remote databases and run SQL queries on them.                                                                                                                                                       Source\njackdb-heroku http://static.jackdb.com/assets/img/blog/jackdb-heroku-oauth-connect.gifOnce your DB is connected, you can run a query and export to CSV or TXT (see bottom right).Note: I\'m in no way affiliated with JackDB. I currently use their free services and think it\'s a great product.
