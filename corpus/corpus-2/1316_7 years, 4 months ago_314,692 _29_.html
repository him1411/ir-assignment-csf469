Once my program is installed on a client machine, how do I force my program to run as an administrator on Windows 7?You\'ll want to modify the manifest that gets embedded in the program. This works on Visual Studio 2008 and higher: Project + Add New Item, select "Application Manifest File". Change the <requestedExecutionLevel> element to:The user gets the UAC prompt when they start the program. Use wisely; their patience can wear out quickly.Adding a requestedExecutionLevel element to your manifest is only half the battle; you have to remember that UAC can be turned off. If it is, you have to perform the check the old school way and put up an error dialog if the user is not administrator  (call IsInRole(WindowsBuiltInRole.Administrator) on your thread\'s CurrentPrincipal).I implemented some code to do it manually:You can embed a manifest file in the EXE file, which will cause Windows (7 or higher) to always run the program as an administrator.You can find more details in Step 6: Create and Embed an Application Manifest (UAC) (MSDN).While working on Visual Studio 2008, right click on Project -> Add New Item and then chose Application Manifest File.In the manifest file, you will find the tag requestedExecutionLevel, and you may set the level to three values:<requestedExecutionLevel  level="asInvoker" uiAccess="false" />OR<requestedExecutionLevel  level="requireAdministrator" uiAccess="false" />OR<requestedExecutionLevel  level="highestAvailable" uiAccess="false" />To set your application to run as administrator, you have to chose the middle one.In Visual Studio 2010 right click your project name.\nHit "View Windows Settings", this generates and opens a file called "app.manifest".\nWithin this file replace "asInvoker" with "requireAdministrator" as explained in the commented sections within the file.As peryou will want to add an application manifest if you don\'t already have one or don\'t know how to add one. As some projects don\'t automatically add a separate manifest file, first go to project properties, navigate to the Application tab and check to make sure your project is not excluding the manifest at the bottom of the tap.The detailed steps are as follow.Another way of doing this, in code only, is to detect if the process is running as admin like in the answer by @NG.. And then open the application again and close the current one.I use this code when an application only needs admin privileges when run under certain conditions, such as when installing itself as a service. So it doesn\'t need to run as admin all the time like the other answers force it too.Note in the below code NeedsToRunAsAdmin is a method that detects if under current conditions admin privileges are required. If this returns false the code will not elevate itself. This is a major advantage of this approach over the others.Although this code has the advantages stated above, it does need to re-launch itself as a new process which isn\'t always what you want.Right click your executable, go to Properties > Compatibility and check the \'Run this program as admin\' box. If you want to run it as admin for all users, do the same thing in \'change setting for all users\'.
