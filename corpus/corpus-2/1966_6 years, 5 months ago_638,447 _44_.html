(These two are Edit.FormatSelection and Edit.FormatDocument.)For Visual Studio 2010/2013/2015/2017Toolbar Edit -> Advanced (If you can\'t see Advanced, select a code file in solution explorer and try again)Your shortcuts might display differently to mine as I am set up for C# coding but navigating via the toolbar will get you to your ones.If it isn\'t working, look for errors in your code, like missing brackets which stop auto format from workingFollow the steps below:See the below image:Even though the question is a bit old, someone might find it handy.You can define new key bindings by going to Tools -> options -> Environment -> keyboardIf you display the HTML Source Editing toolbar there is a "Format the Whole Document" button as wellI have installed an extension named "Format document on Save" which formats the whole document every time you save it.\nFor install it in VS15 or 17, on Tools just click the "Extensions and Updates...":And then just go to "Online" at the left panel and search for "Format document on save"\nI hope it helps!.I used to use these combinations.

You can customise your IDE to add any button to any toolbar - so you can add the Format button (as the HTML Source Editing toolbar has) to any other toolbar (like Text Editing with all the other edit controls like increase/decrease indent).Click the arrow to the right of the toolbar > Add or Remove Buttons > Customize... > Commands tab > Add Command... button.Document Format and Selection Format are both under the Edit group.(Tested in VS2010 and VS2013)Cut/Paste of a section is another quick way (and easy to remember).With the Continuous Formatting extension (commercial, developed by me), the code is formatted really automatically as you type.If you can afford it (or if you\'re eligible for the 30-day free trial) Jetbrains ReSharper can reformat a whole project directory.Just install -> Right-click a directory -> select Cleanup Code from the context menu.In newer versions, the shortcut for the document-wide formatting is: Shift + Alt + F
