What\'s the difference?What are the advantages / disadvantages of tuples / lists?Apart from tuples being immutable there is also a semantic distinction that should guide their usage. Tuples are heterogeneous data structures (i.e., their entries have different meanings), while lists are homogeneous sequences. Tuples have structure, lists have order. Using this distinction makes code more explicit and understandable.One example would be pairs of page and line number to reference locations in a book, e.g.:You can then use this as a key in a dictionary to store notes on locations. A list on the other hand could be used to store multiple locations. Naturally one might want to add or remove locations from the list, so it makes sense that lists are mutable. On the other hand it doesn\'t make sense to add or remove items from an existing location - hence tuples are immutable.There might be situations where you want to change items within an existing location tuple, for example when iterating through the lines of a page. But tuple immutability forces you to create a new location tuple for each new value. This seems inconvenient on the face of it, but using immutable data like this is a cornerstone of value types and functional programming techniques, which can have substantial advantages.There are some interesting articles on this issue, e.g. "Python Tuples are Not Just Constant Lists" or "Understanding tuples vs. lists in Python". The official Python documentation also mentions this ("Tuples are immutable, and usually contain an heterogeneous sequence ...").In a statically typed language like Haskell the values in a tuple generally have different types and the length of the tuple must be fixed. In a list the values all have the same type and the length is not fixed. So the difference is very obvious.Finally there is the namedtuple in Python, which makes sense because a tuple is already supposed to have structure. This underlines the idea that tuples are a light-weight alternative to classes and instances.Difference between list and tupleLiteralSizeDue to the smaller size of a tuple operation, it becomes a bit faster, but not that much to mention about until you have a huge number of elements.Permitted operationsThat also means that you can\'t delete an element or sort a tuple. \nHowever, you could add new element to both list and tuple with the only difference that you will change id of the tuple by adding elementUsageAs a list is mutable, it can\'t be used as a key in a dictionary, whereas a tuple can be used.If you went for a walk, you could note your coordinates at any instant in an (x,y) tuple.If you wanted to record your journey, you could append your location every few seconds to a list.But you couldn\'t do it the other way around.The key difference is that tuples are immutable.  This means that you cannot change the values in a tuple once you have created it.So if you\'re going to need to change the values use a List.Benefits to tuples:Lists are mutable; tuples are not.From docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html Tuples are immutable, and usually contain an heterogeneous sequence of\n  elements that are accessed via unpacking (see later in this section)\n  or indexing (or even by attribute in the case of namedtuples). Lists\n  are mutable, and their elements are usually homogeneous and are\n  accessed by iterating over the list.Lists are for looping, tuples are for structures i.e. "%s %s" %tuple.Lists are usually homogeneous, tuples are usually heterogeneous. Lists are for variable length, tuples are for fixed length.It\'s been mentioned that the difference is largely semantic: people expect a tuple and list to represent different information. But this goes further than a guideline; some libraries actually behave differently based on what they are passed. Take NumPy for example (copied from another post where I ask for more examples):The point is, while NumPy may not be part of the standard library, it\'s a major Python library, and within NumPy lists and tuples are completely different things.This is an example of Python lists:This is an example of Python tuple:Python lists and tuples are similar in that they both are ordered collections of values. Besides the shallow difference that lists are created using brackets "[ ... , ... ]" and tuples using parentheses "( ... , ... )", the core technical "hard coded in Python syntax" difference between them is that the elements of a particular tuple are immutable whereas lists are mutable (...so only tuples are hashable and can be used as dictionary/hash keys!). This gives rise to differences in how they can or can\'t be used (enforced a priori by syntax) and differences in how people choose to use them (encouraged as \'best practices,\' a posteriori, this is what smart programers do). The main difference a posteriori in differentiating when tuples are used versus when lists are used lies in what meaning people give to the order of elements. For tuples, \'order\' signifies nothing more than just a specific \'structure\' for holding information. What values are found in the first field can easily be switched into the second field as each provides values across two different dimensions or scales. They provide answers to different types of questions and are typically of the form: for a given object/subject, what are its attributes? The object/subject stays constant, the attributes differ.For lists, \'order\' signifies a sequence or a directionality. The second element MUST come after the first element because it\'s positioned in the 2nd place based on a particular and common scale or dimension. The elements are taken as a whole and mostly provide answers to a single question typically of the form, for a given attribute, how do these objects/subjects compare? The attribute stays constant, the object/subject differs.There are countless examples of people in popular culture and programmers who don\'t conform to these differences and there are countless people who might use a salad fork for their main course. At the end of the day, it\'s fine and both can usually get the job done. To summarize some of the finer detailsSimilarities:Indexing, Selecting, & Slicing - Both tuples and lists index using integer values found within brackets. So, if you want the first 3 values of a given list or tuple, the syntax would be the same:Comparing & Sorting - Two tuples or two lists are both compared by their first element, and if there is a tie, then by the second element, and so on. No further attention is paid to subsequent elements after earlier elements show a difference.Differences: - A priori, by definitionSyntax - Lists use [], tuples use ()Mutability - Elements in a given list are mutable, elements in a given tuple are NOT mutable. Hashtables (Dictionaries) - As hashtables (dictionaries) require that its keys are hashable and therefore immutable, only tuples can act as dictionary keys, not lists.Differences - A posteriori, in usageHomo vs. Heterogeneity of Elements - Generally list objects are homogenous and tuple objects are heterogeneous. That is, lists are used for objects/subjects of the same type (like all presidential candidates, or all songs, or all runners) whereas  although it\'s not forced by), whereas tuples are more for heterogenous objects.Looping vs. Structures - Although both allow for looping (for x in my_list...), it only really makes sense to do it for a list. Tuples are more appropriate for structuring and presenting information (%s %s residing in %s is an %s and presently %s % ("John","Wayne",90210, "Actor","Dead"))Lists are intended to be homogeneous sequences, while tuples are heterogeneous data structures. The values of list can be changed any time but the values of tuples can\'t be change.The advantages and disadvantages depends upon the use. If you have such a data which you never want to change then you should have to use tuple, otherwise list is the best option.The PEP 484 -- Type Hints says that the types of elements of a tuple can be individually typed; so that you can say Tuple[str, int, float]; but a list, with List typing class can take only one type parameter: List[str], which hints that the difference of the 2 really is that the former is heterogeneous, whereas the latter intrinsically homogeneous.Also, the standard library mostly uses the tuple as a return value from such standard functions where the C would return a struct.First of all, they both are the non-scalar objects (also known as a compound objects) in Python.Using list may also cause an aliasing bug (two distinct paths\npointing to the same object).List is mutable and tuples is immutable. The main difference between mutable and immutable is memory usage when you are trying to append an item. When you create a variable, some fixed memory is assigned to the variable. If it is a list, more memory is assigned than actually used. E.g. if current memory assignment is 100 bytes, when you want to append the 101th byte, maybe another 100 bytes will be assigned (in total 200 bytes in this case). However, if you know that you are not frequently add new elements, then you should use tuples. Tuples assigns exactly size of the memory needed, and hence saves memory, especially when you use large blocks of memory. Lists are mutable and tuples are immutable.\nJust consider this example.Now change index values of list and tuple.Hence proved the following code is invalid with tuple, because we attempted to update a tuple, which is not allowed.
