I wanted to check whether the variable is defined or not. For example, the following throws a not-defined error  How can I catch this error?In JavaScript, null is an object. There\'s another value for things that don\'t exist, undefined. The DOM returns null for almost all cases where it fails to find some structure in the document, but in JavaScript itself undefined is the value used.Second, no, there is not a direct equivalent. If you really want to check for specifically for null, do:If you want to check if a variable exists, that can only be done with try/catch, since typeof will treat an undeclared variable and a variable declared with the value of undefined as equivalent.But, to check if a variable is declared and is not undefined:If you know the variable exists, and want to check whether there\'s any value stored in it:If you want to know if a member exists independent but don\'t care what its value is:If you want to to know whether a variable is truthy:SourceThe only way to truly test if a variable is undefined is to do the following. Remember, undefined is an object in JavaScript.Some of the other solutions in this thread will lead you to believe a variable is undefined even though it has been defined (with a value of NULL or 0, for instance).Technically, the proper solution is (I believe):You can sometimes get lazy and usebut that allows both an undefined variable x, and a variable x containing null, to return true.I\'ve often done:An even easier and more shorthand version would be:ORYou can also use the ternary conditional-operator:We can check undefined as follows        I often use the simplest way:EDIT:Without initializing the variable, exception will be thrown "Uncaught ReferenceError: variable is not defined..."The accepted answer is correct. Just wanted to add one more option. You also can use try ... catch block to handle this situation. A freaky example:Be aware of catch block, which is a bit messy, as it creates a block-level scope. And, of course, the example is extremely simplified to answer the asked question, it does not cover best practices in error handling ;).
