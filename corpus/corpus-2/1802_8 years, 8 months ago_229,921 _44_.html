What it\'s the best way to generate a string of \\t\'s in C#I am learning C# and experimenting with different ways of saying the same thing.  Tabs(uint t) is a function that returns a string with t amount of \\t\'sFor example Tabs(3) returns "\\t\\t\\t"Which of these three ways of implementing Tabs(uint numTabs) is best?Of course that depends on what "best" means.  The LINQ version is only two lines, which is nice.  But are the calls to Repeat and Aggregate unnecessarily time/resource consuming?The StringBuilder version is very clear but is the StringBuilder class somehow slower?The string version is basic, which means it is easy to understand.  Does it not matter at all?  Are they all equal?These are all questions to help me get a better feel for C#.   What about this:Where n is the number of times you want to repeat the string.Or better:In all versions of .NET, you can repeat a string thus:To repeat a character, new String(\'\\t\', count) is your best bet. See the answer by @CMS.Returns"abab"AndReturns"aa"from...Is there a built-in function to repeat string or char in .net?The best version is certainly to use the builtin way:Of the other solutions, prefer the easiest; only if this is proving too slow, strive for a more efficient solution.If you use a StringBuilder and know its resulting length in advance, then also use an appropriate constructor, this is much more efficient because it means that only one time-consuming allocation takes place, and no unnecessary copying of data.\nNonsense: of course the above code is more efficient.What about using extension method?  You could then write :   Note that a performance test of using the stringbuilder version for simple characters instead of strings gives you a major preformance penality : \non my computer the difference in mesured performance  is 1:20 between:\nDebug.WriteLine(\'-\'.Repeat(1000000)) //char version  and\nDebug.WriteLine("-".Repeat(1000000)) //string versionExtension methods:        How about this:I know that this question is five years old already but there is a simple way to repeat a string that even works in .Net 2.0.To repeat a string:Returns"Hello, Hello, Hello, "To repeat a string as an array:Returns{"Hello", "Hello", "Hello", ""}Keep it simple.Using String.Concat and Enumerable.Repeat which will be less expensive\nthan using String.JoinLet\'s say you want to repeat \'\\t\' n number of times, you can use;Your first example which uses Enumerable.Repeat:can be rewritten more compactly with String.Concat:The answer really depends on the complexity you want. For example, I want to outline all my indents with a vertical bar, so my indent string is determined as follows:
