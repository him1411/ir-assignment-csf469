My login view has a subview which has a UIActivityView and a UILabel saying "Signing In\xe2\x80\xa6". This subview has corners which aren\'t rounded. How can I make them round?Is there any way to do it inside my xib?Try this...Note: If you are trying to apply rounded corners to a UIViewController\'s view, it should not be applied in the view controller\'s constructor, but rather in -viewDidLoad, after view is actually instantiated.You can also use the User Defined Runtime Attributes feature of interface builder to set the key path layer.cornerRadius to a value.  Make sure you include the QuartzCore library though.This trick also works for setting layer.borderWidth however it will not work for layer.borderColor as this expects a CGColor not a UIColor.You will not be able to see the effects in the storyboard because these parameters are evaluated at runtime. Now you can use a swift category in UIView (code bellow the picture) in with @IBInspectable to show the result at the storyboard (If you are using the category, use only cornerRadius and not layer.cornerRadius as a key path.A different approach than the one Ed Marty did:You need the setMasksToBounds for it to load all the objects from IB... i got a problem where my view got rounded, but did not have the objects from IB :/this fixed it =D hope it helps!As described in this blog post, here is a method to round the corners of a UIView:The cool part about it is that you can select which corners you want rounded up.Short answer:If you have come to this answer, you have probably already seen enough to solve your problem. I\'m adding this answer to give a bit more visual explanation for why things do what they do.If you start with a regular UIView it has square corners.You can give it round corners by changing the cornerRadius property of the view\'s layer. Larger radius values give more rounded corners and smaller values give less rounded corners.This might be enough to solve your problem right there. However, sometimes a view can have a subview or a sublayer that goes outside of the view\'s bounds. For example, if I were to add a subview like thisor if I were to add a sublayer like thisThen I would end up with Now, if I don\'t want things hanging outside of the bounds, I can do thisor thiswhich gives this result:Both clipsToBounds and masksToBounds are equivalent. It is just that the first is used with UIView and the second is used with CALayer. You need to first import header file <QuartzCore/QuartzCore.h>Don\'t miss to use -setMasksToBounds , otherwise the effect may not be shown.You can use following custom UIView class written in Swift 3.0 which can also change border color and width. As this is IBDesignalbe You can change the attributes in interface builder as well.Please import Quartzcore framework then you have to set setMaskToBounds to TRUE this the very important line.Then: [[yourView layer] setCornerRadius:5.0f];Do this programatically in obj cWe Can Also do this from stoaryboard.You can also use an image:set cornerRadious Property for round Viewset masksToBounds Boolean Value for image will not still be drawn outside the corner radius boundaryUsing UIView Extension:Usage:ON Xcode 6\nYour tryor
