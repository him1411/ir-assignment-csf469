I\'ve just started working with Jenkins and have run into a problem. After installing several plugins it said it needs to be restarted and went into a "shutting down" mode, but never restarts.How do I do a manual restart?To restart Jenkins manually, you can use either of the following commands:(jenkins_url)/safeRestart - Allows all running jobs to complete. New jobs will remain in the queue to run after the restart is complete. (jenkins_url)/restart - Forces a restart without waiting for builds to complete.If you installed as a rpm or deb, then service jenkins restart will work also.On Ubuntu when installed through apt-get/dpkg:Need to be mentioned about SafeRestart Plugin. Pretty useful:On Windows if you installed it as a service go to Services( Start -> Run : services.msc),\nfind Jenkins, right click -> Restart.If it does not help(UI is not responding) open Windows Task Manager -> Processes, kill java.exe process and restart service once again.I am on Redhat and bellow command worked for me.To know the status of Jenkins:To start the Jenkins:To stop the Jenkins:To restart the Jenkins:Demo on command prompt:if you\'re running jenkins on Mac OS X then you can manually stop the service by executing this command:This can also be done using Jenkins CLIThe jenkins-cli.jar file along with full list of commands are available at http://[jenkins-server]/cliSome time there will be stale some jenkins processes, so ps -ef | grep jenkins kill all of them and restart as above it will be clean.if you want to just reload the configuration file, one can do This is quicker, if you have made some small change in the configuration file like config.xml directly on the file system or make copies of the job through the filesystem  ( not through the browser ).Use the command line interface https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+CLIIf you run FreeBSD:It depends on how jenkins has been started.as a service : sudo service jenkins restartor sudo /etc/init.d/jenkins restart, etc.as a web app in a tomcat : restart your tomcat, or just restart the app in tomcat. Go to http://<tomcat-server>:8080/manager/list or after authentication hit http://<tomcat-server>:8080/manager/stop?path=/myapp+ http://<tomcat-server>:8080/manager/start?path=/myapp.launched with just java -jar : kill it (kill -9 <pid>), and relaunch itlaunched with java -jar but from supervisor : supervisorctl restart jenkinsOn windowsGo to jenkins installation, open the cmd and runIf it is deployed war file then restart the application server eg tomcat,Several people have mentioned the need to restart the servlet container if Jenkins is not running as a standalone.  But tomcat (or what is being used) doesn\'t need to be restarted.  Tomcat can force a restart of the Jenkins context if your Jenkins restart is hung.But to address another comment, when you put jenkins in the "shutting down" mode it will not actually shut down.  What it does is stop new jobs from executing and place a giant red banner on the system pages so everyone knows that the admin wants to take it down eventually.  There are plugins to trigger a servlet container restart for that context after all builds are completed.The alternative is to wait till the last running job completes, then manually kick over Jennkins from the container (or via the command line options that others have mentioned for the standalone Jenkins install).from the terminal or (jenkinsurl/restart)If you are able to access it on web browser, just add /restart  e.g;\nlocalhost:8080/restart.if you are running it as a service the login to your server and execute the command:  "sudo service jenkins stop/start"If nothing works then find the jenkins process by and then Kill itJenkinURL/restart will do the restart.For Restart jenkins manually using browser:\nEnter Your www.jenkins-ip/restart \n(ex. http://localhost:8080/restart) in browser.\nJenkins will restart and load login page automatically after restartTry below, it worked for mesudo service jenkins status  It will give you PID of jenkins , now do a kill -15 [PID]sudo service jenkins startIf you are running the Jenkins as a server on windows machine.\nThen open the task manager and switch to the service tab. Search for Jenkins and restart it.For CentOs:sudo systemctl restart jenkinssudo systemctl status JenkinsJenkins will be active and up and running on some PID.
