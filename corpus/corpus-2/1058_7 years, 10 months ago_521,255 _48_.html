Is there a way to allow multiple cross-domains using the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header?I\'m aware of the *, but it is too open. I really want to allow just a couple domains.As an example, something like this:I have tried the above code but it doesn\'t seem to work in Firefox.Is it possible to specify multiple domains or am I stuck with just one?Sounds like the recommended way to do it is to have your server read the Origin header from the client, compare that to the list of domains you\'d like to allow, and if it matches, echo the value of the Origin header back to the client as the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in the response.With .htaccess you can do it like this:Another solution I\'m using in PHP:This worked for me:put in .htaccessit will work for sure.Cheers!!I had the same problem with woff-fonts, multiple subdomains had to have access. To allow subdomains I added something like this to my httpd.conf:For multiple domains you could just change the regex in SetEnvIf.Here\'s how to echo the Origin header back if it matches your domain with Nginx, this is useful if you want to serve a font multiple sub-domains:Here is what i did for a PHP application which is being requested by AJAXIf the requesting origin is allowed by my server, return the $http_origin itself as value of the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header instead of returning a * wildcard, For multiple domains, in your .htaccess:There is one disadvantage you should be aware of: As soon as you out-source files to a CDN (or any other server which doesn\'t allow scripting) or if your files are cached on a proxy, altering response based on \'Origin\' request header will not work.For IIS 7.5+ with URL Rewrite 2.0 module installed please see this SO answerFor Nginx users to allow CORS for multiple domains. I like the @marshall\'s example although his anwers only matches one domain. To match a list of domain and subdomain this regex make it ease to work with fonts:This will only echo "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" headers that matches with the given list of domains.Here\'s a solution for Java, based the answer from yesthatguy. For more info, http://patrickgrimard.com/2013/12/12/cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors-requests-with-spring-mvc/Maybe I\'m wrong .. but as far as I can see Access-Control-Allow-Origin has an "origin-list" as parameter.By definition an origin-list is:And from this I argue different origins are admitted and should be space separated ...I struggled to set this up for a domain running HTTPS, so I figured I would share the solution. I used the following directive in my httpd.conf file:Change example.com to your domain name.  Add this inside <VirtualHost x.x.x.x:xx> in your httpd.conf file.  Notice that if your VirtualHost has a port suffix (e.g. :80) then this directive will not apply to HTTPS, so you will need to also go to /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl and add the same directive in that file, inside of the <VirtualHost _default_:443> section.Once the config files are updated, you will need to run the following commands in the terminal:The answer seems to be to use the header more than once.  That is, rather than sendingsendOn Apache, you can do this in an httpd.conf <VirtualHost> section or .htaccess file using mod_headers and this syntax:The trick is to use add rather than append as the first argument.If you are having trouble with fonts, use:As mentioned above, Access-Control-Allow-Origin should be unique and Vary should be set to Origin if you are behind a CDN.\nRelevant part of my Nginx conf:HTTP_ORIGIN is not used by all browsers.  How secure is HTTP_ORIGIN? For me it comes up empty in FF.\nI have the sites that I allow access to my site send over a site ID, I then check my DB for the record with that id and get the SITE_URL column value (www.yoursite.com).  Even if the send over a valid site ID the request needs to be from the domain listed in my DB associated with that site ID.And one more answer in Django. To have a single view allow CORS from multiple domains, here is my code:Google\'s support answer on serving ads over SSL and the grammar in the RFC itself would seem to indicate that you can space delimit the URLs. Not sure how well-supported this is in different browsers.Here\'s an expanded option for apache that includes some of the latest and planned font definitions:To facilitate multiple domain access for an ASMX service, I created this function in the global.asax file:this allows for CORS handling of OPTIONS verb also.PHP code example for matching subdomains.We can also set this in Global.asax file for Asp.net application.If you try so many code examples like me to make it work using CORS, it is worth to mention that you have to clear your cache first to try if it actually works, similiar to issues like when old images are still present, even if it\'s deleted on the server (because it is still saved in your cache). For example CTRL + SHIFT + DEL in Google Chrome to delete your cache. This helped me using this code after trying many pure .htaccess solutions and this seemed the only one working (at least for me):Also note that it is widely spread that many solutions say you have to type Header set ... but it is Header add .... Hope this helps someone having the same troubles for some hours now like me.
