In AssemblyInfo there are two assembly versions:I can get the Assembly Version with the following line of code:But how can I get the Assembly File Version?See my comment above asking for clarification on what you really want. Hopefully this is it:There are three versions:  assembly, file, and product.  They are used by different features and take on different default values if you don\'t explicit specify them.  When I want to access the application file version (what is set in Assembly Information -> File version), say to set a label\'s text to it on form load to display the version, I have just usedUPDATE: As mentioned by Richard Grimes in my cited post, @Iain and @Dmitry Lobanov, my answer is right in theory but wrong in practice.As I should have remembered from countless books, etc., while one sets these properties using the [assembly: XXXAttribute], they get highjacked by the compiler and placed into the VERSIONINFO resource.For the above reason, you need to use the approach in @Xiaofu\'s answer as the attributes are stripped after the signal has been extracted from them.(From http://bytes.com/groups/net/420417-assemblyversionattribute - as noted there, if you\'re looking for a different attribute, substitute that into the above)Use this:Or this:You can get assembly version with My.Application.Info.Version
