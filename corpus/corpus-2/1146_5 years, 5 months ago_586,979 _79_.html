I cloned a git repository, which contains about 5 branches. However, when I do git branch I only see one of them:I know that I can do git branch -a to see all the branches, but how would I pull all the branches locally so when I do git branch, it shows:I\'ve written my answer some time ago and last downvote motivated me to update it with my later experience :-)Edit: previous version of this answer created branches with \'origin\' prefix, all pointing to master branch, instead of actual branches, and having problems with variable expansions. This has been fixed as per comments.You can fetch one branch from all remotes like this:fetch updates local copies of remote branches so this is always safe for your local branches BUT:fetch will not update local branches (which track remote branches); If you want to update your local branches you still need to pull every branch. fetch will not create local branches (which track remote branches), you have to do this manually. If you want to list all remote branches:\ngit branch -aTo update local branches which track remote branches:However, this can be still insufficient. It will work only for your local branches which track remote branches. To track all remote branches execute this oneliner BEFORE git pull --all:(it seems that pull fetches all branches from all remotes, but I always fetch first just to be sure)Run the first command only if there are remote branches on the server that aren\'t tracked by your local branches.P.S. AFAIK git fetch --all and git remote update are equivalent.Kamil Szot\'s comment, which 74 (at least) people found useful.I had to use:because your code created local branches named origin/branchname and\n  I was getting "refname \'origin/branchname\' is ambiguous whenever I\n  referred to it.You can check them out as local branches git checkout -b LocalName origin/remotebranchnameSince the original answer completely misses the point and an edit was rejected, here a concise answer:You will need to create local branches tracking remote branches.Assuming that you\'ve got only one remote called origin, this snippet will create local branches for all remote tracking ones:After that, git fetch --all will update all local copies of remote branches.Also, git pull --all will update your local tracking branches, but depending on your local commits and how the \'merge\' configure option is set it might create a merge commit, fast-forward or fail.If you do:then they will be all there locally.  If you then perform:you\'ll see them listed as remotes/origin/branch-name.  Since they are there locally you can do whatever you please with them.  For example:ororThis assumes all branches are trackedif they aren\'t you can fire this in bash Then run the command.what about git fetch && git checkout RemoteBranchName ? works very well for me...The bash for loop wasn\'t working for me, but this did exactly what I wanted. All the branches from my origin mirrored as the same name locally.When you clone a repository all the information of the branches is actually downloaded but the branches are hidden. With the commandyou can show all the branches of the repository, and with the commandyou can then "download" them manually one at a time. However, there is a much cleaner and quicker way, though it\'s a bit complicated. You need three steps to accomplish this:First stepcreate a new empty folder on your machine and clone a mirror copy of the .git folder from the repository:the local repository inside the folder my_repo_folder is still empty, there is just a hidden .git folder now that you can see with a "ls -alt" command from the terminal.Second stepswitch this repository from an empty (bare) repository to a regular repository by switching the boolean value "bare" of the git configurations to false:Third StepGrab everything that inside the current folder and create all the branches on the local machine, therefore making this a normal repo. So now you can just type the command git branch and you can see that all the branches are downloaded. This is the quick way in which you can clone a git repository with all the branches at once, but it\'s not something you wanna do for every single project in this way. I usually use nothing else but commands like this:A little shorter version:If you are here seeking a solution to get all branches and then migrate everything to another Git server, I put together the below process. If you just want to get all the branches updated locally, stop at the first empty line.You can fetch all the branches by:If you\'ve trouble fetching them, then precede the above command with:as the remote.origin.fetch could support only a specific branch while fetching, especially when you cloned your repo with --single-branch. Check this by: git config remote.origin.fetch.See: How to fetch all remote branches?After you clone the master repository, you just can executeLooping didn\'t seem to work for me and I wanted to ignore origin/master.\nHere\'s what worked for me.After that:I believe you have clone the repository by now go to that folder using cdif you type git status you can see all to see all hidden branch type it will list all the remote branchnow if you want to checkout on any particular branch just type Just those 3 commands will get all the branchesI wrote a little script to manage cloning a new repo and making local branches for all the remote branches.You can find the latest version here:To use it, just copy it into your git bin directory (for me, that\xe2\x80\x99s C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\bin\\git-cloneall), then, on the command line:It clones as usual, but creates local tracking branches for all remote branches.For Windows users using PowerShell:Make sure all the remote branches are fetchable in .git/config file. In this example, only the origin/production branch is fetchable, even if you try to do git fetch --all nothing will happen but fetching the production branch:This line should be replaced by:Then run git fetch etc...Based on the answer by Learath2, here\'s what I did after doing git clone [...] and cd-ing into the created directory:git branch -r | grep -v master | awk {print\\$1} | sed \'s/^origin\\/\\(.*\\)$/\\1 &/\' | xargs -n2 git checkout -bWorked for me but I can\'t know it\'ll work for you. Be careful.We can put all branch or tag names in a temporary file, then do git pull for each name/tag:Now locally your yourNewLocalBranchName is your requiredRemoteBranch.This will fetch all branches for you and then you can checkout to your desired branch throughHope this helps.
