I want to get a list of all the branches in a Git repository with the "freshest" branches at the top, where the "freshest" branch is the one that\'s been committed to most recently (and is, therefore, more likely to be one I want to pay attention to).Is there a way I can use Git to either (a) sort the list of branches by latest commit, or (b) get a list of branches together with each one\'s last-commit date, in some kind of machine-readable format?Worst case, I could always run git branch to get a list of all the branches, parse its output, and then git log -n 1 branchname --format=format:%ci for each one, to get each branch\'s commit date. But this will run on a Windows box, where spinning up a new process is relatively expensive, so launching the git executable once per branch could get slow if there are a lot of branches. Is there a way to do all this with a single command?Use --sort=-committerdate option of git for-each-ref;  Also available since Git 2.7.0 for git branch:To expand on Jakub\'s answer and Joe\'s tip, the following will strip out the "refs/heads/" so the output only displays the branch names:Tested!Here\'s the optimal code, which combines the other two answers:Here is a simple command that lists all branches with latest commits:To order by most recent commit, useSource: http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Branch-ManagementI also needed colors, tags and remote references without any duplicates:Because quoting can be hard, here the alias for bash:I use the following alias:recent = "!r(){git for-each-ref --sort=-committerdate refs/heads --format=\'%(HEAD)%(color:yellow)%(refname:short)|%(color:bold green)%(committerdate:relative)|%(color:blue)%(subject)|%(color:magenta)%(authorname)%(color:reset)\'|column -ts\'|\'}; r"which produces:\nEdit: use \'|\' to separate, thanks to @Bj\xc3\xb6rn LindqvistUpdate: added * before the current branch, thanks to @elhadi\nEdit: fixed a case where the current branch was a substring of another branchEdit: use a simpler syntax for the current branch, thanks to @Joshua SkrzypekThe other answers don\'t seem to allow passing -vv to get verbose output.So here\'s a one-liner that sorts git branch -vv by commit date, preserving color etc:If you additionally want to print the commit date, you can use this version instead:Sample output:It\'s probably more readable split into multiple lines:This should also work with other arguments to git branch, e.g. -vvr to list remote-tracking branches, or -vva to list both remote-tracking and local branches.git 2.7 (Q4 2015) will introduce branch sorting using directly git branch:\nSee commit aa3bc55, commit aedcb7d, commit 1511b22, commit f65f139, ... (23 Sep 2015), commit aedcb7d, commit 1511b22, commit ca41799 (24 Sep 2015), and commit f65f139, ... (23 Sep 2015) by Karthik Nayak (KarthikNayak).\n(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit 7f11b48, 15 Oct 2015) In particular, commit aedcb7d:Make \'branch.c\' use \'ref-filter\' APIs for iterating through refs sorting. This removes most of the code used in \'branch.c\' replacing it\nwith calls to the \'ref-filter\' library.It adds the option --sort=<key>:Sort based on the key given.\n  Prefix - to sort in descending order of the value. You may use the --sort=<key> option multiple times, in which case the last key becomes the primary key. The keys supported are the same as those in git for-each-ref.\n  Sort order defaults to sorting based on the full refname (including refs/... prefix). This lists detached HEAD (if present) first, then local branches and finally remote-tracking branches.Here:See also commit 9e46833 (30 Oct 2015) by Karthik Nayak (KarthikNayak).\nHelped-by: Junio C Hamano (gitster).\n(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit 415095f, 03 Nov 2015) When sorting as per numerical values (e.g. --sort=objectsize) there is no fallback comparison when both refs hold the same value. This can cause unexpected results (i.e. the order of listing refs with equal values cannot be pre-determined) as pointed out by Johannes Sixt ($gmane/280117).Hence, fallback to alphabetical comparison based on the refname\n  whenever the other criterion is equal.I like using a relative date and shortening the branch name like this:Which gives you output:I recommend making a bash file for adding all your favorite aliases and then sharing the script out to your team.  Here\'s an example to add just this one:    Then you can just do this to get a nicely formatted and sorted local branch list:Update:\nDo this if you want coloring:Adds some color (since pretty-format isn\'t available)I had the same problem, so I wrote a Ruby gem called Twig. It lists branches in chronological order (newest first), and can also let you set a max age so that you don\'t list all branches (if you have a lot of them). For example:It also lets you store custom properties for each branch, e.g., ticket id, status, todos, and filter the list of branches according to these properties. More info: http://rondevera.github.io/twig/FYI, if you\'d like to get a list of recently checked out branches (as opposed to recently committed) you can use git\'s reflog:See also: How can I get a list of git branches that I've recently checked out?I was able to reference the examples above to create something that works best for me.git for-each-ref --sort=-committerdate refs/heads/\n  --format=\'%(authordate:short) %(color:red)%(objectname:short) %(color:yellow)%(refname:short)%(color:reset)\n  (%(color:green)%(committerdate:relative)%(color:reset))\'Here is another script that does what all the other scripts do.  In fact, it provides a function for your shell.Its contribution is that it pulls some colours from your git config (or uses defaults).My best result as a script:Based on ilius\' version, but with the current branch shown with a star and in color, and only showing anything that is not described as "months" or "years" ago:Here\'s the variation I was looking for:That tail -r reverses the list so the most-recent commiterdate is last.Late to the party here. The accepted CML answer rocks, but if you want something prettier, like a GUI, and your origin === "github". You can click  "Branches" in the repo. or hit the url direct: https://github.com/ORGANIZATION_NAME/REPO_NAME/branchesI pipe the output from the accepted answer into dialog, to give me an interactive list:Save as (e.g.) ~/bin/git_recent_branches.sh and chmod +x it. Then git config --global alias.rb \'!git_recent_branches.sh\' to give me a new git rb command.Here\'s a little script that I use to switch between recent branchs:Using those two aliasesJust call that in a git repo and it will show you the last N branches (10 by default) and a number aside each. Input the number of the branch and it checks out.I came up with the following command:If you don\xe2\x80\x99t have column you can replace the last line withThe output looks likeI wrote a blog post about how the various pieces work.
