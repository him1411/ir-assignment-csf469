Is it possible to draw a border around a textview?You can set a shape drawable (a rectangle) as background for the view.And rectangle drawable back.xml (put into res/drawable folder):You can use @android:color/transparent for the solid color to have a transparent background.\nYou can also use padding to separate the text from the border.\nfor more information see: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/drawable-resource.htmlLet me summarize a few different (non-programmatic) methods.Save the following as an XML file in your drawable folder (for example, my_border.xml):Then just set it as the background to your TextView:More help:A 9-patch is a stretchable background image. If you make an image with a border then it will give your TextView a border. All you need to do is make the image and then set it to the background in your TextView.Here are some links that will show how to make a 9-patch image:Using a layer-listYou can use a layer list to stack two rectangles on top of each other. By making the second rectangle just a little smaller than the first rectangle, you can make a border effect. The first (lower) rectangle is the border color and the second rectangle is the background color.Setting android:top="2dp" offsets the top (makes it smaller) by 2dp. This allows the first (lower) rectangle to show through, giving a border effect. You can apply this to the TextView background the same way that the shape drawable was done above.Here are some more links about layer lists:Using a 9-patchYou can just make a 9-patch image with a single border. Everything else is the same as discussed above.Using a ViewThis is kind of a trick but it works well if you need to add a seperator between two views or a border to a single TextView.Here are some more links:The simple way is to add a view for your TextView. Example for the bottom border line:For the other direction borders, please adjust the location of the separator view.I have solved this issue by extending the textview and drawing a border manually.\nI even added so you can select if a border is dotted or dashed.And the border class:Hope this helps someone :)I was just looking at a similar answer-- it\'s able to be done with a Stroke and the following override:I found a better way to put a border around a TextView.Use a nine-patch image for the background. It\'s pretty simple, the SDK comes with a tool to make the 9-patch image, and it involves absolutely no coding.The link is http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/2d-graphics.html#nine-patch.You can set the border by two methods. One is by drawable and the second is programmatic.ProgrammaticCheck the link below to make rounded corners\nhttp://androidcookbook.com/Recipe.seam?recipeId=2318The drawable folder, under res, in an Android project is not restricted to bitmaps (PNG or JPG files), but it can also hold shapes defined in XML files.These shapes can then be reused in the project. A shape can be used to put a border around a layout. This example shows a rectangular border with curved corners. A new file called customborder.xml is created in the drawable folder (in Eclipse use the File menu and select New then File, with the drawable folder selected type in the file name and click Finish).The XML defining the border shape is entered:The attribute android:shape is set to rectangle (shape files also support oval, line, and ring). Rectangle is the default value, so this attribute could be left out if it is a rectangle being defined. See the Android documentation on shapes at http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/drawable-resource.html#Shape for detailed information on a shape file.The element corners sets the rectangle corners to be rounded. It is possible to set a different radius on each corner (see the Android reference).The padding attributes are used to move the contents of the View to which the shape is applied, to prevent the contents overlapping the\nborder.The border color here is set to a light gray (CCCCCC hexadecimal RGB value).Shapes also support gradients, but that is not being used here. Again, see the Android resources to see how a gradient is defined. The shape is applied to the laypout using android:background="@drawable/customborder".Within the layout other views can be added as normal. In this example, a single TextView has been added, and the text is white (FFFFFF hexadecimal RGB). The background is set to blue, plus some transparency to reduce the brightness (A00000FF hexadecimal alpha RGB value). Finally the layout is offset from the screen edge by placing it into another layout with a small amount of padding. The full layout file is thus:You can add something like this in your code:I have a way to do it very simple, and I\'d like to share it. When I want to square mi TextViews, I just put them in a LinearLayout. I set the background color of my LinearLayout, and I add a padding to my TextView. The result is exactly as if you square the TextView.Here is my \'simple\' helper class which returns an ImageView with the border. Just drop this in your utils folder, and call it like this:Here is the code.This may help you.Actually, it is very simple. If you want a simple black rectangle behind the Textview, just add android:background="@android:color/black" within the TextView tags. Like this:
