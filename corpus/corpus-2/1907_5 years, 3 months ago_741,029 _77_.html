I\'ve installed Visual Studio 2012 Release Preview, and it appears to be fine, but now when I try to use Visual Studio 2010 to compile C++ projects, I get the following error message:LINK : fatal error LNK1123: failure during conversion to COFF: file invalid or corruptI\'m not 100% sure of this, but it seems to be related to projects that have .rc (resource) files in them.I\'ve tried repairing Visual Studio 2010 from Add/Remove programs and rebooting, but this has no effect.I also get the same error if I use Visual Studio 2012 RC to compile the C++ projects when set to use the Visual Studio 2010 toolset. Upgrading to the Visual Studio 2011 toolset fixes the problem (but of course I don\'t want to do this for production code).Update: I\'ve uninstalled Visual Studio 2012, rebooted, and the problem still persists! Help!This MSDN thread explains how to fix it.To summarize: Either disable incremental linking, by going to or install VS2010 SP1.Edits (@CraigRinger): Note that installing VS 2010 SP1 will remove the 64-bit compilers. You need to install the VS 2010 SP1 compiler pack to get them back.This affects Microsoft Windows SDK 7.1 for Windows 7 and .NET 4.0 as well as Visual Studio 2010.If disabling incremental linking doesn\'t work for you, and turning off "Embed Manifest" doesn\'t work either, then search your path for multiple versions of CVTRES.exe.By debugging with the /VERBOSE linker option I found the linker was writing that error message when it tried to invoke cvtres and it failed.It turned out that I had two versions of this utility in my path.  One at C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\\VC\\BIN\\cvtres.exe and one at C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\cvtres.exe.   After VS2012 install, the VS2010 version of cvtres.exe will no longer work.  If that\'s the first one in your path, and the linker decides it needs to convert a .res file to COFF object format, the link will fail with LNK1123.(Really annoying that the error message has nothing to do with the actual problem, but that\'s not unusual for a Microsoft product.)Just delete/rename the older version of the utility, or re-arrange your PATH variable, so that the version that works comes first.Be aware that for x64 tooling builds you may also have to check C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\\VC\\bin\\amd64 where there is another cvtres.exe.Check the version of cvtrs.exe:Wrong version:\ndate: 03/18/2010\ntime: 01:16 PM\nsize: 31,048 bytes \nname: cvtres.exeCorrect version:\ndate: 02/21/2011\ntime: 06:03 PM\nsize: 31,056 bytes \nname: cvtres.exeIf you have wrong version you should copy the correct version from:and replace the one here:i.e.According to this thread in MSDN forums: VS2012 RC installation breaks VS2010 C++ projects, simply, take cvtres.exe from VS2010 SP1or from VS2012and copy it over the cvtres.exe in VS2010 RTM installation (the one without SP1)This way, you will effectively use the corrected version of cvtres.exe which is 11.0.51106.1.Repeat the same steps for 64-bit version of the tool in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\\VC\\bin\\amd64\\cvtres.exe.This solution is an alternative to installation of SP1 for VS2010 - in some cases you simply can\'t install SP1 (i.e. if you need to support pre-SP1 builds).If you have installed Visual Studio 2012 RC, then it installed .NET 4.5 RC.Uninstall .NET 4.5 RC, and install the version you need (4.0 for VS 2010). This should clear up any problems you are having.This solved the same problem. There is no need to uninstall Visual Studio.It\'s because of .NET Framework 4.5 is replacing .NET Framework 4.0.\nI uninstalled Visual Studio 2010 several times with no luck. When I removed .NET Framework 4.5 and reinstalled Visual Studio 2010 it went fine.See Uninstall Visual Studio 11 completely to do a fresh install.For me, setting \'Generate Manifest\' to \'No\' fixed it. (Also fixed with /INCREMENTAL:NO)I solved this problem eventually by doing a full uninstall of VS2012 RC, followed by a full uninstall of VS2010, then a reinstall from scratch of VS2010.It took forever, but I\'m now able to compile C++ projects in VS2010 again.If you\'re using x64, here\'s a resource will help:This happens because Microsoft .NET 4.5 is incompatible with Visual C++ 10. The workaround is to ensure that you run the .NET version of cvtres.exe rather than the Visual C++ version. I did this by renaming the Visual C++ versions of those files and copying the .NET versions in their place.The issue was magically resolved for me by removing .NET 4.5, and replacing it with .NET 4.0. I then had to repair Visual Studio 2010 - it being corrupted along the way somehow.I had previously installed, and then un-installed, Visual Studio 2012 - which may be related to the issue.I have not installed Visual Studio 2012, but I still got this error in Visual Studio 2010. I got this resolved after installing Visual Studio 2010 SP1.+1 to user Short for an answer that worked for me!I tried to do some debugging of this with msbuild /v:diag, and I\'m seeing that MSBuild is trying to embed a manifest in the executable, with <somename>.dll.embed.manifest.res on the linker command line, where that is a resource file built from <somename>.dll.embed.manifest. But the manifest file is an empty Unicode text file. (That is, a two-byte file with the Unicode 0xFEFF prefix)So the root problem seems to have something to do with that manifest file not being generated, or it being used when <somename>.dll.intermediate.manifest should have been used.An alternate solution seems to be to turn off the "Embed Manifest" option under Properties, Manifest Tool, Input and Output.It didn\'t work for me after Enable Incremental Linking -> "No (/INCREMENTAL:NO)", but it works for me after I deleted the rc file.As of January 2014, for some reasons I got installed .NET Framework 4.5.1, I don\'t know if due to a third party software installation or to an automatic update. On January 29th, I got installed one component and I started receiving the message. At that time, I solved by avoiding the incremental link. On Jan. 31st, I got installed another component of .NET Framework 4.5.1 and the incremental link trick did not work anymore. I then installed the Visual Studio 2010 SP1, but afterwards the problem became: I think the SP1 messed up my Visual Studio 2010 installation. So I uninstalled .NET Framework 4.5.1, installed .NET Framework 4.0 and uninstalled and then reinstalled Visual Studio 2010. That worked for me.I had the same problem with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate and it was solved by the method described in this youtube video The video suggests to rename the file cvtres.exe in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\\VC\\bin (in my Win7X64 matchine) to cvtres-old.exeEven inspite of installing Service pack you are getting the error then try removing/renaming the cvtres.exe in the C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\\VC\\bin folder. This has worked for me.To summarize:if step1 not work, do Step2if step2 not work, do Step3\nCopy file one of:C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\n13.0\\VC\\bin\\cvtres.exeThen, replace to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\n10.0\\VC\\bin\\cvtres.exe\nWith me, do 3 step it workI set Enable Incremental Linking to "No (/INCREMENTAL:NO)" and it doesn\'t work for me.Next I\'ve changed:and it works for me :)My problem was that I\'ve had two paths on my PC that contained the same libraries. Both paths were added to the Additional Library Directories in Configuration Properties -> Linker -> General. Removing one of the paths solved the problem.I tried a few times and finally solved the problem by uninstalling several times the VS2010. I think I hadn\'t uninstalled all the files and that\'s why it didn\'t work for the first time. In the installation of VS2012, it is said that if you have VS2010 SP1 you can\'t work on the same project in both programs. It is recommended to have only one program. Thanks!Reinstalling CMake worked for me. The new copy of CMake figured out that it should use Visual Studio 11 instead of 10.I was using the Windows SDK for core Win32 programming and had .NET 4.5 installed for "unknown" reasons. I have uninstalled that and installed 4.0 like previous answers and yeah, it worked for me too.Just am flabbergasted that I had to use the useless .NET framework for building Win32 apps using the SDK.I solved this by doing the following:Thus the problem will go forever. Do build randomly and debug your C++ projects without any disturbance.For those of you looking for a solution for this problem with the OpenGL SuperBible 6th source code samples, the solution is building in Release instead of Debug. All projects have disabled the incremental linking option in the Release version.I had the same problem after updating of .NET: \nI uninstalled the .NET framework first,\ndownloaded visual studio from visualstudio.com and selected "repair". NET framework were installed automatically with visual studio -> and now it works fine!
