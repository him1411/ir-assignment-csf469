I find %~dp0 very useful, and I use it a lot to make my batch files more portable.But the label itself seems very cryptic to me...  what is the ~ doing? does dp mean drive and path? does the 0 refer to %0, the path to the batch file that includes the file name?Or is it just a weird label?I\'d also like to know if it is a documented feature, or something prone to be deprecated.Callingin the command-line gives help about this syntax (which can be used outside FOR, too, this is just the place where help can be found).In addition, substitution of FOR\n  variable references has been enhanced.\n  You can now use the following optional\n  syntax:The modifiers can be combined to get\n  compound results:In the above examples %I and PATH can\n  be replaced by other valid values. \n  The %~ syntax is terminated by a valid\n  FOR variable name. Picking upper case\n  variable names like %I makes it more\n  readable and avoids confusion with the\n  modifiers, which are not case\n  sensitive.There are different letters you can use like f for "full path name", d for drive letter, p for path, and they can be combined. %~ is the beginning for each of those sequences and a number I denotes it works on the parameter %I (where %0 is the complete name of the batch file, just like you assumed).(First, I\'d like to recommend this useful reference site for batch:\nhttp://ss64.com/nt/)Then just another useful explanation: http://htipe.wordpress.com/2008/10/09/the-dp0-variable/The %~dp0 (that\xe2\x80\x99s a zero) variable when referenced within a Windows\n  batch file will expand to the drive letter and path of that batch\n  file.The variables %0-%9 refer to the command line parameters of the batch\n  file. %1-%9 refer to command line arguments after the batch file name.\n  %0 refers to the batch file itself.If you follow the percent character (%) with a tilde character (~),\n  you can insert a modifier(s) before the parameter number to alter the\n  way the variable is expanded. The d modifier expands to the drive\n  letter and the p modifier expands to the path of the parameter.Example:  Let\xe2\x80\x99s say you have a directory on C: called bat_files, and\n  in that directory is a file called example.bat. In this case, %~dp0\n  (combining the d and p modifiers) will expand to C:\\bat_files.Check out this Microsoft article for a full explanation.Also, check out this forum thread.And a more clear reference from here:%CmdCmdLine%    will return the entire command line as passed to CMD.EXE%*  will return the remainder of the command line starting at the first command line argument (in Windows NT 4, %* also includes all leading spaces)%~dn    will return the drive letter of %n (n can range from 0 to 9) if %n is a valid path or file name (no UNC)%~pn    will return the directory of %n if %n is a valid path or file name (no UNC)%~nn    will return the file name only of %n if %n is a valid file name%~xn    will return the file extension only of %n if %n is a valid file name%~fn    will return the fully qualified path of %n if %n is a valid file name or directoryhttp://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/percent.mspx?mfr=trueThe variable %0 in a batch script is set to the name of the executing batch file.  The ~dp special syntax between the % and the 0 basically says to expand the variable %0 to show the drive letter and path, which gives you the current directory containing the batch file!Another tip that would help a lot is that to set the current directory to a different drive one would have to use %~d0 first, then cd %~dp0. This will change the directory to the batch file\'s drive, then change to its folder.Alternatively, for #oneLinerLovers, as @Omni pointed out in the comments cd /d %~dp0 will change both the drive and directory :)Hope this helps someone.%~dp0 expands to current directory path of the running batch file.To get clear understanding, let\'s create a batch file in a directory.C:\\script\\test.batwith contents:When you run it from command prompt, you will see this result:C:\\script\\Great example from Strawberry Perl\'s portable shell launcher:not sure what the negative 1\'s doing there myself, but it works a treat!An example would be nice - here\'s a trivial oneit lists only the EXTENSIONS of each file in current folderfor more useful variable combinations (also listed in previous response) from the CMD prompt execute:  HELP FOR\nwhich contains this snippetThe modifiers can be combined to get compound results:
