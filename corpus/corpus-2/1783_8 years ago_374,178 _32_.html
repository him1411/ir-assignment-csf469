How can I convert a NSString containing a number of any primitive data type (e.g. int, float, char, unsigned int, etc.)? The problem is, I don\'t know which number type the string will contain at runtime.I have an idea how to do it, but I\'m not sure if this works with any type, also unsigned and floating point values:Thanks for the help.Use an NSNumberFormatter:If the string is not a valid number, then myNumber will be nil.  If it is a valid number, then you now have all of the NSNumber goodness to figure out what kind of number it actually is.You can use -[NSString integerValue], -[NSString floatValue], etc. However, the correct (locale-sensitive, etc.) way to do this is to use -[NSNumberFormatter numberFromString:] which will give you an NSNumber converted from the appropriate locale and given the settings of the NSNumberFormatter (including whether it will allow floating point values).(Note: this method doesn\'t play nice with difference locales, but is slightly faster than a NSNumberFormatter)Simple but dirty wayThe extension-way\nThis is better, really, because it\'ll play nicely with locales and decimals. Now you can simply do:For strings starting with integers, e.g., @"123", @"456 ft", @"7.89", etc., use -[NSString integerValue].So, @([@"12.8 lbs" integerValue]) is like doing [NSNumber numberWithInteger:12].You can also do this:Have fun!If you know that you receive integers, you could use:Here\'s a working sample of NSNumberFormatter reading localized number NSString (xCode 3.2.4, osX 10.6), to save others the hours I\'ve just spent messing around. Beware: while it can handle trailing blanks ("8,765.4 " works), this cannot handle leading white space and this cannot handle stray text characters. (Bad input strings: " 8"  and "8q" and "8 q".)I wanted to convert a string to a double. This above answer didn\'t quite work for me. But this did: How to do string conversions in Objective-C?All I pretty much did was:Thanks All! I am combined feedback and finally manage to convert from text input ( string ) to Integer. Plus it could tell me whether the input is integer :)I think NSDecimalNumber will do it:Example:NSDecimalNumber is a subclass of NSNumber, so implicit casting allowed.What about C\'s standard atoi?Do you think there are any caveats?You can just use [string intValue] or [string floatValue] or [string doubleValue] etcYou can also use NSNumberFormatter class:you can also do like this code 8.3.3 ios 10.3 supportWorked in Swift 3 I know this is very late but below code is working for me.Try this codeNSNumber *number = @([dictionary[@"keyValue"] intValue]]);This may help you. Thanks
