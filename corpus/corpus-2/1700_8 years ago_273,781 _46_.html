What is the difference between the id and name attributes? They both seem to serve the same purpose of providing an identifier.I would like to know (specifically with regards to HTML forms) whether or not using both is necessary or encouraged for any reasons.The name attribute is used when sending data in a form submission.  Different controls respond differently.  For example, you may have several radio buttons with different id attributes, but the same name.  When submitted, there is just the one value in the response - the radio button you selected.Of course, there\'s more to it than that, but it will definitely get you thinking in the right direction.Use name attributes for form controls (such as <input> and <select>), as that\'s the identifier used in the POST or GET call that happens on form submission.Use id attributes whenever you need to address a particular HTML element with CSS, JavaScript or a fragment identifier. It\'s possible to look up elements by name, too, but it\'s simpler and more reliable to look them up by ID.Id is used to identify the HTML element through the Document Object Model (via Javascript or styled with CSS). Id is expected to be unique within the page. Name corresponds to the form element and identifies what is posted back to the server. See this http://mindprod.com/jgloss/htmlforms.html#IDVSNAMEWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the difference? The short answer is, use both and don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it. But if you want to understand this goofiness, here\xe2\x80\x99s the skinny:id= is for use as a target like this: <some-element id="XXX"></some-element> for links like this: <a href="#XXX".name= is also used to label the fields in the message send to a server with an HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) GET or POST when you hit submit in a form.id= labels the fields for use by JavaScript and Java DOM (Document Object Model).\n  The names in name= must be unique within a form. The names in id= must be unique within the entire document.Sometimes the the name= and id= names will differ, because the server is expecting the same name from various forms in the same document or various radio buttons in the same form as in the example above. The id= must be unique; the name= must not be.JavaScript needed unique names, but there were too many documents already out here without unique name= names, so the W3 people invented the id tag that was required to be unique. Unfortunately older browsers did not understand it. So you need both naming schemes in your forms.NOTE: attribute "name" for some tags like <a> is not supported in HTML5.The way I think about it and use it is simple:id is used for CSS and JavaScript/jQuery (has to be unique in a page)name is used for form handling in PHP when a form is submitted via HTML (has to be unique in a form - to some extent, see Paul\'s comment below)ID tag - used by CSS, define a unique instance of a div, span or other elements. Appears within the Javascript DOM model, allowing you to access them with various function calls.Name tag for fields - This is unique per form -- unless you are doing an array which you want to pass to PHP/server-side processing. You can access it via Javascript by name, but I think that it does not appear as a node in the DOM or some restrictions may apply (you cannot use .innerHTML, for example, if I recall correctly).name is deprecated for link targets, and invalid in HTML5. It no longer works at least in latest Firefox (v13). Change <a name="hello"> to<a id="hello">The target does not need to be an <a> tag, it can be <p id="hello"> or <h2 id="hello"> etc. which is often cleaner code.As other posts say clearly, name is still used (needed) in forms. It is also still used in META tags.This link has answers to the same basic question, but basically, id is used for scripting identification and name is for server-side.http://www.velocityreviews.com/forums/t115115-id-vs-name-attribute-for-html-controls.htmlnameidGenerally, it is assumed that name is always superseded by id. This is true, to some extent, but not for form fields and frame names, practically speaking. For example, with form elements the name attribute is used to determine the name-value pairs to be sent to a server-side program and should not be eliminated. Browsers do not use id in that manner. To be on the safe side, you could use name and id attributes on form elements. So, we would write the following:To ensure compatibility, having matching name and id attribute values when both are defined is a good idea. However, be careful\xe2\x80\x94some tags, particularly radio buttons, must have nonunique name values, but require unique id values. Once again, this should reference that id is not simply a replacement for name; they are different in purpose. Furthermore, do not discount the old-style approach, a deep look at modern libraries shows such syntax style used for performance and ease purposes at times. Your goal should always be in favor of compatibility.Now in most elements, the name attribute has been deprecated in favor of the more ubiquitous id attribute. However, in some cases, particularly form fields (<button>, <input>, <select>, and <textarea>), the name attribute lives on because it continues to be required to set the name-value pair for form submission. Also, we find that some elements, notably frames and links, may continue to use the name attribute because it is often useful for retrieving these elements by name.There is a clear distinction between id and name. Very often when name continues on, we can set the values the same. However, id must be unique, and name in some cases shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94think radio buttons. Sadly, the uniqueness of id values, while caught by markup validation, is not as consistent as it should be. CSS implementation in browsers will style objects that share an id value; thus, we may not catch markup or style errors that could affect our JavaScript until runtime.This is taken from the book JavaScript- The Complete Reference by Thomas-Powell If you\'re not using the form\'s own submit method to send information to a server (and are instead doing it using javascript) you can use the name attribute to attach extra information to an input - rather like pairing it with a hidden input value, but looks neater because it\'s incorporated into the input.This bit does still currently work in Firefox although I suppose in the future it might not get allowed through.You can have multiple input fields with the same name value, as long as you aren\'t planning to submit the old fashioned way.The ID of a form input element has nothing to do with the data contained within the element. IDs are for hooking the element with JavaScript and CSS. The name attribute, however, is used in the HTTP request sent by your browser to the server as a variable name associated with the data contained in the value attribute.For instance:When the form is submitted, the form data will be included in the HTTP header like this:If you add an ID attribute, it will not change anything in the HTTP header. It will just make it easier to hook it with CSS and JavaScript.Below is an interesting use of the id attribute. It is used within the  tag and used to identify the form for  elements outside of the  boundaries so that they will be included with the other  fields within the form. Id : \n1) It is used to identify the HTML element through the Document Object Model (via Javascript or styled with CSS). \n2) Id is expected to be unique within the page.Name corresponds to the form element and identifies what is posted back to the server.\nExample : The "id" tag is used by CSS and JavaScript to assign styles and act on the input item.  Libraries like jquery use the id as a shortcut identifier, so it\'s generally useful to set.The "name" attribute of a form element is what actually gets sent by your web browser in the HTTP GET or POST submission/request to the web server.  If you leave it blank, you won\'t have a proper identifier tied to your content.You may, however, be using JavaScript to submit your forms via AJAX, meaning that you never send form variables via GET or POST through direct web browser submission.  In that case, the name field is unnecessary, although it\'s not great convention.
