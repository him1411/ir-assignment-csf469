I prefer to use OOP in large scale projects like the one I\'m working on right now. I need to create several classes in JavaScript but, if I\'m not mistaken, there are at least a couple of ways to go about doing that. What would be the syntax and why would it be done in that way?I would like to avoid using third-party libraries - at least at first.\nLooking for other answers, I found the article Object-Oriented Programming with JavaScript, Part I: Inheritance - Doc JavaScript that discusses object-oriented programming in JavaScript. Is there a better way to do inheritance? Here\'s the way to do it without using any external libraries:Now the real answer is a whole lot more complex than that. For instance, there is no such thing as classes in JavaScript. JavaScript uses a prototype-based inheritance scheme.  In addition, there are numerous popular JavaScript libraries that have their own style of approximating class-like functionality in JavaScript. You\'ll want to check out at least Prototype and jQuery.  Deciding which of these is the "best" is a great way to start a holy war on Stack Overflow. If you\'re embarking on a larger JavaScript-heavy project, it\'s definitely worth learning a popular library and doing it their way. I\'m a Prototype guy, but Stack Overflow seems to lean towards jQuery.As far as there being only "one way to do it", without any dependencies on external libraries, the way I wrote is pretty much it.   The best way to define a class in JavaScript is to not define a class.Seriously.There are several different flavors of object-orientation, some of them are: And probably others I don\'t know about.JavaScript implements prototype-based OO. In prototype-based OO, new objects are created by copying other objects (instead of being instantiated from a class template) and methods live directly in objects instead of in classes. Inheritance is done via delegation: if an object doesn\'t have a method or property, it is looked up on its prototype(s) (i.e. the object it was cloned from), then the prototype\'s prototypes and so on.In other words: there are no classes.JavaScript actually has a nice tweak of that model: constructors. Not only can you create objects by copying existing ones, you can also construct them "out of thin air", so to speak. If you call a function with the new keyword, that function becomes a constructor and the this keyword will not point to the current object but instead to a newly created "empty" one. So, you can configure an object any way you like. In that way, JavaScript constructors can take on one of the roles of classes in traditional class-based OO: serving as a template or blueprint for new objects.Now, JavaScript is a very powerful language, so it is quite easy to implement a class-based OO system within JavaScript if you want to. However, you should only do this if you really have a need for it and not just because that\'s the way Java does it.In the ES2015 specification, you can use the class syntax which is just sugar over the prototype system.The main benefit is that static analysis tools find it easier to target this syntax. It is also easier for others coming from class-based languages to use the language as a polyglot. Be wary of its current limitations. To achieve private properties, one must resort to using Symbols or WeakMaps. In future releases, classes will most likely be expanded to include these missing features.Browser support isn\'t very good at the moment (supported by nearly everyone except IE), but you can use these features now with a transpiler like Babel.I prefer to use Daniel X. Moore\'s {SUPER: SYSTEM}. This is a discipline that provides benefits such as true instance variables, trait based inheritance, class hierarchies and configuration options. The example below illustrates the use of true instance variables, which I believe is the biggest advantage. If you don\'t need instance variables and are happy with only public or private variables then there are probably simpler systems.Wow, that\'s not really very useful on it\'s own, but take a look at adding a subclass:Another advantage is the ability to have modules and trait based inheritance.An example of having the person class include the bindable module.Disclosure: I am Daniel X. Moore and this is my {SUPER: SYSTEM}. It is the best way to define a class in JavaScript.Following are the ways to create objects in javascript, which I\'ve used so farExample 1:Example 2:Example 3:Example 4: Actual benefits of Object.create(). please refer [this link]\nExample 5 (customised Crockford\'s Object.create):A class is defined like this:I think you should read Douglas Crockford\'s Prototypal Inheritance in JavaScript and Classical Inheritance in JavaScript.Examples from his page:Effect? It will allow you to add methods in more elegant way:I also recommend his videos:\nAdvanced JavaScript.You can find more videos on his page: http://javascript.crockford.com/\nIn John Reisig book you can find many examples from Douglas Crockfor\'s website.Because I will not admit the YUI/Crockford factory plan and because I like to keep things self contained and extensible this is my variation:where ideally the typeof test is on something like the first method prototypedIf you\'re going for simple, you can avoid the "new" keyword entirely and just use factory methods.  I prefer this, sometimes, because I like using JSON to create objects.I\'m not sure what the performance hit is for large objects, though.Thats the way TypeScript compiles class with constructor to JavaScript.You probably want to create a type by using the Folding Pattern:That code will give you a type called myType. It will have internal private fields called toggle and text. It will also have these exposed members: the fields count and numbers; the properties toggle, text and numberLength; the methods incrementNumbersByCount and tweak.The Folding Pattern is fully detailed here:\nJavascript Folding PatternThe simple way is:The reason for that is that this can be bound to something else if you give a method as an event handler, so you save the value during instantiation and use it later.Edit: it\'s definitely not the best way, just a simple way. I\'m waiting for good answers too!Code golf for @liammclennan\'s answer.MooTools (My Object Oriented Tools) is centered on the idea of classes.  You can even extend and implement with inheritance.  When mastered, it makes for ridiculously reusable, powerful javascript.Object Based Classes with InheritenceSimple, sweet, and gets \'er done.JavaScript is object-oriented, but it\'s radically different than other OOP languages like Java, C# or C++. Don\'t try to understand it like that. Throw that old knowledge out and start anew. JavaScript needs a different thinking.I\'d suggest to get a good manual or something on the subject. I myself found ExtJS Tutorials the best for me, although I haven\'t used the framework before or after reading it. But it does give a good explanation about what is what in JavaScript world. Sorry, it seems that that content has been removed. Here\'s a link to archive.org copy instead. Works today. :PA baseA classActionBased on the example of Triptych, this might even be simpler:This only creates a single object instance, but is still useful if you want to encapsulate a bunch of names for variable and methods in a class. Normally there would not be the "Bob, M" arguments to the constructor, for example if the methods would be calls to a system with its own data, such as a database or network.I am still too new with JS to see why this does not use the prototype thing.
