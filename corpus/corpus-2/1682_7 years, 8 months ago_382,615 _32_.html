I have simple HTML:I want to display HTML styled text it in TextView. How to do this?You need to use Html.fromHtml() to use HTML in your XML Strings. Simply referencing a String with HTML in your layout XML will not work.For example (< Android Nougat):For example (>= Android Nougat):To distinguish between Android versions use Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.N.Have a look on this: https://stackoverflow.com/a/8558249/450148It is pretty good too!!It works only for few tags.setText(Html.fromHtml(bodyData)) is deprecated after api 24. Now you have to do this: If you want to be able to configure it through xml without any modification in java code you may find this idea helpful. Simply you call init from constructor and set the text as htmlxml: The below code gave best result for me.If you are trying to show HTML from a string resource id, the formatting may not show up on screen.  If that is happening to you, try using CDATA tags instead:...See this post for further details.It\'s worth mentioning that the method Html.fromHtml(String source) is deprecated as of API level 24. If that\'s your target API, you should use Html.fromHtml(String source, int flags) instead.If you just want to display some html text and don\'t really need a TextView, then take a WebView and use it like following:This does not restrict you to a few html tags either.The best approach to use CData sections for the string in strings.xml file to get a actual display of the html content to the TextView the below code snippet will give you the fair idea.CData section in string text keeps the html tag data intact even after formatting text using String.format method. So, Html.fromHtml(str) works fine and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see the bold text in Welcome message.Output:Welcome, to your favorite music app store. Logged in as: usernameI would like also to suggest following project: https://github.com/NightWhistler/HtmlSpannerUsage is almost the same as default android converter:Found it after I already started by own implementation of html to spannable converter, because standard Html.fromHtml does not provide enough flexibility over rendering control and even no possibility to use custom fonts from ttfSimple use Html.fromHtml("html string"). This will work. If the string has tags like <h1> then spaces will come. But we cannot eliminate those spaces. If you still want to remove the spaces, then you can remove the tags in the string and then pass the string to the method Html.fromHtml("html string"); . Also generally these strings come from server(dynamic) but not often, if it is the case better to pass the string as it is to the method than try to remove the tags from the string.I have implemented this using web view. In my case i have to load image from URL along with the text in text view and this works for me.It has been suggested through various answers to use the Html framework class as suggested here, but unfortunately this class has different behavior in different versions of Android and various unaddressed bugs, as demonstrated in issues 214637, 14778, 235128 and 75953.You may therefore want to use a compatibility library to standardize and backport the Html class across Android versions which includes more callbacks for elements and styling:https://github.com/Pixplicity/HtmlCompatWhile it is similar to the framework\'s Html class, some signature changes were required to allow more callbacks. Here\'s the sample from the GitHub page:
