Given the following HTML:I would like #copyright to stick to the bottom of #container.Can I achieve this without using absolute positioning? If the float property supported a value of \'bottom\' it seems that would do the trick, but unfortunately, it doesn\'t.Likely not.Assign position:relative to #container, and then position:absolute; bottom:0; to #copyright.Actually, the accepted answer by @User will only work if the window is tall and the content is short. But if the content is tall and the window is short, it will put the copyright info over the page content, and then scrolling down to see the content will leave you with a floating copyright notice. That makes this solution useless for most pages (like this page, actually).The most common way of doing this is the "CSS sticky footer" approach demonstrated here, or a slightly slimmer variation here. This approach works great -- IF you have a fixed height footer.If you need a variable height footer that will appear at the bottom of the window if the content is too short, and at the bottom of the content if the window is too short, what do you do?Swallow your pride and use a table.For example:Try it out. This will work for any window size, for any amount of content, for any size footer, on every browser... even IE6.If you\'re cringing at the thought of using a table for layout, take a second to ask yourself why. CSS was supposed to make our lives easier -- and it has, overall -- but the fact is that even after all these years, it\'s still a broken, counter-intuitive mess. It can\'t solve every problem. It\'s incomplete.Tables aren\'t cool, but at least for now, they are sometimes the best way to solve a design problem.Yes you can do this without absolute positioning and without using tables (which screw with markup and such).DEMO\nThis is tested to work on IE>7, chrome, FF & is a really easy thing to add to your existing layout.It effectively does what float:bottom would, even accounting for the issue pointed out in @Rick Reilly\'s answer!In supported browsers, you can use the following:Example HereThe solution above is probably more flexible, however, here is an alternative solution:Example HereAs a side note, you may want to add vendor prefixes for additional support.Its an old question, but this is a unique approach that can help in several cases.check out that Working FiddleBecause normal flow is \'top-to-bottom\' we can\'t simply ask the #copyright div to stick to the bottom of his parent without absolutely positioning of some sort, But if we wanted the #copyright div to stick to the top of his parent, it will be very simple - because this is the normal flow way.So we will use this in our advantage.\nwe will change the order of the divs in the HTML, now the #copyright div is at the top, and the content follow it right away.\nwe also make the content div stretch all the way (using pseudo elements and clearing techniques)now it\'s just a matter of inverting that order back in the view. that can be easily done with CSS transform.We rotate the container by 180deg, and now: up-is-down. (and we inverse back the content to look normal again)If we want to have a scroolbar within the content area, we need to apply a little bit more of CSS magic. as can be showed Here [in that example, the content is below a header - but its the same idea]HTML: (notice the little changes)CSS:Try this;Create another container div for the elements above #copyright. Just above copyright add a new div:\n   <div style="clear:both;"></div>\nIt will force the footer to be under everything else, just like in the case of using relative positioning (bottom:0px;).You can indeed align the box to the bottom without using position:absolute if you know the height of the #container using the text alignment feature of inline-block elements.Here you can see it in action.This is the code:While none of the answers provided here seemed to apply or work in my particular case, I came across this article which provides this neat solution\xc2\xa0:I find it very useful for applying responsive design for mobile display without having to reorder all the html code of a website, setting body itself as a table.Note that only the first table-footer-group or table-header-group will be rendered as such\xc2\xa0: if there are more than one, the others will be rendered as table-row-group.If you want it to "stick" to the bottom, regardless of the height of container, then absolute positioning is the way to go. Of course, if the copyright element is the last in the container it\'ll always be at the bottom anyway.Can you expand on your question? Explain exactly what you\'re trying to do (and why you don\'t want to use absolute positioning)?Link here.Also, if there\'s stipulations with using position:absolute; or position:relative;, you can always try padding parent div or putting a margin-top:x;. Not a very good method in most cases, but it may come in handy in some cases.Just set element child to position: relative and than move it top: 100% (that\'s the 100% height of the parent) and stick to bottom of parent by transform: translateY(-100%) (that\'s -100% of the height of the child).BenefitSBut still just workaround :(Don\'t forget prefixes for the older browser.If you do not know the height of child block:http://jsbin.com/ULUXIFon/3/editIf you know the height of the child block add the child block then add padding-top/margin-top :Maybe this helps someone: You can always place the div outside the other div and then push it upwards using negative margin:Just because this hasn\'t been mentioned at all, what usually works well in situations like yours: Placing the copyright-div after the container-divYou would only have to format the copyright-div in a similar way to the other container (same overall width, centering, etc.), and all is fine.CSS:HTML:The only time this might not be ideal is when your container-div is declared with height:100%, and the user would need to scroll down to see the copyright. But even still you could work around (e.g. margin-top:-20px - when the height of your copyright element is 20px).Aside: I know the OP asked for a solution that "... sticks to the bottom of the \'container\' div ...", and not something under it, but come on, people are looking for good solutions here, and this is one!Here is an approach targeted at making an element with a known height and width (at least approximately) float to the right and stay at the bottom, while behaving as an inline element to the other elements. It is focused at the bottom-right because you can place it easily in any other corner through other methods.I needed to make a navigation bar which would have the actual links at the bottom right, and random sibling elements, while ensuring that the bar itself stretched properly, without disrupting the layout. I used a "shadow" element to occupy the navigation bar\'s links\' space and added it at the end of the container\'s child nodes.There is nothing called float:bottom in CSS. The best way is using positioning in such cases:For those only have one child in the container, you can use the table-cell and vertical-align approach which worked reliably for positioning a single div at the bottom of its parent.Note that using table-footer-group as other answers mentioned will break the height calculation of parent table.Div of style, position:absolute;bottom:5px;width:100%; is working, \nBut it required more scrollup situation.
