Is there any way to revert or undo git pull so that my source/repos will come to old state that was before doing git pull ?\nI want to do this because it merged some files which I didn\'t want to do so, but only merge other remaining files. So, I want to get those files back, is that possible ?\nThanks :)EDIT I want to undo git merge for clarification.\nAfter seeing some answers, I did this Now, what should I do ? Doing git reset --hard  is OK ? I don\'t want to screw it again, so asking for detailed steps ? git pull will do two things: it does a git fetch and then a git merge where it merges branches that have been setup to be merged in your config.So what you want to do is to undo the merge (undoing the fetch doesn\'t make a lot of sense and shouldn\'t be necessary).  To do that you can try using git reset --hard to reset to a previous state.  Use the git-reflog command to find the SHA-1 of the previous state and then reset to it.Same as jkp\'s answer, but here\'s the full command:where a0d3fe6 is found by doingand looking at the point at which you want to undo to. A more modern way to undo a merge is:And the slightly older way:The old-school way described in previous answers (warning: will discard all your local changes):But actually, it is worth noticing that git merge --abort is only equivalent to git reset --merge given that MERGE_HEAD is present. This can be read in the git help for merge command.After a failed merge, when there is no MERGE_HEAD, the failed merge can be undone with git reset --merge but not necessarily with git merge --abort, so they are not only old and new syntax for the same thing. This is why i find git reset --merge to be much more useful in everyday work.If you have gitk (try running "gitk --all from your git command line"), it\'s simple. Just run it, select the commit you want to rollback to (right-click), and select "Reset master branch to here". If you have no uncommited changes, chose the "hard" option.it works\nfirst use: git reflogfind your SHA of your previus state and make (HEAD@{1} is an example)Suppose $COMMIT was the last commit id before you performed git pull.\nWhat you need to undo the last pull is.In speaking of pull, I would like to share an interesting trick,This above command is the most useful command in my git life which saved a lots of time.Before pushing your newly commit to server, try this command and it will automatically sync latest server changes (with a fetch + merge) and will place your commit at the top in git log. No need to worry about manual pull/merge.Find details at: http://gitolite.com/git-pull--rebaseyou can do git reset --hard ORIG_HEADsince "pull" or "merge" set ORIG_HEAD to be the current state before doing those actions.
