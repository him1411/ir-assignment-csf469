Here is the problemI have a requirements.txt that looks like:I have a local archive directory containing all the packages + others.I have created a new virtualenv withupon activating it, I tried to install the packages according to requirements.txt from the local archive directory.I got some output that seems to indicate that the installation is fineBut later check revealed none of the package is installed properly. I cannot import the package, and none is found in the site-packages directory of my virtualenv. So what went wrong?This works for me:--no-index - Ignore package index (only looking at --find-links URLs instead). -f, --find-links <URL> - If a URL or path to an html file, then parse for links to archives. \nIf a local path or file:// URL that\'s a directory, then look for archives in the directory listing.I\'ve read the above, realize this is an old question, but it\'s totally unresolved and still at the top of my google search results so here\'s an answer that works for everyone:For virtualenv to install all files in the requirements.txt file.I had a similar problem. I tried this:(-U = update if it had already installed)But the problem continued. I realized that some of generic libraries for development were missed.I don\'t know if this would help you.pip install -r requirements.txtFor further details please check the help option.pip install --helpWe can find the option \'-r\'-r, --requirement     Install from the given requirements file. This option can be\n                                used multiple times.Further information on some commonly used pip install options: (This is the help option on pip install command)Also the above is the complete set of options. Please use pip install --help for complete list of options.Often, you will want a fast install from local archives, without probing PyPI.First, download the archives that fulfill your requirements:Then, install using \xe2\x80\x93find-links and \xe2\x80\x93no-index:I work with a lot of systems that have been mucked by developers "following directions they found on the internet". It is extremely common that your pip and your python are not looking at the same paths/site-packages. For this reason, when I encounter oddness I start by doing this:That is a happy system.Below is an unhappy system. (Or at least it\'s a blissfully ignorant system that causes others to be unhappy.)It is unhappy because pip is (python3.6 and) using /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages while python is (python2.7 and) using /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packagesWhen I want to make sure I\'m installing requirements to the right python, I do this:You\'ve heard, "If it ain\'t broke, don\'t try to fix it." The DevOps version of that is, "If you didn\'t break it and you can work around it, don\'t try to fix it."
