I am having this error when seeding my database with code first approach.Validation failed for one or more entities. See \'EntityValidationErrors\' property for more details.To be honest I don\'t know how to check the content of the validation errors, Visual Studio shows me that its an array with 8 objects. so 8 validation Errors.This was working with my previous model, but I made a few changes that I explain below:Excuse me for the long code, but I have to paste it all.  The exception is thrown in the last line of the following code.\n\nTo be honest I dont know how to check the content of the validation\n  errors, Visual Studio shows me that its an array with 8 objects. so 8\n  validation Errors.Actually you should see the errors if you drill into that array in Visual studio during debug. But you can also catch the exception and then write out the errors to some logging store or the console:EntityValidationErrors is a collection which represents the entities which couldn\'t be validated successfully, and the inner collection ValidationErrors per entity is a list of errors on property level.These validation messages are usually helpful enough to find the source of the problem. EditA few slight improvements:The value of the offending property can be included in the inner loop like so:While debugging Debug.Write might be preferable over Console.WriteLine as it works in all kind of applications, not only console applications (thanks to @Bart for his note in the comments below).For web applications that are in production and that use Elmah for exception logging it turned out to be very useful for me to create a custom exception and overwrite SaveChanges in order to throw this new exception.The custom exception type looks like this:And SaveChanges can be overwritten the following way:A few remarks:The yellow error screen that Elmah shows in the web interface or in the sent emails (if you have configured that) now displays the validation details directly at the top of the message.Overwriting the Message property in the custom exception instead of overwriting ToString() has the benefit that the standard ASP.NET "Yellow screen of death (YSOD)" displays this message as well. In contrast to Elmah the YSOD apparently doesn\'t use ToString(), but both display the Message property.Wrapping the original DbEntityValidationException as inner exception ensures that the original stack trace will still be available and is displayed in Elmah and the YSOD.By setting a breakpoint on the line throw newException; you can simply inspect the newException.Message property as a text instead of drilling into the validation collections which is a bit awkward and doesn\'t seem to work easily for everyone (see comments below).You can do it from Visual Studio during debugging without writing any code, not even a catch block.Just add a watch with the name:((System.Data.Entity.Validation.DbEntityValidationException)$exception).EntityValidationErrorsThe watch expression $exception displays any exception thrown in the current context, even if it has not been caught and assigned to a variable.Based on http://mattrandle.me/viewing-entityvalidationerrors-in-visual-studio/This could actually do it without having to write code: In your catch block, add a break point at the following line of code:Now if you hover on exception or add it to the Watch and then navigate into the exception details as shown below; you will see which particular column(s) is/ are causing the problem as this error usually occurs when a table-constraint is violated..Large imageFor a quick way to see the first error without even adding a watch you can paste this in the Immediate Window:Here\'s how you can check the contents of the EntityValidationErrors in Visual Studio (without writing any extra code) i.e. during Debugging in the IDE.You are right, the Visual Studio debugger\'s View Details Popup doesn\'t show the actual errors inside the EntityValidationErrors collection . Just add the following expression in a Quick Watch window and click Reevaluate.((System.Data.Entity.Validation.DbEntityValidationException)$exception).EntityValidationErrorsIn my case, see how I am able to expand into the ValidationErrors List inside the EntityValidationErrors collection References: mattrandle.me blog post, @yoel\'s answerFor anyone who works in VB.NETWhile you are in debug mode within the catch {...} block open up the "QuickWatch" window (ctrl+alt+q) and paste in there:((System.Data.Entity.Validation.DbEntityValidationException)ex).EntityValidationErrorsor:((System.Data.Entity.Validation.DbEntityValidationException)$exception).EntityValidationErrorsIf you are not in a try/catch or don\'t have access to the exception object.This will allow you to drill down into the ValidationErrors tree. It\'s the easiest way I\'ve found to get instant insight into these errors.If you are simply catching a generic exception, it may benefit you to cast this as a DbEntityValidationException.  This type of an exception has a Validation Errors property, and continuing to expand your way into them, you will find all the problems.For example, if you put a break point in the catch, you can throw the following into a watch:An example of an error is if a field does not allow nulls, and you have a null string, you\'ll see it say that the field is required.In debug, you can enter this in your QuickWatch expression evaluator entry field:Note that Entity.GetType().BaseType.Name gives the type name you specified, not the one with all the hex digits in its name.Using the answer of @Slauma i have made a code snippet (a surrounds with snippet) for better use.I had to write this in the Immediate window :3in order to get deep into the exact error !Per @Slauma\'s answer and @Milton\'s suggestion I\'ve extended our base class\'s custom save method with a try/catch that will handle (and hence log in our error logging!) these sorts of exceptions.Catch the exception in a try catch and then quick watch or ctrl+d & ctrl+q and you can drill down to the EntityValidationErrors.just Check Your Database Table Field Length . \nYour Input Text Is Greater than the length of column field data type lengthThe answer from @Slauma is really great but I found that it didnt\'t work when a ComplexType property was invalid. For example, say you have a property Phone of the complex type PhoneNumber. If the AreaCode property is invalid, the property name in ve.PropertyNames is "Phone.AreaCode". This causes the call to eve.Entry.CurrentValues<object>(ve.PropertyName) to fail. To fix this, you can split the property name at each ., then recurse through the resulting array of property names. Finally, when you arrive at the bottom of the chain, you can simply return the value of the property.Below is @Slauma\'s FormattedDbEntityValidationException class with support for ComplexTypes.Enjoy!Just throwing my two cents in...Within my dbConfiguration.cs, I like to wrap my context.SaveChanges() method into a try/catch and produce an output text file that allows me to read the Error(s) clearly, and this code also timestamps them - handy if you run into more than one error at different times!This works for me.Put a breakpoint on if statement.\nThen you can check modelState in debug windows. On every value you can see if there is an error and even the error message. That\'s it.\nWhen you don\'t need it anymore, just delete or comment the line.I hope this will help.If asked, I can provide detailed screenshot in the debug window.As mentioned in other posts, simply catch the exception in DbEntityValidationException class.\nWhich will give you watever you required during error cases.What i found...when i got \'EntityValidationErrors\' error is that....i have a field in my database \'db1\' in table \'tbladdress\' as \'address1\' which has size of 100 (i.e address varchar(100) null) and i was passing value more than 100 characters..and this leading to error while saving data to database....So you must Check the data you are passing to the field.I faced this error before when I tried to update specific field in my model in entity framwork and according the above answers I found the Validation message The SignerName field is required.which pointing to field in my model and when I checked my database schema I found so off coure ValidationException has its right to raise and according to this field I want it to be nullable, (I dont know how I messed it)so I changed that field to allow Null, and by this my code will not give me this error again so This error maybe will happened if you invalidate Your Data integrity of your database
