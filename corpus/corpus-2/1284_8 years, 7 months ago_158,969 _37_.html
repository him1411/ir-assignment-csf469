Are all URLs encrypted when using TLS/SSL (HTTPS) encryption? I would like to know because I want all URL data to be hidden when using TLS/SSL (HTTPS).If TLS/SSL gives you total URL encryption then I don\'t have to worry about hiding confidential information from URLs.Yes, the SSL connection is between the TCP layer and the HTTP layer.  The client and server first establish a secure encrypted TCP connection (via the SSL/TLS protocol) and then the client will send the HTTP request (GET, POST, DELETE...) over that encrypted TCP connection.As the other answers have already pointed out, https "URLs" are indeed encrypted. However, your DNS request/response when resolving the domain name is probably not, and of course, if you were using a browser, your URLs might be recorded too.Entire request and response is encrypted, including URL.Note that when you use a HTTP Proxy, it knows the address (domain) of the target server, but doesn\'t know the requested path on this server (i.e. request and response are always encrypted).Since nobody provided a wire capture, here\'s one.\nServer Name (the domain part of the URL) is presented in the ClientHello packet, in plain text.The following shows a browser request to:\nhttps://i.stack.imgur.com/path/?some=parameters&go=here\nSee this answer for more on TLS version fields (there are 3 of them - not versions, fields that each contain a version number!)From https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3546.txt:3.1. Server Name Indication[TLS] does not provide a mechanism for a client to tell a server\n  the    name of the server it is contacting.  It may be desirable for\n  clients    to provide this information to facilitate secure\n  connections to    servers that host multiple \'virtual\' servers at a\n  single underlying    network address.In order to provide the server name, clients MAY include an\n  extension    of type "server_name" in the (extended) client hello. FQDN (the domain part of the URL) MAY be transmitted in clear inside the ClientHello packet if SNI extension is usedThe rest of the URL (/path/?some=parameters&go=here) has no business being inside ClientHello since the request URL is a HTTP thing (OSI Layer 7), therefore it will never show up in a TLS handshake (Layer 4 or 5). That will come later on in a GET /path/?some=parameters&go=here HTTP/1.1 HTTP request, AFTER the secure TLS channel is established.Domain name MAY be transmitted in clear (if SNI extension is used in the TLS handshake) but URL (path and parameters) is always encrypted.I agree with the previous answers: To be explicit: With TLS, the first part of the URL (https://www.example.com/) is still visible as it builds the connection. The second part (/herearemygetparameters/1/2/3/4) is protected by TLS. However there are a number of reasons why you should not put parameters in the GET request. First, as already mentioned by others: \n- leakage through browser address bar\n- leakage through historyIn addition to that you have leakage of URL through the http referer: user sees site A on TLS, then clicks a link to site B. If both sites are on TLS, the request to site B will contain the full URL from site A in the referer parameter of the request. And admin from site B can retrieve it from the log files of server B.)An addition to the helpful answer from Marc Novakowski - the URL is stored in the logs on the server (e.g., in /etc/httpd/logs/ssl_access_log), so if you don\'t want the server to maintain the information over the longer term, don\'t put it in the URL.I\'m going to take a leap here and assume you mean the "GET" portion of the https request.In that case, yes and no.  The server address portion of the URL is obviously not encrypted since it is used to set up the connection.  Everything else is encrypted in an HTTPS connection.  But if you are using GET instead of POST then the user will still be able to cut and paste the URL out of the location bar, and you will probably not want to put confidential information in there that can be seen by anyone looking at the screen.All that said, you should be careful of your terminology.  To quote a famous swashbuckler: You keep using that word (URL) I do not think it means what you think it means....A third-party that is monitoring traffic may also be able to determine the page visited by examining your traffic an comparing it with the traffic another user has when visiting the site. For example if there were 2 pages only on a site, one much larger than the other, then comparison of the size of the data transfer would tell which page you visited. There are ways this could be hidden from the third-party but they\'re not normal server or browser behaviour. See for example this paper from SciRate, https://scirate.com/arxiv/1403.0297.In general other answers are correct, practically though this paper shows that pages visited (ie URL) can be determined quite effectively.Linking to my answer on a duplicate question. Not only is the URL available in the browsers history, the server side logs but it\'s also sent as the HTTP Referer header which if you use third party content, exposes the URL to sources outside your control.You can not always count on privacy of the full URL either. For instance, as is sometimes the case on enterprise networks, supplied devices like your company PC are configured with an extra "trusted" root certificate so that your browser can quietly trust a proxy (man-in-the-middle)  inspection of https traffic. This means that the full URL is exposed for inspection. This is usually saved to a log. \nFurthermore, your passwords are also exposed and probably logged and this is another reason to use one time passwords or to change your passwords frequently. \nFinally, the request and response content is also exposed if not otherwise encrypted. \nOne example of the inspection setup is described by Checkpoint here. An old style "internet caf\xc3\xa9" using supplied PC\'s may also be set up this way. No until you establish connection with the server, by the way GET is used only for \'name\' what do you would get (not for sending data), you must use POST for sending data.
