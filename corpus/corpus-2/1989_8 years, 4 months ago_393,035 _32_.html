Say that I have LINQ query such as:Given that authorsList is of type List<Author>, how can I delete the Author elements from authorsList that are returned by the query into authors?Or, put another way, how can I delete all of the firstname\'s equalling Bob from authorsList?Note: This is a simplified example for the purposes of the question.Well, it would be easier to exclude them in the first place:However, that would just change the value of authorsList instead of removing the authors from the previous collection. Alternatively, you can use RemoveAll:If you really need to do it based on another collection, I\'d use a HashSet, RemoveAll and Contains:It\'d be better to use List<T>.RemoveAll to accomplish this.If you really need to remove items then what about Except()?\nYou can remove based on a new list, or remove on-the-fly by nesting the Linq.You cannot do this with standard LINQ operators because LINQ provides query, not update support.But you can generate a new list and replace the old one.Or you could remove all items in authors in a second pass.Simple solution:I was wandering, if there are any difference between RemoveAll and Except and pros of using HashSet, so I have done quick performance check :)Results below:As we can see, best option in that case is to use RemoveAll( HashSet )This is a very old question, but I found a really simple way to do this: Note that since the return variable authorsList is a List<T>, the IEnumerable<T> returned by Except() must be converted to a List<T>.You can remove in two waysorI had same issue, if you want simple output based on your where condition , then first solution is better.Say that authorsToRemove is an IEnumerable<T> that contains the elements you want to remove from authorsList.Then here is another very simple way to accomplish the removal task asked by the OP:I think you could do something like thisAlthough I think the solutions already given solve the problem in a more readable way.LINQ has its origins in functional programming, which emphasises immutability of objects, so it doesn\'t provide a built-in way to update the original list in-place.Note on immutability (taken from another SO answer):Here is the definition of immutability from Wikipedia (link)"In object-oriented and functional programming, an immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created."i think you just have to assign the items from Author list to a new list to take that effect.Is very simple:Below is the example to remove the element from the list.
