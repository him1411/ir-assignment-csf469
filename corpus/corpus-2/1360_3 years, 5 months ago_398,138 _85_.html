I am trying to build a backup and restore solution for the Docker containers that we work with.I have Docker base image that I have created, ubuntu:base, and do not want have to rebuild it each time with a Docker file to add files to it.I want to create a script that runs from the host machine and creates a new container using the ubuntu:base Docker image and then copies files into that container.How can I copy files from the host to the container?The cp command can be used for that. For example:Reference: Docker CLI docs for cp Note that docker cp is not new in Docker 1.8. In older versions of Docker, the docker cp command only allowed copying files from a container to the hostGet container name or short container id:Get full container id:Copy file:orThe cleanest way is to mount a host directory on the container before running your command:The following is a fairly ugly way of doing it but it works.If you need to do this on a running container you can use docker exec (added in 1.3).First, find the container\'s name or ID:In the example above we can either use b9b7400ddd8f or elated_hodgkin.If you wanted to copy everything in /tmp/somefiles on the host to /var/www in the container:We can then exec /bin/bash in the container and verify it worked:The solution is given below,The file shall be directly copied to the location where the container sits on the filesystem.Another solution for copying files into a running container is using tar:Copies the file foo.sh into /tmp of the container.Edit: Remove reduntant -f, thanks to Maartens comment.To copy a file from host to running containerBased on Erik\'s answer and Mikl\'s and z0r\'s comments.Create a new dockerfile and use the existing image as your base.Then build the container:With Docker 1.8, docker cp is able to copy files from host to container.  See the Docker blog post Announcing Docker 1.8: Content Trust, Toolbox, and Updates to Registry and Orchestration.This is a direct answer to the question \'Copying files from host to Docker container\' raised in this question in the title.Try docker cp. It is the easiest way to do that and works even on my Mac. Usage:This will copy the file some-file.txt in the directory /root on your host machine into the Docker container named some-docker-container into the directory /root. It is very close to the secure copy syntax. And as shown in the previous post, you can use it vice versa. I.e., you also copy files from the container to the host.And before you downlink this post, please enter docker cp --help. Reading the documentation can be very helpful, sometimes... If you don\'t like that way and you want data volumes in your already created and running container, then recreation is your only option today. See also How can I add a volume to an existing Docker container?.In a docker environment, all containers are found in the directory:/var/lib/docker/aufs/required-docker-id/To copy the source directory/file to any part of the container, type the given command:sudo cp -r mydir/ /var/lib/docker/aufs/mnt/required-docker-id/mnt/Assuming the container is already running, type the given command:To share files using shared directory, run the container by typing the given command:Note: Problems with permissions might arise as container\'s users are not the same as the host\'s users.You can just trace the IP address of your local machine usingThen just enter into your Docker container and type In any case if you don\'t have an SSH client and server installed, just install it using:tar and docker cp are a good combo for copying everything in a directory.Create a data volume containerTo preserve the directory hierarchyCheck your workTo copy files/folders between a container and the local filesystem, type the command:For example,To get the contianer id, type the given command:The above content is taken from docker.com.The best way for copying files to the container I found is mounting a directory on host using -v option of docker run command.There are good answers, but too specific. I find out docker ps is good way to get container id you\'re interested in. Then doto see where the volume is mounted. That\'sfor me, but it might be a different path depending on the OS and configuration. Now simply copy files to that path.Using -v is not always practical.Many that find this question may actually have the problem of copying files into a Docker image while it is being created (I did).In that case, you can use the COPY command in the Dockerfile that you use to create the image.See the documentation.If the host is CentOS or Fedora, there is a proxy NOT in /var/lib/docker/aufs, but it is under /proc:This cmd will copy all contents of data directory to / of container with id "containerid".If using Windows as host, you can use WinSCP to connect to Docker and transfer files through the GUI.If on Linux, the scp command would also work through the terminal.Where you don\'t have a directory defined as a volume in the Dockerfile, the /var/lib/docker/aufs/mnt// will work. But there are cases where the directory within the container is defined as a volume. In this case, the contents under aufs/mnt/*/ and the contents seen by the container are different.You will need to inspect the container using docker inspect  and then, look for volumes. There you will find a mention for something like /var/lib/docker/vfs/dir/fe940b... (the id). You will need to add/modify the files here instead of under aufs/mnt/*.The confusing part is that the files also appear under /aufs/mnt/*. I spent quite a while scratching my head why changes here didn\'t work for me. Hope this helps someone.My favorite method:or I\'d mount and then run the image with a daemon, just any as given here;thenAnother workaround is using the good old scp. This is useful in the case you need to copy a directory.From your host run:In the case you need to copy a directory:be sure to install ssh into your container too.I simply copy the file directly from where the container is located from the host machine.For example:First find out the container id:And then from the host, let\'s say the file is in the home directory:Back to the container...One thing which I tried and it workedOnce you spin up your docker container and if you create any file under that container; You can easily access that file from below location of your docker host:-Try once!Try docker cp.Usage:It copies files/folders from PATH to the HOSTPATH.
