This question already has an answer here:How can I clear my working directory in git?To reset a specific file to the last-committed state (to discard uncommitted changes in a specific file):This is mentioned in the git status output:To reset the entire repository to the last committed state:To remove untracked files, I usually just delete all files in the working copy (but not the .git/ folder!), then do git reset --hard which leaves it with only committed files.A better way is to use git clean: (Warning: using the -x flag as below will cause git to delete ignored files.)will remove untracked files, including directories (-d) and files ignored by git (-x). Replace the -f argument with -n to perform a dry-run or -i for interactive mode and it will tell you what will be removed.Relevant links:Edit:\nIt\'s not well advertised but git clean is really handy.  Git Ready has a nice intro to git clean.Update: removed the x flag based on the suggestion in the comment belowAll the answers so far retain local commits.  If you\'re really serious, you can discard all local commits and all local edits by doing:For example:This makes your local repository exactly match the state of the origin (other than untracked files).If you accidentally did this after just reading the command, and not what it does :), use git reflog to find your old commits.You could create a commit which contains an empty working copy.This is a generally safe, non-destructive approach because it does not involve the use of any brute-force reset mechanisms.  First you hide all managed content with git checkout empty, then you are free to manually review and remove whatever unmanaged content remains.Your working copy should now be clear of any managed content.  All that remains are unmanaged files and the .git folder itself.To re-populate your working copy...To switch to another branch, discarding all uncommitted changes (e.g. resulting from Git\'s strange handling of line endings):I had a working copy with hundreds of changed files (but empty git diff --ignore-space-at-eol) which I couldn\'t get rid off with any of the commands I read here, and git checkout <branchname> won\'t work, either - unless given the -f (or --force) option.To reset a specific file as git status suggests:To reset a folder
