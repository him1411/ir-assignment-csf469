All my college years I have been using public, and would like to know the difference between public, private, and protected?Also what does static do as opposed to having nothing?publicThe type or member can be accessed by any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it.privateThe type or member can only be accessed by code in the same class or struct.protectedThe type or member can only be accessed by code in the same class or struct, or in a derived class.internalThe type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, but not from another assembly.protected internalThe type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, or by any derived class in another assembly. When no access modifier is set, a default access modifier is used. So there is always some form of access modifier even if it\'s not set.StaticThe static modifier on a class means that the class cannot be instantiated, and that all of its members are static. A static member has one version regardless of how many instances of its enclosing type are created.A static class is basically the same as a non-static class, but there is one difference: a static class cannot be externally instantiated. In other words, you cannot use the new keyword to create a variable of the class type. Because there is no instance variable, you access the members of a static class by using the class name itself.However, there is a such thing as a static constructor. Any class can have one of these, including static classes. They cannot be called directly & cannot have parameters (other than any type parameters on the class itself). A static constructor is called automatically to initialize the class before the first instance is created or any static members are referenced. Looks like this:Static classes are often used as services, you can use them like so:Public - If you can see the class, then you can see the methodPrivate - If you are part of the class, then you can see the method, otherwise not.Protected - Same as Private, plus all descendants can also see the method.Static (class) - Remember the distinction between "Class" and "Object" ?  Forget all that.  They are the same with "static"... the class is the one-and-only instance of itself.Static (method) - Whenever you use this method, it will have a frame of reference independent of the actual instance of the class it is part of.A graphical overview (summary in a nutshell)For the defaults if you put no access modifier in front, see here:\nDefault visibility for C# classes and members (fields, methods, etc)?Non-nestedNested:Regarding the question of NothingHmm.See here:  Access Modifiers.In a nutshell:Public gives the method or type complete visibility from other types/classes.Private allows only the type containing the private method/variable access to the private method/variable (note that nested classes  also have access to the containing classes private methods/variables).Protected is similar to private except derived classes can also access protected methods."Nothing" is VB.NET\'s equivalent to null. Although if you\'re referring to "nothing" meaning "no access modifier", then it depends, although a very rough rule of thumb (certainly in C#) is that if you don\'t explicitly specify an access modifier, the method/variable declaration is usually as restricted as it can be.\ni.e. is effectively the same as:The linked MSDN article will offer a fully description when there\'s no access modifier explicitly specified.public - can be access by anyone anywhere.\nprivate - can only be accessed from with in the class it is a part of.\nprotected - can only be accessed from with in the class or any object that inherits off of the class.Nothing is like null but in VB.\nStatic means you have one instance of that object, method for every instance of that class.mmm...Static means that you can access that function without having an instance of the class. You can access directly from the class definition.A status of Private indicates that variables can only be accessed by objects of the same class. Protected status extends that access to include descendants of the class as well."from the above table we can see the deference between private and protected... am think both are same ....so what the need for that two separate command"Check MSDN link for more informationThose access modifiers specify where your members are visible. You should probably read this up. Take the link given by IainMH as a starting point.Static members are one per class and not one per instance.Careful watch your accessibility of your classes. Public and protected classes and methods are by default accessible for everyone.Also Microsoft isn\'t very explict in showing access modifiers (public, protected, etc.. keywords) when new classes in Visual Studio are created. So, take good care and think about your accessibility of your class because it\'s the door to your implementation internals.I think it is related to good OOP design. If you are a developer of a library you want to hide the inner workings of your library. That way, you can modify your library inner workings later on. So you put your members and helper methods as private, and only interface methods are public. Methods that should be overwritten should be protected.
