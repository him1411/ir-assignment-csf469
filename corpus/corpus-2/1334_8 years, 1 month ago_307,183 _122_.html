I\'m making an application which uses an UITextView. Now I want the UITextView to have a placeholder similar to the one you can set for an UITextField.Does anyone know how to do this?I made a few minor modifications to bcd\'s solution to allow for initialization from a Xib file, text wrapping, and to maintain background color.  Hopefully it will save others the trouble.UIPlaceHolderTextView.h:UIPlaceHolderTextView.m:Easy way, just create placeholder text in UITextView by using the following UITextViewDelegate methods:just remember to set myUITextView with the exact text on creation e.g.and make the parent class a UITextViewDelegate before including these methods e.g.Code for Swift 3.1just remember to set myUITextView with the exact text on creation e.g.and make the parent class a UITextViewDelegate before including these methods e.g.I wasn\'t too happy with any of the solutions posted as they were a bit heavy. Adding views to the view isn\'t really ideal (especially in drawRect:). They both had leaks, which isn\'t acceptable either.Here is my solution: SAMTextViewSAMTextView.hSAMTextView.mIt\'s a lot simpler than the others, as it doesn\'t use subviews (or have leaks). Feel free to use it.Update 11/10/11: It is now documented and supports use in Interface Builder.Update 11/24/13: Point to new repo.What you can do is set up the text view with some initial value in the text property, and change the textColor to [UIColor grayColor] or something similar. Then, whenever the text view becomes editable, clear the text and present a cursor, and if the text field is ever empty again, put your placeholder text back. Change the color to [UIColor blackColor] as appropriate.It\'s not exactly the same as the placeholder functionality in a UITextField, but it\'s close.I found myself a verry easy way to imitate a place-holderEdit:Changed if statements to compare tags rather than text. If the user deleted their text it was possible to also accidentally delete a portion of the place holder @"Foobar placeholder".This meant if the user re-entered the textView the following delegate method, -(BOOL) textViewShouldBeginEditing:(UITextView *) textView, it would not work as expected. I tried comparing by colour of text in the if statement but found that light grey color set in interface builder is not the same as light grey colour set in code with [UIColor lightGreyColor]\nIt is also possible to reset the placeholder text when the keyboard returns and the [textView length] == 0EDIT:Just to make the last part clearer - here\'s is how you can set the placeholder text back:You can set the label on the UITextView by and hide it on TextViewdidChange method.This is the simple & easy way.If someone needs a Solution for Swift: Add UITextViewDelegate to your classI extended KmKndy\'s answer, so that the placeholder remains visible until the user starts editing the UITextView rather than just taps on it. This mirrors the functionality in the Twitter and Facebook apps. My solution doesn\'t require you to subclass and works if the user types directly or pastes text! just remember to set myUITextView with the exact text on creation e.g.and make the parent class a UITextView delegate before including these methods e.g.I recommend to use SZTextView.https://github.com/glaszig/SZTextViewAdd your default UITextView from storyboard and then change its custom class to SZTextView like below \xf0\x9f\x91\x87\xf0\x9f\x91\x87\xf0\x9f\x91\x87\xf0\x9f\x91\x87Then you will see two new option in the Attribute Inspector \xf0\x9f\x91\x87\xf0\x9f\x91\x87\xf0\x9f\x91\x87\xf0\x9f\x91\x87Simple Swift 3 solutionAdd UITextViewDelegate to your classSet yourTextView.delegate = selfCreate placeholderLabel and position it inside yourTextViewNow just animate placeholderLabel.alpha on textViewDidChange:you might have to play with placeholderLabel position to set it up right, but that shouldn\'t be too hardthis is how I did it:UITextView2.hUITextView2.mHere\'s a way easier solution that behaves exactly like UITextField\'s placeholder but doesn\'t require drawing custom views, or resigning first responder.(the second check in the else if statement is for the case where nothing is entered and the user presses backspace)Just set your class as a UITextViewDelegate.  In viewDidLoad you should initialize likeSorry to add another answer, But I just pulled something like this off and this created the closest-to-UITextField kind of placeholder.Hope this helps someone.Below is a Swift port of "SAMTextView" ObjC code posted as one of the first handful of replies to the question. I tested it on iOS 8.  I tweaked a couple of things, including the bounds offset for the placement of the placeholder text, as the original was too high and too far right (used suggestion in one of the comments to that post).  I know there are a lot of simple solutions, but I like the approach of subclassing UITextView because it\'s reusable and I don\'t have to clutter classes utilizing it with the mechanisms.Swift 2.2:Simple way to use this within some line of code:Take one label up to UITextView in .nib\nconnecting this label to your code ,\nAfter it.I\'ve modified Sam Soffes\' implementation to work with iOS7:Remember to set _placeholderAttribues = nil in methods that might change the font and other thigns that might affect them. You might also want to skip "lazy" making of the attributes dictionary if that doesn\'t bug you.EDIT:Remember to call setNeedsDisplay in a overridden version of setBounds if you like the placeholder to look good after autolayout animations and the like.You could also create a new class TextViewWithPlaceholder as a subclass of UITextView.(This code is kind of rough -- but I think it\'s on the right track.)In your delegate, add this:I made my own version of the subclass of \'UITextView\'. I liked Sam Soffes\'s idea of using the notifications, but I didn\'t liked the drawRect: overwrite. Seems overkill to me. I think I made a very clean implementation.You can look at my subclass here. A demo project is also included.Hi you can use IQTextView available in IQKeyboard Manager it\'s simple to use and integrate just set class of your textview to IQTextView and you can use its property for setting placeholder label with color you want.\nYou can download the library from IQKeyboardManager or you can install it from cocoapods.First take a label in .h file. Here I take Then in .m under viewDidLoad declare ittextview is my TextView.Now declare And your Textview placeholder is ready !put a label over the textview. Here\'s yet another way to do it, one that reproduces the slight indentation of UITextField\'s placeholder:Drag a UITextField right under the UITextView so that their top left corners are aligned. Add your placeholder text to the text field. In viewDidLoad, add:Then add:Lets make it easyCreate one UILabel and place it on your text view(Give the text as Placeholder-set color gray-you can do all this in your xib)\nNow in you header file declare the UILabel and also the the textviewDelegate\nNow you can simply hide the label when you click on the textviewcomplete code belowheaderimplementation @endDont forget to connect the textView and UILabel to filesowner from xib Take a look at UTPlaceholderTextView.This is a convenient subclass of UITextView that supports placeholder similiar to that of UITextField. Main peculiarities:This thread has had plenty of answers, but here\'s the version I prefer.It extends the existing UITextView class so is easily reuseable, and it doesn\'t intercept the events like textViewDidChange (which might break user\'s code, if they were already intercepting these events elsewhere).Using my code (shown below), you can easily add a placeholder to any of your UITextViews like this:When you set this new placeholder value, it quietly adds a UILabel on top of your UITextView, then hide/shows it as necessary:Okay, to make these changes, add a "UITextViewHelper.h" file containing this code:...and a UITextViewHelper.m file containing this:Yup, it\'s a lot of code, but once you\'ve added it to your project and included the .h file......you can easily use placeholders in UITextViews.There\'s one gotcha though.If you do this:...the placeholder will appear on top of the text.  When you set the text value, none of the regular notifications gets called, so I couldn\'t work out how to call my function to decide whether to show/hide the placeholder.The solution is to set the textValue rather than text:Alternatively, you can set the text value, then call checkIfNeedToDisplayPlaceholder.I like solutions like this, as they "fill the gap" between what Apple provides us with, and what we (as developers) actually need in our apps.  You write this code once, add it to your library of "helper" .m/.h files, and, over time, the SDK actually starts becoming less frustrating.(I wrote a similar helper for adding a "clear" button to my UITextViews, another thing which annoyingly exists in UITextField but not in UITextView...)It is not possible to create placeholder in UITextView but you can generate effect like place holder by this.OR you can add label in textview just likeand set How to insert placeholder in UITextView?The answer of PJR works like a charm. The ones here didn\'t work for me. Maybe an iOS5 thing.OK my ansewer is a bit different \nI create a small class to do it for you.TextViewShader.m fileTextViewShader.h filethis is the simple one line of code usage (dont forget to add #import "TextViewShader.h")have fun :)I created an instance variable to check whether I\'ll show the placeholder or not:On viewDidLoad I set: Here\'s what this does:I also created a button to resign the keyboard. You don\'t have to do this but the cool thing here is that the placeholder is shown again if nothing was enteredThis mimics UITextField\'s placeholder perfectly, where the place holder text stays until you actually type something.
