I\'m currently learning AngularJS and am having difficulty understanding the difference between ng-bind and ng-model.Can anyone tell me how they differ and when one should be used over the other?ng-bind has one-way data binding ($scope --> view). It has a shortcut {{ val }}\nwhich displays the scope value $scope.val inserted into html where val is a variable name.ng-model is intended to be put inside of form elements and has two-way data binding ($scope --> view and view --> $scope) e.g. <input ng-model="val"/>.tosh\'s answer gets to the heart of the question nicely. Here\'s some additional information....ng-bind and ng-model both have the concept of transforming data before outputting it for the user. To that end, ng-bind uses filters, while ng-model uses formatters.With ng-bind, you can use a filter to transform your data. For example,<div ng-bind="mystring | uppercase"></div>, or more simply: <div>{{mystring | uppercase}}</div>Note that uppercase is a built-in angular filter, although you can also build your own filter.To create an ng-model formatter, you create a directive that does require: \'ngModel\', which allows that directive to gain access to ngModel\'s controller. For example:Then in your partial:This is essentially the ng-model equivalent of what the uppercase filter is doing in the ng-bind example above. Now, what if you plan to allow the user to change the value of mystring? ng-bind only has one way binding, from model-->view. However, ng-model can bind from view-->model which means that you may allow the user to change the model\'s data, and using a parser you can format the user\'s data in a streamlined manner. Here\'s what that looks like:Play with a live plunker of the ng-model formatter/parser examplesng-model also has built-in validation. Simply modify your $parsers or $formatters function to call ngModel\'s controller.$setValidity(validationErrorKey, isValid) function.Angular 1.3 has a new $validators array which you can use for validation instead of $parsers or $formatters.Angular 1.3 also has getter/setter support for ngModelngModel\nThe ngModel directive binds an input,select, textarea (or custom form control) to a property on the scope.This directive executes at priority level 1.Example PlunkerJAVASCRIPTCSSHTMLngModel is responsible for:ngBind\nThe ngBind attribute tells Angular to replace the text content of the specified HTML element with the value of a given expression, and to update the text content when the value of that expression changes.This directive executes at priority level 0.Example PlunkerJAVASCRIPTHTMLngBind is responsible for:ng-model ng-model  directive in AngularJS is one of the greatest strength to bind the variables used in application with input components. This works as two way data binding. If you want to understand better about the two way bindings, you have an input component and the value updated into that field must be reflected in other part of the application. The better solution is to bind a variable to that field and output that variable whereever you wish to display the updated value throughoput the application. ng-bind ng-bind works much different than ng-model. ng-bind is one way data binding used for displaying the value inside html component as inner HTML. This directive can not be used for binding with the variable but only with the HTML elements content. Infact this can be used along with ng-model to bind the component to HTML elements. This directive is very useful for updating the blocks like div, span, etc. with inner HTML content. This example would help you to understand.If you are hesiting between using ng-bind or ng-model, try to answer these questions:Do you only need to display data?Yes: ng-bind (one-way binding)No: ng-model (two-way binding)Do you need to bind text content (and not value)?Yes: ng-bind No: ng-model (you should not use ng-bind where value is required)Is your tag a HTML <input>?Yes: ng-model (you cannot use ng-bind with input tag)No: ng-bindngModel usually use for input tags for bind a variable that we can change variable from controller and html page but ngBind use for display a variable in html page and we can change variable just from controller and html just show variable.We can use ng-bind with <p> to display, we can use shortcut for ng-bind {{model}}, we cannot use ng-bind with html input controls, but we can use shortcut for ng-bind {{model}} with html input controls.
