How do I use the HTML Agility Pack?My XHTML document is not completely valid. That\'s why I wanted to use it. How do I use it in my project? My project is in C#.Download and build the HTMLAgilityPack solution. In\nyour application, add a reference to\nHTMLAgilityPack.dll in the HTMLAgilityPack\\Debug (or Realease) \\bin folder.Then, as an example:(NB:  This code is an example only and not necessarily the best/only approach.  Do not use it blindly in your own application.)The HtmlDocument.Load() method also accepts a stream which is very useful in integrating with other stream oriented classes in the .NET framework.  While HtmlEntity.DeEntitize() is another useful method for processing html entities correctly.  (thanks Matthew)HtmlDocument and HtmlNode  are the classes you\'ll use most.  Similar to an XML parser, it provides the selectSingleNode and selectNodes methods that accept XPath expressions.Pay attention to the HtmlDocument.Option??????  boolean properties.  These control how the Load and LoadXML methods will process your HTML/XHTML.There is also a compiled help file called HtmlAgilityPack.chm that has a complete reference for each of the objects.  This is normally in the base folder of the solution.I don\'t know if this will be of any help to you, but I have written a couple of articles which introduce the basics.The next article is 95% complete, I just have to write up explanations of the last few parts of the code I have written. If you are interested then I will try to remember to post here when I publish it.HtmlAgilityPack uses XPath syntax, and though many argues that it is poorly documented, I had no trouble using it with help from this XPath documentation: www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_syntax.aspTo parseI did this:Main HTMLAgilityPack related code is as follows
