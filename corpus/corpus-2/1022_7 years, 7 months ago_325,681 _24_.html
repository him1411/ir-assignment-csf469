Does anyone know how to comment a block of lines in yaml?YAML supports inline comments, but does not support block comments.From Wikipedia:Comments begin with the number sign ( # ), can start anywhere on a line, and continue until the end of the lineA comparison with JSON, also from Wikipedia:The syntax differences are subtle and seldom arise in practice: JSON allows extended charactersets like UTF-32, YAML requires a space after separators like comma, equals, and colon while JSON does not, and some non-standard implementations of JSON extend the grammar to include Javascript\'s /* ... */ comments. Handling such edge cases may require light pre-processing of the JSON before parsing as in-line YAML.The spec only describes one way of marking comments:An explicit comment is marked by a \xe2\x80\x9c#\xe2\x80\x9d indicator.That\'s all. There are no block comments.Not trying to be smart about it, but if you use Sublime Text for your editor, the steps are:I\'d imagine that other editors have similar functionality too. Which one are you using? I\'d be happy to do some digging.In Vim you can do one of the following: or using visual block:Emacs has comment-dwim (Do What I Mean) - just select the block and do a:M-;It\'s a toggle - use it to comment AND uncomment blocks.If you don\'t have yaml-mode installed you will need to tell Emacs to use the hash character (#).For Ruby Mine users on Windows:Open file in editor\nSelect the block and press\nCtrl+forward slash, you will have selected block starting with #.Now if you want to un-comment the commented block, press same key combination Ctrl+forward slash again The only way to block comment in YAML is to use another application to add a # (comment) tag to multiple lines at once. An example of this is the "Block Comment" right click option for selected text in Notepad++.If you are using Eclipse with yedit plugin (an editor for .yaml files),\nyou can comment-out multiple lines byand to un-comment follow the same steps.
