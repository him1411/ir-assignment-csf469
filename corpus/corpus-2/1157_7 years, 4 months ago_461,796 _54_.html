What is the difference between HashMap, LinkedHashMap and TreeMap in Java? \nI don\'t see any difference in the output as all the three has keySet and values. What are Hashtables?All three classes implement the Map interface and offer mostly the same functionality. The most important difference is the order in which iteration through the entries will happen:"Hashtable" is the generic name for hash-based maps. In the context of the Java API,\nHashtable is an obsolete class from the days of Java 1.1 before the collections framework existed. It should not be used anymore, because its API is cluttered with obsolete methods that duplicate functionality, and its methods are synchronized (which can decrease performance and is generally useless). Use ConcurrrentHashMap instead of Hashtable. I prefer visual presentation: All three represent mapping from unique keys to values, and therefore implement the Map interface.HashMap is a map based on hashing of the keys. It supports O(1) get/put operations. Keys must have consistent implementations of hashCode() and equals() for this to work. LinkedHashMap is very similar to HashMap, but it adds awareness to the order at which items are added (or accessed), so the iteration order is the same as insertion order (or access order, depending on construction parameters).TreeMap is a tree based mapping. Its put/get operations take O(log n) time. It requires items to have some comparison mechanism, either with Comparable or Comparator. The iteration order is determined by this mechanism.See where each class is in the class hierarchy in the following diagram (bigger one). TreeMap implements SortedMap and NavigableMap while HashMap doesn\'t.HashTable is obsolete and the corresponding ConcurrentHashMap class should be used.\nJust some more input from my own experience with maps, on when I would use each one:HashMap makes absolutely not guarantees about the iteration order. It\n  can (and will) even change completely when new elements are added.\n  TreeMap will iterate according to the "natural ordering" of the keys\n  according to their compareTo() method (or an externally supplied\n  Comparator). Additionally, it implements the SortedMap interface,\n  which contains methods that depend on this sort order. LinkedHashMap\n  will iterate in the order in which the entries were put into the mapLook at how performance varying..\nTree map which is an implementation of Sorted map. The complexity of the put, get and containsKey operation is O(log n) due to the Natural orderingLet me put it simple:@Amit: SortedMap is an interface whereas TreeMap is a class which implements the SortedMap interface. That means if follows the protocol which SortedMap asks its implementers to do.\nA tree unless implemented as search tree, can\'t give you ordered data because tree can be any kind of tree. So to make TreeMap work like Sorted order, it implements SortedMap ( e.g, Binary Search Tree - BST, balanced BST like AVL and R-B Tree , even Ternary Search Tree - mostly used for iterative searches in ordered way ).In NUT-SHELL\nHashMap : gives data in O(1) , no orderingTreeMap : gives data in O(log N), base 2. with ordered keysLinkedHashMap : is Hash table with linked list (think of indexed-SkipList) capability to store data in the way it gets inserted in the tree. Best suited to implement LRU ( least recently used ).These are different implementations of the same interface. Each implementation has some advantages and some disadvantages (fast insert, slow search) or vice versa.For details look at the javadoc of TreeMap, HashMap, LinkedHashMap.All three classes HashMap, TreeMap and LinkedHashMap implements java.util.Map interface, and represents mapping from unique key to values. HashMapA HashMap contains values based on the key.It contains only    unique elements. It may have one null key and multiple null values.It maintains no order.public class HashMap<K,V> extends AbstractMap<K,V> implements Map<K,V>, Cloneable, SerializableLinkedHashMapIt is same as HashMap instead maintains insertion order. //See class deceleration belowpublic class LinkedHashMap<K,V> extends HashMap<K,V> implements Map<K,V>TreeMapIt is same as HashMap instead maintains ascending order(Sorted using the natural order of its key.).public class TreeMap<K,V> extends AbstractMap<K,V> implements NavigableMap<K,V>, Cloneable, Serializable HashtableIt is a legacy class.public class Hashtable<K,V> extends Dictionary<K,V> implements Map<K,V>, Cloneable, SerializableRef: http://javarevisited.blogspot.in/2015/08/difference-between-HashMap-vs-TreeMap-vs-LinkedHashMap-Java.htmlAll offer a key->value map and a way to iterate through the keys. The most important distinction between\nthese classes are the time guarantees and the ordering of the keys.Imagine you passed an empty TreeMap, HashMap, and LinkedHashMap into the following function:The output for each will look like the results below.For HashMap, the output was, in my own tests, { 0, 1, -1}, but it could be any ordering. There is no guarantee on the\nordering.\nTreemap,the output was,{ -1, 0, 1}\nLinkedList,the output was,{ 1, -1, 0}HashMap\ncan contain one null key.HashMap maintains no order. TreeMapTreeMap can not contain any null key.TreeMap maintains ascending order.LinkedHashMapLinkedHashMap can be used to maintain insertion order, on which keys are inserted into Map or it can also be used to maintain an access order, on which keys are accessed.Examples::1) HashMap map = new HashMap();2) TreeMap map = new TreeMap();3) LinkedHashMap map = new LinkedHashMap();
