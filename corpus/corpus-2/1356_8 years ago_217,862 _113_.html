The meaning of both eludes me.A declaration introduces an identifier and describes its type, be it a type, object, or function. A declaration is what the compiler needs to accept references to that identifier. These are declarations: A definition actually instantiates/implements this identifier. It\'s what the linker needs in order to link references to those entities. These are definitions corresponding to the above declarations: A definition can be used in the place of a declaration. An identifier can be declared as often as you want. Thus, the following is legal in C and C++: However, it must be defined exactly once. If you forget to define something that\'s been declared and referenced somewhere, then the linker doesn\'t know what to link references to and complains about a missing symbols. If you define something more than once, then the linker doesn\'t know which of the definitions to link references to and complains about duplicated symbols. Since the debate what is a class declaration vs. a class definition in C++ keeps coming up (in answers and comments to other questions) , I\'ll paste a quote from the C++ standard here.\nAt 3.1/2, C++03 says:A declaration is a definition unless it [...] is a class name declaration [...].3.1/3 then gives a few examples. Amongst them:To sum it up: The C++ standard considers struct x; to be a declaration and struct x {}; a definition. (In other words, "forward declaration" a misnomer, since there are no other forms of class declarations in C++.) Thanks to litb (Johannes Schaub) who dug out the actual chapter and verse in one of his answers. From the C++ standard section 3.1:A declaration introduces names into a translation unit or redeclares names introduced by previous\n  declarations. A declaration specifies the interpretation and attributes of these names.The next paragraph states (emphasis mine) that a declaration is a definition unless...... it declares a function without specifying the function\xe2\x80\x99s body... it declares a static member within a class definition... it declares a class name... it contains the extern keyword without an initializer or function body... or is a typedef or using statement.Now for the big reason why it\'s important to understand the difference between a declaration and definition: the One Definition Rule.  From section 3.2.1 of the C++ standard:No translation unit shall contain more than one definition of any variable, function, class type, enumeration type, or template.Declaration "Somewhere, there exists a foo".Definition: "...and here it is!"There are interesting edge cases in C++ (some of them in C too). ConsiderThat can be a definition or a declaration, depending on what type T is:In C++, when using templates, there is another edge case. The last declaration was not a definition. It\'s the declaration of an explicit specialization of the static member of X<bool>. It tells the compiler: "If it comes to instantiating X<bool>::member, then don\'t instantiate the definition of the member from the primary template, but use the definition found elsewhere". To make it a definition, you have to supply an initializerDeclarationDeclarations tell the compiler that a\n  program element or name exists. A\n  declaration introduces one or more\n  names into a program. Declarations can\n  occur more than once in a program.\n  Therefore, classes, structures,\n  enumerated types, and other\n  user-defined types can be declared for\n  each compilation unit.DefinitionDefinitions specify what code or data\n  the name describes. A name must be\n  declared before it can be used.From the C99 standard, 6.7(5):A declaration specifies the interpretation and attributes of a set of identifiers. A definition of an identifier is a declaration for that identifier that:From the C++ standard, 3.1(2):A declaration is a definition unless it declares a function without specifying the function\'s body, it contains the extern specifier or a linkage-specification and neither an initializer nor a function-body, it declares a static data member in a class declaration, it is a class name declaration, or it is a typedef declaration, a using-declaration, or a using-directive.Then there are some examples.So interestingly (or not, but I\'m slightly surprised by it), typedef int myint; is a definition in C99, but only a declaration in C++.From wiki.answers.com:The term declaration means (in C) that you are telling the compiler about type, size and in case of function declaration, type and size of its parameters of any variable, or user defined type or function in your program. No space is reserved in memory for any variable in case of declaration. However compiler knows how much space to reserve in case a variable of this type is created.for example, following are all declarations: Definition on the other hand means that in additions to all the things that declaration does, space is also reserved in memory. You can say "DEFINITION = DECLARATION + SPACE RESERVATION" following are examples of definition: see Answers.Since I don\'t see an answer pertinent to C++11 here\'s one.A declaration is a definition unless it declares a/n:Additional clauses inherited from C++03 by the above list:A template-declaration is a declaration. A template-declaration is also a definition if its declaration defines a function, a class, or a static data member.Examples from the standard which differentiates between declaration and definition that I found helpful in understanding the nuances between them:Declaration : Thus declaration associates the variable with a type.Following are some examples of declaration.Now function declaration :Note the semicolon at the end of function so it says it is only a declaration. Compiler knows that somewhere in the program that function will be defined with that prototype. Now if the compiler gets a function call something like this Compiler will throw an error saying that there is no such function. Because it doesn\'t has any prototype for that function.Note the difference between two programs.Program 1In this, print function is declared and defined as well. Since function call is coming after the definition. Now see the next program.Program 2It is essential because function call precedes definition so compiler must know whether there is any such function. So we declare the function which will inform the compiler.Definition  : This part of defining a function is called Definition. It says what to do inside the function. Now with the variables.Some times declaration and definition are grouped into a single statement like this.definition means actual function written & declaration means simple declare function \nfor e.g. and this is definition of function myfunction Rule of thumb:A declaration tells the compiler how to interpret the variable\'s data in memory. This is needed for every access.A definition reserves the memory to make the variable existing. This has to happen exactly once before first access.Find similar answers here: Technical Interview Questions in CA declaration provides a name to the program; a definition provides a unique description of an entity (e.g. type, instance, and function) within the program. Declarations can be repeated in a given scope, it introduces a name in a given scope. A declaration is a definition unlessA definition is a declaration unless:Couldnt you state in the most general terms possible, that a declaration is an identifier in which no storage is allocated and a definition actually allocates storage from a declared identifier? One interesting thought - a template cannot allocate storage until the class or function is linked with the type information.  So is the template identifier a declaration or definition?  It should be a declaration since no storage is allocated, and you are simply \'prototyping\' the template class or function.Declaration means give name and type to a variable (in case of variable declaration) \neg: or give name,return type and parameter(s) type to a function without body(in case of function declaration)eg:  whereas definition means assign value to a variable (in case of variable definition).\neg:or provide/add body(functionality) to a function is called function definition.eg: many time declaration and definition can be done together as:andIn above cases we define and declare variable i and function max()This is going to sound really cheesy, but it\'s the best way I\'ve been able to keep the terms straight in my head:Declaration: Picture Thomas Jefferson giving a speech... "I HEREBY DECLARE THAT THIS FOO EXISTS IN THIS SOURCE CODE!!!"Definition: picture a dictionary, you are looking up Foo and what it actually means.A declaration introduces a name into the program; a definition provides a unique description of an entity (e.g. type, instance, and function). Declarations can be repeated in a given scope, it introduces a name in a given scope. There must be exactly one definition of every object, function or class used in a C++ program.\nA declaration is a definition unless:A definition is a declaration unless:Difference between declaring and defining with functions:\nThe prototype statement for a function declares it, i.e. tells the compiler about the function - its name, return type, and number and type of its parameters.\nThe function header, followed by the body of the function, defines the function - giving the details of the steps to perform the function operation.Ex.Code:With Respect to Variables:\nFor automatic and register variables, there is no difference between definition and declaration.\nThe process of declaring an automatic or a register variable defines the variable name and allocates appropriate memory.However, for external variables:\nBecause memory for a variable must be allocated only once, to ensure that access to the variable always refers to the same cell.\nall variables must be defined once and only once.If an external variable is to be used in a file other than the one in which it is defined, a mechanism is needed to "connect" such a use with the uniquely defined external variable cell allocated for it. This process of connecting the references of the same external variable in different files, is called resolving the references.It may be defined and declared with a declaration statement outside any function, with no storage class specifier. Such a declaration allocates memory for the variable. A declaration statement may also be used to simply declare a variable name with the extern storage class specifier at the beginning of the declaration. Such a declaration specifies that the variable is defined elsewhere, i.e. memory for this variable is allocated in another file. Thus, access to an external variable in a file other than the one in which it is defined is possible if it is declared with the keyword extern; no new memory is allocated. Such a declaration tells the compiler that the variable is defined elsewhere, and the code is compiled with the external variable left unresolved. The reference to the external variable is resolved during the linking process.Ex.CodeThese declarations tell the compiler that the variables stack[] and stkptr are defined elsewhere, usually in some other file. If the keyword extern were omitted, the variables would be considered to be new ones and memory would be allocated for them. Remember, access to the same external variable defined in another file is possible only if the keyword extern is used in the declaration. The concept of Declaration and Definition will form a pitfall when you are using the extern storage class because your definition will be in some other location and you are declaring the variable in your local code file (page). One difference between C and C++ is that in C you the declarations are done normally at the beginning of a function or code page. In C++ it\'s not like that. You can declare at a place of your choice.My favorite example is "int Num = 5" here your variable is 1. defined as int 2. declared as Num and 3. instantiated with a value of five. WeA class or struct allows you to change how objects will be defined when it is later used. For exampleWhen we learn programming these two terms are often confused because we often do both at the same time. Whenever we write function after the main function, compiler will through the error since it does not have any idea about the function at the time of calling function. If we provide prototype declaration of function then we compiler will not look for the definition.In the above example , first line is called as function declaration.Declaring VariableWhenever we write declaration statement then memory will not be allocated for the variable. Variable declaration will randomly specify the memory location.Variable Declaration Vs Definition Differentiation ParametersA. Space Reservation :Whenever we declare a variable then space will not be reserved for the variable.\nWhenever we declare a variable then compiler will not look for other details such as definition of the variable.Declaration is handy way to write code in which actual memory is not allocated.In the above declaration memory is not allocated. Whenever we define a variable then memory will be allocated for the variable.B. What it does ?A declaration presents a symbol name to the compiler. A definition is a declaration that allocates space for the symbol.
