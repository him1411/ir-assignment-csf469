When using the Xcode 8+ and creating a new blank project, the following logs appear when running the application:Maybe someone already found a configuration for this to handle?Try this:1- From Xcode menu open: Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme 2- On your Environment Variables set OS_ACTIVITY_MODE = disableBuilding on the original tweet from @rustyshelf, and illustrated answer from iDevzilla, here\'s a solution that silences the noise from the simulator without disabling NSLog output from the device.A tweet had the answer for me - https://twitter.com/rustyshelf/status/775505191160328194To stop the Xcode 8 iOS Simulator from logging like crazy, set an environment variable OS_ACTIVITY_MODE = disable in your debug scheme. It worked.OS_ACTIVITY_MODE didn\'t work for me (it may have been because I typo\'d disable as disabled, but isn\'t that more natural?!?), or at least didn\'t prevent a great deal of messages. So here\'s the real deal with the environment variables.https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/lldb/trunk/source/Plugins/Platform/MacOSX/PlatformDarwin.cppSo setting OS_ACTIVITY_DT_MODE to "NO" in the environment variables (GUI method explained in Schemes screenshot in main answer) makes it work for me.As far as NSLog being the dumping ground for system messages, errors, and your own debugging: a real logging approach is probably called for anyway, e.g. https://github.com/fpillet/NSLogger .ORDrink the new Kool-Aid: http://asciiwwdc.com/2016/sessions/721 https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/721/\nIt\'s not surprising that there are some hitches after overhauling the entire logging API.ADDENDUMAnyway, NSLog is just a shim:https://developer.apple.com/library/content/releasenotes/Miscellaneous/RN-Foundation-OSX10.12/NSLog / CFLogNSLog is now just a shim to os_log in most circumstances.Only makes sense now to quote the source for the other env variable. Quite a disparate place, this time from Apple internals. Not sure why they are overlapping. [Incorrect comment about NSLog removed] [Edited 22 Sep]: I wonder what "release" and "stream" do differently than "debug". Not enough source.https://github.com/macosforge/libdispatch/blob/8e63547ea4e5abbfe55c0c3064181c4950a791d3/src/voucher.cThis is still not fixed in Xcode Version 8.0 beta 2 (8S162m) for me and extra logs are also appearing in the Xcode console** EDIT 8/1/16: This has been acknowledged in the release notes for Xcode 8 Beta 4 (8S188o) as an issues still persisting. Debugging\xe2\x80\xa2 Xcode Debug Console shows extra logging from system frameworks when\n   debugging applications in the Simulator. (27331147, 26652255)Presumably this will be resolved by the GM release. Until then patience and although not ideal but a workaround I\'m using is below...Similar to the previous answer I am having to: prefix my print logs with some kind of special character (eg * or ^ or ! etc etc)Then use the search box on the bottom right of the console pane to filter my console logs by inputing my chosen special character to get the console to display my print logs as intendedPlease find the below steps.For more information please find the below GIF representation.My solution is to use the debugger command and/or Log Message in breakpoints.And change the output of console from All Output to Debugger Output likeThis is related to a known issue with logging found in the Xcode 8 Beta Release Notes (also asked an engineer at WWDC).When debugging WatchOS applications in the Watch simulator, the OS may produce an excessive\n  amount of unhelpful logging. (26652255) There is currently no workaround available, you must wait for a new version of Xcode.EDIT 7/5/16: This is supposedly fixed as of Xcode 8 Beta 2:Resolved in Xcode 8 beta 2 \xe2\x80\x93 IDE DebuggingXcode 8 Beta 2 Release NotesAlright. There seems to be a lot of commotion about this one, so I\'ll give y\'all a way to persist it without using that scheme trick. I\'ll address the iOS Simulator specifically, but this also might need to be applied for the TV Sim as well which is located in a different dir. The problem that is causing all of this stuff are plists located within the Xcode directory. There is a process that gets launched called configd_sim when the Sim starts that reads the plists in and prints debugging information if the plists specify they should be logged.The plists are located here: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator.sdk/System/Library/Preferences/Logging/Subsystems If you are playing around with a beta, take note that the dir will be different. You will see numerous plists in this directory. Now, build and run your application and observe the logs. You are looking for the content immediately followed by the subsystem: part. It is the name immediately following this that represents the corresponding problematic plist. From there, either modify the plist to knock out the debugging [Level] key/value which is a dictionary containing the "Enable" => "Default" key/value... or just simply delete the plist. Note, that you will need to be root to do either of these since they\'re located in the Xcode application. the plutil -p command might be of use to you as well. i.e. This gave me one of the problematic plists which contained: { "DEFAULT-OPTIONS" => { "Level" => { "Enable" => "Default" }}}Good luck :] This is no longer an issue in xcode 8.1 (tested Version 8.1 beta (8T46g)). You can remove the OS_ACTIVITY_MODE environment variable from your scheme.https://developer.apple.com/go/?id=xcode-8.1-beta-rn Debugging\xe2\x80\xa2 Xcode Debug Console no longer shows extra logging from system\n  frameworks when debugging applications in the Simulator. (26652255,\n  27331147)This solution has been working for me:This will dump out all of the debug data and also your NSLogs. To filter just your NSLog statements:This is what you should get:
