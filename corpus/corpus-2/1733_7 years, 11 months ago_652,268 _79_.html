I need to get my current location using GPS programmatically. \nHow can i achieve it?I have created a small application with step by step description to get current location\'s GPS coordinates.Complete example source code is in Get Current Location coordinates , City name - in Android.See how it works:All we need to do is add this permission in the manifest file:And create a LocationManager instance like this:Check if GPS is enabled or not.And then implement LocationListener and get coordinates:Here is the sample code to do soHere is additional information for other answers.Since Android hasyou can register to both and start fetch events from onLocationChanged(Location location) from two at the same time. So far so good. Now the question do we need two results or we should take the best. As I know GPS_PROVIDER results have better accuracy than NETWORK_PROVIDER.Let\'s define Location field:Before we start listen on Location change we will implement the following method. This method returns the last known location, between the GPS and the network one. For this method newer is best.Each time when we retrieve a new location we will compare it with our previous result.I add a new method to onLocationChanged:You can find the location either by GPS_PROVIDER or NETWORK_PROVIDER.Overview of location services in Android.Here is one example which try to find the location using GPS. If your GPS is not available then try to use network for find the location.GPSTracker.javaActivity -AndroidGPSTrackingActivity.javaLayout- main.xmlAndroidManifest.xmlSince I didn\'t like some of the code in the other answers, here\'s my simple solution.  This solution is meant to be usable in an Activity or Service to track the location.  It makes sure that it never returns data that\'s too stale unless you explicitly request stale data.  It can be run in either a callback mode to get updates as we receive them, or in poll mode to poll for the most recent info.  Generic LocationTracker interface.  Allows us to have multiple types of location trackers and plug the appropriate one in easily:ProviderLocationTracker-  this class will track the location for either GPS or NETWORK.The is the FallbackLocationTracker, which will track by both GPS and NETWORK, and use whatever location is more accurate.  Since both implement the LocationTracker interface, you can easily change your mind about which one to use.  To run the class in poll mode, just call start().  To run it in update mode, call start(Listener).Also take a look at my blog post on the codeThere are already many answers there but I want to show latest way to get location using Google API, so new programmers can use new method:I have written detailed tutorial on current location in android at my blog demonuts.com You can also find full source code developed with android studio.First of all, put this in gradle filethen implement necessary interfaces  declare instancesput this in onCreate()At last, override necessary methodsDon\'t forget to start GPS in your device before running app. Get location of gps by -You need to use latest/newest GoogleApiClient ApiBasically what you need to do is:Then for the most accurate and reliable location. See my post here:https://stackoverflow.com/a/33599228/2644905Do not use LocationListener which is not accurate and has delayed response. To be honest this is easier to implement.\nAlso read documentation: https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/common/api/GoogleApiClientI hope this will help you...Now that Google Play locations services are here, I recommend that developers start using the new fused location provider. You will find it easier to use and more accurate. Please watch the Google I/O video Beyond the Blue Dot: New Features in Android Location by the two guys who created the new Google Play location services API.I\'ve been working with location APIs on a number of mobile platforms, and I think what these two guys have done is really revolutionary. It\'s gotten rid of a huge amount of the complexities of using the various providers. Stack Overflow is littered with questions about which provider to use, whether to use last known location, how to set other properties on the LocationManager, etc. This new API that they have built removes most of those uncertainties and makes the location services a pleasure to use.I\'ve written an Android app that periodically gets the location using Google Play location services and sends the location to a web server where it is stored in a database and can be viewed on Google Maps. I\'ve written both the client software (for Android, iOS, Windows Phone and Java ME) and the server software (for ASP.NET and SQLÂ Server or PHP and MySQL). The software is written in the native language on each platform and works properly in the background on each. Lastly, the software has the MIT License. You can find the Android client here:https://github.com/nickfox/GpsTracker/tree/master/phoneClients/androidLocationManager is a class that provides in-build methods to get last know locationSTEP 1 :Create a LocationManager Object as belowLocationManager locationManager = (LocationManager)  context.getSystemService(Context.LOCATION_SERVICE);STEP 2 : Add CriteriaSTEP 3 :GET Avaliable ProviderThrere are two types of provider GPS and networkSTEP 4: Get Last Know LocationSTEP 5: Get Latitude and LongitudeIf location object is null then dont try to call below methodsgetLatitude and getLongitude is methods which returns double valuesGetting location updates requires lots of bolierplate code in Android, You need to take care ofTo ease out all these steps i have created Android-EasyLocation (small android library) which will take care all this stuff and you can focus on business logic.All you need is extend EasyLocationActivity and thisorCheckout sample app and steps needed here at https://github.com/akhgupta/Android-EasyLocationIf you are creating new location projects for Android you should use the new Google Play location services. It is much more accurate and much simpler to use.I have been working on an open source GPS tracker project, GpsTracker, for several years. I recently updated it to handle periodic updates from Android, iOS, Windows Phone and Java ME cell phones. It is fully functional and does what you need and has the MIT License.The Android project within GpsTracker uses the new Google Play services and there are also two server stacks (ASP.NET and PHP) to allow you to track those phones. For just location checking you can use following code. You can put it in your onStart() of main activity and display alert dialog if return is false.Simplest you can findI have made a project from which we can get the accurate location using Google Play Services, GPS and Network providers. This project can be found here.Strategy in finding the best location is that first get the location from google play services if location is found then check weather it is better or not, if location found is null restart google play services and try to fetch the location from Android Location API. Register the location on change listeners and when ever the better location is found the call back returns it to the main activity.It is very simple to use and implement in code only two classes we need to embed i.e. LocationManagerInterface and SmartLocationManager, LocationActivity is implementing the interface and using SmartLocationManager to fetch location.here is the location manager classwe can use it with activity or a fragment, here i am using it with activity Hope it helps, if you can suggest any improvement kindly post it on git. Thanks.I have published a small library that can make it easy to get location data in Android, it even takes care of Android M runtime permissions.You might check it out here: https://github.com/julioromano/RxLocation and use it or its source code as examples for your implementation.Simple Find Write Code in On Location Method
