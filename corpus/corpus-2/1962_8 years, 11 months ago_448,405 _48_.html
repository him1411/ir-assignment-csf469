I thought this would be really simple but it\'s presenting some difficulties. If I haveHow do I combine them to get a single string "John21"?In alphabetical order:in C++11,If you have Boost, you can convert the integer to a string using boost::lexical_cast<std::string>(age).Another way is to use stringstreams:A third approach would be to use sprintf or snprintf from the C library.Other posters suggested using itoa. This is NOT a standard function, so your code will not be portable if you use it. There are compilers that don\'t support it.Shamelessly stolen from http://www.research.att.com/~bs/bs_faq2.html.This is the easiest way:It seems to me that the simplest answer is to use the sprintf function:If you have C++11 you can use std::to_string:I don\'t have karma enough to comment (let alone edit), but Jay\'s post (currently the top-voted one at 27) contains an error. This code:Does not solve the stated problem of creating a string consisting of a concatenated string and integer. I think Jay meant something more like this:The final line is just to print the result, and shows how to access the final concatenated string.Herb Sutter has a good article on this subject: "The String Formatters of Manor Farm".  He covers Boost::lexical_cast, std::stringstream, std::strstream (which is deprecated), and sprintf vs. snprintf.Then your usage would look something like thisGoogled [and tested :p ]If you\'d like to use + for concatenation of anything which has an output operator, you can provide a template version of operator+:Then you can write your concatenations in a straightforward way:Output:This isn\'t the most efficient way, but you don\'t need the most efficient way unless you\'re doing a lot of concatenation inside a loop.If you are using MFC, you can use a CStringManaged C++ also has a \n string formatter.Common Answer: itoa()This is bad.  itoa is non-standard, as pointed out in Where is the itoa function in Linux?The std::ostringstream is a good method, but sometimes this additional trick might get handy transforming the formatting to a one-liner:Now you can format strings like this:As a Qt-related question was closed in favour of this one, here\'s how to do it using Qt:The string variable now has someIntVariable\'s value in place of %1 and someOtherIntVariable\'s value at the end.You can concatinate int to string by using the given below simple trick, but note that this only works when integer is of single digit otherwise add integer digit by digit to that string.There are more options possible to use to concatenate integer (or other numerric object) with string. It is Boost.Formatand Karma from Boost.Spirit (v2)Boost.Spirit Karma claims to be one of the fastest option for integer to string conversion.If you want to get a char* out, and have used stringstream as per what the above respondants have outlined, then do e.g.:Since what the stringstream returns via str() is a standard string, you can then call c_str() on that to get your desired output type.There is a function I wrote, which takes in parameters the int number, and convert it to a string literal, this function is dependant on another function that converts a single digit to its char equivalent :Here is an implementation of how to append an int to a string using the parsing and formatting facets from the IOStreams library.Another easy way of doing it is:Without C++11, for a small integer range, I found this is all I needed:declare/include some variant of the following somewhere:then:Works with enums too.Suggesting an alternate solution for people like me who may not have access to C++ 11 and additional libraries/headers like boost. A simple conversion works like this: Example the number is 4, to convert 3 into ascii we can simply use the code: \nchar a=\'0\'+4\n\nThis will immediately store 4 as a character in a. \n\nFrom here, we can simply concatenate a with the rest of the string. I am a beginner C++ user and found this the easiest way: This will successfully concatenate name and age, the the output will be "John21."However there has to be a reason nobody said this; I think there may be a flaw in it although I haven\'t experienced any so far. EDIT: I have realized that this is not necessarily the right answer, however I will keep it here in case any C++ beginners would like to know how to output concatenated strings.
