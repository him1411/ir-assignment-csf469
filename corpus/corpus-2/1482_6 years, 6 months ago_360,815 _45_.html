This is the error I getWhat can I do to resolve this?It seems mysql_config is missing on your system or the installer could not find it.\nBe sure mysql_config is really installed.For example on Debian/Ubuntu you must install the package:Maybe the mysql_config is not in your path, it will be the case when you compile by yourself\nthe mysql suite.Running Mac OSX Mountain Lion, I simply ran this in terminal to fix:This is the quickest fix I found - it adds it to the path, but I think you\'re better off adding it permanently (ie add it to /etc/paths) if you plan to install MySQL-python in another environment.Seemed to do the trick.There maybe various answers for the above issue, below is a aggregated solution.For Ubuntu:For CentOS:You can use the MySQL Connector/PythonInstallation via PyPipFurther information can be found on the MySQL Connector/Python 1.0.5 beta announcement blog.On Launchpad there\'s a good example of how to add-, edit- or remove data with the library.I was trying to install mysql-python on an Amazon EC2 Linux instance and I had to install these :But then I got this error :So I installed :And that did the trick.For centos users:    yum install -y mysql-devel python-devel python-setuptoolsthenpip install MySQL-pythonIf this solution doesn\'t work, and print gcc compile error like:\n_mysql.c:29:20: error: Python.h: No such file or directoryYou need to specify the path of Python.h, like this:\npip install --global-option=build_ext --global-option="-I/usr/include/python2.6" MySQL-pythonDue to changes within osx mavericks & xcode development tools you may get the error on installation therefore use :Try sudo apt-get build-dep python-mysqldbFor anyone that is using MariaDB instead of MySQL, the solution is to install the libmariadbclient-dev package and create a symbolic link to the config file with the correct name.For example this worked for me:sometimes the error depends on the actual cause. we had a case where mysql-python was installed through the python-mysqldb debian package. a developer who didn\'t know this, accidentally ran pip uninstall mysql-python and then failed to recover with pip install mysql-python giving the above error.pip uninstall mysql-python had destroyed the debian package contents, and of course pip install mysql-python failed because the debian package didn\'t need any dev files.the correct solution in that case was apt-get install --reinstall python-mysqldb which restored mysql-python to its original state.for mariadb install libmariadbclient-dev instead of libmysqlclient-devHad a similar issue trying to install on OS X Server 10.6.8. Here\'s what I had to do.\nUsing:MySQL-python 1.2.4b4 (source)\nMySQL-5.6.19 (binary installer)\nPython 2.7 (binary installer)\nNOTE: Installing in virtualenv...Unzip source, open \'distribute_setup.py\' and edit DEFAULT_VERSION to use the latest version of distribute tools, like so:Save. Open \'site.cfg\' file and uncomment the path to mysql_config so it looks something like (reference your own path to mysql_config):Now clean, build and make will not fail with the \'mysql_config\' not found error.\nHope this helps someone else trying to make use of their old xserves :-)Your sudo path does not know about your local path... go into superuser mode, add the path, and install it from there.And you\'re up and running on OSX.  Now you have an updated global python.If you are on MAC\nInstall this globally then export path like thislastly globally or in your venv
