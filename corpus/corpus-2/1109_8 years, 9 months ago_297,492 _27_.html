How can I detect which request type was used (GET, POST, PUT or DELETE) in PHP?By usingFor more details please see the documentation for the $_SERVER variable.REST in PHP can be done pretty simple. Create http://example.com/test.php (outlined below). Use this for REST calls, e.g. http://example.com/test.php/testing/123/hello. This works with Apache and Lighttpd out of the box, and no rewrite rules are needed.Detecting the HTTP method or so called REQUEST METHOD can be done using the following code snippet.You could also do it using a switch if you prefer this over the if-else statement.If a method other than GET or POST is required in an html form, this is often solved using an hidden field in the form.For more information regarding HTTP methods I would like to refer to the following StackOverflow question:HTTP protocol's PUT and DELETE and their usage in PHPSince this is about REST, just getting the request method from the server is not enough. You also need to receive RESTful route parameters. The reason for separating RESTful parameters and GET/POST/PUT parameters is that a resource needs to have its own unique URL for identification. Here\'s one way of implementing RESTful routes in PHP using Slim:https://github.com/codeguy/SlimAnd configure the server accordingly. Here\'s another example using AltoRouter:https://github.com/dannyvankooten/AltoRouterYou can use getenv function and don\'t have to work with a $_SERVER variable:More info:http://php.net/manual/en/function.getenv.phpIt is Very Simple just use $_SERVER[\'REQUEST_METHOD\'];Example:In this way you can also achieve in zend framework 2 also.\nThanks.We can also use the input_filter to detect the request method while also providing security through input sanitation.When a method was requested, it will have an array. So simply check with count().3v4l.org/U51TEYou can get any query string data i.e www.example.com?id=2&name=rYou must get data using $_GET[\'id\'] or $_REQUEST[\'id\'].Post data means like form <form action=\'\' method=\'POST\'> you must use $_POST or $_REQUEST.
