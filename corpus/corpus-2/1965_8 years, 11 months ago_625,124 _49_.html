If I have two variables:Without knowing the class of obj, how can I call the method identified by methodName on it?The method being called has no parameters, and a String return value. It\'s a getter for a Java bean.Coding from the hip, it would be something like:The parameters identify the very specific method you need (if there are several overloaded available, if the method has no arguments, only give methodName).Then you invoke that method by callingAgain, leave out the arguments in .invoke, if you don\'t have any. But yeah. Read about Java ReflectionUse reflection:http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/reflect/member/methodInvocation.htmlWhere:"class name" is the name of the classobjectToInvokeOn is of type Object and is the object you want to invoke the method on\n"method name" is the name of the method you want to callparameterTypes is of type Class [] and decalres the parameters the method takesparams is of type Object [] and declares the parameters to be passed to the methodThe method can be invoked like this. There are also more possibilities (check the reflection api), but this is the simplest one:For those who want a straight-forward code example in Java 7:Dog class:ReflectionDemo class:Output:\nMishka is 3 year(s) old.You can invoke the constructor with parameters this way:Alternatively, you can removeand doSuggested reading: Creating New Class InstancesFirst, don\'t. Avoid this sort of code. It tends to be really bad code and insecure too (see section 6 of Secure Coding Guidelines for the\nJava Programming Language, version 2.0).If you must do it, prefer java.beans to reflection. Beans wraps reflection allowing relatively safe and conventional access.To complete my colleague\'s answers, You might want to pay close attention to:Here is an old java1.4 code which takes into account those points:This sounds like something that is doable with the Java Reflection package.http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/ALT/Reflection/index.htmlParticularly under Invoking Methods by Name:import java.lang.reflect.*;Please refer following code may help you.Thanks....If you do the call several times you can use the new method handles introduced in Java 7. Here we go for your method returning a String:I do this manner:KeyWords is class name and KeyWord is a variableYou should use reflection - init a class object, then a method in this class, and then invoke this method on an object with optional parameters. Remember to wrap the following snippet in try-catch blockHope it helps!This is working fine for me :}Output: My input testparamI am able to invoke the method by passing its name to another method (like main).using import java.lang.reflect.*;and here is how you use it:Student.javaStudentTest.javafor me a pretty simple and fool proof way would be to simply make a method caller method like so:then when you need to call the method simply put something like this
