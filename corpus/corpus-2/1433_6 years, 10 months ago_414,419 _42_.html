In JavaScript, how do I get:For some number y and some divisor x compute the quotient (quotient) and remainder (remainder) as:I\'m no expert in bitwise operators, but here\'s another way to get the whole number:This will work properly for negative numbers as well, while Math.floor() will round in the wrong direction.This seems correct as well:I did some speed tests on Firefox.The above is based on 10 million trials for each.Conclusion: Use (a/b>>0) (or (~~(a/b)) or (a/b|0)) to achieve about 20% gain in efficiency. Also keep in mind that they are all inconsistent with Math.floor, when a/b<0 && a%b!=0.ES6 introduces the new Math.trunc method. This allows to fix @MarkElliot\'s answer to make it work for negative numbers too:Note that Math methods have the advantage over bitwise operators that they work with numbers over 231.You can use the function parseInt to get a truncated result.To get a remainder, use mod operator:parseInt have some pitfalls with strings, to avoid use radix parameter with base 10In some cases the string representation of the number can be a scientific notation, in this case, parseInt will produce a wrong result.This call will produce 1 as result.JavaScript calculates right the floor of negative numbers and the remainder of non-integer numbers, following the mathematical definitions for them.FLOOR is defined as "the largest integer number smaller than the parameter", thus:REMAINDER is defined as the "left over" of a division (Euclidean arithmetic). When the dividend is not an integer, the quotient is usually also not an integer, i.e., there is no remainder, but if the quotient is forced to be an integer (and that\'s what happens when someone tries to get the remainder or modulus of a floating-point number), there will be a non-integer "left over", obviously.JavaScript does calculate everything as expected, so the programmer must be careful to ask the proper questions (and people should be careful to answer what is asked!) Yarin\'s first question was NOT "what is the integer division of X by Y", but, instead, "the WHOLE number of times a given integer GOES INTO another". For positive numbers, the answer is the same for both, but not for negative numbers, because the integer division (dividend by divisor) will be -1 smaller than the times a number (divisor) "goes into" another (dividend). In other words, FLOOR will return the correct answer for an integer division of a negative number, but Yarin didn\'t ask that!gammax answered correctly, that code works as asked by Yarin. On the other hand, Samuel is wrong, he didn\'t do the maths, I guess, or he would have seen that it does work (also, he didn\'t say what was the divisor of his example, but I hope it was 3):Remainder = X % Y = -100 % 3 = -1GoesInto = (X - Remainder) / Y = (-100 - -1) / 3 = -99 / 3 = -33By the way, I tested the code on Firefox 27.0.1, it worked as expected, with positive and negative numbers and also with non-integer values, both for dividend and divisor. Example:-100.34 / 3.57: GoesInto = -28, Remainder = -0.3800000000000079Yes, I noticed, there is a precision problem there, but I didn\'t had time to check it (I don\'t know if it\'s a problem with Firefox, Windows 7 or with my CPU\'s FPU). For Yarin\'s question, though, which only involves integers, the gammax\'s code works perfectly.Math.floor(operation) returns the rounded value of the operation.EXAMPLE OF 1ST QUESTION:CONSOLE:15EXAMPLE OF 2ND QUESTIONCONSOLE:4I hope this helped!You can use ternary to decide how to handle positive and negative integer values as well.If the number is a positive, all is fine. If the number is a negative, it will add 1 because of how Math.floor handles negatives.I normally use (a - a % b) / b.  It\'s probably not the most elegant, but it works.This will always truncate towards zero.\nNot sure if it is too late, but here it goes:Alex Moore-Niemi\'s comment as an answer:For Rubyists here from Google in search of divmod, you can implement it as such: Result:If you are just dividing with powers of two, you can use bitwise operators:(The first is the quotient, the second the remainder)
