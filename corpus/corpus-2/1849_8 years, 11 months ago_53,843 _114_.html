Creating an HTML Element and keeping a reference\nChecking if an element exists\nWriting your own selectorsjQuery\'s data() method is useful and not well known. It allows you to bind data to DOM elements without modifying the DOM.You can nest filters (as nickf showed here).I\'m really not a fan of the $(document).ready(fn) shortcut. Sure it cuts down on the code but it also cuts way down on the readability of the code. When you see $(document).ready(...), you know what you\'re looking at. $(...) is used in far too many other ways to immediately make sense.If you have multiple frameworks you can use jQuery.noConflict(); as you say, but you can also assign a different variable for it like this:Very useful if you have several frameworks that can be boiled down to $x(...)-style calls.Ooooh, let\'s not forget jQuery metadata! The data() function is great, but it has to be populated via jQuery calls.Instead of breaking W3C compliance with custom element attributes such as:Use metadata instead:Set an event handler for any element that matches a selector, even if it gets added to the DOM after the initial page load:This allows you to load content via ajax, or add them via javascript and have the event handlers get set up properly for those elements automatically.Likewise, to stop the live event handling:These live event handlers have a few limitations compared to regular events, but they work great for the majority of cases.For more info see the jQuery Documentation.UPDATE: live() and die() are deprecated in jQuery 1.7.   See http://api.jquery.com/on/ and http://api.jquery.com/off/ for similar replacement functionality.UPDATE2: live() has been long deprecated, even before jQuery 1.7. For versions jQuery 1.4.2+ before 1.7 use delegate() and undelegate(). The live() example ($(\'button.someClass\').live(\'click\', someFunction);) can be rewritten using delegate() like that: $(document).delegate(\'button.someClass\', \'click\', someFunction);.Replace anonymous functions with named functions. This really supercedes the jQuery context, but it comes into play more it seems like when using jQuery, due to its reliance on callback functions. The problems I have with inline anonymous functions, are that they are harder to debug (much easier to look at a callstack with distinctly-named functions, instead 6 levels of "anonymous"), and also the fact that multiple anonymous functions within the same jQuery-chain can become unwieldy to read and/or maintain. Additionally, anonymous functions are typically not re-used; on the other hand, declaring named functions encourages me to write code that is more likely to be re-used.An illustration; instead of:I prefer:Defining properties at element creationIn jQuery 1.4 you can use an object literal to define properties when you create an element:... You can even add styles:Here\'s a link to the documentation.instead of using a different alias for the jQuery object (when using noConflict), I always write my jQuery code by wrapping it all in a closure. This can be done in the document.ready function:alternatively you can do it like this:I find this to be the most portable. I\'ve been working on a site which uses both Prototype AND jQuery simultaneously and these techniques have avoided all conflicts.jQuery has .index but it is a pain to use, as you need the list of elements, and pass in the element you want the index of:The following is much easier:If you want to know the index of an element within a set (e.g. list items) within a unordered list:Shorthand for the ready-eventThe explicit and verbose way:The shorthand:On the core jQuery function, specify the context parameter in addition to the selector parameter.  Specifying the context parameter allows jQuery to start from a deeper branch in the DOM, rather than from the DOM root.  Given a large enough DOM, specifying the context parameter should translate to performance gains.Example: Finds all inputs of type radio within the first form in the document.Reference: http://docs.jquery.com/Core/jQuery#expressioncontextNot really jQuery only but I made a nice little bridge for jQuery and MS AJAX:It\'s really nice if you\'re doing lots of ASP.NET AJAX, since jQuery is supported by MS now having a nice bridge means it\'s really easy to do jQuery operations:So the above example isn\'t great, but if you\'re writing ASP.NET AJAX server controls, makes it easy to have jQuery inside your client-side control implementation.Optimize performance of complex selectorsQuery a subset of the DOM when using complex selectors drastically improves performance:Speaking of Tips and Tricks and as well some tutorials. I found these series of tutorials (\xe2\x80\x9cjQuery for Absolute Beginners\xe2\x80\x9d Video Series) by Jeffery Way are VERY HELPFUL. It targets those developers who are new to jQuery. He shows how to create many cool stuff with jQuery, like animation, Creating and Removing Elements and more...I learned a lot from it. He shows how it\'s easy to use jQuery.\nNow I love it and i can read and understand any jQuery script even if it\'s complex.Here is one example I like "Resizing Text"1- jQuery...2- CSS Styling... 2- HTML... Highly recommend these tutorials...  http://blog.themeforest.net/screencasts/jquery-for-absolute-beginners-video-series/Asynchronous each() functionIf you have really complex documents where running the jquery each() function locks up the browser during the iteration, and/or Internet Explorer pops up the \'do you want to continue running this script\' message, this solution will save the day.The first way you can use it is just like each():An optional 2nd parameter lets you specify the speed/delay in between iterations which may be useful for animations (the following example will wait 1 second in between iterations):Remember that since this works asynchronously, you can\'t rely on the iterations to be complete before the next line of code, for example:I wrote this for an internal project, and while I am sure it can be improved, it worked for what we needed, so hope some of you find it useful. Thanks -Syntactic shorthand-sugar-thing--Cache an object collection and execute commands on one line:Instead of:I do:A somewhat "real" use case could be something along these lines:I like declare a $this variable at the beginning of anonymous functions, so I know I can reference a jQueried this.Like so:Saving a jQuery object to a variable lets you reuse it without having to search back through the DOM to find it.(As @Louis suggested, I now use $ to indicate that a variable holds a jQuery object.)As a more complex example, say you\'ve got a list of foods in a store, and you want to show only the ones that match a user\'s criteria. You have a form with checkboxes, each one containing a criteria. The checkboxes have names like organic and lowfat, and the products have corresponding classes - .organic, etc.Now you can keep working with that jQuery object. Every time a checkbox is clicked (to check or uncheck), start from the master list of foods and filter down based on the checked boxes:It seems that most of the interesting and important tips have been already mentioned, so this one is just a little addition.The little tip is the jQuery.each(object, callback) function. Everybody is probably using the jQuery.each(callback) function to iterate over the jQuery object itself because it is natural. The jQuery.each(object, callback) utility function iterates over objects and arrays. For a long time, I somehow did not see what it could be for apart from a different syntax (I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind writing all fashioned loops), and I\xe2\x80\x99m a bit ashamed that I realized its main strength only recently.The thing is that since the body of the loop in jQuery.each(object, callback) is a function, you get a new scope every time in the loop which is especially convenient when you create closures in the loop.In other words, a typical common mistake is to do something like:Now, when you invoke the functions in the functions array, you will get three times alert with the content undefined which is most likely not what you wanted. The problem is that there is just one variable i, and all three closures refer to it. When the loop finishes, the final value of i is 3, and someArrary[3] is undefined. You could work around it by calling another function which would create the closure for you. Or you use the jQuery utility which it will basically do it for you:Now, when you invoke the functions you get three alerts with the content 1, 2 and 3 as expected.In general, it is nothing you could not do yourself, but it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to have.Access jQuery functions as you would an arrayAdd/remove a class based on a boolean...Is the shorter version of...Not that many use-cases for this. Never the less; I think it\'s neat :)UpdateJust in case you are not the comment-reading-type, ThiefMaster points out that the toggleClass accepts a boolean value, which determines if a class should be added or removed. So as far as my example code above goes, this would be the best approach...Update:Just include this script on the site and you\xe2\x80\x99ll get a Firebug console that pops up for debugging in any browser. Not quite as full featured but it\xe2\x80\x99s still pretty helpful! Remember to remove it when you are done.Check out this link:From CSS TricksUpdate:\nI found something new; its the the JQuery Hotbox.JQuery HotboxGoogle hosts several JavaScript libraries on Google Code. Loading it from there saves bandwidth and it loads quick cos it has already been cached.OrYou can also use this to tell when an image is fully loaded.The "console.info" of firebug, which you can use to dump messages and variables to the screen without having to use alert boxes. "console.time" allows you to easily set up a timer to wrap a bunch of code and see how long it takes.Use filtering methods over pseudo selectors when possible so jQuery can use querySelectorAll (which is much faster than sizzle). Consider this selector:The same selection can be made using:Which is must faster because the initial selection of \'.class\' is QSA compatibleRemove elements from a collection and preserve chainabilityConsider the following:The filter() function removes elements from the jQuery object. In this case: All li-elements not containing the text "One" or "Two" will be removed.Changing the type of an input elementI ran into this issue when I was trying to change the type of an input element already attached to the DOM. You have to clone the existing element, insert it before the old element, and then delete the old element. Otherwise it doesn\'t work:Judicious use of third-party jQuery scripts, such as form field validation or url parsing. It\'s worth seeing what\'s about so you\'ll know when you next encounter a JavaScript requirement.Line-breaks and chainabilityWhen chaining multiple calls on collections...You can increase readability with linebreaks. Like this:Use .stop(true,true) when triggering an animation prevents it from repeating the animation. This is especially helpful for rollover animations.Using self-executing anonymous functions in a method call such as .append() to iterate through something. I.E.:I use this to iterate through things that would be large and uncomfortable to break out of my chaining to build.HTML5 data attributes support, on steroids!The data function has been mentioned before. With it, you are able to associate data with DOM elements.Recently the jQuery team has added support for HTML5 custom data-* attributes. And as if that wasn\'t enough; they\'ve force-fed the data function with steroids, which means that you are able to store complex objects in the form of JSON, directly in your markup.\nThe HTML:\nThe JavaScript:
