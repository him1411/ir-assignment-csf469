I want to add a comma in the thousands place for a number. String.Format()?I found this to be the simplest way:If you want culture specific, you might want to try this:(19950000.0).ToString("N",new CultureInfo("en-US")) = 19,950,000.00(19950000.0).ToString("N",new CultureInfo("is-IS")) = 19.950.000,00Note: Some cultures use , to mean decimal rather than . so be careful.Standard formats, with their related outputs,Example output (en-us culture):That will give you commas at the relevant points.This is the best format. Works in all of those cases:If you wish to force a "," separator regardless of culture (for example in a trace or log message), the following code will work and has the added benefit of telling the next guy who stumbles across it exactly what you are doing.sets formatted to "19,400,320"The most voted answer was great and has been helpful for about 7 years. With the introduction of C# 6.0 and specifically the String Interpolation there\'s a neater and, IMO safer, way to do what has been asked to add commas in thousands place for a number:Where the variable i  is put in place of the placeholder (i.e. {0}). So there\'s no need to remember which object goes to which position. The formatting (i.e. :n) hasn\'t changed. For a complete feature of what\'s new, you may go to this page.For example String.Format("{0:0,0}", 1); returns 01, for me is not validThis works for meoutput\n19,950,000Note that the value that you\'re formatting should be numeric.\nIt doesn\'t look like it will take a string representation of a number and format is with commas.The following example displays several values that are formatted by using custom format strings that include zero placeholders.Orresult "29,255.0"Orresult "29,255.00"You can use a function such as this to format numbers and optionally pass in the desired decimal places. If decimal places are not specified it will use two decimal places.I use decimal but you can change the type to any other or use an anonymous object. You could also add error checking for negative decimal place values.Simpler, using string interpolation instead of String.Formator using yourVariablejust simple as this: more info is in HereBelow is a good solution in Java though!   or for a more robust way you may want to get the locale of a particular place, then use as below:US Locale OUTPUT: $9,999,999.00German Locale outputOUTPUT: 9.999.999,00 \xe2\x82\xacIndian Locale outputOUTPUT: Rs.9,999,999.00Estonian Locale outputOUTPUT: 9\xc2\xa0999\xc2\xa0999 \xe2\x82\xacAs you can see in different outputs you don\'t have to worry about the separator being a comma or dot or even space you can get the number formatted according to the i18n standardsThe method I used to not worry anymore about cultures and potential formatting issues is that I formatted it as currency and took out the currency symbol afterwards.if (decimal.TryParse(tblCell, out result))If you want to show it in DataGridview , you should change its type , because default is String and since you change it to decimal it considers as Number with floating point
