I want to force the chrome debugger to break on a line via code, or else using some sort of comment tag such as something like console.break().Is there a way to do this?You can use debugger; within your code.  If the developer console is open, execution will break.  It works in firebug as well.As other have already said, debugger; is the way to go.\nI wrote a small script that you can use from the command line in a browser to set and remove breakpoint right before function call: \nhttp://andrijac.github.io/blog/2014/01/31/javascript-breakpoint/Set up a button click listener and call the debugger;ExampleDemohttp://jsfiddle.net/hBCH5/Resources on debugging in JavaScriptYou can also use debug(function), to break when function is called.Command Line API Reference: debugOn the "Scripts" tab, go to where your code is. At the left of the line number, click. This will set a breakpoint.Screenshot:You will then be able to track your breakpoints within the right tab (as shown in the screenshot).It is possible and there are many reasons you might want to do this. For example debugging a javascript infinite loop close to the start of the page loading, that stops the chrome developer toolset (or firebug) from loading correctly.See section 2 of  http://www.laurencegellert.com/2012/05/the-three-ways-of-setting-breakpoints-in-javascript/or just add a line containing the word debugger to your code at  the required test point.debugger is a reserved keyword by EcmaScript and given optional semantics since ES5As a result, it can be used not only in Chrome, but also Firefox and Node.js via node debug myscript.js.The standard says:SyntaxSemanticsEvaluating the DebuggerStatement production may allow an implementation to cause a breakpoint when run under a debugger. If a debugger is not present or active this statement has no observable effect.The production DebuggerStatement : debugger ; is evaluated as follows:Breakpoint :-breakpoint will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values.After examining values, you can resume the execution of code (typically with a play button).Debugger :-The debugger; stops the execution of JavaScript, and callsthe debugging function.The debugger statement suspends execution, but it does not close any files or clear any variables.I use This works just fine. It helps to avoid refreshing the page. Cheers!
