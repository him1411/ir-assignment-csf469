How do I enable assembly bind failure logging (Fusion) in .NET?Add the following values toMake sure you include the backslash after the folder name and that the Folder exists. You need to restart the program that you\'re running to force it to read those registry settings.BTW, don\'t forget to turn off fusion logging off when not needed.  If you have the Windows SDK installed on your machine, you\'ll find the "Fusion Log Viewer" under Microsoft SDK\\Tools (just type "Fusion" in the start menu on Vista or Windows 7/8). Launch it, click the Settings button, and select "Log bind failure" or "Log all binds".If these buttons are disabled, go back to the start menu, right-click the Log Viewer, and select "Run as Administrator".I usually use the Fusion Log Viewer (Fuslogvw.exe from a Visual Studio command prompt or Fusion Log Viewer from the start menu) - my standard setup is:Remember to turn of logging off once you\'re done! (I just posted this on a similar question - I think it\'s relevant here too.)Set the following registry value:[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Fusion!EnableLog] (DWORD) to 1To disable, set to 0 or delete the value.[edit ]:Save the following text to a file, e.g FusionEnableLog.reg, in\nWindows Registry Editor Format:Then run the file from windows explorer and ignore the warning about possible damage.You can run this Powershell script as administrator to enable FL:and this one to disable:The Fusion Log Settings Viewer changer script is bar none the best way to do this. In ASP.NET, it has been tricky at times to get this to work correctly. This script works great and was listed on Scott Hanselman\'s Power Tool list as well. I\'ve personally used it for years and its never let me down.Instead of using a ugly log file, you can also activate Fusion log via ETW/xperf by turning on the DotnetRuntime Private provider (Microsoft-Windows-DotNETRuntimePrivate) with GUID 763FD754-7086-4DFE-95EB-C01A46FAF4CA and the FusionKeyword keyword (0x4) on.When you now open the ETL file in PerfView and look under the Events table, you can find the Fusion data:Just a tiny bit of info that might help others; if you do something along the lines of searching all assemblies in some directory for classes that inherit/implement classes/interfaces, then make sure you clean out stale assemblies if you get this error pertaining to one of your own assemblies.The scenario would be something like:In short: A ---loads--> B (stale) ---references---> CIf this happens, the only telltale sign is the namespace and classname in the error message. Examine it closely. If you can\'t find it anywhere in your solution, you are likely trying to load a stale assembly.If you already have logging enabled and you still get this error on Windows 7 64 bit, try this in IIS 7.5:Create a new application poolGo to the Advanced Settings of this application poolSet the Enable 32-Bit Application to TruePoint your web application to use this new pool
