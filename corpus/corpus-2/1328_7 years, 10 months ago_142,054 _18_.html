How do I mark a method as Obsolete/Deprecated using C#?The shortest way is adding a Method Attribute:You can add an explanation:You can also cause the compilation to fail (treat method use as error instead of warning) if the method is called from somewhere in code like this:(Thanks @rick)Add an annotation to the method using the keyword Obsolete. Message argument is optional but a good idea to communicate why the item is now obsolete and/or what to use instead. Example:To mark as obsolete with a warning;You get a warning when you use it;And tool tip;If you want a message;Here\'s the tool tip;Finally if you want the usage to be flagged as an error;When used this is what you get;Tip - Use the message to tell people what they should use instead, not why it is obsolete.
