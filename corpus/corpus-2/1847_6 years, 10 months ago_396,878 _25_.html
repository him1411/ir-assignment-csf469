Checking if this method returns null should be enough to tell if an internet connection is available or not.You will also need:in your android manifest.Edit:Note that having an active network interface doesn\'t guarantee that a particular networked service is available. Network issues, server downtime, low signal, captive portals, content filters and the like can all prevent your app from reaching a server.
