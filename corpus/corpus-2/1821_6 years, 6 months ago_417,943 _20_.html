Is there an easy way to get a tag name?For example, if I am given $(\'a\') into a function, I want to get \'a\'.You can call .prop("tagName"). Examples:\nIf writing out .prop("tagName") is tedious, you can create a custom function like so:Examples:\nNote that tag names are, by convention, returned CAPITALIZED. If you want the returned tag name to be all lowercase, you can edit the custom function like so:Examples:You can use the DOM\'s nodeName property:As of jQuery 1.6 you should now call prop:See http://api.jquery.com/prop/jQuery 1.6+ Older versions toLowerCase() is not mandatory.This is yet another way:You should NOT use jQuery(\'selector\').attr("tagName").toLowerCase(), because it only works in older versions of Jquery.You could use $(\'selector\').prop("tagName").toLowerCase() if you\'re certain that you\'re using a version of jQuery thats >= version 1.6.You may think that EVERYONE is using jQuery 1.10+ or something by now (January 2016), but unfortunately that isn\'t really the case. For example, many people today are still using Drupal 7, and every official release of Drupal 7 to this day includes jQuery 1.4.4 by default.So if do not know for certain if your project will be using jQuery 1.6+, consider using one of the options that work for ALL versions of jQuery :Option 1 :Option 2
