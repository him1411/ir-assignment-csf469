It\'s a useful feature, to be sure, but is there any way to disable it? For instance, if the form is a single text field and already has a "clear" button beside it, it\'s superfluous to also have the X. In this situation, it would be better to remove it.Can it be done, and if so, how?Style the ::-ms-clear pseudo-element for the box:I found it\'s better to set the width and height to 0px. Otherwise, IE10 ignores the padding defined on the  field -- padding-right -- which was intended to keep the text from typing over the \'X\' icon that I overlayed on the input field. I\'m guessing that IE10 is internally applying the padding-right of the input to the ::--ms-clear pseudo element, and hiding the pseudo element does not restore the padding-right value to the input.This worked better for me:I would apply this rule to all input fields of type text, so it doesn\'t need to be duplicated later:As pointed out by David Cumps, one can even get less specific by using just:I have used the later even before adding this answer, but thought that most people would prefer to be more specific than that. Both solutions work fine.You should style for ::-ms-clear (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh465740.aspx):And you also style for ::-ms-reveal pseudo-element for password field:I think it\'s worth noting that all the style and CSS based solutions don\'t work when a page is running in compatibility mode. The compatibility mode renderer ignores the ::-ms-clear element, even though the browser shows the x. If your page needs to run in compatibility mode, you may be stuck with the X showing.In my case, I am working with some third party data bound controls, and our solution was to handle the "onchange" event and clear the backing store if the field is cleared with the x button.
