I need to check the existence of an input argument. I have the following script:I getHow do I check the input argument1 first to see if it exists?It is:The $# variable will tell you the number of input arguments the script was passed.Or you can check if an argument is an empty string or not like:The -z switch will test if the expansion of "$1" is a null string or not. If it is a null string then the body is executed.It is better to demonstrate this wayYou normally need to exit if you have too few arguments.If you\'re only interested in detecting if a particular argument is missing, parameter substitution is great:In some cases you need to check whether the user passed an argument to the script and if not, fall back to a default value. Like in the script below:Here if the user hasn\'t passed scale as a 2nd parameter, I launch Android emulator with -scale 1 by default. ${varname:-word} is an expansion operator. There are other expansion operators as well:Another way to detect if arguments were passed to the script:Note that (( expr )) causes the expression to be evaluated as per rules of Shell Arithmetic.In order to exit in the absence of any arguments, one can say:Another (analogous) way to say the above would be:help let says:let: let arg [arg ...]Try:As a small reminder, the numeric test operators in Bash only work on integers (-eq, -lt, -ge, etc.)I like to ensure my $vars are ints bybefore I test them, just to defend against the "[: integer arg required" error.If you\'d like to check if the argument exists, you can check if the # of arguments is greater than or equal to your target argument number.The following script demonstrates how this worksproduces the following output
