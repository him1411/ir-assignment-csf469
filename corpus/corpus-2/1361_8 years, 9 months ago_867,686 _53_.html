Is this possible via CSS? I\'m trying to no avail. Maybe I\'m doing something wrong?You need to use padding on your td elements. Something like this should do the trick. You can, of course, get the same result using a top padding instead of a bottom padding.In the CSS code below, the greater-than sign means that the padding is only applied to td elements that are direct children to tr elements with the class spaceUnder. This will make it possible to use nested tables. (Cell C and D in the example code.) I\'m not too sure about browser support for the direct child selector (think IE 6), but it shouldn\'t break the code in any modern browsers.This should render somewhat like this:In the parent table, try setting Plus a border declaration, and see if this achieves your desired effect.\nBeware, though, that IE doesn\'t support the "separated borders" model.You have table with id albums with any data... I have omitted the trs and tdsIn the css:since I have a background image behind the table, faking it with white padding wouldn\'t work. I opted to put an empty row in-between each row of content:then use css to give the spacer rows a certain height and transparent background.You may try to add separator row:html:css:From Mozilla Developer Network:The border-spacing CSS property specifies the distance between the borders of adjacent cells (only for the separated borders model). This is equivalent to the cellspacing attribute in presentational HTML, but an optional second value can be used to set different horizontal and vertical spacing.That last part is often overseen. Example: UPDATEI now understand that the OP wants specific, seperate rows to have increased spacing. I\'ve added a setup with tbody elements that accomplishes that without ruining the semantics. However, I\'m not sure if it is supported on all browsers. I made it in Chrome.The example below is for showing how you can make it look like the table exists of seperate rows, full blown css sweetness. Also gave the first row more spacing with the tbody setup. Feel free to use!Support notice: IE8+, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera 4+You can\'t change the margin of a table cell. But you CAN change the padding. Change the padding of the TD, which will make the cell larger and push the text away from the side with the increased padding. If you have border lines, however, it still won\'t be exactly what you want.Ok, you can doMake sure the background color is set on the td rather than the row. This should work across most browsers... (Chrome, ie & ff tested)You need to set border-collapse: separate; on the table; most browser default stylesheets start at border-collapse: collapse;, which ditches border spacing.Also, border-spacing: goes on the TD, not the TR.  Try:You can use line-height in the table:A too late answer :)If you apply float to tr elements, you can space between two rows with margin attribute.For creating an illusion of spacing between rows, apply background color to row and then create a thick border with white color so that a "space" is created :)The correct way to give spacing for tables is to use cellpadding and cellspacing e.g.I stumbled upon this while struggling with a similar issue. I\'ve found Varun Natraaj\'s answer to be quite helpful, but I would use a transparent border instead.Transparent borders still have width. Works for most latest browsers in 2015. Simple solution. It doesn\'t work for transparent, but unlike Thoronwen\'s answer, I can\'t get transparent to render with any size.Simply put div inside the td and set the following styles of div:I realize this is an answer to an old thread and may not be the solution requested, but while all the suggested solutions did not do what I needed, this solution worked for me.I had 2 table cells, one with background color, the other with a border color. The above solutions remove the border, so the cell on the right would appear to be floating in mid-air.\nThe solution that did the trick was to replace the table, tr and td with divs and corresponding classes: table would be div id="table_replacer", tr would be div class="tr_replacer" and td would be div class="td_replacer" (change closing tags to divs as well obviously)To get the solution for my problem the css is:Hope this helps someone.You can fill the <td/> elements with <div/> elements, and apply any margin to those divs that you like.  For a visual space between the rows, you can use a repeating background image on the <tr/> element.  (This was the solution I just used today, and it appears to work in both IE6 and FireFox 3, though I didn\'t test it any further.)Also, if you\'re averse to modifying your server code to put <div/>s inside the <td/>s, you can use jQuery (or something similar) to dynamically wrap the <td/> contents in a <div/>, enabling you to apply the CSS as desired.Or just add a blank  with the height of the margin in between the rows you would like to add the spacingHere this works smoothly:I suppose you could work out a more finely-grained layout by specifying which td if need be.doing this shown above...removes vertical column alignment so be careful how you use itHave you tried:Alternatively, each td can be adjusted as well:or
