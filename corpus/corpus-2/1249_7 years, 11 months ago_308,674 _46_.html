I have a Debian system currently running with python 2.5.4. I got virtualenv properly installed, everything is working fine. Is there a possibility that I can use a virtualenv with a different version of Python?I compiled Python 2.6.2 and would like to use it with some virtualenv. Is it enough to overwrite the binary file? Or do I have to change something in respect to the libraries?Just use the --python (or short -p) option when creating your virtualenv instance to specify the Python executable you want to use, e.g.:N.B. For Python 3.3 or later, refer to The Aelfinn\'s answer below. [Editor\'s note: I know this should normally be a comment, not an edit, but a new comment would be hidden, and I just spent 45 minutes untangling errors because this important answer was buried under three or four parrot answers. I\'m just trying to save everyone time here.]These are steps when you are on shared hosting environment and need to install & complie Python from source and then create venv from your Python version. For Python 2.7.9 you would do something along these lines:virtual envNaturally this can be applicable to any situation where you want to replicate the exact environment you work and deploy on. Under Windows for me this works:without the python.exe I got WindowsError: [Error 5] Access is denied \nI have Python2.7.1 installed with virtualenv 1.6.1, and I wanted python 2.5.2.UPDATE:  For Python3.6, the below pyvenv script is deprecated. Instead, it is suggested that you create the virtual environment with the following command:For python3 (3.5.2), use the new pyvenv command.There is an easier way, Thanks to  a comment, this only works if you have python2.7 installed at the system level (e.g. /usr/bin/python2.7).Otherwise, if you are using homebrew you can use the path to give you what you want.You can find the path to your python installation with This will also work with python 3. Ultimately condensing to:Mac OSX 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard):1) When you do pip install virtualenv, the pip command is associated with one of your python versions, and virtualenv gets installed into that version of python (you can doto see what version of python that is). By default, that will be the version of python that is used for any new environment you create. However, you can specify any version of python installed on your computer to use inside a new environment with the -p flag:  virtualenv my_env will create a folder in the current directory which\n  will contain the Python executable files, and a copy of the pip\n  [command] which you can use to install other packages.http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/virtualenv just copies python from a location on your computer into the newly created my_env/bin/ directory. 2) The system python is in /usr/bin, while the various python versions I installed were, by default, installed into:3) The various pythons I installed have names like python2.7 or python3.2, and I can use those names rather than full paths. 1) I had some problems getting virtualenvwrapper to work.  This is what I ended up putting in ~/.bash_profile:  2) The -p option works differently with virtualenvwrapper: I have to specify the full path to the python interpreter to be used in the new environment(when I do not want to use the default python version):  Unlike virtualenv, virtualenvwrapper will create the environment at the location specified by the $WORKON_HOME environment variable.  That keeps all your environments in one place.Suppose you currently have python 2.7 installed in your virtualenv. But want to make use of python3.2. You would have to update this with:Then activate your virtualenv and type python --version in shell to check whether your version is now updated.You can call virtualenv with python version you want. For example:Or alternatively directly point to your virtualenv path. e.g. for windows:And by running:you can see the python version installed in virtual environmentOn the mac I use pyenv and virtualenvwrapper. I had to create a new virtualenv. You need homebrew which I\'ll assume you\'ve installed if you\'re on a mac, but just for fun:I also froze my requirements first so i could simply reinstall in the new virtualenv with:The -p approach works well, but you do have to remember to use it every time.  If your goal is to switch to a newer version of Python generally, that\'s a pain and can also lead to mistakes.Your other option is to set an environment variable that does the same thing as -p. Set this via your ~/.bashrc file or wherever you manage environment variables for your login sessions:Then virtualenv will use that any time you don\'t specify -p on the command line.Even easier, by using command substitution to find python2 for you:virtualenv -p $(which python2) <path/to/new/virtualenv/>Or when using virtualenvwrapper : mkvirtualenv -p $(which python2) <env_name>It worked for meCreate environment for python3:Activate it:
