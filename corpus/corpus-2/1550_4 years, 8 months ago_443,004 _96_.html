I have a few checkboxes:That I would like to bind to a list in my controller such that whenever a checkbox is changed the controller maintains a list of all the checked values, for example, [\'apple\', \'pear\'].ng-model seems to only be able to bind the value of one single checkbox to a variable in the controller.Is there another way to do it so that I can bind the four checkboxes to a list in the controller?There are two ways to approach this problem. Either use a simple array or an array of objects. Each solution has it pros and cons. Below you\'ll find one for each case.The HTML could look like:And the appropriate controller code would be:Pros: Simple data structure and toggling by name is easy to handleCons: Add/remove is cumbersome as two lists (the input and selection) have to be managedThe HTML could look like:And the appropriate controller code would be:Pros: Add/remove is very easyCons: Somewhat more complex data structure and toggling by name is cumbersome or requires a helper methodDemo: http://jsbin.com/ImAqUC/1/A simple solution:http://plnkr.co/edit/U4VD61?p=previewHere\'s a quick little reusable directive that seems to do what you\'re looking to do. I\'ve simply called it checkList. It updates the array when the checkboxes change, and updates the checkboxes when the array changes.Here\'s a controller and a view that shows how you might go about using it.(The buttons demonstrate that changing the array will also update the checkboxes.)Finally, here is an example of the directive in action on Plunker: http://plnkr.co/edit/3YNLsyoG4PIBW6Kj7dRK?p=preview.Based on answers in this thread I\'ve created checklist-model directive that covers all cases:For topic-starter case it would be:The checklist-model directive on GitHub by Vitaliy Potapov absolutely worked for me (using complex objects).I spent a few hours trying to get the other solutions to work with no luck. Great job, vitalets!!Using a string of $index can help to use a hashmap of selected values:This way the ng-model object gets updated with the key representing the index.After a while $scope.someObject should look something like:This method won\'t work for all situations, but it is easy to implement.Since you accepted an answer in which a list was not used, I\'ll assume the answer to my comment question is "No, it doesn\'t have to be a list".  I also had the impression that maybe you were rending the HTML server side, since "checked" is present in your sample HTML (this would not be needed if ng-model were used to model your checkboxes).Anyway, here\'s what I had in mind when I asked the question, also assuming you were generating the HTML server-side:ng-init allows server-side generated HTML to initially set certain checkboxes.Fiddle.I have adapted Yoshi\'s accepted answer to deal with complex objects (instead of strings).HTMLJavaScriptWorking example: http://jsfiddle.net/tCU8v/Another simple directive could be like:The controller:And the HTML:I\'m also including a Plunker: http://plnkr.co/edit/XnFtyij4ed6RyFwnFN6V?p=previewCheck out this directive that manages effectively lists of checkboxes. I hope it works for you.\nCheckList ModelI think the easiest workaround would be to use \'select\' with \'multiple\' specified:Otherwise, I think you\'ll have to process the list to construct the list\n(by $watch()ing the model array bind with checkboxes).There is a way to work on the array directly and use ng-model at the same time through ng-model-options="{ getterSetter: true }".The trick is to use a getter/setter function in your ng-model. This way you can use an array as your real model and "fake" the booleans in the input\'s model:\nCAVEAT You shouldn\'t use this method if your arrays are big as myGetterSetter will be called a lot of times.For more on that, see https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngModelOptions.You don\'t have to write all that code.  AngularJS will keep the model and the checkboxes in sync simply by using ngTrueValue and ngFalseValueCodepen here:  http://codepen.io/paulbhartzog/pen/kBhznCode snippet:I like Yoshi\'s answer. I enhanced it so You can use the same function for multiple lists.http://plnkr.co/edit/KcbtzEyNMA8s1X7Hja8p?p=previewIn the HTML (supposing that the checkboxes are in the first column of every row in a table).In the controllers.js file:Here is yet another solution. The upside of my solution:Here is the directive:At the end then just use it like this:And that is all there is. The only addition is the checkbox-array-set attribute.You can combine AngularJS and jQuery. For example, you need to define an array, $scope.selected = [];, in the controller.You can get an array owning the selected items. Using method alert(JSON.stringify($scope.selected)), you can check the selected items.The following solution seems like a good option,And in controller model value fruits will be like this If you have multiple checkboxes on the same form The controller code View code Inspired from Yoshi\'s post above.\nHere is the plnkr.Based on my other post here, I have made a reusable directive.Check out the GitHub repositoryA simple HTML only way of doing it:Using this example of the @Umur Kontac\xc4\xb1, I think in using to catch selected data throughout another object/array, like a edit page.As example, all colors json in below:And 2 types of data object, array with one object and object containing two/more object data:Two items selected catched at the database:One item selected catched at the database:And here, my javascript code:My Html code:And call new method as below:That\'s it!I think the following way is more clear and useful for nested ng-repeats. Check it out on Plunker.Quote from this thread:Take a look this: checklist-model.It works with JavaScript arrays, and objects and it can use static HTML checkboxes, without ng-repeatAnd the JavaScript side:Here is the jsFillde link for the same, http://jsfiddle.net/techno2mahi/Lfw96ja6/.This uses the directive which is available for download at http://vitalets.github.io/checklist-model/.This is the good to have directive as your application will need this functionality much often.The code is below:I suggest using the AngularJS module Dropdown Multiselect.
