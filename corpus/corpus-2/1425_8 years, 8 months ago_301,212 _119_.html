Is there some easy way to handle multiple submit buttons from the same form? Example:Any idea how to do this in ASP.NET Framework Beta? All examples I\'ve googled for have single buttons in them.Here is a mostly clean attribute-based solution to the multiple submit button issue based heavily on the post and comments from Maartin Balliauw.razor:and controller:Update: Razor pages looks to provide the same functionality out of the box. For new development, it may be preferable.Give your submit buttons a name, and then inspect the submitted value in your controller method:posting toEDIT:To extend this approach to work with localized sites, isolate your messages somewhere else (e.g. compiling a resource file to a strongly-typed resource class)Then modify the code so it works like:and your controller should look like this:You can check the name in the action as has been mentioned, but you might consider whether or not this is good design.  It is a good idea to consider the responsibility of the action and not couple this design too much to UI aspects like button names.  So consider using 2 forms and 2 actions:Also, in the case of "Cancel", you are usually just not processing the form and are going to a new URL.  In this case you do not need to submit the form at all and just need a link:Eilon suggests you can do it like this:If you have more than one button you\n  can distinguish between them by giving\n  each button a name:In your controller action method you\n  can add parameters named after the\n  HTML input tag names:If any value gets posted to one of\n  those parameters, that means that\n  button was the one that got clicked.\n  The web browser will only post a value\n  for the one button that got clicked.\n  All other values will be null.I like this method as it does not rely on the value property of the submit buttons which is more likely to change than the assigned names and doesn\'t require javascript to be enabledSee:\nhttp://forums.asp.net/p/1369617/2865166.aspx#2865166Just written a post about that:\nMultiple submit buttons with ASP.NET MVC:Basically, instead of using ActionMethodSelectorAttribute, I am using\nActionNameSelectorAttribute, which allows me to pretend the action name is whatever I want it to be. Fortunately, ActionNameSelectorAttribute does not just make me specify action name, instead I can choose whether the current action matches request. So there is my class (btw I am not too fond of the name):  To use just define a form like this:and controller with two methods  As you see, the attribute does not require you to specify anything at all. Also, name of the buttons are translated directly to the method names. Additionally (I haven\xe2\x80\x99t tried that) these should work as normal actions as well, so you can post to any of them\ndirectly.I would suggest interested parties have a look at Maarten Balliauw\'s solution. I think it is very elegant.In case the link dissapears, it\'s using the MultiButton attribute applied to a controller action to indicate which button click that action should relate to.You should be able to name the buttons and give them a value; then map this name as an argument to the action. Alternatively, use 2 separate action-links or 2 forms.it is short and suite:It was answered by Jeroen Dopand do like this in code behindeGood luck.You could write:And then in the page check if the name == "Send" or name == "Cancel"...Something I don\'t like about ActionSelectName is that IsValidName is called for every action method in the controller; I don\'t know why it works this way. I like a solution where every button has a different name based on what it does, but I don\'t like the fact that you have to have as many parameters in the action method as buttons in the form. I have created an enum for all button types:Instead of ActionSelectName, I use an ActionFilter:The filter will find the button name in the form data and if the button name matches any of the button types defined in the enum, it will find the ButtonType parameter among the action parameters:and then in views, I can use:Here is what works best for me:I\'ve came across this \'problem\' as well but found a rather logical solution by adding the name attribute. I couldn\'t recall having this problem in other languages.http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.2Meaning the following code value attributes can be changed, localized, internationalized without the need for extra code checking strongly-typed resources files or constants.On the receiving end you would only need to check if any of your known submit types isn\'t nullDavid Findley writes about 3 different options you have for doing this, on his ASP.Net weblog. Read the article multiple buttons in the same form to see his solutions, and the advantages and disadvantages of each. IMHO he provides a very elegant solution which makes use of attributes that you decorate your action with.This is the technique I\'d use and I don\'t see it here yet. The link (posted by Saajid Ismail\n) that inspires this solution is http://weblogs.asp.net/dfindley/archive/2009/05/31/asp-net-mvc-multiple-buttons-in-the-same-form.aspx). It adapts Dylan Beattie\'s answer to do localization without any problems.In the View:In the Controller:If you do not have restrictions on the use of HTML 5, you can use the <button> tag with formaction Attribute:Reference: http://www.w3schools.com/html5/att_button_formaction.aspThis script allows to specify a data-form-action attribute which will work as the HTML5 formaction attribute in all browsers (in an unobtrusive way):The form containing the button will be posted to the URL specified in the data-form-action attribute:This requires jQuery 1.7. For previous versions you should use live() instead of on().There are three ways by which you can solve the above issueBelow is a video which summarizes all the three approaches in a demonstrative way.https://www.facebook.com/shivprasad.koirala/videos/vb.100002224977742/809335512483940HTML way :-In the HTML way we need to create two forms and place the \xe2\x80\x9cSubmit\xe2\x80\x9d button inside each of the forms. And every form\xe2\x80\x99s action will point to different / respective actions. You can see the below code the first form is posting to \xe2\x80\x9cAction1\xe2\x80\x9d and the second form will post to \xe2\x80\x9cAction2\xe2\x80\x9d depending on which \xe2\x80\x9cSubmit\xe2\x80\x9d button is clicked.Ajax way :-In case you are a  Ajax lover this second option would excite you more. In the Ajax way we can create two different functions \xe2\x80\x9cFun1\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cFun1\xe2\x80\x9d , see the below code. These functions will make Ajax calls by using JQUERY or any other framework. Each of these functions are binded with the \xe2\x80\x9cSubmit\xe2\x80\x9d button\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cOnClick\xe2\x80\x9d events. Each of these function make call to respective action names.Using \xe2\x80\x9cActionNameSelectorAttribute\xe2\x80\x9d:- This is a great and a clean option. The \xe2\x80\x9cActionNameSelectorAttribute\xe2\x80\x9d is a simple attribute class where we can write decision making logic which will decide which action can be executed.So the first thing is in HTML we need to put proper name\xe2\x80\x99s to the submit buttons for identifying them on the server. You can see we have put \xe2\x80\x9cSave\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cDelete\xe2\x80\x9d to the button names. Also you can notice in the action we have just put controller name \xe2\x80\x9cCustomer\xe2\x80\x9d and not a particular action name. We expect the action name will be decide by \xe2\x80\x9cActionNameSelectorAttribute\xe2\x80\x9d.So when the submit button is clicked , it first hits the \xe2\x80\x9cActionNameSelector\xe2\x80\x9d attribute and then depending on which submit is fired it invokes the appropriate action.So the first step is to create  a class which inherits from \xe2\x80\x9cActionNameSelectorAttribute\xe2\x80\x9d class. In this class we have created a simple property \xe2\x80\x9cName\xe2\x80\x9d.We also need to override the \xe2\x80\x9cIsValidName\xe2\x80\x9d function which returns true or flase. This function is where we write the logic whether an action has to be executed or not. So if this function returns true then the action is executed or else it is not.The main heart of the above function is in the below code. The \xe2\x80\x9cValueProvider\xe2\x80\x9d collection has all the data that has been posted from the form. So it first looks up the \xe2\x80\x9cName\xe2\x80\x9d value and if its  found in the HTTP request it returns true or else it returns false.This attribute class can then decorated on the respective action and the respective \xe2\x80\x9cName\xe2\x80\x9d value can be provided. So if the submit is hitting this action and if the name matches of  the HTML submit button name it then executes the action further or else it does not.Here\'s an extension method I wrote to handle multiple image and/or text buttons.Here\'s the HTML for an image button:or for a text submit button :Here is the extension method you call from the controller with form.GetSubmitButtonName(). For image buttons it looks for a form parameter with .x (which indicates an image button was clicked) and extracts the name. For regular input buttons it looks for a name beginning with Submit_ and extracts the command from afterwards. Because I\'m abstracting away the logic of determining the \'command\' you can switch between image + text buttons on the client without changing the server side code.Note: For text buttons you have to prefix the name with Submit_. I prefer this way becuase it means you can change the text (display) value without having to change the code. Unlike SELECT elements, an INPUT button has only a \'value\' and no separate \'text\' attribute. My buttons say different things under different contexts - but map to the same \'command\'. I much prefer extracting the name this way than having to code for == "Add to cart". I don\'t have enough rep to comment in the correct place, but I spent all day on this so want to share.While trying to implement the "MultipleButtonAttribute" solution ValueProvider.GetValue(keyValue) would incorrectly come back null.It turned out I was referencing System.Web.MVC version 3.0 when it should have been 4.0 (other assemblies are 4.0). I don\'t know why my project didn\'t upgrade correctly and I had no other obvious problems.So if your ActionNameSelectorAttribute is not working... check that.I\'ve tried to make a synthesis of all solutions and created a [ButtenHandler] attribute that makes it easy to handle multiple buttons on a form.I\'ve described it on CodeProject Multiple parameterized (localizable) form buttons in ASP.NET MVC.To handle the simple case of this button:You\'ll have something like the following action method:Notice how the name of the button matches the name of the action method. The article also describes how to have buttons with values and buttons with indexes.Modified version of HttpParamActionAttribute method but with a bug fix for not causing an error on expired/invalid session postbacks. To see if this is a problem with your current site, open the your form in a window and just before you go to click Save or Publish, open a duplicate window, and logout. Now go back to your first window and try to submit your form using either button. For me I got an error so this change solves that problem for me. I omit a bunch of stuff for the sake of brevity but you should get the idea. The key parts are the inclusion of ActionName on the attribute and making sure the name passed in is the name of the View that shows the formAttribute ClassControllerViewthis is the best way that i have found:http://iwayneo.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/aspnet-mvc-action-selector-with-list.htmlHere is the code:Enjoy a code-smell-less multi submit button future.thank youIf your browser supports the attribute formaction for input buttons (IE 10+, not sure about other browsers) then the following should work:I\'m pretty late to the party, but here goes...\nMy implementation borrows from @mkozicki but requires less hardcoded strings to get wrong.  Framework 4.5+ required.  Essentially, the controller method name should be the key to the routing.Markup.  The button name must be keyed with "action:[controllerMethodName]"(notice the use of the C#6 nameof API, providing type-specific reference to the name of the controller method you wish to invoke.Controller:Attribute Magic.  Notice the use of CallerMemberName goodness.My JQuery approach using an extension method:You can use it like this:And it renders like this:For each submit button just add:   Based on mkozicki answer I come up with a bit different solution. I still use ActionNameSelectorAttribute But I needed to handle two buttons \'Save\' and \'Sync\'. They do almost the same so I didn\'t want to have two actions. attribute:viewcontrollerI also want to point out that if actions do different things I would probably follow mkozicki post.When using ajax forms, we can use ActionLinks with POST HttpMethod and \nserialize the form in the AjaxOptions.OnBegin event.  Let\'s say you have two actions, InsertAction and UpdateAction:JavascriptI\'ve created an ActionButton method for the HtmlHelper. It will generate normal input button with a bit of javascript in the OnClick event that will submit the form to the specified Controller/Action.You use the helper like thatthis will generate the following HTMLHere is the extension method code:  VB.Net C# (the C# code is just decompiled from the VB DLL, so it can get some beautification... but time is so short :-))These methods have various parameters, but for the ease of use you can create some overload that take just the parameters you need.
