I\'ve been given sudo access on one of our development RedHat linux boxes, and I seem to find myself quite often needing to redirect output to a location I don\'t normally have write access to.The trouble is, this contrived example doesn\'t work:I just receive the response:How can I get this to work?Your command does not work because the redirection is performed by your shell which does not have the permission to write to /root/test.out. The redirection of the output is not performed by sudo.There are multiple solutions:Run a shell with sudo and give the command to it by using the -c option:Create a script with your commands and run that script with sudo:Run sudo ls.sh. See Steve Bennett\'s answer if you don\'t want to create a temporary file.Launch a shell with sudo -s then run your commands:Use sudo tee (if you have to escape a lot when using the -c option):The redirect to /dev/null is needed to stop tee from outputting to the screen. To append instead of overwriting the output file \n(>>), use tee -a or tee --append (the last one is specific to GNU coreutils).Thanks go to Jd, Adam J. Forster and Johnathan for the second, third and fourth solutions.Someone here has just suggested sudoing tee:This could also be used to redirect any command, to a directory that you do not have access to. It works because the tee program is effectively an "echo to a file" program, and the redirect to /dev/null is to stop it also outputting to the screen to keep it the same as the original contrived example above.A trick I figured out myself wasThe problem is that the command gets run under sudo, but the redirection gets run under your user. This is done by the shell and there is very little you can do about it.The usual ways of bypassing this are:Wrap the commands in a script which you call under sudo.If the commands and/or log file changes, you can make the \nscript take these as arguments. For example:Call a shell and pass the command line as a parameter with -cThis is especially useful for one off compound commands.\nFor example:Yet another variation on the theme:Or of course:They have the (tiny) advantage that you don\'t need to remember any arguments to sudo or sh/bashClarifying a bit on why the tee option is preferableAssuming you have appropriate permission to execute the command that creates the output, if you pipe the output of your command to tee, you only need to elevate tee\'s privledges with sudo and direct tee to write (or append) to the file in question.in the example given in the question that would mean:for a couple more practical examples:In each of these examples you are taking the output of a non-privileged command and writing to a file that is usually only writable by root, which is the origin of your question.It is a good idea to do it this way because the command that generates the output is not executed with elevated privileges.  It doesn\'t seem to matter here with echo but when the source command is a script that you don\'t completely trust, it is crucial.Note you can use the -a option to tee to append append (like >>) to the target file rather than overwrite it (like >).Make sudo run a shell, like this:How about writing a script?Filename: myscriptThen use sudo to run the script:Whenever I have to do something like this I just become root:It\'s probably not the best way, but it works.I would do it this way:The way I would go about this issue is:If you need to write/replace the file:If you need to append to the file:Here\'s an extension of the answer involving tee. To make things easier you might like to make a small script (I call it suwrite or you may call it sutee) and put it in /usr/local/bin/ with +x permission:Now all you have to do is to pipe the output to this script followed by the desired superuser-accessible filename and it will automatically prompt you for your password if needed (since it includes sudo).Note that since this is a simple wrapper for tee, it will also accept tee\'s -a (or any other) option so to append to the desired file you just pass -a:Maybe you been given sudo access to only some programs/paths? Then there is no way to do what you want. (unless you will hack it somehow)If it is not the case then maybe you can write bash script:Press ctrl + d :Hope it help.Don\'t mean to beat a dead horse, but there are too many answers here that use tee, which means you have to redirect stdout to /dev/null unless you want to see a copy on the screen. A simpler solution is to just use cat like this:Notice how the redirection is put inside quotes so that it is evaluated by a shell started by sudo instead of the one running it.
