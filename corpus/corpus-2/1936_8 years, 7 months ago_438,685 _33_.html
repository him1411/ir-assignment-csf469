Let say I have a generic member in a class or method, so:When I instantiate the class, the T becomes MyTypeObject1, so the class has a generic list property: List<MyTypeObject1>. The same applies to a generic method in a non-generic class:I would like to know, what type of objects the list of my class contains. So the list property called Bar or the local variable baz, contains what type of T? I cannot do Bar[0].GetType(), because the list might contain zero elements. How can I do it?If I understand correctly, your list has the same type parameter as the container class itself. If this is the case, then:If you are in the lucky situation of having object as a type parameter, see Marc\'s answer.(note: I\'m assuming that all you know is object or IList or similar, and that the list could be any type at runtime)If you know it is a List<T>, then:Another option is to look at the indexer:Using new TypeInfo:With the following extension method you can get away without reflection:Or more general:Usage:TryThat\'s work for me. Where myList is some unknowed kind of list.Consider this:\nI use it to export 20 typed list by same way:The GetGenericArgument() method has to be set on the Base Type of your instance \n(whose class is a generic class myClass<T>). Otherwise, it returns a type[0]Example:If you dont need the whole Type variable and just want to check the type you can easily create a temp variable and use is operator.You can get the type of "T" from any collection type that implements IEnumerable<T> with the following:Note that it doesn\'t support collection types that implement IEnumerable<T> twice, e.g. I suppose you could return an array of types if you needed to support this...Also, you might also want to cache the result per collection type if you\'re doing this a lot (e.g. in a loop).I use this extension method to accomplish something similar:You use it like this:This isn\'t quite what you\'re looking for, but it\'s helpful in demonstrating the techniques involved.  You can use this one for rerun type of generic list. Using 3dGrabber\'s solution:If you want to know a property\'s underlying type, try this:This is how i did it Then call it like this ORType:
