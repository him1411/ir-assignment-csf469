I\'m using Bootstrap. How can I make three columns all the same height?Here is a screenshot of the problem. I would like the blue and red columns to be the same height as the yellow column. Here is the code: Solution 1 using negative margins (doesn\'t break responsiveness) DemoSolution 2 using table DemoSolution 3 using flex added August 2015. Comments posted before this don\'t apply to this solution.DemoBest approach for Bootstap 3.x -- using CSS flexbox (and requires minimal CSS)..Bootstrap same height flexbox exampleTo only apply the same height flexbox at specific breakpoints (responsive), use a media query. For example, here is sm(768px) and up:This solution also works well for multiple rows (column wrapping): \nhttps://www.bootply.com/gCEXzPMehZOther workaroundsThese options will be recommended by others, but are not a good idea for responsive design. These only work for simple single row layouts w/o column wrapping.1) Using huge negative margins & padding2) Using display:table-cell (this solution also effects the responsive grid, so a @media query can be used to only apply table display on wider screens before the columns stack vertically)Flexbox is now used by default in Bootstrap 4 so there is no need for the extra CSS to make equal height columns: http://www.codeply.com/go/IJYRI4LPwUNo JavaScript needed. Just add the class .row-eq-height to your existing .row just like this:Tip: if you have more than 12 columns in your row, the bootstrap grid will fail to wrap it. So add a new div.row.row-eq-height each 12 columns.Tip: you may need to add to your htmlYou only show one row so your use case may be limited to just that.  Just in case you have multiple rows, this plugin - github Javascript-grids - works perfectly!  It makes each panel expand to the tallest panel, giving each row potentially a different height based on the tallest panel in that row. It\'s a jquery solution vs. css, but wanted to recommend it as an alternative approach.To answer your question this is all you need see full responsive demo with prefixed css:To add support for thumbnail content flex within flex columns like the screenshot above also add this... Note you could do this with panels as well: While flexbox doesn\'t work in IE9 and below you can use the demo with a fallback using conditional tags with something like javascript grids as a polyfil:As for the other two examples in the accepted answer... The table demo is a decent idea, but is being implemented wrong. Applying that css on bootstrap column classes specifically will without a doubt break the grid framework entirely. You should be using a custom selector for one and two the tables styles should not be applied to [class*=\'col-\'] that have defined widths. This method should ONLY be used if you wan\'t equal height AND equal width columns. It is not meant for any other layouts and is NOT responsive. We can make it fallback however on mobile displays...Lastly, the first demo in the accepted answer which implements a version of the one true layout is a good choice for some situations, but not suitable for bootstrap columns. The reason for this is that all the columns expand to the the container height. So this will also break responsiveness since the columns are not expanding to the elements next to them, but the entire container. This method will also not allow you to apply bottom margins to rows any longer and will also cause other issues along the way like scrolling to anchor tags.For the complete code see the codepen which automatically prefixes the flexbox code.If you want to make this work in any browser, use javascript:You can use inline-flex as well which works pretty good and may be a little cleaner than modifying every row element with CSS.For my project I wanted every row who\'s child elements had borders to be the same height so the borders would look jagged. For this I created a simple css class.Some of the previous answers explain how to make the divs the same height, but the problem is that when the width is too narrow the divs won\'t stack, therefore you can implement their answers with one extra part. For each one you can use the CSS name given here in addition to the row class that you use, so the div should look like this if you always want the divs to be next to each other:For all screens:For when you want to use sm:For when you want to md:For when you want to use lg:From:http://getbootstrap.com.vn/examples/equal-height-columns/equal-height-columns.cssI know I\'m very late but now you can use the "min-height" style attribute to achieve your purpose.cheeky jquery solution if anyone\'s interested. Just make sure all your cols (el) have a common classname...works responsively too if you bind it to $(window).resizeNote: This post has been edited as per @Chris\' comment out that the code was only set the last highest height in the $.each() functionI tried alot of the suggestions made in this thread and on other pages but no solution worked 100% in every browsers.So I experimented quite some time and came up with this.\nA complete solution for Bootstrap Equal Height columns with the help of flexbox with only 1 class. This works in all major browsers IE10+.CSS:HTML:To support even more versions of IE you can, for example, use https://github.com/liabru/jquery-match-height and target all child columns of .equal-cols. Like this:Without this polyfill the columns will behave as usual Bootstrap columns so which is a quite good fallback.There is a problem with using Solution 1 while appling it on only column in rows. Would like to improve Solution 1.(Sorry, can\'t comment Popnoodles\'s anwer. I have not enough reputations)Based on Popnoodles\' good answer (solution 2):where .container-height is the style class that has to be added to a .row styled element to which all its .col* children have the same height.Popnoodles\' solution 1 did not work for me because it would interfere with inner .row and .col* expected behaviour, due to the layout changes. Applying these styles only to some specific .row (with .container-height, as in the example) also avoids applying the margin and padding overflow to all .col*.here is my solution (compiled CSS):So your code would look like:Basically this is the same system you use with .col-* classes with that difference you need to apply .row-* classes to the row itself.With .row-sm-eq columns will be stacked on XS screens. If you don\'t need them to be stacked on any screens you can use .row-xs-eq.The SASS version that we do actually use:Live demoNote: mixing .col-xs-12 and .col-xs-6 inside a single row would not work properly.Best out there: Works with bootstrapUpdate:Here is my method, i have used flex with some changes in media query.then added the classes to the parent which were required.I am using responsive breakpoints because flux usually hampers the bootstrap standard responsive nature.If it makes sense in your context, you can simply add an empty 12-column div after each break, which acts as a divider that hugs the bottom of the tallest cell in your row.Hope this helps!For those looking for a quick, easy solution - if you have a relatively consistent set of block content setting a min-height on the div that is a bit bigger than the largest block can be easier to implement.Example:https://jsfiddle.net/b9chris/njcnex83/embedded/result/Adapted from several answers here. The flexbox-based answers are the right way once IE8 and 9 are dead, and once Android 2.x is dead, but that is not true in 2015, and likely won\'t be in 2016. IE8 and 9 still make up 4-6% of usage depending on how you measure, and for many corporate users it\'s much worse. http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexboxThe display: table, display: table-cell trick is more backwards-compatible - and one great thing is the only serious compatibility issue is a Safari issue where it forces box-sizing: border-box, something already applied to your Bootstrap tags. http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-tableYou can obviously add more classes that do similar things, like .equal-height-md. I tied these to divs for the small performance benefit in my constrained usage, but you could remove the tag to make it more generalized like the rest of Bootstrap.Note that the jsfiddle here uses CSS, and so, things Less would otherwise provide are hard-coded in the linked example. For example @screen-sm-min has been replaced with what Less would insert - 768px.Thought I\'d just add that the answer given by Dr.Flink can also be applied to a Bootstrap 3 form-horizontal block - which can be very handy if you want to use background colours for each cell. In order for this to work for bootstrap forms, you would need to wrap the form contents which just serves to replicate a table-like structure.The example below also provides the CSS which demonstrates an additional media query allows Bootstrap 3 to simply takeover and do it\'s normal thing on the smaller screen(s). This also works in IE8+ .Example:I use this super easy solution with clearfix, which doesn\'t have any side effects. Here is an example on AngularJS:And one more example on PHP:You can wrap the columns inside a divTry this do through flex-boxLive JSFiddle - https://jsfiddle.net/grinmax_/spsn4fnq/Just checking through bootstrap documentation and I found the simple solution for the problem of column same height.Add the extra clearfix for only the required viewportFor example:Please refer to http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-responsive-resetsYou can use below codealot of css here...jQueryReally simple code no need to play with css, although all options above are perfectly usable.Jsfiddle
