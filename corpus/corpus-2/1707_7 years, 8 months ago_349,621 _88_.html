If I use: This will launch the built-in Android application; I\'m trying to send the mail on button click directly without using this application.Send e-mail in Android using the JavaMail API using Gmail authenticationSteps to create a sample Project:MailSenderActivity.javaGMailSender.javaJSSE Provider JSSEProvider.javaADD 3 jars found in the following link to your Android Project Click here - How to add External JarsAnd don\'t forget to add this line in your manifest:Just click below link to change account access for less secure apps\nhttps://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureappsRun the project and check your recipient mail account for the mail.\nCheers!P.S. And don\'t forget that you cannot do network operation from any Activity in android.\nHence it is recommended to use AsyncTask or IntentService to avoid network on main thread exception.Jar files: https://code.google.com/archive/p/javamail-android/Thank you for your valuable information. Code is working fine. I am able to add attachment also by adding following code.Could not connect to SMTP host:\n  smtp.gmail.com, port: 465Add this line in your manifest:You can use JavaMail API to handle your email tasks. JavaMail API is available in JavaEE package and its jar is available for download. Sadly it cannot be used directly in an Android application since it uses AWT components which are completely incompatible  in Android.You can find the Android port for JavaMail at the following location:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/javamail-android/Add the jars to your application and use the SMTP methodIn order to help those getting a Network On Main Thread Exception with an SDK Target >9. This is using droopie\'s code above but will work similarly for any.You can use AsyncTask as belowUsing SMTP is one way to go, and the others have already pointed out ways how to do it. Just note that while doing this, you completely circumvent the built in mail app, and you will have to provide the address of the SMTP server, the user name and password for that server, either statically in your code, or query it from the user.Another way would involve a simple server side script, like php, that takes some URL parameters and uses them to send a mail. This way, you only need to make an HTTP request from the device (easily possible with the built in libraries) and don\'t need to store the SMTP login data on the device. This is one more indirection compared to direct SMTP usage, but because it\'s so very easy to make HTTP request and send mails from PHP, it might even be simpler than the direct way.If the mail shall be send from the users default mail account that he already registered with the phone, you\'d have to take some other approach. If you have enough time and experience, you might want to check the source code of the Android Email application to see if it offers some entry point to send a mail without user interaction (I don\'t know, but maybe there is one).Maybe you even find a way to query the users account details (so you can use them for SMTP), though I highly doubt that this is possible, because it would be a huge security risk and Android is built rather securely.here is an alt version that also works for me and has attachments (posted already above but complete version unlike the source link, which people posted they cant get it to work since its missing data)and to call it in an activity...100% working code with demo You can also send multiple email using this answer.Download Project HEREStep 1 :  Download mail,activation,additionnal jar files and add in your project libs folder in android studio.

Google will force you to change your linked email account password frequently due to their over zealous "suspicious activity" polices. In essence it treats repeated smtp requests from different countries within a short time frame as "suspicious activity". As they assume you (the email account holder) can only be in one country at a time.When google systems detect "suspicious activity" it will prevent further emails until you change the password. As you will have hard coded the password into the app you have to re-release the app each time this happens, not ideal. This happened 3 times in a week to me, I even stored the password on another server and dynamically fetched the password each time google forced me to change it.So I recommend using one of the many free smtp providers instead of "smtp.gmail.com" to avoid this security problem. Use the same code but change "smtp.gmail.com" to your new smtp forwarding host.Edit: JavaMail 1.5.5 claims to support Android, so you shouldn\'t need anything else.\nI\'ve ported the latest JavaMail (1.5.4) to Android. It\'s available in Maven Central, just add the following to build.gradle~~You can then follow the official tutorial.Source code is available here: https://bitbucket.org/artbristol/javamail-forked-androidFor sending a mail with attachment..GmailBackground is small library to send an email in background without user interaction :Usage:Configuration:Permissions:Also for attachments, you need to set READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission:Source(I\'ve tested it myself)Did you consider using Apache Commons Net ? Since 3.3, just one jar (and you can depend on it using gradle or maven) and you\'re done : http://blog.dahanne.net/2013/06/17/sending-a-mail-in-java-and-android-with-apache-commons-net/Those who are getting ClassDefNotFoundError try to move that Three jar files to lib folder of your Project,it worked for me!!I am unable to run Vinayak B\'s code. Finally i solved this issue by following :1.Using this 2.Applying AsyncTask.3.Changing security issue of sender gmail account.(Change to "TURN ON") in thisWithout user intervention, you can send as follows:Send email from client apk. Here mail.jar, activation.jar is required to send java email. If these jars are added, it might increase the APK Size. Alternatively, You can use a web-service at the server side code, which will use the same mail.jar and activation.jar to send email. You can call the web-service via asynctask and send email. Refer same link. (But, you will need to know the credentials of the mail account)In case that you are demanded to keep the jar library as small as possible, you can include the SMTP/POP3/IMAP function separately to avoid the "too many methods in the dex" problem. You can choose the wanted jar libraries from the javanet web page, for example, mailapi.jar + imap.jar can enable you to access icloud, hotmail mail server in IMAP protocol. (with the help of additional.jar and activation.jar)I tried using the code that @Vinayak B submitted. However I\'m getting an error saying: No provider for smtpI created a new question for this with more information HEREI was able to fix it myself after all. I had to use an other mail.jar\nand I had to make sure my "access for less secure apps" was turned on.I hope this helps anyone who has the same problem. With this done, this piece of code works on the google glass too.All the code provided in the other answers is correct and is working fine, but a bit messy, so I decided to publish a library (still in development though) to use it in a easier way: AndroidMail.You have just to create a MailSender, build a mail and send it (already handled in background with an AsyncTask).You can receive a notification for the email sent and it has also the support for different Recipients types (TO, CC and BCC), attachments and html:You can get it via Gradle or Maven:Please let me know if you have any issue with it! :)These sources explain to you step by step what actually each code line does:Sending email with attachment using JavaMail APISend e-mail with attachment in JavaDownload attachments in e-mail messages using JavaMailTo add attachment, don\'t forget to add.
