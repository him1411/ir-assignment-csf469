I have 2 directories on my GitHub repository. I\'d like to delete one of them. How could I do that without deleting and re-creating entire repository?You could checkout \'master\' with both directories; As mentioned in the comments, what you usually want to do is remove this directory from git but not delete it entirely from the filesystem (local)In that case use:  Steps to remove directorySteps to ignore that folder in next commitsTo ignore that folder from next commits make one file in root named .gitignore\n  and put that folders name into it. You can put as many as you want.gitignore file will be look like thisIf, for some reason, what karmakaze said doesn\'t work, you could try deleting the directory you want to delete (through your file system browser), issuing the command \ngit add -A \nand then \ngit commit -m \'deleting directory\' \nand then \ngit push origin master.If you remove the files in the directory (with git rm as the other answers explain), then the directory no longer exists as far as git is concerned. You cannot commit an empty directory, nor can you remove one.This is unlike subversion where you have to explicitly svn rm emptyfolder/, and is incidentally why the man page for git describes itself as "the stupid content tracker"An answer on "How do I add an empty directory to a git repository" links to the FAQ on this subject:Currently the design of the git index\n  (staging area) only permits files to\n  be listed, and nobody competent enough\n  to make the change to allow empty\n  directories has cared enough about\n  this situation to remedy it.Directories are added automatically\n  when adding files inside them. That\n  is, directories never have to be added\n  to the repository, and are not tracked\n  on their own.You can say "git add <dir>" and it\n  will add files in there.If you really need a directory to\n  exist in checkouts you should create a\n  file in it. .gitignore works well for\n  this purpose; you can leave it empty,\n  or fill in the names of files you\n  expect to show up in the directory.You can try this:\ngit rm -rf <directory_name>It will force delete the directory.You can delete the folder locally and then push, as follow:Go to your git Directory then type the following command:\nrm -rf <Directory Name>After Deleting the directory commit the changes by:\ngit commit -m "Your Commit Message"Then Simply push the changes on remote GIT directory:\ngit push origin <Branch name>I usually use git add --all to remove files / folders from remote repositoriesmaster can be replaced by any other branch of the repository.You can use Attlasian Source Tree (Windows) (https://www.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree/overview). \nJust select files from tree and push button "Remove" at the top. Files will be deleted from local repository and local git database. Then Commit, then push.One of my colleague suggested BFG Repo-Cleaner which I think powerful. It is not only delete unwanted data but also clean your repository from any related commit information.First git command need to know who you are before deleting anything
