Is it possible to insert a tab character in HTML instead of having to type &nbsp; four times?It\'s much cleaner to use CSS. Try padding-left:5em or margin-left:5em as appropriate instead.It depends on which character set you want to use. There\'s no tab entity defined in ISO-8859-1 HTML - but there are a couple of whitespace characters other than &nbsp; such as &thinsp;, &ensp;,and &emsp;.In ASCII, &#09; is a tab.Here is a complete listing of HTML entities and a useful discussion of whitespace on Wikipedia.No, tab is just whitespace as far as HTML is concerned. I\'d recommend an em-space instead which is this big (-> <-) and is input as &emsp;. You might even be able to get away with using the unicode character for it if you\'re lucky.&emsp; is the answer. However, they won\'t be as functional as you might expect if you are used to using  horizontal tabulations in word-processors e.g. Word, Wordperfect, Open Office, Wordworth, etc. They are fixed width, and they cannot be customised.CSS gives you far greater control and provides an alternative until the W3C provide an official solution.Example:..or....as appropriateIt depends on which character set you want to use.You could set up some tab tags and use them similar to how you would use h tags....and use them like so:Run the snippet above to see a visual example.Extra discussionOddly, there are no horizontal tabulation entities defined in ISO-8859-1 HTML: Odd, because it isn\'t as if tabs are scarcely used.However, there are some other white-space characters available than the usual &nbsp, for example; &thinsp;, &ensp;, and the aforementioned &emsp;.It\'s also worth mentioning that in ASCII and Unicode, &#09; is a horizontal tabulation.Try &emsp;It is equivalent to four &nbsp;s.There really isn\'t any easy way to insert multiple spaces inside (or in the middle) of a paragraph. Those suggesting you use CSS are missing the point. You may not always be trying to indent a paragraph from a side but, in fact, trying to put extra spaces in a particular spot of it.In essence, in this case, the spaces become the content and not the style. I don\'t know why so many people don\'t see that. I guess the rigidity with which they try to enforce the separation of style and content rule (HTML was designed to do both from the beginning - there is nothing wrong with occasionally defining style of an unique element using appropriate tags without having to spend a lot more time on creating CSS style sheets and there is absolutely nothing unreadable about it when it\'s used in moderation. There is also something to be said for being able to do something quickly.) translates to how they can only consider whitespace characters as being used only for style and indentation.And when there is no graceful way to insert spaces without having to rely on &emsp; and &nbsp; tags, I would argue that the resulting code becomes far more unreadible than if there was an appropriately named tag that would have allowed you to quickly insert a large number of spaces (or if, you know, spaces weren\'t needlessly consumed in the first place).As it is though, as was said above, your best bet would be to use &emsp; to insert   in the correct place.I came across this while searching for a method and ended up figuring out my own that seems to work easily for what\'s wanted. I\'m new to posting here so I hope this works...\nBut have this in CSS:Then in your HTML have this be your "long tab" in mid sentence like I needed:Saves from the amount of &nbsp; or &emsp; that you\'d need.Hope this helps someone, cheers!It\'s better to use the pre tag. The pre tag defines preformatted text.know more about pre tag at this linkAFAIK, the only way is to useIf you can use CSS then you can use padding or margin. See Box model, and for Internet Explorer, also read Internet Explorer box model bug.&emsp;, &ensp;, &#8195; or &#8194; can be used. W3 says... Read More at W3.org for HTML3Read More at W3.org for HTML4Even more at WikipediaIf whitespace becomes that important, it may be better to use preformatted text and the <pre> tag.The <tab> tag never made it into browsers, despite being introduced in HTML3. I\'ve always thought it a real pity because life would be much easier in many circumstances if we had it available to us. But you can easily remedy this to give you a fake <tab> tag. Add the following in the head of your HTML or else (without the style tags) into your CSS:From then on, when you need a tab in your document put <tab> in there. It isn\'t a true tab because it doesn\'t align to tab-marks, but it works for most needs, without having to dither around with clumsy character entities or spans. It makes it really easy to check your source, and a cinch to format simple things where you don\'t want to go to the hassle of tables or other more complex "solutions".One nice aspect of this solution is that you can do a quick search/replace of a text document to replace all TABs with the <tab> tag.You might be able to define a bunch of true absolute position TABs, then use the appropriate tab (e.g. <tab2> or <tab5> or whatever) where needed, but I haven\'t found a way to do that without it indenting subsequent lines.If you\'re looking to just indent the first sentence in a paragraph, you could do that with a small CSS trick:You can use a table and apply a width attribute to the first <td>.Code:ResultI have used a span with in line styling.  I have had to do this as I as processing a string of plain text and need to replace the \\t with 4 spaces (appx).  I couldn\'t use &nbsp; as further on in the process they were being interpreted so that the final mark up had non-content spaces.HTML:I used it in a php function like this:If you needed only one tab, the following worked for me.with the HTML something like:You can add more "tabs" by adding additional "tab" styles and changing the HTML such as:with the HTML something like:Consider it like this: one tab is equal to 64 pixels. So this is the space we can give by CSS.If you are using CSS, I would suggest the following:p:first-letter  {\n   text-indent:1em;\n}This will indent the first line like in traditional publications.I use a list with no bullets to give the "tabbed" appearance.\n(It\'s what I sometimes do when using MS Word)In the CSS file:And in the HTML file use unordered lists:The beauty of this solution is that you can make further indentations using nested lists.A noob here talking, so if there are any errors, please comment.Using CSS and best practice, the dynamic creation of nested, indented menus would be as follows:Alternatively, loop through the static variable to add spacing using multiple &nbsp; or <pre> tags, or other characters, as appropriate.From testing the horizontal tab character, &#09; I found that it doesn\'t work as a replacement to multiple &nbsp; in the scenario I described. You may have different results.This is a bit of an ugly solution but you could just do thisAnd then use the tab variable in your strings.Only "pre" tag:You can apply any CSS class on this tag.I would simply recommend:Well, if one needs a long whitespace in the beginning of one line only out of the whole paragraph, then this may be a solution:If that is too much to write or one needs such tabs in many places, then you can do thisThen include this into CSS:Make sure the color code matches the background\nthe px is variable to desired length for the tab.Then add your text after the < t >.< /t > The period is used as a space holder and it is easier to type, but the \'& #160;\' can be used in place of the period also making it so the color coding is irrelative. This is useful mostly for displaying paragraphs of text though may come in useful in other portions of scripts.You can also use:And replace "p" with any other selector you have in mind.CSSHTMLRenderedThis is not a direct answer but I wanted to add a tab in Markdown document.  I was drawing an object graph like this:Of course the easy way it to mark it as code by indenting by 4 spaces and is then treated as code in Markdown.we can use style="white-space:pre" like this:the blank space inside  is filled with tabs, the amount of tabs is depend on the text.it will looks like this:When you need tab, normally you want to make an indent to the left of an item regardless of the width of another item.\nI mean, all other solutions will fail in the following case:Therefore, I suggest to use CSS styling of div\'s in bootstrap.In any place you need a tab, just create div\'s with suitable width. For example:
