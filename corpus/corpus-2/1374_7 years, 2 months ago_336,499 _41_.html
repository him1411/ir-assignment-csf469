How can I delete all tables in PostgreSQL, working from the command line?I don\'t want to drop the database itself, just all tables and all the data in them.If all of your tables are in a single schema, this approach could work (below code assumes that the name of your schema is public)If you are using PostgreSQL 9.3 or greater, you may also need to restore the default grants.You can write a query to generate a SQL script like this:Or:In case some tables are automatically dropped due to cascade option in a previous sentence.Additionally, as stated in the comments, you might want to filter the tables you want to drop by schema name:And then run it.Glorious COPY+PASTE will also work.The most accepted answer as of this writing (January 2014) is:This does work, however if your intention is to restore the public schema to its virgin state this does not fully accomplish the task.  Under pgAdmin III for PostgreSQL 9.3.1, if you click on the "public" schema created this way and look in the "SQL pane" you will see the following:However, by contrast a brand new database will have the following:For me using a python web framework which creates database tables (web2py), using the former caused problems:So to my mind the fully correct answer is:(also note to issue these commands from pgAdmin III, I went to Plugins-> PSQL Console)As per Pablo above, to just drop from a specific schema, with respect to case: You can drop all tables withIMO this is better than drop schema public, because you don\'t need to recreate the schema and restore all the grants. Additional bonus that this doesn\'t require external scripting language, nor copy-pasting of generated SQL back to the interpreter.If everything you want to drop is owned by the same user, then you can use: You have to replace the_user with the actual username, currently there is no option to drop everything for "the current user". The upcoming 9.5 version will have the option drop owned by current_user.This will also drop views, sequences, triggers and so on that the_user owns (=created). More details in the manual: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-drop-owned.htmlshould do the trick. Following Pablo and LenW, here\'s a one-liner that does it all both preparing and then executing: psql -U $PGUSER $PGDB -t -c "select \'drop table \\"\' || tablename || \'\\" cascade;\' from pg_tables where schemaname = \'public\'"  | psql -U $PGUSER $PGDBNB: either set or replace $PGUSER and $PGDB with the values you want If you have the PL/PGSQL procedural language installed you can use the following to remove everything without a shell/Perl external script.Rather than type this in at the "psql" prompt I would suggest you copy it to a file and then pass the file as input to psql using the "--file" or "-f" options:Credit where credit is due: I wrote the function, but think the queries (or the first one at least) came from someone on one of the pgsql mailing lists years ago. Don\'t remember exactly when or which one.Just in case... Simple Python script that clean Postgresql databaseMake sure that after copying it the indentation is right since Python relies on it.You can use the string_agg function to make a comma-separated list, perfect for DROP TABLE.\nFrom a bash script:Rake task for Rails for destroy all tables in current databaseYou need to drop tables and sequences, here is what worked for mebefore you run the command you might need to sudo/su to the postgres user or (export connection details PGHOST, PGPORT, PGUSER and PGPASSWORD) and then export PGDATABASE=yourdatabase I enhanced the bash method from jamie by taking care of views because his only respects the table type "base table" which is the default.following bash code deletes the views first and then all the restI modified Pablo\'s answer slightly for the convenience of having the generated SQL commands returned as one single string:in a Windows batch file:
