What is the difference between asynchronous and synchronous execution?When you execute something synchronously, you wait for it to finish before moving on to another task. When you execute something asynchronously, you can move on to another task before it finishes.That being said, in the context of computers this translates into executing a process or task on another "thread." A thread is a series of commands (a block of code) that exists as a unit of work. The operating system can manage multiple threads and assign a thread a piece ("slice") of processor time before switching to another thread to give it a turn to do some work. At its core (pardon the pun), a processor can simply execute a command, it has no concept of doing two things at one time. The operating system simulates this by allocating slices of time to different threads.Now, if you introduce multiple cores/processors into the mix, then things CAN actually happen at the same time. The operating system can allocate time to one thread on the first processor, then allocate the same block of time to another thread on a different processor.  All of this is about allowing the operating system to manage the completion of your task while you can go on in your code and do other things.Asynchronous programming is a complicated topic because of the semantics of how things tie together when you can do them at the same time. There are numerous articles and books on the subject; have a look!Synchronous/Asynchronous HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MULTI-THREADING.Synchronous, or Synchronized means "connected", or "dependent" in some way. In other words, two synchronous tasks must be aware of one another, and one task must execute in some way that is dependent on the other, such as wait to start until the other task has completed.\nAsynchronous means they are totally independent and neither one must consider the other in any way, either in initiation or in execution.   Synchronous (one thread):Synchronous (multi-threaded):Asynchronous (one thread):   Asynchronous (multi-Threaded):Technically, the concept of synchronous/asynchronous really does not have anything to do with threads. Although, in general, it is unusual to find asynchronous tasks running on the same thread, it is possible, (see below for examples) and it is common to find two or more tasks executing synchronously on separate threads... No, the concept of synchronous/asynchronous has to do solely with whether or not a second or subsequent task can be initiated before the other (first) task has completed, or whether it must wait.  That is all.  What thread (or threads), or processes, or CPUs, or indeed, what hardware, the task[s] are executed on is not relevant. Indeed, to make this point I have edited the graphics to show this.ASYNCHRONOUS EXAMPLE.  In solving many engineering problems, the software is designed to split up the overall problem into multiple individual tasks, and then execute them asynchronously. Inverting a matrix, or a finite element analysis problem, are good examples. In computing, sorting a list is an example. The quick sort routine, for example, splits the list into two lists, and sorts each of them by calling itself recursively.  In both of the above examples, the two tasks can (and often were) executed asynchronously. They do not need to be on separate threads. Even a machine with one CPU, and only one thread of execution can be coded to initiate processing of a second task before a first one has completed. The only criterion is that the results of one task are not necessary as inputs to the other task. As long as the start and end times of the tasks overlap, (possible only if the output of neither is needed as inputs to the other), they are being executed asynchronously, no matter how many threads are in use.   SYNCHRONOUS EXAMPLE.  Any process consisting of multiple tasks where the tasks must be executed in sequence, but one must be executed on another machine (Fetch and/or update data, get a stock quote from a financial service, etc.).   If it\'s on a separate machine it is on a separate thread, whether synchronous or asynchronous.In simpler terms:SYNCHRONOUSYou are in a queue to get a movie ticket. You cannot get one until everybody in front of you gets one, and the same applies to the people queued behind you.ASYNCHRONOUSYou are in a restaurant with many other people. You order your food. Other people can also order their food, they don\'t have to wait for your food to be cooked and served to you before they can order.\nIn the kitchen restaurant workers are continuously cooking, serving, and taking orders.\nPeople will get their food served as soon as it is cooked.I\'ll try to explain as simply as I can so you\'ll (hopefully) remember:Synchronous ExecutionMy boss is a busy man. He tells me to write the code. I tell him: Fine. I get started and he\'s watching me like a vulture, standing behind me, off my shoulder. I\'m like "Dude, WTF: why don\'t you go and do something while I finish this?"he\'s like: "No, I\'m waiting right here until you finish." This is synchronous.Asynchronous ExecutionThe boss tells me to do it, and rather than waiting right there for my work, the boss goes off and does other tasks. When I finish my job I simply report to my boss and say: "I\'m DONE!" This is Asynchronous Execution.It\'s really that simple! Hope it helps.(Take my advice: NEVER work with the boss behind you.)Synchronous execution means the execution happens in a single series.  A->B->C->D.  If you are calling those routines, A will run, then finish, then B will start, then finish, then C will start, etc.With Asynchronous execution, you begin a routine, and let it run in the background while you start your next, then at some point, say "wait for this to finish".  It\'s more like:Start A->B->C->D->Wait for A to finishThe advantage is that you can execute B, C, and or D while A is still running (in the background, on a separate thread), so you can take better advantage of your resources and have fewer "hangs" or "waits".Synchronous means that the caller waits for the response or completion, asynchronous that the caller continues and a response comes later (if applicable).As an example:This will always ouput:But if we were to make doSomething asynchronous (multiple ways to do it), then the output could become:Because the method making the asynchronous call would immediately continue with the next line of code.  I say "could", because order of execution can\'t be guaranteed with asynch operations.  It could also execute as the original, depending on thread timings, etc.I think this is bit round-about explanation but still it clarifies using real life example.Small Example:Let\'s say playing an audio involves three steps:If your audio player does step 1,2,3 sequentially for every song then it is synchronous. You will have to wait for some time to hear the song till the song actually gets fetched and decompressed.If your audio player does step 1,2,3 independent of each other, then it is asynchronous. ie.\nWhile playing audio 1 ( step 3), if it fetches audio 3 from harddisk in parallel (step 1) and it decompresses the audio 2 in parallel. (step 2 )\nYou will end up in hearing the song without waiting much for fetch and decompress.In a nutshell, synchronization refers to two or more processes\' start and end points, NOT their executions.  In this example, Process A\'s endpoint is synchronized with Process B\'s start point:Asynchronous processes, on the other hand, do not have their start and endpoints synchronized:Where Process A overlaps Process B, they\'re running concurrently or synchronously (dictionary definition), hence the confusion.  It might be helpful to think in terms of "asynchronous and synchronous processes" instead of "asynchronous and synchronous execution". Simply said asynchronous execution is doing stuff in the background.For example if you want to download a file from the internet you might use a synchronous function to do that but it will block your thread until the file finished downloading. This can make your application unresponsive to any user input.Instead you could download the file in the background using asynchronous method. In this case the download function returns immediately and program execution continues normally. All the download operations are done in the background and your program will be notified when it\'s finished.When executing a sequence like: a>b>c>d>, if we get a failure in the middle of execution like:Then we re-start from the beginning:this is synchronousIf, however, we have the same sequence to execute: a>b>c>d>, and we have a failure in the middle:...but instead of restarting from the beginning, we re-start from the point of failure:...this is know as asynchronous.You are confusing Synchronous with Parallel vs Series. Synchronous mean all at the same time. Syncronized means related to each othere which can mean in series or at a fixed interval.  While the program is doing all, it it running in series. Get a dictionary...this is why we have unsweet tea.  You have tea or sweetened tea.Synchronous basically means that you can only execute one thing at a time. Asynchronous means that you can execute multiple things at a time and you don\'t have to finish executing the current thing in order to move on to next one.A synchronous operation does its work before returning to the caller.An asynchronous operation does (most or all of) its work after returning to the caller. Synchronous : When a task is executed synchronously, you wait for a task to be completed before moving on to another task. One task depends on the end of anotherAsynchronous : When a task is executed asynchronously, you can directly switch to another task before the previous has been completed. One task does not depend on the other.In programming, tasks are executed on a "thread". It is necessary to understand that several threads can be created for tasks in order to avoid stacking in a single queue.That being said, the concept of synchronous and asynchronous do not have much to do with threads, the reason I mention it is that it is rare to see tasks running asynchronously on a single thread (although technically possible).In regards to the "at the same time" definition of synchronous execution (which is sometimes confusing), here\'s a good way to understand it:Synchronous Execution: All tasks within a block of code are all executed at the same time.Asynchronous Execution: All tasks within a block of code are not all executed at the same time.
