I have a batch file that runs several python scripts that do table modifications.  I want to have users comment out the 1-2 python scripts that they don\'t want to run, rather than removing them from the batch file (so the next user knows these scripts exist as options!)I also want to add comments to bring to their attention specifically the variables they need to update in the Batch file before they run it. I see that I can use REM. But it looks like that\'s more for updating the user with progress after they\'ve run it.  Is there a syntax for more appropriately adding a comment?The rem command is indeed for comments. It doesn\'t inherently update anyone after running the script. Some script authors might use it that way instead of echo, though, because by default the batch interpreter will print out each command before it\'s processed. Since rem commands don\'t do anything, it\'s safe to print them without side effects. To avoid printing a command, prefix it with @, or, to apply that setting throughout the program, run @echo off. (It\'s echo off to avoid printing further commands; the @ is to avoid printing that command prior to the echo setting taking effect.)So, in your batch file, you might use this:Use ::   (or REM)p.s.(1) In Some cases, you might need to add & signp.s.(2) using :: might bug scripts with setlocal ENABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION and forNo, plain old batch files use REM as a comment.  ECHO is the command that prints something on the screen.To "comment out" sections of the file you could use GOTO.  An example of all these commands/techniques:What can I say?  batch files are a relic of times long gone, they\'re clunky and ugly.You can read more on this website.EDIT: modified the example a bit to have it contain the elements you are apparently looking for.The :: instead of REM was preferably used in the days that computers weren\'t very fast.\nREM\'ed line are read and then ingnored. ::\'ed line are ignored all the way. This could speed up your code in "the old days". Further more after a REM you need a space, after :: you don\'t.And as said in the first comment: you can add info to any line you feel the need toAs for the skipping of parts.\nPutting REM in front of every line can be rather time consuming.\nAs mentioned using GOTO to skip parts is an easy way to skip large pieces of code. Be sure to set a :LABEL at the point you want the code to continue.If there are large number of lines you want to comment out then it will be better if you can make multi line comments rather than commenting out every line. The batch language doesn\'t have comment blocks, though there are ways to accomplish the effect.You can use GOTO Label and :Label for making block comments.Or, If the comment block appears at the end of the batch file, you can write EXIT at end of code and then any number of comments for your understanding.Comments SourceExplanation:& separates two commands, so in this case color C is the first command and :: set red font color is the second one.This statement with comment looks intuitively correct:but it is not a valid use of the comment. It works only because goto ignores all arguments past the first one. The proof is easy, this goto will not fail either:But similar attemptfails executing the command due to 4 arguments unknown to the color command: ::, grey, on, blue.It will only work as:So the ampersand is inevitable.
