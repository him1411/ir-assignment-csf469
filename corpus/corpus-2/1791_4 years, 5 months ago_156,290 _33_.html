I can\'t find a clear answer on Apple documentation regarding Cocoa Autolayout about the difference between content hugging and compression resistance. Can somebody explain their usages and difference ? Quick summary of the concepts:and an example:Say you\'ve got button like this:and you\'ve pinned the edges to a larger superview with priority 500.Then, if Hugging priority > 500 it\'ll look like this:If Hugging priority < 500 it\'ll look like this:If superview now shrinks then, if the Compression Resistance priority > 500, it\'ll look like thisElse if Compression Resistance priority < 500,  it could look like this:If it doesn\'t work like this then you\'ve probably got some other constraints going on that are messing up your good work!E.g. you could have it pinned to the superview with priority 1000.\nOr you could have a width priority. If so, this can be helpful:Editor > Size to Fit ContentTake a look at this video tutorial about Autolayout, they explain it carefullyLet\'s say you have a button with the text, "Click Me". What width should that button be?First, you definitely don\'t want the button to be smaller than the text. Otherwise, the text would be clipped. This is the horizontal compression resistance priority.Second, you don\'t want the button to be bigger than it needs to be. A button that looked like this, [\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Click\xc2\xa0Me\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0], is obviously too big. You want the button to "hug" its contents without too much padding. This is the horizontal content hugging priority. For a button, it isn\'t as strong as the horizontal compression resistance priority.If view.intrinsicContentSize.width != NSViewNoIntrinsicMetric, then auto layout creates a special constraint of type NSContentSizeLayoutConstraint. This constraint acts like two normal constraints:In Swift, with iOS 9\'s new layout anchors, you could set up equivalent constraints like this:Similarly, if view.intrinsicContentSize.height != NSViewNoIntrinsicMetric, then auto layout creates an NSContentSizeLayoutConstraint that acts like two constraints on the view\'s height. In code, they would look like this:You can see these special NSContentSizeLayoutConstraint instances (if they exist) by printing view.constraints after layout has run. Example:Content Hugging and Content Compression Resistence Priorities work for elements which can calculate their size intrinsically depending upon the contents which are coming in.From Apple docs:source: krakendevIntrinsic Content Size - Pretty self-explanatory, but views with variable content are aware of how big their content is and describe their content\'s size through this property. Some obvious examples of views that have intrinsic content sizes are UIImageViews, UILabels, UIButtons.Content Hugging Priority - The higher this priority is, the more a view resists growing larger than its intrinsic content size.Content Compression Resistance Priority - The higher this priority is, the more a view resists shrinking smaller than its intrinsic content size.Check here for more explanation: AUTO LAYOUT MAGIC: CONTENT SIZING PRIORITIESThe Content hugging priority is like a Rubber band that is placed around a view. \nThe higher the priority value, the stronger the rubber band and the more it wants to hug to its content size.\nThe priority value can be imagined like the "strength" of the rubber bandAnd the Content Compression Resistance is, how much a view "resists" getting smaller \nThe View with higher resistance priority value is the one that will resist compression.
