I\'ve built a simple music player in Android. The view for each song contains a SeekBar, implemented like this: This works fine. Now I want a timer counting the seconds/minutes of the progress of the song. So I put a TextView in the layout, get it with findViewById() in onCreate(), and put this in run() after progress.setProgress(pos):But that last line gives me the exception:Yet I\'m doing basically the same thing here as I\'m doing with the SeekBar - creating the view in onCreate, then touching it in run() - and it doesn\'t give me this complaint. So is there an obvious mistake here? I\'m new to both Android and Java, so I won\'t be surprised if it\'s something dumb.You have to move the portion of the background task that updates the ui onto the main thread. There is a simple piece of code for this:Documentation for Activity.runOnUiThreadJust nest this inside the method that is running in the background, then copy paste the code that implements any updates in the middle of the block. Include only the smallest amount of code possible, otherwise you start to defeat the purpose of the background thread.I solved this by putting runOnUiThread( new Runnable(){ .. inside run():my solution to this:call this method on background threadUsually, any action involving the user interface must be done in the main or UI thread, that is the one in which onCreate() and event handling are executed. One way to be sure of that is using runOnUiThread(), another is using Handlers.ProgressBar.setProgress() has a mechanism for which it will always execute on the main thread, so that\'s why it worked.See Painless Threading.I\'ve been in this situation but I found a solution with the Handler Object.In my case, I want to update a ProgressDialog with an Observer Pattern.\nMy view implements Observer and override the update method.So, my main thread create the view and another thread call the update method that update the ProgressDialop and.... : It\'s possible to solve the problem with the Handler Object.Below, different parts of my code :This explanation can be found on this page, and you must read the "Example ProgressDialog with a second thread".I see that you have accepted @providence\'s answer. Just in case, you can also use the handler too! First, do the int fields.Next, make a handler instance as a field.Make a method.Finally, put this at onCreate() method.I had similar issue, and my solution is ugly but itUse this code, and no need to runOnUiThread function:I use Handler with Looper.getMainLooper() it worked fine for meThis is explicitly throwing an error. It says whichever thread created a view, only that can touch its views. It is because the created view is inside that thread\'s space. The view creation (GUI) happens in UI (Main) thread. So, you always use UI thread to access those methods. In above picture, progress variable is inside space of UI Thread. So, only UI thread can access this variable. Here, you accessing progress via new Thread(), that\'s why yo got error. This is the stack trace of mentioned exceptionSo if you go and dig then you come to knowWhere mThread is initialize in constructor like belowAll I mean to say that when we created particular view we created it on UI Thread and later try to modifying in a Worker Thread.We can verify it via below code snippetwhen we inflate layout and later where you are getting exception.If you do not want to use  runOnUiThread API, you can infact implement AsynTask for the operations that takes some seconds to complete.But in that case also after processing your work in doinBackground() you need to return the finished view in onPostExecute(). The android implementation allows only main UI thread to interact with views.ThanksFor me the issue was that I was calling onProgressUpdate() explicitly from my code. This shouldn\'t be done. I called publishProgress() instead and that resolved the error.In my case,\nI have EditText in Adaptor, and it\'s already in UI Thread\nhowever when this Activity Load, it\'s crash with this error.My solution is I need to remove <requestFocus /> out from EditText in xml
