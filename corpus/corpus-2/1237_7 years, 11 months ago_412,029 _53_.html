I\'d like to change the color of a standard Android button slightly in order to better match a client\'s branding.The best way I\'ve found to do this so far is to change the Button\'s drawable to the following drawable located in res/drawable/red_button.xml:But doing that requires that I actually create three different drawables for each button I want to customize (one for the button at rest, one when focused, and one when pressed).  That seems more complicated and non-DRY than I need.All I really want to do is apply some sort of color transform to the button.  Is there an easier way to go about changing a button\'s color than I\'m doing?I discovered that this can all be done in one file fairly easily.  Put something like the following code in a file named custom_button.xml and then set background="@drawable/custom_button" in your button view:Following on from Tomasz\'s answer, you can also programmatically set the shade of the entire button using the PorterDuff multiply mode. This will change the button colour rather than just the tint. If you start with a standard grey shaded button:will give you a red shaded button,will give you a green shaded button etc., where the first value is the colour in hex format.It works by multiplying the current button colour value by your colour value. I\'m sure there\'s also a lot more you can do with these modes.Mike, you might be interested in color filters.An example:try this to achieve the color you want.This is my solution which perfectly works starting from API 15. This solution keeps all default button click effects, like material RippleEffect. I have not tested it on lower APIs, but it should work.All you need to do, is:1) Create a style which changes only colorAccent:I recommend using ThemeOverlay.AppCompat or your main AppTheme as parent, to keep the rest of your styles.2) Add these two lines to your button widget:Sometimes your new colorAccent isn\'t showing in Android Studio Preview, but when you launch your app on the phone, the color will be changed.You can now also use appcompat-v7\'s AppCompatButton with the backgroundTint attribute:I like the color filter suggestion in previous answers from @conjugatedirection and @Tomasz; However, I found that the code provided so far wasn\'t as easily applied as I expected.First, it wasn\'t mentioned where to apply and clear the color filter. It\'s possible that there are other good places to do this, but what came to mind for me was an OnTouchListener.From my reading of the original question, the ideal solution would be one that does not involve any images.  The accepted answer using custom_button.xml from @emmby is probably a better fit than color filters if that\'s your goal.  In my case, I\'m starting with a png image from a UI designer of what the button is supposed to look like. If I set the button background to this image, the default highlight feedback is lost completely. This code replaces that behavior with a programmatic darkening effect.I extracted this as a separate class for application to multiple buttons - shown as anonymous inner class just to get the idea.If you are making colour buttons with XML you can make the code a bit cleaner by specifying the focused and pressed state in a separate file and reuse them. My green button looks like this:I am using this approachstyle.xml\nAs you can see from above, I\'m using a custom style for my button. The button color corresponds to the accent color. I find this a much better approach than setting android:background as I won\'t lose the ripple effect Google provides. There is a much easier way now : android-holo-colors.comIt will let you change the colors of all holo drawables (buttons, spinners, ...) easily. You select the color and then download a zip file containing drawables for all resolutions.Use it in this way:In  <Button> use android:background="#33b5e5". or better android:background="@color/navig_button"The shortest solution which is working with any Android version:Notes/Requirements: appcompat version > 24.2.0dependencies {\n    compile \'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:25.3.1\'\n}Explanation:\nThe DroidUX component library has a ColorButton widget whose color can be changed easily, both via xml definition and programmatically at run time, so you can even let the user to set the button\'s color/theme if your app allows it.You can Also use this online tool to customize your button http://angrytools.com/android/button/  and use android:background="@drawable/custom_btn" to define the customized button in your layout.An easy way is to just define a custom Button class which accepts all the properties that you desire like radius, gradient, pressed color, normal color etc. and then just use that in your XML layouts instead of setting up the background using XML. A sample is here This is extremely useful if you have a lot of buttons with same properties like radius, selected color etc. You can customize your inherited button to handle these additional properties.Result (No Background selector was used).Normal ButtonPressed ButtonYou can set theme of your button to thisThe way I do a different styled button that works quite well is to subclass the Button object and apply a colour filter. This also handles enabled and disabled states by applying an alpha to the button.values\\styles.xmlthen:
