What is the maximum length of a valid email address? Is it defined by any standard?[UPDATED] The correct answer of 254 has now been accepted by the IETF following the erratum I submitted here.You can get a full diagnosis of any given address here.The original version of RFC 3696 did indeed say 320 was the maximum length, but John Klensin subsequently accepted this was WRONG.The maximum length is specified in RFC 5321: "The maximum total length of a reverse-path or forward-path is 256 characters"RFC 3696 was corrected hereI note for the record that John Klensin may actually be wrong in his correction: a Path is defined asSo the Mailbox element (i.e. the email address) has angle brackets around it to form a Path, so the Mailbox must be no more than 254 characters to keep the path under 256.I\'ve now collated test cases from Cal Henderson, Dave Child, Phil Haack, Doug Lovell and RFC 3696. 158 test addresses in all.I ran all these tests against all the validators I could find. The comparison is here: http://www.dominicsayers.com/isemailI\'ll try to keep this page up-to-date as people enhance their validators. Thanks to Cal, Dave and Phil for their help and co-operation in compiling these tests and constructive criticism of my own validator.People should be aware of the errata against RFC 3696 in particular. Three of the canonical examples are in fact invalid addresses.320And the segments look like this{64}@{255}64 + 1 + 255 = 320You should also read this if you are validating emailshttp://haacked.com/archive/2007/08/21/i-knew-how-to-validate-an-email-address-until-i.aspxTo help the confused rookies like me, the answer to "What is the maximum length of a valid email address?" is 254 characters.If your application uses an email, just set your field to accept 254 characters or less and you are good to go. You can run a bunch of tests on an email to see if it is valid here. http://isemail.info/The RFC, or Request for Comments is a type of publication from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) that defines 254 characters as the limit. Located here - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321#section-4.5.3userThe maximum total length of a user name is 64 characters.domainMaximum of 255 characters in the domain part (the one after the \xe2\x80\x9c@\xe2\x80\x9d)However, there is a restriction in RFC 2821 reading: The maximum total length of a reverse-path or forward-path is 256\n  characters, including the punctuation and element separators\xe2\x80\x9d. Since\n  addresses that don\xe2\x80\x99t fit in those fields are not normally useful, the\n  upper limit on address lengths should normally be considered to be\n  256, but a path is defined as: Path = \xe2\x80\x9c<\xe2\x80\x9d [ A-d-l \xe2\x80\x9c:\xe2\x80\x9d ] Mailbox \xe2\x80\x9c>\xe2\x80\x9d\n  The forward-path will contain at least a pair of angle brackets in\n  addition to the Mailbox, which limits the email address to 254\n  characters.64 for the local part (the account/name) and 255 for the domain. I think the @ sign will be counted extra so that sums to 320.But caution: this is only the length of the real address. An address may contain a display name. Such an address looks like first last <local@domain> and will often extend 320.
