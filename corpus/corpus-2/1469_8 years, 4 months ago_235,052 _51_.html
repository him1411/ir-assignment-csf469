How do I test if an NSString is empty in Objective C?You can check if [string length] == 0. This will check if it\'s a valid but empty string (@"") as well as if it\'s nil, since calling length on nil will also return 0.Marc\'s answer is correct.  But I\'ll take this opportunity to include a pointer to Wil Shipley\'s generalized isEmpty, which he shared on his blog:The first approach is valid, but doesn\'t work if your string has blank spaces (@"          "). So you must clear this white spaces before testing it.This code clear all the blank spaces on both sides of the string:One good idea is create one macro, so you don\'t have to type this monster line:Now you can use:One of the best solution I ever seen (better than Matt G\'s one) is this improved inline function I picked up on some Git Hub repo (Wil Shipley\'s one, but I can\'t find the link) : You should better use this category:I put this:The problem is that if self is nil, this function is never called. It\'ll return false, which is desired.Just pass your string to following method:Another option is to check if it is equal to @"" with isEqualToString: like so:You have 2 methods to check whether the string is empty or not:Let\'s suppose your string name is NSString *strIsEmpty.Method 1: Method 2: Choose any of the above method and get to know whether string is empty or not.Just use one of the if else conditions as shown below:Method 1:Method 2:Even though this is an Objective C question, I needed to use NSString in Swift so I will also include an answer here.Or if NSString is an Optional:The normal Swift String version is See also: Check empty string in Swift?You can check either your string is empty or not my using this method:Best practice is to make a shared class say UtilityClass and ad this method so that you would be able to use this method by just calling it through out your application.Very useful post, to add NSDictionary support as well one small change May be this answer is the duplicate of already given answers, but i did few modification and changes in the order of checking the conditions. Please refer the below code:    Simply Check your string lengtha message to NIL will return nil or 0, so no need to test for nil :).Happy coding ...It is working as charm for meIf the NSString is sSo aside from the basic concept of checking for a string length less than 1, it is important to consider context deeply. \n Languages human or computer or otherwise might have different definitions of empty strings and within those same languages, additional context may further change the meaning. Let\'s say empty string means "a string which does not contain any characters significant in the current context". This could mean visually, as in color and background color are same in an attributed string. Effectively empty. This could mean empty of meaningful characters. All dots or all dashes or all underscores might be considered empty. \nFurther, empty of meaningful significant characters could mean a string that has no characters the reader understands. \nThey could be characters in a language or characterSet defined as meaningless to the reader. We could define it a little differently to say the string forms no known words in a given language. We could say empty is a function of the percentage of negative space in the glyphs rendered. Even a sequence of non printable characters with no general visual representation is not truly empty. Control characters come to mind. Especially the low ASCII range (I\'m surprised nobody mentioned those as they hose lots of systems and are not whitespace as they normally have no glyphs and no visual metrics). Yet the string length is not zero. Conclusion. \nLength alone is not the only measure here. \nContextual set membership is also pretty important. Character Set membership is a very important common additional measure. \nMeaningful sequences are also a fairly common one. ( think SETI or crypto or captchas )\nAdditional more abstract context sets also exist. So think carefully before assuming a string is only empty based on length or whitespace. The best way is to use the category.\nYou can check the following function. Which has all the conditions to check.The best way in any case is to check the length of the given string.For this if your string is myString then the code is:check this : OrHope this will help.You can easily check if string is empty with this:  I have checked an empty string using below code :Its as simple as if([myString isEqual:@""]) or if([myString isEqualToString:@""])
