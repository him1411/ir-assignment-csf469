We are new to git, and I want to set a tag at the beginning of our repository. \nOur production code is the same as the beginning repository, but we\'ve made commits since then.\nA tag at the beginning would allow us to "roll back" production to a known, stable state.So how to add a tag to an arbitrary, older commit?Example:Where 9fceb02 is the beginning part of the commit id.You can then push them up using git push --tags origin masterYou can do git log to show all the commit id\'s in your current branch.There is also a good chapter on tagging in the Pro Git book.The answer by @dkinzer creates tags whose date is the current date (when you ran the git tag command), not the date of the commit. The Git help for tag has a section "On Backdating Tags" which says:If you have imported some changes from another VCS and would like to add tags for major releases of your work, it is useful to be able to specify the date to embed inside of the tag object; such data in the tag object affects, for example, the ordering of tags in the gitweb interface.To set the date used in future tag objects, set the environment variable GIT_COMMITTER_DATE (see the later discussion of possible values; the most common form is "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM").For example:The page "How to Tag in Git" shows us that we can extract the time of the HEAD commit via:We could extract the date of a specific commit via:However, instead of repeating the commit twice, it seems easier to just change the HEAD to that commit and use it implicitly in both commands:The simplest way to do this isgit tag v1.0.0 f4ba1fcwith f4ba1fc being the beginning of the hash of the commit you want to tag and v1.0.0 being the version you want to tag.Use command:Where v1.0 is the tag name and ec32d32 is the commit you want to tagOnce done you can push the tags by:Reference:Git (revision control): How can I tag a specific previous commit point in GitHub?This is an old question, and the answers already given all work, but there\'s also a new option which can be considered.If you\'re using SourceTree to manage your git repositories, you can right-click on any commit and add a tag to it. With another mouseclick you can also send the tag straight to the branch on origin.OK, You can simply do:So if you want to add tag: 1.0.2 to commit 8ecdb02, just simply do:Also you add a message at the end, using -m, something like this:After all, you need to push it to the remote, to do that, simply do:If you have many tags which you don\'t want to mention them one by one, just simply do:to push all tags together...Also, I created the steps in the image below, for more clarification of the steps:\n\nYou can also dd the tag in Hub or using tools like SourceTree, to avoid the previous steps, I logged-in to my Bitbucket in this case and doing it from there:
