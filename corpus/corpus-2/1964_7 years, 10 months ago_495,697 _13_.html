This question already has an answer here:I have some code:How can i escape from the "each" code block based on a condition?What if we have something like this:Is it possible to break out from both "each" functions from the inner "each" function?# 19.03.2013If you want to continue instead of break outAccording to the documentation you can simply return false; to break:Return false from the anonymous function:From the documentation of the each method:Returning \'false\' from within the each\n  function completely stops the loop\n  through all of the elements (this is\n  like using a \'break\' with a normal\n  loop). Returning \'true\' from within\n  the loop skips to the next iteration\n  (this is like using a \'continue\' with\n  a normal loop).You can use return false;see  similar question asked 3 days ago.
