Is there a way in jQuery to loop through or assign to an array all of the classes that are assigned to an element?ex.I will be looking for a "special" class as in "dolor_spec" above.  I know that I could use hasClass() but the actual class name may not necessarily be known at the time.You can use document.getElementById(\'divId\').className.split(/\\s+/); to get you an array of class names.Then you can iterate and find the one you want.jQuery does not really help you here...Why has no one simply listed.Here is a jQuery plugin which will return an array of all the classes the matched element(s) haveUse it likeIn your case returns You can also pass a function to the method to be called on each classHere is a jsFiddle I set up to demonstrate and test http://jsfiddle.net/GD8Qn/8/On supporting browsers, you can use DOM elements\' classList property.It is an array-like object listing all of the classes the element has.If you need to support old browser versions that don\'t support the classList property, the linked MDN page also includes a shim for it - although even the shim won\'t work on Internet Explorer versions below IE 8.You should try this one:It returns an array of all current classes of the element.With all the given answers, you should never forget to user .trim() (or $.trim())Because classes gets added and removed, it can happen that there are multiple spaces between class string.. e.g. \'class1 class2         class3\'.. This would turn into [\'class1\', \'class2\',\'\',\'\',\'\', \'class3\']..When you use trim, all multiple spaces get removed.. Might this can help you too. I have used this function to get classes of childern element..In your case you want doler_ipsum class u can do like this now calsses[2];.Thanks for this - I was having a similar issue, as I\'m trying to programatically relate objects will hierarchical class names, even though those names might not necessarily be known to my script.In my script, I want an <a> tag to turn help text on/off by giving the <a> tag [some_class] plus the class of toggle, and then giving it\'s help text the class of [some_class]_toggle. This code is successfully finding the related elements using jQuery: Try This. This will get you the names of all the classes from all the elements of document.});Here is the working example: https://jsfiddle.net/raju_sumit/2xu1ujoy/3/javascript provides a classList attribute for a node element in dom. Simply using will return a object of formThe object has functions like contains, add, remove which you can useI had a similar issue, for an element of type image. I needed to check whether the element was of a certain class. First I tried with:but I got a nice "this function is not available for this element".Then I inspected my element on the DOM explorer and I saw a very nice attribute that I could use: className. It contained the names of all the classes of my element separated by blank spaces.Once you get this, just split the string as usual.In my case this worked: I am assuming this would work with other kinds of elements (besides img).Hope it helps.The question is what Jquery is designed to do.  And why has no one given .find() as an answer?There is also classList for non-IE browsers: A bit late, but using the extend() function lets you call "hasClass()" on any element, e.g.:\nvar hasClass = $(\'#divId\').hasClass(\'someClass\');Here you go, just tweaked readsquare\'s answer to return an array of all classes:Pass a jQuery element to the function, so that a sample call will be:I know this is an old question but still.If you want to manipulate elementIf you want to check if element has classif multiple classes
