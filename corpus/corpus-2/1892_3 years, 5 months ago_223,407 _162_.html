Searching the web, it is not clear if Java 8 is supported for Android development or not.Before I download/setup Java 8, can some one point me at any "official" documentation that says Java 8 is or is not supported for Android development.Android supports all Java 7 language features and a subset of Java 8 language features that vary by platform version.To check which features of java 8 are supported Use Java 8 language featuresWe\'ve decided to add support for Java 8 language features directly into the current javac and dx set of tools, and deprecate the Jack toolchain. With this new direction, existing tools and plugins dependent on the Java class file format should continue to work. Moving forward, Java 8 language features will be natively supported by the Android build system. We\'re aiming to launch this as part of Android Studio in the coming weeks, and we wanted to share this decision early with you. Future of Java 8 Language Feature Support on AndroidFor old developers who prefer Eclipse, google stops support Eclipse Android Developer toolsif you installed Java 8 JDK, then give it a try, if any problems appears try to set the compiler as 1.6 in Eclipse from window menu \xe2\x86\x92 Preferences \xe2\x86\x92 Java \xe2\x86\x92 Compiler.\nJava 7 will works too:Java 7 or higher is required if you are targeting Android 5.0 and\n  higher.install multiple JDK and try.Android does not support Java 8. It only supports up to Java 7 (if you have kitkat) and still it doesn\'t have invokedynamic, only the new syntax sugar.If you want to use lambdas, one of the major features of Java 8 in Android, you can use gradle-retrolamba. It\'s a gradle build dependency that integrates retrolambda, a tool that converts Java 8 bytecode back to Java 6/7. Basically, if you set the compiler in Android Studio to compile Java 8 bytecode, thus allowing lambdas, it\'ll convert it back to Java 6/7 bytecode which then in turn gets converted to dalvik bytecode. It\'s a hack for if you want to try out some JDK 8 features in Android in lieu of official support.You can indeed use gradle-retrolamba gradle build dependency to use Java 8 for Android Development.Below is the complete guide that I have recently followed to run lambda expressions for Android development. The original source of this guide is mentioned at the end.In this guide, a method for bringing some Java 8 features into\n  Android Development Tools will be demonstrated, specifically aiming at\n  Eclipse IDE. However, steps which will be described throughout this guide might also be adapted to Google\xe2\x80\x99s new uprising development\n  environment, Android Studio. It is based on the community edition of\n  popular IntelliJ Idea IDE by JetBrains and it has recently been\n  upgraded to its \xe2\x80\x98beta\xe2\x80\x99 version by Google in early July 2014, slightly\n  before this guide was written. Eclipse will remain as the prominent\n  development environment, at least for a while, and considering the\n  fact that most Android projects have been developed using Eclipse, a\n  method for bringing new Java 8 features like lambda expressions into\n  ADT seems to be quite useful for developers.Android Development is based on a custom Java implementation called\n  Apache Harmony Project which was terminated back in 2011. The most\n  commonly used Java syntax in Android Development is Java 6 (v1.6) and\n  Java 7 (v1.7) is also partially supported on the KitKat edition\n  (Android 4.4.+). Therefore, Java 8 features like lambda expressions\n  cannot be used directly in the Android App Development without\n  applying some tweaks into the development tools. Luckily, these\n  constructs are basically some \xe2\x80\x98syntactic sugar\xe2\x80\x99 enhancements which\n  give developers the shortcomings of things like \xe2\x80\x98anonymous classes\xe2\x80\x99\n  and they can be translated into Java 6 or Java 7 classes.A recent approach for translating a Java 8 source code into lower Java\n  versions is called RetroLambda. This library makes developers run\n  Java 8 code with lambda expressions on Java 7 or even lower.\n  Unfortunately, Java 8 features other than lambda expressions are not\n  supported by RetroLambda for now but the concept of lambda expressions\n  is the biggest leap on Java 8 platform and it\xe2\x80\x99s a great tool for\n  Android developers anyway. Details about this library can be found on its GitHub page:https://github.com/orfjackal/retrolambda#getting-startedAlso, a Gradle plugin for RetroLambda created by another developer\n  allows Gradle-based builds to be implemented in Java or Android\n  Projects. However, the developer only mentions about integrating this\n  plugin into Android Studio environment. Details can be found on its\n  GitHub page:https://github.com/evant/gradle-retrolambdaUsing these infrastructures within an Eclipse-based development\n  environment cannot be approached directly but it\xe2\x80\x99s doable and will be\n  demonstrated throughout this guide.This guide assumes that the reader has a basic understanding of Android Development and it is based on ADT version 22.6.2 because recent ADT version 23.0.2 seems to have problems like layout folder creation. Details about this issue can be found under the following link:http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=72591Steps in this guide will be given for a Windows 8.1, 64-bit development machine but they can easily be adapted to other platforms. The new build system Gradle will be used for build/clean processes and its installation procedure will also be provided. Also, both JDK 8 and JDK 7 must coexist on the development machine. Steps given below must be followed to install them:Now, ADT-22.6.2 must be downloaded from the following link:http://dl.google.com/android/adt/22.6.2/adt-bundle-windows-x86_64-20140321.zipIf everything goes well, ADT will be up and running.The installation of the following tools is also highly recommended:Eclipse Kepler Java 8 Support: It makes Eclipse recognize new Java 8 syntax extensions and makes you get rid of annoying red dots in your Java code editor. It might be installed through Help -> Install New Software in Eclipse. Enter http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/4.3-P-builds/ into the Work with field and continue to install it.Nodeclipse/Enide Gradle: It is mainly used to highlight Groovy language keywords. Groovy is used as the DSL for Gradle build scripts. This plugin can be installed through Eclipse Marketplace. However, Eclipse within ADT-22.6.2 does not come along with Eclipse Marketplace Client. Therefore, you will first need to install Eclipse Marketplace Client by means of Install New Software tool in Eclipse. Enter http//:download.eclipse.org/mpc/kepler/ into the Work with field and continue to install it. After installing Eclipse Marketplace Client, you may search for Nodeclipse/Enide Gradle in the Eclipse Marketplace Client and install it.Genymotion Virtual Device: It is a great replacement of the default Android Virtual Device which comes along with ADT. AVD is annoyingly cumbersome and it keeps on crashing for no reason. Genymotion makes you prepare Android VD\'s using CyanogenMod images which are executed by Oracle VirtualBox. Its single user license is for free and it can be downloaded from http://www.genymotion.com. Only a login is required and it can also be integrated into Eclipse. Details can be found under:https://cloud.genymotion.com/page/doc/#collapse8Below is a screenshot of an Android 4.3 based CyanogenMod virtual device,It might be considered as a fully-fledge Android device running on a x86 or x64 based personal computer. In order to use Google services like Google PlayStore on this virtual device, a gapps image for the Android version that it uses must be flashed onto the device. A proper gapps image for the device might be downloaded from CyanogenMod website:http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Google_AppsGradle installation is optional since it is also provided by Android SDK itself but its separate installation is highly recommended. Installation of it might be conducted by following these steps:Go to Gradle web site: http://www.gradle.org/Click DownloadsA simple app will be created to demonstrate the usage of the tools which were described in the previous section. \nYou may simply follow the steps given below to get an insight on using lambda expressions in Android Developer Tools:Create following batch files under the builders folder:Fill in these batch files as follows:gradle_build.cmd:gradle_post_build.cmd:gradle_clean.cmd:Main Tab of the new Builder ConfigurationRefresh Tab of the new Builder ConfigurationEnvironment Tab of the new Builder ConfigurationBuild Options Tab of the new Builder ConfigurationNew Builders of the HelloLambda ProjectClean Project WindowBuild Process\nRight-click on the project and go to Properties -> Java Build Path. Add the following folders to the build path (also shown in below image):Eclipse will now be able to recognize R.java and buildConfig.java files and it will not display any red dots which denote errors related to the resource files of the project.You may observe in the LogCat window that the code snippet with a simple lambda expression works properlySource: Using Java 8 Lambda Expressions in Android Developer ToolsFollow this link for new updates. Use Java 8 language featuresOld AnswerAs of Android N preview release Android support limited features of Java 8 see Java 8 Language FeaturesTo start using these features, you need to download and set up Android\n  Studio 2.1  and the Android N Preview SDK, which includes the\n  required Jack toolchain and updated Android Plugin for Gradle. If you\n  haven\'t yet installed the Android N Preview SDK, see Set Up to Develop\n  for Android N.Supported Java 8 Language Features and APIsAndroid does not currently support all Java 8 language features.\n  However, the following features are now available when developing apps\n  targeting the Android N Preview:Default and static interface methodsLambda expressions (also available on API level 23 and lower)Repeatable annotationsMethod References (also available on API level 23 and lower)There are some additional Java 8 features which Android support, you can see complete detail from Java 8 Language FeaturesUpdateNote: The Android N bases its implementation of lambda expressions on\n  anonymous classes. This approach allows them to be backwards\n  compatible and executable on earlier versions of Android. To test\n  lambda expressions on earlier versions, remember to go to your\n  build.gradle file, and set compileSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion to\n  23 or lower.Android uses a Java that branches off of Java 6.As of Android SDK version 19, you can use Java 7 features by doing this.  No full support for Java 8 (yet).Android OFFICIALLY supports Java 8 as of Android N. Feature announcements are here, the Java 8 language announcement is:Improved Java 8 language support - We\xe2\x80\x99re excited to bring Java 8 language features to Android. With Android\'s Jack compiler, you can\n  now use many popular Java 8 language features, including lambdas and\n  more, on Android versions as far back as Gingerbread. The new features\n  help reduce boilerplate code. For example, lambdas can replace\n  anonymous inner classes when providing event listeners. Some Java 8\n  language features --like default and static methods, streams, and\n  functional interfaces -- are also now available on N and above. With\n  Jack, we\xe2\x80\x99re looking forward to tracking the Java language more closely\n  while maintaining backward compatibility.Now it is possible But you will need to have your device rom run on java 1.8  and enable "jackOptions" to run it. \nJack is the name for the new Android compiler that runs Java 8https://developer.android.com/guide/platform/j8-jack.htmladd these lines to build_gradle Java 8 seem to be the running java engine of Android studio 2.0, \nBut it still does not accept the syntax of java 8 after I checked, and you cannot chose a compiler from android studio now. However, you can use the scala plugin if you need functional programming mechanism in your android client.

Finally!Starting with Android Studio 2.4 Preview 4 and android gradle plugin version 2.4.0-alpha4, Java 8 language features are now natively supported by android:Also from min API level 24 the following Java 8 API are available:Add the following to your project\xe2\x80\x99s main build.gradle:Add these lines to your application module\xe2\x80\x99s build.gradle to inform the project of the language level:You\xe2\x80\x99re done! You can now use native java8!OLD ANSWER : To start using Java 8 Language  you need to download and set up Android Studio 2.1 (preview) and the Android N Preview SDK, which includes the required Jack toolchain and updated Android Plugin for Gradle.Using the new Java 8 language features is not a requirement for developing apps that target the Android N platform. If you don\'t want to write code with Java 8 language features, you can keep your project\'s source and target compatibility values set to Java 7, but you still must compile with JDK 8 to build against the Android N platform.Android does not currently support all Java 8 language features.Known Issues:\nInstant Run, introduced in Android Studio 2.0 (Beta), does not currently work with Jack and will be disabled while using the new toolchain.Android Studio 3.0 started to provide built-in support for some of Java 8 language features, which are:Also starting from API level 24 the following Java 8 API are available:Besides that, the try-with-resources support was extended to all Android API levels.More Java 8 features are promised to be added in the future.To start using supported Java 8 language features, update the Android\n  plugin to 3.0.0-alpha1 (or higher) and add the following to your\n  module\xe2\x80\x99s build.gradle file:For more details visit:\nhttps://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support.htmlWhen I asked this question almost 2 years ago the answer really was \xe2\x80\x9cofficially\xe2\x80\x9d no,  but as pointed out by ekcr1\'s answer you can get one of the most highly anticipated features (lambdas) to work if you  use retrolamba.  At the time I was still using eclipse, as Android Studio was in \xe2\x80\x9cpreview\xe2\x80\x9d mode,  so I never did pursue this path.Today, I think the \xe2\x80\x9cofficial\xe2\x80\x9d answer is still no,  and while retrolamba still seems like a good way to go, there is another option for those willing to go down a somewhat \xe2\x80\x9cunofficial\xe2\x80\x9d  route can take, namely Kotlin.Today Kotlin reached 1.0.0.

Here is an extract from the Android Developers blogspot post:... Android Studio 2.1 release includes support for the new Jack compiler and support for Java 8. ...To use Java 8 language features when developing with the N Developer Preview, you need to use the Jack compiler. The New Project Wizard [File\xe2\x86\x92 New\xe2\x86\x92 Project] generates the correct configurations for projects targeting the N.Android does not support Java 1.8 yet (it only supports up to 1.7), so you cannot use Java 8 features like lambdas.This answer gives more detail on Android Studio\'s compatibility; it states:If you want to use lambdas, one of the major features of Java 8 in Android, you can use gradle-retrolambaIf you want to know more about using gradle-retrolambda, this answer gives a lot of detail on doing that.I figured I would post an updated answer for those looking at for something a little more current. Currently Android and Android Studio are supporting a subset of Java 8 features. According to the Android documentation located on their website, Google says: Support for Java 8 language features requires a new compiler called Jack. Jack is supported only on Android Studio 2.1 and higher. So if you want to use Java 8 language features, you need to use Android Studio 2.1 to build your app.If you already have Android Studio installed, make sure you update to the latest version by clicking Help > Check for Update (on Mac, Android Studio > Check for Updates). If you don\'t already have the IDE installed on your workstation, download Android Studio here.Supported Java 8 Language Features and APIsAndroid does not support all Java 8 language features. However, the following features are available when developing apps targeting Android 7.0 (API level 24):Additionally, the following Java 8 language APIs are also available:Reflection and language-related APIs:Utility APIs:In order to use the new Java 8 language features, you need to also use the Jack toolchain. This new Android toolchain compiles Java language sources into Android-readable DEX bytecode, has its own .jack library format, and provides most toolchain features as part of a single tool: repackaging, shrinking, obfuscation and multidex.Here is a comparison of the two toolchains used to build Android DEX files:I asked this question over 3 years ago and obviously the answers have changed over the years.  As many above have already answered, as of sometime back, the answer became Yes.   I have never updated the accepted answer because it was the correct answer at the time. (I am not sure what the Stack Overflow policy is on that)I just wanted to add another answer for those who still search for this topic. As of  5/17/2017 Google also announced that Kotlin is also an official language for Android development.I have not found an official press release, but I did watch some of the Google I/O videos where it was announced.  Here is a link to a blog post by the Kotlin team on the announcement. Adding the following fixed the problem for me (Android studio 2.3.2):build.gradle (Project)build.gradle (Module: app)
