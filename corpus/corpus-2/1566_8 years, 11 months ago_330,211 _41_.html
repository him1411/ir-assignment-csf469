As I understand it, .bat is the old 16-bit naming convention, and .cmd is for 32-bit Windows, i.e., starting with NT. But I continue to see .bat files everywhere, and they seem to work exactly the same using either suffix. Assuming that my code will never need to run on anything older than NT, does it really matter which way I name my batch files, or is there some gotcha awaiting me by using the wrong suffix?From Wikipedia:New Quote from WikipediaThe only known difference between .cmd\n  and .bat file execution is that in a\n  .cmd file the ERRORLEVEL variable\n  changes even on a successful command\n  that is affected by Command Extensions\n  (when Command Extensions are enabled),\n  whereas in .bat files the ERRORLEVEL\n  variable changes only upon errors.The source for the Wikipedia quote above is actually based on this news group posting.The differences between .CMD and .BAT as far as CMD.EXE is concerned\n  are:  With extensions enabled, PATH/APPEND/PROMPT/SET/ASSOC in .CMD \n  files will set ERRORLEVEL regardless of error. .BAT sets ERRORLEVEL \n  only on errors.Not only is it a little more restrictive concerning the differences, than the Wikipedia text, but is also worth being explicitly mentioned, given the fact it was posted by Mark Zbikowski himself - which gives a huge credibility bonus IMHO.Here is a compilation of verified information from the various answers and cited references in this thread:Here is a list of cmd.exe features that are not supported by command.com:Order of Execution:If both .bat and .cmd versions of a script (test.bat, test.cmd) are in the same folder and you run the script without the extension (test), by default the .bat version of the script will run, even on 64-bit Windows 7. The order of execution is controlled by the PATHEXT environment variable. See Order in which Command Prompt executes files for more details.References:wikipedia: Comparison of command shellsThese answers are a bit too long and focused on interactive use.  The important differences are:Edit: Command Extensions are on by default in both .bat and .cmd files under Windows 2000 or later.In 2012 and beyond, I recommend using .cmd exclusively.No - it doesn\'t matter in the slightest.  On NT the .bat and .cmd extension both cause the cmd.exe processor to process the file in exactly the same way.Additional interesting information about command.com vs. cmd.exe on WinNT-class systems from MS TechNet (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc723564.aspx):This behavior reveals a quite subtle\n  feature of Windows NT that is very\n  important. The 16-bit MS-DOS shell\n  (COMMAND.COM) that ships with Windows\n  NT is specially designed for Windows\n  NT. When a command is entered for\n  execution by this shell, it does not\n  actually execute it. Instead, it\n  packages the command text and sends it\n  to a 32-bit CMD.EXE command shell for\n  execution. Because all commands are\n  actually executed by CMD.EXE (the\n  Windows NT command shell), the 16-bit\n  shell inherits all the features and\n  facilities of the full Windows NT\n  shell.RE: Apparently when command.com is invoked is a bit of a complex mystery;Several months ago, during the course of a project, we had to figure out why some programs that we wanted to run under CMD.EXE were, in fact, running under COMMAND.COM. The "program" in question was a very old .BAT file, that still runs daily.We discovered that the reason the batch file ran under COMMAND.COM is that it was being started from a .PIF file (also ancient). Since the special memory configuration settings available only through a PIF have become irrelevant, we replaced it with a conventional desktop shortcut.The same batch file, launched from the shortcut, runs in CMD.EXE. When you think about it, this makes sense. The reason that it took us so long to figure it out was partially due to the fact that we had forgotten that its item in the startup group was a PIF, because it had been in production since 1998.Since the original post was regarding the consequences of using the .bat or .cmd suffix, not necessarily the commands inside the file...One other difference between .bat and .cmd is that if two files exist with the same file name and both those extensions, then:entering filename or filename.bat at the command line will run the .bat fileto run the .cmd file, you have to enter filename.cmdStill, on Windows 7, BAT files have also this difference : If you ever create files TEST.BAT and TEST.CMD in the same directory, and you run TEST in that directory, it\'ll run the BAT file.everything working in a batch should work in a cmd; cmd provides some extensions for controlling the environment.\nalso, cmd is executed by in new cmd interpreter and thus should be faster (not noticeable on short files) and stabler as bat runs under the NTVDM emulated 16bit environmentThe extension makes no difference.  There are slight differences between COMMAND.COM handling the file vs. CMD.EXE I believe if you change the value of the ComSpec environment variable to %SystemRoot%system32\\cmd.exe then it doesn\'t matter if the file extension is .BAT or .CMD. I\'m not sure, but this may even be the default for WinXP and above.Slightly off topic, but have you considered Windows Scripting Host? You might find it nicer..cmd and .bat file execution is different because in a .cmd errorlevel variable it can change on a command that is affected by command extensions. That\'s about it really.Here is one difference I discovered: EnableDelayedExpansion is required in .cmd files.\nWhere as in case of .bat files it is implicit by default. (Windows 10)This works in .bat but is always found in case of a .cmd file.\nChanging line 2 to the following makes it work as expected:And finally for the .cmd file this works correctly:As being a Cmd programmer, and looking all over the web, it really doesn\'t matter which one you use, you can have a .bat program on a Windows 7, and run it on a Windows 10.  but if you are to make it on a Windows 10, you probably won\'t be able to run all the commands on a Windows 7.  A .cmd is the exact same way, and runs the exact same program and codes.All the difference is, is that its a different name of the same program, as long as it is connected to CMD.EXE, it runs the same commands.a difference:.cmd files are loaded into memory before being executed.  .bat files execute a line, read the next line, execute that line... you can come across this when you execute a script file and then edit it before it\'s done executing.  bat files will be messed up by this, but cmd files won\'t.
