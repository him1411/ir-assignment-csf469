How do I convert an array to a list in Java?I used the Arrays.asList() but the behavior (and signature) somehow changed from Java SE 1.4.2 (docs now in archive) to 8 and most snippets I found on the web use the 1.4.2 behaviour.For example:In many cases it should be easy to detect, but sometimes it can slip unnoticed:In your example, it is because you can\'t have a List of a primitive type. In other words, List<int> is not possible. You can, however, have a List<Integer>.That works as expected.The problem is that varargs got introduced in Java5 and unfortunately, Arrays.asList() got overloaded with a vararg version too. So Arrays.asList(spam) is understood by the Java5 compiler as a vararg parameter of int arrays.This problem is explained in more details in Effective Java 2nd Ed., Chapter 7, Item 42.Speaking about conversion way, it depends on why do you need your List.\nIf you need it just to read data. OK, here you go:But then if you do something like this:you get java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException.\nSo for some cases you even need this:First approach actually does not convert array but \'represents\' it like a List. But array is under the hood with all its properties like immutability. Please note you need to specify type when constructing ArrayList.In Java 8, you can use streams:It seems little late but here are my two cents. We cannot have List<int> as int is a primitive type so we can only have List<Integer>. Consider the case we have an array of ints and using Java 8:In case of Integer array we can use:When we use Arrays.asList the size of the returned list is fixed because the list returned is not java.util.ArrayList, but a private static class defined inside java.util.Arrays. So if we add or remove elements from the returned list, an UnsupportedOperationException will be thrown. So we should go with list22 when we want to modify the list. If we have Java8 then we can also go with list23.I recently had to convert an array to a List.  Later on the program filtered the list attempting to remove the data.  When you use the Arrays.asList(array) function, you create a fixed size collection:  you can neither add nor delete.  This entry explains the problem better than I can: Why do I get an UnsupportedOperationException when trying to remove an element from a List?.In the end, I had to do a "manual" conversion:I suppose I could have added conversion from an array to a list using an List.addAll(items) operation. Even shorter: you have to cast in to arrayOne-liner:If you are targeting Java 8 (or later), you can try this:NOTE:Pay attention to the Collectors.<Integer>toList(), this generic method helps you to avoid the error "Type mismatch: cannot convert from List to List".This is the simplest way to convert an array to List. However, if you try to add a new element or remove an existing element from the list, an UnsupportedOperationException will be thrown.You can use a for loop to add all the elements of the array into a List implementation, e.g. ArrayList:You can turn the array into a stream, then collect the stream using different collectors: The default collector in Java 8 use ArrayList behind the screen, but you can also impose your preferred implementation.See also:Another workaround if you use apache commons-lang:Where ArrayUtils.toObject converts int[] to Integer[]So it depends on which Java version you are trying-OROR Reference - http://www.codingeek.com/java/how-to-convert-array-to-list-in-java/If this helps: I\'ve had the same problem and simply wrote a generic function that takes an array and returns an ArrayList of the same type with the same contents:use two line of code to convert array to list if you use it in integer value\nyou must use autoboxing type for primitive data type
