What are the uses for **kwargs in Python?I know you can do an objects.filter on a table and pass in a **kwargs argument. Â Can I also do this for specifying time deltas i.e. timedelta(hours = time1)? How exactly does it work? Is it classes as \'unpacking\'? Like a,b=1,2?You can use **kwargs to let your functions take an arbitrary number of keyword arguments ("kwargs" means "keyword arguments"):You can also use the **kwargs syntax when calling functions by constructing a dictionary of keyword arguments and passing it to your function:The Python Tutorial contains a good explanation of how it works, along with some nice examples.** unpacks dictionaries.Thisis the same asIt\'s useful if you have to construct parameters:This lets you use the function like this:kwargs is just a dictionary that is added to the parameters.A dictionary can contain key, value pairs. And that are the kwargs. Ok, this is how.The whatfor is not so simple.For example (very hypothetical) you have an interface that just calls other routines to do the job:Now you get a new method "drive":But wait a minute, there is a new parameter "vehicle" -- you did not know it before. Now you must add it to the signature of the myDo-function.Here you can throw kwargs into play -- you just add kwargs to the signature:This way you don\'t need to change the signature of your interface function every time some of your called routines might change.This is just one nice example you could find kwargs helpful.On the basis that a good sample is sometimes better than a long discourse I will write two functions using all python variable argument passing facilities (both positional and named arguments). You should easily be able to see what it does by yourself:And here is the output:Motif: *args and **kwargs serves as a placeholder for the arguments that need to be passed to a function callusing *args and **kwargs to call a function  Now we\'ll use *args to call the above defined function  arg1: two\narg2: 3\narg3: 5Now, using **kwargs to call the same functionarg1: 5\narg2: two\narg3: 3  Bottomline : *args has no intelligence, it simply interpolates the passed args to the parameters(in left-to-right order) while **kwargs behaves intelligently by placing the appropriate value @ the required placeSo being said that let me explain "named arguments" first and then "arbitrary number of named arguments" kwargs.Named argumentsExampleArbitrary number of named arguments kwargsExamplePassing tuple and dict variables for custom argsTo finish it up, let me also note that we can pass Thus the same above call can be made as follows:Finally note * and ** in function calls above. If we omit them, we may get ill results.Omitting * in tuple args:prints Above tuple (\'custom param1\', \'custom param2\', \'custom param3\') is printed as is. Omitting dict args:gives As an addition, you can also mix different ways of usage when calling kwargs functions:gives this output:Note that **kwargs has to be the last argumentHere\'s a simple function that serves to explain the usage:Any arguments that are not specified in the function definition will be put in the args list, or the kwargs list, depending on whether they are keyword arguments or not:If you add a keyword argument that never gets passed to a function, an error will be raised:kwargs are a syntactic sugar to pass name arguments as dictionaries(for func), or dictionaries as named arguments(to func)Here is an example that I hope is helpful:When you run the program, you get:The key take away here is that the variable number of named arguments in the call translate into a dictionary in the function.
