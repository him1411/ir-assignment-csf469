I\'m working on a C# class library that needs to be able to read settings from the web.config or app.config file (depending on whether the DLL is referenced from an ASP.NET web application or a Windows Forms application).I\'ve found thatworks, but that code has been marked as deprecated by Microsoft.  I\'ve read that I should be using: However, the System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager class doesn\'t seem to be available from a C# Class Library project.Does anyone know what the best way to do this is?You\'ll need to add a reference to System.Configuration in your project\'s references folder.  You should definitely be using the ConfigurationManager over the obsolete ConfigurationSettings.For Sample App.config like below:You read the above app settings using code shown below:You may also need to also add a reference to System.Configuration in your project if there isn\'t one already. You can then access the values like so:Hope this helps!Update for framework 4.5 and 4.6; the following will no longer work:Now access the Setting class via Properties:See Managing Application Settings for more information.Right click on your class Library, and choose the "Add References" option from the Menu; and finally from the .NET tab, select System.Configuration. This would include System.Configuration dll into your project. Im using this and it works well for meYou must add to the project a reference to the System.Configuration assembly.You might be adding the App.config file to a DLL. App.Config works only for executable projects, since all the dll take the configuration from the configuration file for the exe being executed.Let\'s say you have two projects in your solution:Your problem might be releated to the fact that you\'re including the app.config to SomeDLL and not SomeExe. SomeDll is able to read the configuration from the SomeExe project.Try this:In web.config should be next structure:I had the same problem, just read them this way:I strongly recommend you to create a Wrapper for this call. Something like a ConfigurationReaderService and use dependency injection to get this class. This way you will be able to isolate this configuration files for test purposes. So use the ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["something"]; suggested and return this value. You can with this method create some kind of default return if there is no key available in .config file.Read From Config : You\'ll need to add a reference to ConfigGet Value with using following code :     string value = Properties.Settings.Default.keyname;Save to Config :  Also, you can use formo:  Config:  Code:As i found best approach to access app settings variables in systematic way  by making a wrapper class over System.Configuration as belowNow we can access needed settings variables by hard coded names using another class as below web.config is used with web applications.web.config will by default have several configurations required for the web application. You can have a web.config for each folder under your web application.app.config is used for windows applications. When you build the application in vs.net, it will be automatically renamed to <appname>.exe.config and this file has to be delivered along with your application.You can use the same method to call the app settings values from both config files :I have been trying to find a fix for this same issue for a couple days now. I was able to resolve this by adding a key within the appsettings tag in the web.config. This should override the .dll when using the helper.I always create an IConfig interface with typesafe properties declared for all configuration values. A Config implementation class then wrappers the calls to System.Configuration.  All your System.Configuration calls are now in one place so much easier and cleaner to maintain and track which fields are being used and declare their default values.  I write a set of private helper methods to read and parse common data types.Using an IoC framework you can access the IConfig fields anywhere your in app by simply passing the interface to a class constructor. You\'re also then able to create mock implementations of the IConfig interface in your unit tests so you can now test various configuration values and value combinations without needing to touch your App.config or Web.config file.Just for completeness, there\'s another option available for web projects only:The benefit of this is that it doesn\'t require an extra reference to be added so may be preferable for some people.Another possible solution:for ex:
