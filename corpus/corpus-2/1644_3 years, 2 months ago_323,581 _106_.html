This is an example of how it could have been done previously in the ListView class, using the divider and dividerHeight parameters:However, I don\'t see such possibility in the RecyclerView class.In that case, is it ok to define margins and/or add a custom divider view directly into a list item\'s layout or is there a better way to achieve my goal?October 2016 UpdateThe version 25.0.0 of Android Support Library introduced DividerItemDecoration class:DividerItemDecoration is a RecyclerView.ItemDecoration that can be used as a divider between items of a LinearLayoutManager. It supports both HORIZONTAL and VERTICAL orientations.Usage:Previous answerSome answers either use methods that have since become deprecated, or don\'t give a complete solution, so I tried to do a short, up-to-date wrap-up.Unlike ListView, the RecyclerView class has no divider-related parameters. Instead, you need to extend ItemDecoration, a RecyclerView\'s inner class:An ItemDecoration allows the application to add a special drawing and layout offset to specific item views from the adapter\'s data set. This can be useful for drawing dividers between items, highlights, visual grouping boundaries and more.All ItemDecorations are drawn in the order they were added, before the item views (in onDraw()) and after the items (in onDrawOver(Canvas, RecyclerView, RecyclerView.State).Extend ItemDecoration, add custom constructor which takes space height as a parameter and override getItemOffsets() method:If you don\'t want to insert space below the last item, add the following condition:Note: you can also modify outRect.top, outRect.left and outRect.right properties for desired effect.Extend ItemDecoration and override onDraw() method:You can either call the first constructor that uses the default Android divider attributes, or the second one that uses your own drawable, for example drawable/divider.xmlNote: if you want the divider to be drawn over your items, override onDrawOver() method instead.To use your new class add VerticalSpaceItemDecoration or DividerSpaceItemDecoration to RecyclerView, for example in your fragment\'s onCreateView() method:There\'s also Lucas Rocha\'s library which is supposed to simplify the item decoration process. Haven\'t tried it though.Among its features are:Might I direct your attention to this particular file on Github by Alex Fu:\nhttps://gist.github.com/alexfu/0f464fc3742f134ccd1eIt\'s the DividerItemDecoration.java example file "pulled straight from the support demos".(https://plus.google.com/103498612790395592106/posts/VVEB3m7NkSS)I was able to get divider lines nicely after importing this file in my project and add it as an item decoration to the recycler view.Here\'s how my onCreateView look like in my fragment containing the Recyclerview:I\'m sure additional styling can be done, but it\'s a starting point. :)Simple ItemDecoration implementation for equal spaces between all items.The simple one is to set background color for RecyclerView and different background color for items. Here is an example ...and the TextView item (It can be anything though) with bottom margin "x" dp or px.The output ...Just add Also you may need to add the dependency\n compile \'com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:26.0.1\'EDIT: For customizing it a little bit you can add a custom drawable:You are free to use any custom drawable, for instance:I think using simple divider will help you\nTo add divider to each item:\n1- Add this to drawable directory line_divider.xml2- Create SimpleDividerItemDecoration class\nI used this example to define this class:\nhttps://gist.github.com/polbins/e37206fbc444207c0e92\n3- In activity or fragment that using RecyclerView, inside onCreateView add this:4- To add spacing between Items\nyou just need to add padding property to your item viewAs I have set ItemAnimators. The ItemDecorator don\'t enter or exit along with the animation.I simply ended up in having a view line in my item view layout file of each item. It solved my case. DividerItemDecoration felt to be to much of sorcery for a simple divider. Or I might be missing its real use.Since there is no right way to implement this yet properly using Material Design, I just did the following trick to add a divider on the list item directly:With support library v25.0.0 there finally is a default implementation of basic horizontal and vertical dividers available!https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/DividerItemDecoration.htmlThis doesn\'t actually solve the problem, but as a temporary workaround, you can set the useCompatPadding property on the card in your XML layout to make it measure the same as it does on pre-Lollipop versions.For those who are looking just for spaces between items in the RecyclerView see my approach where you get equal spaces between all items, except in first and last items where I gave a bigger padding. I only apply padding to left/right in horizontal LayoutManager and to top/bottom in vertical LayoutManager.dimens.xmlI forked the DividerItemDecoration from an older gist and simplified it to fit my use case, and I also modified it to draw the dividers the way they are drawn in ListView, including a divider after the last list item. This will also handle vertical ItemAnimator animations:1) Add this class to your project:2) Add the decorator to your RecylerView:Add a margin to your view, it worked for me.If you just want to add equal spacing and want to do it in XML, just set padding to your RecyclerView and equal amount of layoutMargin to the item you inflate into your RecyclerView, and let the background color determine the spacing color.Just add a background to the layout of your recycler item as followsCreate following  shape_border.xml in drawable folder.Here is final result - a RecyclerView with divider.Taken from a google search, add this ItemDecoration to your RecyclerView:We can decorate the items using various decorators attached to the recyclerview such as the DividerItemDecoration:Simply use the following ...taken from the answer by EyesClear}\nand then use the above as followsThis will display dividers between each item within the list as shown below:And for those of who are looking for more details can check out this guide  Using the RecyclerView _ CodePath Android CliffnotesSome answers here suggest the use of margins but the catch is that :\nIf you add both top and bottom margins, they will appear both added between items and they will be too large. If you only add either, there will be no margin either at the top or the bottom of the whole list. If you add half of the distance at the top, half at the bottom, the outer margins will be too small. Thus, the only aesthetically correct solution is the divider that the system knows where to apply properly: between items but not above or below items.Please let me know of any doubts in the comments below :)If anyone is looking to only add, say, 10dp spacing between items, you can do so by setting a drawable to DividerItemDecoration:Where divider_10dpis a drawable resource containing:If you want to add same space for items, the simplest way is to add top+left padding for RecycleView and right+bottom margins to card items.dimens.xmllist_item.xmllist.xmlThis link worked like a charm for me:https://gist.github.com/lapastillaroja/858caf1a82791b6c1a36Then in your activity:Or this if you are using a fragment:I have added a line in list item like below1px will draw the thin line. If you want to hide the divider for the last row then divider.setVisiblity(View.GONE); on the onBindViewHolder for the last list Item.You can add with programaticly easily.If your Layout Manager is Linearlayout then you can use:DividerItemDecoration is a RecyclerView.ItemDecoration that can be\n  used as a divider between items of a LinearLayoutManager. It supports\n  both HORIZONTAL and VERTICAL orientations.sourceThis will add space in every item\'s top and bottom(or left and right).Then you can set it to your recyclerView.SizeUtils.javaA really easy solution is to use RecyclerView-FlexibleDividerAdd dependency:Add to your recyclerview:And you\'re done!Too Late but for GridLayoutManager I use this:This work for any span count you have.Ollie.1.One of the Way is by using cardview and recycler view together  we can easily add effect like divider. \nex.https://developer.android.com/training/material/lists-cards.html2.and other is by adding view as divider to list_item_layout of recycler view.Implement its own version of RecyclerView.ItemDecorationThe RecyclerView is a bit different from the ListView. Actually, the RecyclerView needs a ListView like structure in it. For example, a LinearLayout. The LinearLayout has parameters for the dividing each element.\nIn the code below I have a RecyclerView comprised of CardView objects within a LinearLayout with a "padding" that will put some space between items. Make that space really small and you get a line.Here\'s the Recycler view in recyclerview_layout.xmlAnd here is what each item looks like (and it shows as divided due to the android:padding in the LinearLayout that surrounds everything.) in another file: cards_layout.xmlI have a very simple way of adding a divider in RecyclerView. Use a custom adapter to modify the recycler view layout and then along with the recycler view items add LinearLayout with a background color (which will be the divider color) and add a height of 1dp (or as per your requirement) and width to match parent.Here is a sample code.Here\'s my lazy approach but it works:\nwrap the CardView in a layout and set a padding/margin on the parent layout to mimic the divider, and force the normal divider to nulllist_item.xmllist.xml
