I have a Ubuntu VM running on my Windows 7 machine. How do I set it up so that I can access the webserver externally through SSH?I found steps (Setup SSH access between VirtualBox Host and Guest VMs) to be able to ssh to my guest from my host, but that still leaves me with the problem of accessing it through my router.I suppose that I could install an SSH server on my Windows machine and then tunnel a few times (though I\'m not 100% sure what to use in terms of local, dynamic, etc. or how to set up multiple tunnels?), but is there a way to make the VM directly accessible to my router so I could directly port forward to it?The best way to login to a guest Linux VirtualBox VM is port forwarding. By default, you should have one interface already which is using NAT. Then go to the Network settings and click the Port Forwarding button.  Add a new Rule:Host port 3022, guest port 22, name ssh, other left blank.or from command linewhere \'myserver\' is the name of the created VM. Check the added rules:That\'s all! Please be sure you don\'t forget to install an SSH server:To SSH into the guest VM, write:Where user is your username within the VM.Change the adapter type in VirtualBox to bridged, and set the guest to use DHCP or set a static IP address outside of the bounds of DHCP. This will cause the Virtual Machine to act like a normal guest on your home network. You can then port forward.Keeping the NAT adapter and adding a second host-only adapter works amazing, and is crucial for laptops (where the external network always changes).http://muffinresearch.co.uk/archives/2010/02/08/howto-ssh-into-virtualbox-3-linux-guests/Remember to create a host-only network in virtualbox itself (GUI -> settings -> network), otherwise you can\'t create the host-only interface on the guest.Start cmd.exe and run ipconfig /all. You should see lines:Second adapter in guest should also be in 192.168.59.*.Start VM.Check if ssh is enabledModify /etc/ssh/sshd_config so there isRestart ssh serviceFrom host check itList interfaces:You should see three interfaces like lo, enp0s3, enp0s8. We will use the third.Edit /etc/network/interfacesThen sudo ifup enp0s8. Check if enp0s8 got correct address. You should see your ip:If not, you may run sudo ifdown enp0s8 && sudo ifup enp0s8https://superuser.com/questions/424083/virtualbox-host-ssh-to-guest/424115#424115You can also use a Bridged Network in network settings. This will put your VM in a VLAN with your machine. So you can just ssh into the VM like this.ssh user@IP_OF_VMThe answers provided by other users here : How to SSH to a VirtualBox guest externally through a host?... helped me to accomplish the task of connecting from out on the internet to my home computer\'s guest machine. You should be able to connect using computers, tablets, and smart phones (android, IPhone,etc). I add a few more step in case it might be helpful to someone else:Here is a quick diagram of my setup:Remote device ---> INTERNET --> MODEM --> ROUTER --> HOST MACHINE --> GUEST VMRemote device (ssh client) ---> PASS THRU DEVICES ---> GUEST VM (ssh server)Remote device (leave ssh port 3022) ---> INTERNET --> MODEM --> ROUTER (FWD frm:p3022 to:p3022)--> HOST MACHINE (FWD frm:p3022 to:p22) --> GUEST VM (arrive ssh port 22)The key for me was to realize that ALL connections was PASSING-THROUGH intermediary devices to get from my remote PC to my guest virtual-machine at home --Hence port forwarding!Notes:\n* Need ssh client to request a secure connection and a running ssh server to process the secure connection.I will forward the port 3022 as used in the chosen answer from above.Enter your IPs where needed (home modem/router, host IP, guest IP,etc.), Names chosen are just examples-use or change.1.Create ssh tunnel to port 3022 on your modem\'s IP / router\'s external IP address.ssh client/device possible commands: ssh -p 3022 user-name@home_external_IP2.Port forward = we are passing thru the connection from router to host machineAlso make sure firewall /IPtable rules on router is allowing ports to be forward (open if needed)Router\'s Pfwd SCREEN required entries: AppName:SSH_Fwd, Port_from: 3022, Protocol:both (UDP/TCP), IP_address:hostIP_address, Port_to:3022, everything else can be blankDD-WRT router software resources / Info:DD-WRT Port_ForwardingDD-WRT Static_DHCP3.Host Machine Firewall: open port 3022 #so forwarded port can pass thru to guest machineHost Machine: Install VirtualBox, guest additions, and guest machine if not done alreadyConfigure guest machine and then follow the Network section belowI used VirtualBox GUI to setup guest\'s network- easier than CLIIf you want to use other methods refer to : VirtualBox/manual/ch06.html#natforward4.Some suggest using Network Bridge adapter for guest = access to LAN and other machines on your LAN. This also pose an increase security risk, because now your guest machine is now exposed to LAN machines and possibly the INTERNET hackers if firewall not setup properly. So I selected Network adapter attached to NAT for less exposure to bridged security risks.On the guest machine do the following:Also there are different ssh servers and clients depending on platform using.For Ubuntu Users:That should be it. If I made a mistake or want to add anything -feel free to do so-- I am still a noob.Hope this helps someone. Good luck!You can also initiate a port forward TO your HOST, OR ANY OTHER SERVER, from your Guest.   This is especially useful if your Guest is \'locked\' or can\'t otherwise complete the ModifyVM option (e.g. no permission to VBoxManage). Three minor requirements are 1) you are/can log into the VirtualBox Guest (via \'console\' GUI, another Guest, etc), 2) you have an account on the VirtualBox HOST (or other Server), and 3) SSH and TCP forwarding is not blocked. Presuming you can meet the 3 requirements, these are the steps:For Windows host, you can :A good explanation about how to configure port forwarding with NAT is found in the VirtualBox documents:\nhttp://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#natforwardSimply setting the Network Setting to bridged did the trick for me.Your IP will change when you do this. However, in my case it didn\'t change immediately. ifconfig returned the same ip. I rebooted the vm and boom, the ip set itself to one start with 192.* and I was immediately allowed ssh access.On secure networks setting your network to bridge might not work. Administrators could only allow one mac address per port or even worse block the port should the switches detect multiple macs on one port.The best solution in my opinion is to set up additional network interfaces to handle additional services you would like to run on your machines. So I have a bridge interface to allow for bridging when I take my laptop home and can SSH into it from other devices on my network as well as a host only adapter when I would like to SSH into my VM from my laptop when I am connected to the eduroam wifi network on campus.Use NAT network adapter and Add port forward. Mention actual host ip.Do not use 127.0.0.1 or localhost.
