I am working with Java. If I hit Ctrl+Shift+F in Eclipse Helios, it will auto format my code. At a certain point, it wraps lines. I would like to increase the maximum line length. How can I do this?In preferences Java -> Code Style -> Formatter, edit the profile. Under the Line Wrapping tab is the primary option for line width (Maximum line width:). In the Comments tab you have a separate option Maximum line width for comments:, which will also need to be changed to affect comment wrapping.You will need to make your own profile to make these changes in if you using one of the [Built-in] ones. Just click "New..." on the formatter preferences page.Take a look of following image:Comments have their own line length setting at the bottom of the setting page java->code style->formatter-> Edit... ->commentsfor XML line width, update preferences > XML > XML Files > Editor > Line widthFor HTML / PHP / JSP / JSPF: Web -> HTML Files -> Editor -> Line widthClick Project->preferences. Type format into the search - you should see java->code style->formatter. Click that, then edit - finally, the line wrapping tab - its there :)For XHTML files: Web -> HTML Files -> Editor -> Line widthPreferences -> Java -> Code Style -> Formatter  / "Edit..."Tabs: "Line wrapping" , "Comments"Field: "Maximum line width" Set both to make comments have the same length too.\nYou might need to create a new profile if you don\'t have one already.
