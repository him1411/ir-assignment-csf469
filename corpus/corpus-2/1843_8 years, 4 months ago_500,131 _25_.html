I want to check if a variable exists. Now I\'m doing something like this:Are there other ways without exceptions?To check the existence of a local variable:To check the existence of a global variable:To check if an object has an attribute:The use of variables that haven\'t been defined is actually a bad thing in any language since it indicates that the logic of the program hasn\'t been thought through properly.Python will assume you know what you\'re doing, otherwise you\'d be using VB :-).The following trick, which is similar to yours, will ensure that a variable has some value before use:However, I still don\'t think that\'s a good idea - in my opinion, you should refactor your code so that this situation does not occur.Using try/except is the best way to test for a variable\'s existence. But there\'s almost certainly a better way of doing whatever it is you\'re doing than setting/testing global variables.For example, if you want to initialize a module-level variable the first time you call some function, you\'re better off with code something like this:for objects/modules, you can also For example, catch is called except in Python. other than that it\'s fine for such simple cases. There\'s the AttributeError that can be used to check if an object has an attribute.I will assume that the test is going to be used in a function, similar to user97370\'s answer.  I don\'t like that answer because it pollutes the global namespace.  One way to fix it is to use a class instead:I don\'t like this, because it complicates the code and opens up questions such as, should this confirm to the Singleton programming pattern?  Fortunately, Python has allowed functions to have attributes for a while, which gives us this simple solution:A way that often works well for handling this kind of situation is to not explicitly check if the variable exists but just go ahead and wrap the first usage of the possibly non-existing variable in a try/except NameError:A simple way is to initialize it at first saying myVar = None;Then later on:   It\'s just an addition to previous answers to check whether a key is present in JSON/Dict or not in python\'Json/Dict object name\'.has_key(\'key name\')this will return True or Falsetry:`hope this helps!This will work to see whether the variable exists at all.
