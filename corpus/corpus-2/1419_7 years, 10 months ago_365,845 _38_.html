How can I see the diff between a local branch and a remote branch?For example git diff master origin/master, or git diff featureA origin/nextOf course to have said remote-tracking branch you need to git fetch first; and you need it to have up to date information about branches in remote repository.First typeto get the list of available branches. On the output you may see something likeThen show the diffIf you\'re on a given branch, and you want to compare it with an upstream branch you\'re tracking, useCourtesy of this answer, the git documentation for specifying revisions has:<branchname>@{upstream}, e.g. master@{upstream}, @{u}\n  The suffix\n  @{upstream} to a branchname (short form <branchname>@{u}) refers to\n  the branch that the branch specified by branchname is set to build on\n  top of (configured with branch.<name>.remote and branch.<name>.merge).\n  A missing branchname defaults to the current one.I understand much better the output of:git diff <remote-tracking branch> <local branch>that shows me what is going to be dropped and what is going to be added if I push the local branch. Of course it is the same, just the inverse, but for me is more readable and I\'m more confortable looking at what is going to happen.The easy way:This will first fetch the changes from your default remote (origin). This will be created automatically when you clone a repo. You can also be explicit: git fetch origin master.Then git log is used to compare your current branch with the one just fetched. (The -p (generate patch) option is what shows the differences.) Let your working branch is development and want to differentiate between local development branch and remote development branch, that case, syntax should be like git diff remotes/origin/development..development\n                  or git fetch origin \ngit diff origin/development This is how I do it.this will fetch everything from the remote, so when you check difference, it will compare the difference with the remote branch.the above command will display all the branches.Now, you can check difference as follows.this will compare your local branch with the remote branchIf you want to see the difference as just the names of the files changed then use:  git diff --name-status <remote-branch> <local-branch>,  else this would show all differences between the two branches: git diff <remote-branch> <local-branch>I know there are several answers to this question already but I was getting an odd error when trying most of them.In my case I have a second remote called heroku that is not the origin and because it wasn\'t in sync I got this error when trying to run the git diff master heroku/master:fatal: ambiguous argument \'heroku/master\': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.or this when trying the other approach git diff master..heroku/master:fatal: bad revision \'master..heroku/master\'The solution was explicitly mentioning the remote name on git fetch before running git diff, in my case:Hope that helps others with this same issue.Here is a shorthand answer if you are comparing your current branch and to something you want to git pull.The first command will figure out which remote branch corresponds to your current branch. An artifact of that calculation in the FETCH_HEAD reference. Then the second command uses that reference compare versus what your current branch has.This will compare the commit you want with your local files. Don\'t forget the dot in the end (for local).For example, to compare your local files with some commit:git difftool 1db1ef2490733c1877ad0fb5e8536d2935566341 .(and you don\'t need git fetch, unless comparing to new commits is needed)ExampleIf you are using editor like webstorm, you can right click on file select compare with branch and type/select your branch.
