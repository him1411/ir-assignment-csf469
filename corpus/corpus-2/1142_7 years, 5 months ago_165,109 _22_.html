Context: I\'m working on master adding a simple feature. After a few minutes I realize it was not so simple and it should have been better to work into a new branch.This always happens to me and I have no idea how to switch to another branch and take all these uncommited changes with me leaving the master branch clean. I supposed git stash && git stash branch new_branch would simply accomplish that but this is what I get:Do you know if there is any way of accomplishing this?No need to stash.does not touch your local changes. It just creates the branch from the current HEAD and sets the HEAD there.\nSo I guess that\'s what you want.--- Edit to explain the result of checkout master ---Are you confused because checkout master does not discard your changes?Since the changes are only local, git does not want you to lose them too easily. Upon changing branch, git does not overwrite your local changes. The result of your checkout master is:, which means that your working files are not clean. git did change the HEAD, but did not overwrite your local files. That is why your last status still show your local changes, although you are on master.If you really want to discard the local changes, you have to force the checkout with -f.Since your changes were never committed, you\'d lose them.Try to get back to your branch, commit your changes, then checkout the master again.You should get a M message after the first checkout, but then not anymore after the checkout master, and git status should show no modified files.--- Edit to clear up confusion about working directory (local files)---In answer to your first comment, local changes are just... well, local. Git does not save them automatically, you must tell it to save them for later.\nIf you make changes and do not explicitly commit or stash them, git will not version them. If you change HEAD (checkout master), the local changes are not overwritten since unsaved.Try:Two things you can do:or(git stash -u <-- the -u means that it also takes unstaged changes )(git checkout - <-- the dash is a shortcut for the previous branch you were on )If you are using the GitHub Windows client (as I am) and you are in the situation of having made uncommitted changes that you wish to move to a new branch, you can simply "Crate a new branch" via the GitHub client. It will switch to the newly created branch and preserve your changes.
