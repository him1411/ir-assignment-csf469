Is it possible to clear an <input type=\'file\' /> control value with jQuery? I\'ve tried the following:But it\'s not working.Easy: you wrap a <form> around the element, call reset on the form, then remove the form using unwrap(). Unlike the clone() solutions otherwise in this thread, you end up with the same element at the end (including custom properties that were set on it).Tested and working in Opera, Firefox, Safari, Chrome and IE6+. Also works on other types of form elements, with the exception of type="hidden".http://jsfiddle.net/rPaZQ/As Timo notes below, if you have the buttons to trigger the reset of the field inside of the <form>, you must call preventDefault on the event to prevent the <button> from triggering a submit.Does not work in IE 11 due to an unfixed bug. The text (file name) is cleared on the input, but its File list remains populated.Quick answer: replace it.In the code below I use the replaceWith jQuery method to replace the control with a clone of itself. In the event you have any handlers bound to events on this control, we\'ll want to preserve those as well. To do this we pass in true as the first parameter of the clone method.Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/jonathansampson/dAQVM/If cloning, while preserving event handlers, presents any issues you could consider using event delegation to handle clicks on this control from a parent element:This prevents the need for any handlers to be cloned along with the element when the control is being refreshed.Jquery is supposed to take care of the cross-browser/older browser issues for you.This works on modern browsers that I tested: Chromium v25, Firefox v20, Opera v12.14Using jquery 1.9.1HTMLJqueryOn jsfiddleThe following javascript solution also worked for me on the browsers mention above.On jsfiddleI have no way to test with IE, but theoretically this should work. If IE is different enough that the Javascript version does not work because MS have done it in a different way, the jquery method should in my opinion deal with it for you, else it would be worth pointing it out to the jquery team along with the method that IE requires. (I see people saying "this won\'t work on IE", but no vanilla javascript to show how it does work on IE (supposedly a "security feature"?), perhaps report it as a bug to MS too (if they would count it as such), so that it gets fixed in any newer release)Like mentioned in another answer, a post on the jquery forumBut jquery have now removed support for browser testing, jquery.browser.This javascript solution also worked for me, it is the vanilla equivalent of the jquery.replaceWith method.On jsfiddleThe important thing to note is that the cloneNode method does not preserve associated event handlers.See this example.On jsfiddleBut jquery.clone offers this [*1]On jsfiddle[*1] jquery is able to do this if the events were added by jquery\'s methods as it keeps a copy in jquery.data, it does not work otherwise, so it\'s a bit of a cheat/work-around and means things are not compatible between different methods or libraries.On jsfiddleYou can not get the attached event handler direct from the element itself.Here is the general principle in vanilla javascript, this is how jquery an all other libraries do it (roughly).On jsfiddleOf course jquery and other libraries have all the other support methods required for maintaining such a list, this is just a demonstration.For obvious security reasons you can\'t set the value of a file input, even to an empty string.All you have to do is reset the form where the field or if you only want to reset the file input of a form containing other fields, use this:Here is an exemple: http://jsfiddle.net/v2SZJ/1/This works for me. http://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-to-clear-a-file-input-in-ieHope it helps.In IE8 they made the File Upload field read-only for security. See the IE team blog post:Historically, the HTML File Upload Control () has been the source of a significant number of information disclosure vulnerabilities. To resolve these issues, two changes were made to the behavior of the control.To block attacks that rely on \xe2\x80\x9cstealing\xe2\x80\x9d keystrokes to surreptitiously trick the user into typing a local file path into the control, the File Path edit box is now read-only. The user must explicitly select a file for upload using the File Browse dialog.Additionally, the \xe2\x80\x9cInclude local directory path when uploading files\xe2\x80\x9d URLAction has been set to "Disable" for the Internet Zone. This change prevents leakage of potentially sensitive local file-system information to the Internet. For instance, rather than submitting the full path C:\\users\\ericlaw\\documents\\secret\\image.png, Internet Explorer 8 will now submit only the filename image.png.I got stuck with all the options here. Here\'s a hack that I made which worked:and you can trigger the reset using jQuery with a code similar to this:(jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/eCbd6/)I have used https://github.com/malsup/form/blob/master/jquery.form.js, which has a function called clearInputs(), which is crossbrowser, well tested, easy to use and handles also IE issue and hidden fields clearing if needed. Maybe a little long solution to only clear file input, but if you are dealing with crossbrowser file uploads, then this solution is recommended.The usage is easy:I ended up with this:may not be the most elegant solution, but it work as far as I can tell.$("#control).val(\'\') is all you need! Tested on Chrome using JQuery 1.11The value of file inputs is read only (for security reasons). You can\'t blank it programatically (other than by calling the reset() method of the form, which has a broader scope than just that field).I was able to get mine working with the following code:The .clone() thing does not work in Opera (and possibly others). It keeps the content.The closest method here for me was Jonathan\'s earlier, however ensuring that the field preserved its name, classes, etc made for messy code in my case.Something like this might work well (thanks to Quentin too):I have managed to get this to work using the following...This has been tested in IE10, FF, Chrome & Opera.There are two caveats...Still doesn\'t work properly in FF, if you refresh the page, the file element gets re-populated with the selected file. Where it is getting this info from is beyond me. What else related to a file input element could I possible try to clear?Remember to use delegation on any events you had attached to the file input element, so they still work when the clone is made.What I don\'t understand is who on earth thought not allowing you to clear an input field from an invalid unacceptable file selection was a good idea?OK, don\'t let me dynamically set it with a value so I can\'t leach files from a user\'s OS, but let me clear an invalid selection without resetting an entire form. It\'s not like \'accept\' does anything other than a filter anyhow and in IE10, it doesn\'t even understand MS Word mime types, it\'s a joke!On my Firefox 40.0.3 only work with thisI tried with the most of the techniques the users mentioned, but none of they worked in all browsers. i.e: clone() doesn\'t work in FF for file inputs.\nI ended up copying manually the file input, and then replacing the original with the copied one. It works in all browsers.its works for me in every browser.Make it asynchronous, and reset it after the button\'s desired actions have been done.This works with Chrome, FF, and SafariMay not work with IE or OperaIt\'s easy lol (works in all browsers [except opera]):JS Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/cw84x/1/What? \nIn your validation function, just put Assuming upload is the name:I\'m using JSP, not sure if that makes a difference...Works for me, and I think it\'s way easier.
