I have inherited a fairly large SQL Server database. It seems to take up more space than I would expect, given the data it contains.Is there an easy way to determine how much space on disk each table is consuming?If you are using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), instead of running a query (which in my case returned duplicate rows) you can run a standard report.Â Note: The database compatibility level must be set to 90 or above for this to work correctly. See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/bb510680.aspxsp_spaceused can get you information on the disk space used by a table, indexed view, or the whole database.For example:This reports the disk usage information for the ContactInfo table.To use this for all tables at once:You can also get disk usage from within the right-click Standard Reports functionality of SQL Server.  To get to this report, navigate from the server object in Object Explorer, move down to the Databases object, and then right-click any database. From the menu that appears, select Reports, then Standard Reports, and then "Disk Usage by Partition: [DatabaseName]".After some searching, I could not find an easy way to get information on all of the tables. There is a handy stored procedure named sp_spaceused that will return all of the space used by the database. If provided with a table name, it returns the space used by that table. However, the results returned by the stored procedure are not sortable, since the columns are character values.The following script will generate the information I\'m looking for.For all tables ,use..(adding from the comments of Paul)If you need to calculate exactly the same numbers, that are on \'table properties - storage\' page in SSMS, you need to count them with the same method as it done in SSMS (works for sql server 2005 and above ... and also works correctly for tables with LOB fields - because just counting "used_pages" is not enought to show accurate index size):Above queries are good for finding the amount of space used by the table (indexes included), but if you want to compare how much space is used by indexes on the table use this query:This will give you the sizes, and record counts for each table.For get all table size in one database you can use this query :And you can change it to insert all of result into temp table and after that select from temp table.A small change on Mar_c\'s answer, since I have been going back to this page so often, ordered by most row\'s first:I added a few more columns on top of marc_s answer:We use table partitioning and had some trouble with the queries provided above due to duplicate records.For those who need this, you can find below the query as run by SQL Server 2014 when generating the "Disk usage by table" report. I assume it also works with previous versions of SQL Server.It works like a charm.My post is only relevant for SQL Server 2000 and has been tested to work in my environment.This code accesses All possible databases of a single instance, not just a single database.  I use two temp tables to help collect the appropriate data and then dump the results into one \'Live\' table.Returned data is: DatabaseName, DatabaseTableName, Rows (in the Table), data (size of the table in KB it would seem), entry data (I find this useful for knowing when I last ran the script).  Downfall to this code is the \'data\' field is not stored as an int (The chars \'KB\' are kept in that field), and that would be useful (but not totally necessary) for sorting.Hopefully this code helps someone out there and saves them some time!In case you need to know, the rsp_DatabaseTableSizes table was created through:From a command prompt using OSQL:As a simple extension to marc_s\'s answer (the one that has been accepted), this is adjusted to return column count and allow for filtering:Here is a way to get all tables\' sizes quickly with the following steps:Write the given T-SQL commands to list all database tables:Now copy the list of database tables, and copy it into a new query analyzer windowIn SQL query analyzer, select from top tool bar option Results to file (Ctrl + Shift + F).Now finally hit the Execute button red marked from the above tool bar.The Database size of all tables is now stored in a file on your computer.Riffing on @Mark answer above, added the @updateusage=\'true\' to force the latest size stats (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms188776.aspx):
