How can I ignore directories or folders in Git using msysgit on Windows?Create a file named .gitignore in your project\'s directory. Ignore directories by entering the directory name into the file (with a slash appended):More info here.By default windows explorer will display .gitignore when in-fact the file name is .gitignore.txtGit will not use .gitignore.txtAnd you can\'t rename the file to .gitignore because explorer thinks its a file of type gitignore with no name.Non command line solution: It seems that for ignoring files and directories there are two main ways:.gitignore note: files tracked before can be untracked by running git rm --cached filenameRepo exclude - For local files that doesn\'t need to be shared, you just adde file pattern or directory to file .git/info/exclude. Theses rules are not commited, so are not seen by other users more info here[updated]\nTo make exceptions in list of ignored files, see this question.I had some issues creating a file in windows explorer with a . at the beginning.a workaround was to go into the commandshell and create a new file using "edit"to instruct GIT to ignore certain files or folders, you have to create .gitignore file.but in windows explorer you have to provide a name for the file, you just cannot create file with just extension, the trick is that create a empty text file and go to command prompt and change the name of the file to .gitignorenow open the file with your favorite text editor and add the file/folder names you wish you ignore. you can also use wildcards like this *.txthope it answers you questionIn Windows there\'s an extra catch with slashes. Excluding a single directory in .gitignore withdir_to_exclude/will possibly work, but excluding all directories with/causes problems when you have file names with spaces (like my file.txt) in your directory: Git bash escapes these spaces with a backslash (like my\\ file.txt) and Git for Windows doesn\'t distinguish between / and \\.To exclude all directories better use:**/Two consecutive asteriscs signify directory contents.Also in your \\.git\\info projects directory there is an exclude file that is effectively the same thing as .gitignore (I think). You can add files and directories to ignore in that.I\'ve had some problems getting git to pickup the .gitignore file on Windows.  The $GIT_DIR/info/exclude file always seems to work though.  The downside of this approach, however, is that the files in the $GIT_DIR directory are not included in the check-in, and therefore not shared.( p.s.  $GIT_DIR is usually the hidden folder named .git )You can create the ".gitignore" file with the contents:It works for me and simples. If you want to mantain a folder and no the files inside it, just put a ".gitignore" file with "*" as content. This file ignore all content from repository. But .gitignore will be include in your repo.If you add empty folder, you receive this message (.gitignore is hidden file)So, use "-f" to force add:I assume the problem is that your working tree is like:... with the .gitignore you describe.  This will give you git status output like:... if the index.html files have not yet been added to the repository.  (git sees that there are unignored files in the cache directories, but only reports the directories.)  To fix this, make sure that you have added and committed the index.html files:... and your git status will then look like:(Obviously you do want to commit .gitignore as well, I was just being lazy with this test case.)To ignore an entire directory in git, the easiest way is to include a .gitignore file within the target directory which simply contains "*"An illustrative example,Example SystemTargetTop Level .gitignore (/root/.gitignore)Ignored Directory .gitignore (/root/dirB.gitignore)and it\'s that simple :)I had similar issues, I work on a windows tool chain with a shared repo with linux guys, they happlily create files with the same [except for case] names in a given folder.The effect is that I can clone the repo and immediatly have dozens of \'modified\' files that if I checked in would create havoc.I have windows set to case sensitive and git to not ignore case but it still fails (in the win32 api calls apparently).If I gitignore the files then I have to remember to not track the .gitignore file.But I found a good answer here\nhttp://archive.robwilkerson.org/2010/03/02/git-tip-ignore-changes-to-tracked-files/index.htmlChris
