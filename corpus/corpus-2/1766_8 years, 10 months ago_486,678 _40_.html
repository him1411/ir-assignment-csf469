I am creating a chat using ajax requests in rails and I\'m trying to get a div to scroll to the bottom without much luck.I am wrapping everything in this div:Is there a way to keep it scrolled to the bottom by default using JS?Is there a way to keep it scrolled to the bottom after an ajax request?Here\'s what I use on my site (I didn\'t write it, I just found it somewhere since I don\'t know Javascript too well.)This is much easier if you\'re using jQuery:using jQuery animate:You can use the following code:To perform a smooth scroll, use the following code (require jQuery):See the sample on JSFiddleAnd that\'s how it works:Ref: scrollTop, scrollHeight, clientHeightjQuery version:Works from jQuery 1.6https://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/http://api.jquery.com/prop/Newer method :If you don\'t want to rely on scrollHeight, the following code helps:Found this really helpful, thank you.For the Angular folks out there: Just because the wrapping in jQuery elements versus HTML DOM elements gets a little confusing with angular.  Also for a chat application, I found making this assignment after your chats were loaded to be useful, you also might need to slap on short timeout as well. Using jQuery, scrollTop is used to set the vertical position of scollbar for any given element. there is also a nice jquery scrollTo plugin used to scroll with animation and different options (demos)if you want to use jQuery\'s animate method to add animation while scrolling down, check the following snippet:small addendum: scrolls only, if last line is already visible. if scrolled a tiny bit, leaves the content where it is (attention: not tested with different font sizes. this may need some adjustments inside ">= comparison"):Just as a bonus snippet. I\'m using angular and was trying to scroll a message thread to the bottom when a user selected different conversations with users. In order to make sure that the scroll works after the new data had been loaded into the div with the ng-repeat for messages, just wrap the scroll snippet in a timeout.That will make sure that the scroll event is fired after the data has been inserted into the DOM.This will let you scroll all the way down regards the document heightI have encountered the same problem, but with an additional constraint: I had no control over the code that appended new elements to the scroll container. None of the examples I found here allowed me to do just that. Here is the solution I ended up with .It uses Mutation Observers (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) which makes it usable only on modern browsers (though polyfills exist)So basically the code does just that :I made a fiddle to demonstrate the concept : \nhttps://jsfiddle.net/j17r4bnk/You can also, using jQuery, attach an animation to html,body of the document via:$("html,body").animate({scrollTop:$("#div-id")[0].offsetTop}, 1000);which will result in a smooth scroll to the top of the div with id "div-id".Javascript or jquery:Css:I know this is an old question, but none of these solutions worked out for me. I ended up using offset().top to get the desired results. Here\'s what I used to gently scroll the screen down to the last message in my chat application:I hope this helps someone else.
