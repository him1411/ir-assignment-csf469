The LocationManager API on Android seems like it\'s a bit of a pain to use for an application that only needs an occasional and rough approximation of the user\'s location.The app I\'m working on isn\'t really a location app per se, but it does need to get the user\'s location in order to display a list of nearby businesses.  It doesn\'t need to worry about if the user is moving around or anything like that.Here\'s what I\'d like to do:It seems like it shouldn\'t be that hard, but it appears to me that I have to spin up two different location providers (GPS and NETWORK) and manage each\'s lifecycle. Not only that, but I have to duplicate the same code in multiple activities to satisfy #2. I\'ve tried using getBestProvider() in the past to cut the solution down to just using one location provider, but that seems to only give you the best "theoretical" provider rather than the provider that\'s actually going to give you the best results.Is there a simpler way to accomplish this?Here\'s what I do:Here\'s how I use my class:And here\'s MyLocation class:Somebody may also want to modify my logic. For example if you get update from Network provider don\'t stop listeners but continue waiting. GPS gives more accurate data so it\'s worth waiting for it. If timer elapses and you\'ve got update from Network but not from GPS then you can use value provided from Network.One more approach is to use LocationClient http://developer.android.com/training/location/retrieve-current.html. But it requires Google Play Services apk to be installed on user device.After searching for best implementation how to get best precise user location I managed to combine all the best methods and come up with following class:This class tries to connect to min_gps_sat_count satellites if GPS is enabled. Else returns LocationManager.getBestProvider() location. Check the code!With Fedor\'s solution I\'ve experienced multiple execution of the callback gotLocation.\nIt seems to be due to a race condition in the overridden LocationListener.onLocationChanged method, when gotLocation method is \'long enough\'. I\'m not sure, but I guess removeUpdates prevents the enqueueing of new messages in the Looper queue, but it doesn\'t remove those already enqueued but not yet consumed. Hence the race condition.To reduce the probability of this wrong behavior it\'s possible to call removeUpdates before firing the onLocationChanged event, but still we have the race condition.The best solution I found is to replace requestLocationUpdates with requestSingleUpdate.This is my version, based on Fedor\'s solution, using an Handler to send a message to the looper thread:I use this class from a customized looper thread, like the following one:where Coordinates is a simple class with two properties: latitude and longitude.I have created small application with step by step description to gets current locations GPS co-ordinates.Complete example source code in below URL:Get Current Location coordinates , City name - in AndroidSee How it works :All we need to do is add this permission in manifest fileand create LocationManager instance like thisCheck GPS is enabled or notthen implement LocationListener and Get Coordinateshere is the sample code to doYou could always just use LocationManager.getLastKnownLocation() but like it says it could be out of date.And a simple way to get a general location could be registering for the network (usually pretty fast).and then doingin the onLocationChanged() method of the listener.I am not sure if the Location-Based Services can get the location from other infrastructures other than GPS, but according to that article, it does seem possible:Applications can call on any of\n  several types of positioning methods.Using the mobile phone network: The\n  current cell ID can be used to\n  identify the Base Transceiver Station\n  (BTS) that the device is communicating\n  with and the location of that BTS.\n  Clearly, the accuracy of this method\n  depends on the size of the cell, and\n  can be quite inaccurate. A GSM cell\n  may be anywhere from 2 to 20\n  kilometers in diameter. Other\n  techniques used along with cell ID can\n  achieve accuracy within 150 meters.Using satellites: The Global\n  Positioning System (GPS), controlled\n  by the US Department of Defense, uses\n  a constellation of 24 satellites\n  orbiting the earth. GPS determines the\n  device\'s position by calculating\n  differences in the times signals from\n  different satellites take to reach the\n  receiver. GPS signals are encoded, so\n  the mobile device must be equipped\n  with a GPS receiver. GPS is\n  potentially the most accurate method\n  (between 4 and 40 meters if the GPS\n  receiver has a clear view of the sky),\n  but it has some drawbacks: The extra\n  hardware can be costly, consumes\n  battery while in use, and requires\n  some warm-up after a cold start to get\n  an initial fix on visible satellites.\n  It also suffers from "canyon effects"\n  in cities, where satellite visibility\n  is intermittent. Using short-range\n  positioning beacons: In relatively\n  small areas, such as a single\n  building, a local area network can\n  provide locations along with other\n  services. For example, appropriately\n  equipped devices can use Bluetooth for\n  short-range positioning.Use the below code, it will give the best provider available:The recommended way to do this is to use LocationClient:First, define location update interval values. Adjust this to your needs.Have your Activity implement GooglePlayServicesClient.ConnectionCallbacks, GooglePlayServicesClient.OnConnectionFailedListener, and LocationListener.Then, set up a LocationClientin the onCreate() method of your Activity:Add the required methods to your Activity; onConnected() is the method that is called when the LocationClientconnects. onLocationChanged() is where you\'ll retrieve the most up-to-date location.Be sure to connect/disconnect the LocationClient so it\'s only using extra battery when absolutely necessary and so the GPS doesn\'t run indefinitely. The LocationClient must be connected in order to get data from it. Get the user\'s location. First try using the LocationClient; if that fails, fall back to the LocationManager.Actualy we can use the two providers both. And they just share a public listener:This is necessary because the OnLocationChanged() method always need to be called in time.I have written detailed tutorial covering current location here on demonuts.com.You can find more description here and also you can download whole demo source code for better understanding.There are already many answers there but I want to show latest way to get location using Google API, so new programmers can use new method:First of all, put this in gradle filethen implement necessary interfaces  declare instancesput this in onCreate()At last, override necessary methodsDon\'t forget to start GPS in your device before running app. This is the code that provides user current locationcreate Maps Activty:main.xml:and define following permission in manifest:To get and show the user\'s current location, you could also use MyLocationOverlay. Suppose you have a mapView field in your activity. All you would need to do to show the user location is the following:This gets the current location from either the GPS or the network. If both fail, enableMyLocation() will return false.As for the locations of things around the area, an ItemizedOverlay should do the trick.I hope I haven\'t misunderstood your question. Good luck.EDIT: Updated with the latest Location Service API from Google Play Services library (July 2014)I would recommend you to use the new Location Service API, available from the Google Play Services library, which provides a more powerful, high-level framework that automates tasks such as location provider choice and power management. According to the official documentation: "... Location API make it easy for you to build location-aware applications, without needing to focus on the details of the underlying location technology. They also let you minimize power consumption by using all of the capabilities of the device hardware."For further information visit: Making Your App Location-AwareTo see a full example using the latest Location Service API visit: Android LocationClient class is deprecated but used in documentation Even though the answer is already given here. I just wanted to share this to the world incase the come across such scenario.My requirement was that i needed to get a user\'s current location within 30 to 35 seconds at max so here is the solution i made following Nirav Ranpara\'s Answer.1. I made MyLocationManager.java class which handles all the GPS and Network stuff2. I made an Interface (callback) OnLocationDetectectionListener.java in order to communicate the results back to the calling fragment or activity 3. Then i made an MainAppActivty.java Activity that implements OnLocationDetectectionListener interface and here is how i receive my location in it4. Add the following permissions to your manifest fileHope this is helpful to others :)Simple and best way for GeoLocation.A bit late here but what I would in such a situation is to use Google Maps API and mark the nearby locations using lat and long API of google maps. Plus user experience is better if you can show his/her location on a map. No need to bother about the updation of user location or frisking with android api. Let google maps handle the internals for you.@emmby may have got it resolved in his app but for future reference a look at Google maps API for location specific stuff is what I recommend to fellow developers.Edit: Link for displaying user location in google mapsIt requires lots of things in place to get location updates in android,\nrequires lots of bolierplate code.You need to take care ofI have created Android-EasyLocation (small android library) which will take care all this stuff and you can focus on business logic.All you need is extend EasyLocationActivity and thisorCheckout sample app and steps needed here at https://github.com/akhgupta/Android-EasyLocationBy using FusedLocationProviderApi which is the latest API and the best among the available possibilities to get location in Android.\nadd this in build.gradle fileyou can get full source code by this url\nhttp://javapapers.com/android/android-location-fused-provider/ Here\'s what I do:Below is the code for service. You can run it based upon frequency of location update you need.Before I answer, I just want to be upfront about the fact that I\xe2\x80\x99m affiliated with Neura.\nNow to your question. So, instead of wasting your time behind coding to get your user\xe2\x80\x99s location, you can use our SDK. It takes less than 30 mins to integrate. Neura provides you with your user\xe2\x80\x99s location/activity,and you can configure your application accordingly to perform certain tasks after you receive the data. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a few reasons to use Neura over other Activity recognition API\xe2\x80\x99s:
