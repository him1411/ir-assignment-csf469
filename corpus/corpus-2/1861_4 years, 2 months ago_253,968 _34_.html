I would like to understand how the built-in function property works. What confuses me is that property can also be used as a decorator, but it only takes arguments when used as a built-in function and not when used as a decorator.This example is from the documentation:property\'s arguments are getx, setx, delx and a doc string.In the code below property is used as decorator. The object of it is the x function, but in the code above there is no place for an object function in the arguments.And, how are the x.setter and x.deleter decorators created?\nI am confused.The property() function returns a special descriptor object:It is this object that has extra methods:These act as decorators too. They return a new property object:that is a copy of the old object, but with one of the functions replaced.Remember, that the @decorator syntax is just syntactic sugar; the syntax:really means the same thing asso foo the function is replaced by property(foo), which we saw above is a special object. Then when you use @foo.setter(), what you are doing is call that property().setter method I showed you above, which returns a new copy of the property, but this time with the setter function replaced with the decorated method.The following sequence also creates a full-on property, by using those decorator methods.First we create some functions and a property object with just a getter:Next we use the .setter() method to add a setter:Last we add a deleter with the .deleter() method:Last but not least, the property object acts as a descriptor object, so it has .__get__(), .__set__() and .__delete__() methods to hook into instance attribute getting, setting and deleting:The Descriptor Howto includes a pure python sample implementation of the property() type:Documentation says it\'s just a shortcut for creating readonly properties. Sois equivalent toThe first part is simple:is the same asThe next step would be to extend this property with a setter and a deleter. And this happens with the appropriate methods:returns a new property which inherits everything from the old x plus the given setter.x.deleter works  the same way.Here is a minimal example of how @property can be implemented:Otherwise word remains a method instead of a property.This following:Is the same as:Is the same as:Is the same as:Which is the same as :A property can be declared in two ways.You can have a look at few examples I have written about properties in python.
