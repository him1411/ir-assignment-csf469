How could I merge / convert multiple PDF files into one large PDF file?I tried the following, but the content of the target file was not as expected:I need a very simple/basic command line (CLI) solution. Best would be if I could pipe the output of the merge / convert straight into pdf2ps ( as originally attempted in my previously asked question here: Linux piping ( convert -> pdf2ps -> lp) ).Considering that pdfunite is part of poppler it has a higher chance to be installed, usage is also simpler than pdftk:Try the good ghostscript:or even this way for an improved version for low resolution PDFs (thanks to Adriano for pointing this out):In both cases the ouput resolution is much higher and better than this way using convert:In this way you wouldn\'t need to install anything else, just work with what you already have installed in your system (at least both come by default in my rhel).Hope this helps,UPDATE: first of all thanks for all your nice comments!! just a tip that may work for you guys, after googling, I found a superb trick to shrink the size of PDFs, I reduced with it one PDF of 300 MB to just 15 MB with an acceptable resolution! and all of this with the good ghostscript, here it is:cheers!!I\'m sorry, I managed to find the answer myself using google and a bit of luck : )For those interested;I installed the pdftk (pdf toolkit) on our debian server, and using the following command I achieved desired output:This in turn can be piped directly into pdf2ps.Also pdfjoin a.pdf b.pdf will create a new b-joined.pdf with the contents of a.pdf and b.pdfYou can use the convert command directly,e.g.If you want to convert all the downloaded images into one pdf then executeconvert img{0..19}.jpg slides.pdfApache PDFBox\nhttp://pdfbox.apache.org/PDFMerger\nThis application will take a list of pdf documents and merge them, saving the result in a new document.usage: java -jar pdfbox-app-x.y.z.jar PDFMerger "Source PDF files (2 ..n)" "Target PDF file"I like the idea of Chasmo, but I preffer to use the advantages of things likeGiving multiple source files to convert leads to merging them into a common pdf. This command merges all files with .pdfextension in the actual directory into merged.pdf in the parent dir.You can use sejda-console, free and open source.\nUnzip it and run  sejda-console merge -f file1.pdf file2.pdf -o merged.pdfIt preserves bookmarks, link annotations, acroforms etc.. it actually has quite a lot of options you can play with, just run sejda-console merge -h to see them all.Here\'s a method I use which works and is easy to implement.  This will require both the fpdf and fpdi libraries which can be downloaded here:I second the pdfunite recommendation. I was however getting Argument list too long errors as I was attempting to merge > 2k PDF files.I turned to Python for this and two external packages: PyPDF2 (to handle all things PDF related) and natsort (to do a "natural" sort of the directory\'s file names). In case this can help someone:Use PDF tools from python https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pdftools/1.0.6Download the tar.gz file and uncompress it and run the command like belowYou should install pyhton3 before you run the above commandThis tools support the belowYou can find more details in the below link and it is open sourcehttps://github.com/MrLeeh/pdftools
