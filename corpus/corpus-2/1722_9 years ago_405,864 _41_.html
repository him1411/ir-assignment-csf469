How do I find the location of my site-packages directory?There are two types of site-packages directories, global and per user.Global site-packages ("dist-packages") directories are listed in sys.path when you run:For a more concise list run getsitepackages from the site module in Python code:Note: With virtualenvs getsitepackages is not available, sys.path from above will list the virtualenv\'s site-packages directory correctly, though.The per user site-packages directory (PEP 370) is where Python installs your local packages:If this points to a non-existing directory check the exit status of Python and see python -m site --help for explanations.(or just first item with site.getsitepackages()[0])From "How to Install Django" documentation (though this is useful to more than just Django installation) - execute the following from the shell:Formatted for readability (rather than use as a one-liner), that looks like the following:For Ubuntu,...is not correct.It will point you to /usr/lib/pythonX.X/dist-packagesThis folder only contains packages your operating system has automatically installed for programs to run.On ubuntu, the site-packages folder that contains packages installed via setup_tools\\easy_install\\pip will be in /usr/local/lib/pythonX.X/dist-packagesThe second folder is probably the more useful one if the use case is related to installation or reading source code.If you do not use Ubuntu, you are probably safe copy-pasting the first code box into the terminal.This is what worked for me:As others have noted, distutils.sysconfig has the relevant settings:...though the default site.py does something a bit more crude, paraphrased below:(it also adds ${sys.prefix}/lib/site-python and adds both paths for sys.exec_prefix as well, should that constant be different).That said, what\'s the context? You shouldn\'t be messing with your site-packages directly; setuptools/distutils will work for installation, and your program may be running in a virtualenv where your pythonpath is completely user-local, so it shouldn\'t assume use of the system site-packages directly either.Let\'s say you have installed the package \'django\'. import it and type in dir(django). It will show you, all the functions and attributes with that module. Type in the python interpreter - You can do the same thing if you have installed mercurial.This is for Snow Leopard. But I think it should work in general as well.All the answers (or: the same answer repeated over and over) are inadequate. What you want to do is this:The final line shows you the installation dir. Works on Ubuntu, whereas the above ones don\'t. Don\'t ask me about windows or other dists, but since it\'s the exact same dir that easy_install uses by default, it\'s probably correct everywhere where easy_install works (so, everywhere, even macs). Have fun. Note: original code has many swearwords in it.The native system packages installed with python installation can be found at :/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/by using this small code :However, the list of packages installed via pip can be found at :/usr/local/bin/Or one can simply write the following command to list all paths where python packages are.A side-note: The proposed solution (distutils.sysconfig.get_python_lib()) does not work when there is more than one site-packages directory (as recommended by this article). It will only return the main site-packages directory. Alas, I have no better solution either. Python doesn\'t seem to keep track of site-packages directories, just the packages within them.This works for me.\nIt will get you both dist-packages and site-packages folders.\nIf the folder is not on Python\'s path, it won\'t be\ndoing you much good anyway.Output (Ubuntu installation):An additional note to the get_python_lib function mentioned already: on some platforms different directories are used for platform specific modules (eg: modules that require compilation).  If you pass plat_specific=True to the function you get the site packages for platform specific packages.This should work on all distributions in and out of virtual environment due to it\'s "low-tech" nature. The os module always resides in the parent directory of \'site-packages\'To change dir to the site-packages dir I use the following alias (on *nix systems):Answer to old question. But use ipython for this. This will give the following output about imaplib package -
