I am using Google Maps API (v3) to draw a few maps on a page. One thing I\'d like to do is disable zooming when you scroll the mouse wheel over the map, but I\'m unsure how.I have disabled the scaleControl (i.e. removed the scaling UI element), but this doesn\'t prevent scroll wheel scaling.Here is part of my function (it\'s a simple jQuery plugin):In version 3 of the Maps API you can simply set the scrollwheel option to false within the MapOptions properties:If you were using version 2 of the Maps API you would have had to use the disableScrollWheelZoom() API call as follows:The scrollwheel zooming is enabled by default in version 3 of the Maps API, but in version 2 it is disabled unless explicitly enabled with the enableScrollWheelZoom() API call.Daniel\'s code does the job (thanks a heap!). But I wanted to disable zooming completely. I found I had to use all four of these options to do so:See: MapOptions object specificationJust in case you want to do this dynamically;Sometimes you have to show something "complex" over the map (or the map is a small part of the layout), and this scroll zooming gets in the middle, but once you have a clean map, this way of zooming is nice.Keep it simple! Original Google maps variable, none of the extra stuff.In my case the crucial thing was to set in \'scrollwheel\':false in init. Notice: I am using jQuery UI Map. Below is my CoffeeScript init function heading:Just in case, you are using the GMaps.js library, which makes it a bit simpler to do things like Geocoding and custom pins, here\'s how you solve this issue using the techniques learned from the previous answers.I created a more developed jQuery plugin that allows you to lock or unlock the map with a nice button.This plugin disables the Google Maps iframe with a transparent overlay div and adds a button for unlockit. You must press for 650 milliseconds to unlock it.You can change all the options for your convenience. Check it at https://github.com/diazemiliano/googlemaps-scrollpreventHere\'s some example.For someone that wondering how to disable the Javascript Google Map APIIt will enable the zooming scroll if you click the map once. And disable after your mouse exit the div.Here is some example\nJust incase anybody is interested in a pure css solution for this. The following code overlays a transparent div over the map, and moves the transparent div behind the map when it is clicked. The overlay prevents zooming, once clicked, and behind the map, zooming is enabled. See my blog post Google maps toggle zoom with css for an explanation how it works, and pen codepen.io/daveybrown/pen/yVryMr for a working demo.Disclaimer: this is mainly for learning and probably won\'t be the best solution for production websites.HTML: CSS:A simple solution:Source: https://github.com/Corsidia/scrolloffYou just need to add in map options:Use that piece of code, that will give you all the color and zooming control of google map. (scaleControl: false and scrollwheel: false will prevent the mousewheel from zoom up or down)I do it with this simple exampsjQueryCSSOr use the gmap options
