How can I send data from one activity (intent) to another?I use this code to send data:First, get the intent which has started your activity using the getIntent() method:If your extra data is represented as strings, then you can use intent.getStringExtra(String name) method. In your case:In the receiving activityInstead of initializing another new Intent to receive the data, just do this:If used in a FragmentActivity, try this:The first page extends FragmentActivityIn the fragment, you just need to call getActivity() first,The second page extends Fragment:If you are trying to get extra data in fragments then you can try using :  Place data using:Get data using:Just a suggestion:Instead of using "id" or "name" in your i.putExtra("id".....), I would suggest, when it makes sense, using the current standard fields that can be used with putExtra(), i.e. Intent.EXTRA_something.A full list can be found at Intent (Android Developers).You can also do like this\n// put value in intent// get value from intentWe can do it by simple means:In FirstActivity:In SecondActivity:To access data from Intent you should know two things.There are different methods in Intent class to extract different kind of data types.\nIt looks like this \nSo if you know the datatype of your varibale which you set in otherActivity you can use the respective method.      You can see the list of available methods in Official Documentation of Intent.I just posted an answer here that covers this topic in a bit more detail, including some alternatives.It utilises Vapor API, a new jQuery inspired Android framework I wrote to simplify Android dev. Check out the example in that answer for how you can easily pass data between activites.Also it demonstrates VaporIntent, which lets you chain method calls and utilise the overloaded .put(...) method:You can easily pass data around your whole application using Vapor API, so hopefully it\'ll be helpful to you and others during app development.
