What is the difference between g++ and gcc?  Which ones should be used for general c++ development?gcc and g++ are compiler-drivers of the \'Gnu Compiler Collection\' (which was once upon a time just the \'Gnu C Compiler\').Even though they automatically determine which backends (cc1 cc1plus ...) to call depending on the file-type, unless overridden with -x language, they have some differences.The probably most important difference in their defaults is which libraries they link against automatically.According to [1] and [2], g++ is equivalent to gcc -xc++ -lstdc++ -shared-libgcc (the 1st is a compiler option, the 2nd two are linker options). This can be checked by running both with the -v option (it displays the backend toolchain commands being run).GCC: GNU Compiler Collectiongcc: GNU C      Compiler\ng++: GNU C++ CompilerThe main differences:Extra Macros when compiling *.cpp files:For c++ you should use g++.It\'s the same compiler (e.g. the GNU compiler collection). GCC or G++ just choose a different front-end with different default options.In a nutshell: if you use g++ the frontend will tell the linker that you may want to link with the C++ standard libraries. The gcc frontend won\'t do that (also it could link with them if you pass the right command line options). Although the gcc and g++ commands do very similar things, g++ is designed to be the command you\'d invoke to compile a C++ program; it\'s intended to automatically do the right thing.Behind the scenes, they\'re really the same program.  As I understand, both decide whether to compile a program as C or as C++ based on the filename extension.  Both are capable of linking against the C++ standard library, but only g++ does this by default.  So if you have a program written in C++ that doesn\'t happen to need to link against the standard library, gcc will happen to do the right thing; but then, so would g++.  So there\'s really no reason not to use g++ for general C++ development.\xe2\x80\x9cGCC\xe2\x80\x9d is a common shorthand term for the GNU Compiler Collection. This is both the most general name for the compiler, and the name used when the emphasis is on compiling C programs (as the abbreviation formerly stood for \xe2\x80\x9cGNU C Compiler\xe2\x80\x9d).When referring to C++ compilation, it is usual to call the compiler \xe2\x80\x9cG++\xe2\x80\x9d. Since there is only one compiler, it is also accurate to call it \xe2\x80\x9cGCC\xe2\x80\x9d no matter what the language context; however, the term \xe2\x80\x9cG++\xe2\x80\x9d is more useful when the emphasis is on compiling C++ programs.You could read more here.I became interested in the issue and perform some experimentsI found that description here, but it is very short.Then I tried to experiment with gcc.exe and g++.exe on my windows machine:I tried to compile c89, c99, and c++1998 simple test files and It\'s work well for me with correct extensions matching for languageBut when I try to run "gnu compiler collection" tool in that fashion:But this one still work with no errorsAnd this alsop.s. Test filesFindings:If look at process tree then it seems that gcc, and g++ is backend to other tools, which in my environment are: cc1plus.exe, cc1.exe, collect2.exe, as.exe, ld.exegcc works fine as metatool for if you have correct extension or set correct\n-std -x flags. See thisThe only notable difference is that i you pass a .c to gcc it will compile as C, whereas g++ will always treat it as C++What is the difference between g++ and gcc?gcc has evolved from a single language "GNU C Compiler" to be a multi-language "GNU Compiler Collection".  The term "GNU C Compiler" is still used sometimes in the context of C programming.The g++ is the C++ compiler for the GNU Compiler Collection. Like gnat is the Ada compiler for gcc. see Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)For example on Ubuntu 16.04, man g++ returns the GCC(1) manual page.The man gcc states that ...g++ accepts mostly the same options as gccand that the default ...... use of gcc does not add the C++ library.  g++ is a program\n  that calls GCC and automatically specifies linking against the C++\n  library.  It treats .c, .h and .i files as C++ source files instead of\n  C source files unless -x is used.  This program is also useful when\n  precompiling a C header file with a .h extension for use in C++\n  compilations.Search the gcc man pages for mores particulars on the option variances of gcc and g++.  Which one should be used for general c++ development?Either gcc or g++ can be used for general C++ development with applicable option settings.  However, g++ default behavior is more naturally aligned to a C++ centric development.gcc and g ++ are both GNU compiler. They both compile c and c++. The difference is for *.c files gcc treats it as a c program, and g++ sees it as a c ++ program. *.cpp files are considered to be c ++ programs. c++ is a super set of c and the syntax is more strict, so be careful about the suffix.I was testing gcc and g++ in a linux system. By using MAKEFILE, I can define the compliler used by "GNU make". I tested with the so called "dynamic memory" locating feature of "C plus plus" by :Only g++ can successfully compile on my computer while gcc will report errorSo my own conclusion is gcc does not fully support "C plus plus". It seems that choosing g++ for C++ source files is a better option.
