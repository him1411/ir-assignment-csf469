I am using the autocomplete feature of jQuery. When I try to retrieve the list of more then 17000 records (each won\'t have more than 10 char length), it\'s exceeding the length and throws the error:Exception information: \n      Exception type: InvalidOperationException \n      Exception message: Error during serialization or deserialization using the JSON JavaScriptSerializer. The length of the string exceeds the value set on the maxJsonLength property.Can I set an unlimited length for maxJsonLength in web.config? If not, what is the maximum length I can set?NOTE: this answer applies only to Web services, if you are returning JSON from a Controller method, make sure you read this SO answer below as well: https://stackoverflow.com/a/7207539/1246870The MaxJsonLength property cannot be unlimited, is an integer property that defaults to 102400 (100k).You can set the MaxJsonLength property on your web.config:If you are using MVC 4, be sure to check out this answer as well.If you are still receiving the error:your problem is is likely that:The value of the MaxJsonLength property applies only to the internal JavaScriptSerializer instance that is used by the asynchronous communication layer to invoke Web services methods. (MSDN: ScriptingJsonSerializationSection.MaxJsonLength Property)Basically, the "internal" JavaScriptSerializer respects the value of maxJsonLength when called from a web method; direct use of a JavaScriptSerializer (or use via an MVC action-method/Controller) does not respect the maxJsonLength property, at least not from the systemWebExtensions.scripting.webServices.jsonSerialization section of web.config.As a workaround, you can do the following within your Controller (or anywhere really):This answer is my interpretation of this asp.net forum answer.In MVC 4 you can do:in your controller.You can configure the max length for json requests in your web.config file:The default value for maxJsonLength is 102400. For more details, see this MSDN page: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb763183.aspxI was having this problem in ASP.NET Web Forms. It was completely ignoring the web.config file  settings so I did this:Of course overall this is terrible practice. If you are sending this much data in a web service call you should look at a different approach.I fixed it.It works very well.if, after implementing the above addition into your web.config, you get an \xe2\x80\x9cUnrecognized configuration section system.web.extensions.\xe2\x80\x9d error then try adding this to your web.config in the <ConfigSections> section:if you are still getting error after web.config setting like following:\n   I solved it using following:I hope this should help. If you are getting this error from the MiniProfiler in MVC then you can increase the value by setting the property MiniProfiler.Settings.MaxJsonResponseSize to the desired value. By default, this tool seems to ignore the value set in config.Courtesy mvc-mini-profiler.you can write this line into Controlleryou can also write this line into web.config` To be on the safe side, use both.The question really is whether you really need to return 17k records? How are you planning to handle all the data in the browser? The users are not going to scroll through 17000 rows anyway.A better approach is to retrieve only a "top few" records and load more as needed.I followed vestigal\'s answer and got to this solution:When I needed to post a large json to an action in a controller, I would get the famous "Error during deserialization using the JSON JavaScriptSerializer. The length of the string exceeds the value set on the maxJsonLength property.\\r\\nParameter name: input value provider".What I did is create a new ValueProviderFactory, LargeJsonValueProviderFactory, and set the MaxJsonLength = Int32.MaxValue in the GetDeserializedObject method}Then, in the Application_Start method from Global.asax.cs, replace the ValueProviderFactory with the new one:It appears that there is no "unlimited" value. The default is 2097152 characters, which is equivalent to 4 MB of Unicode string data.As as already been observed, 17,000 records are hard to use well in the browser. If you are presenting an aggregate view it may be much more efficient to do the aggregation on the server and transfer only a summary in the browser. For example, consider a file system brower, we only see the top of the tree, then emit further requestes as we drill down. The number of records returned in each request is comparatively small. A tree view presentation can work well for large result sets.Just ran into this. I\'m getting over 6,000 records. Just decided I\'d just do some paging. As in, I accept a page number in my MVC JsonResult endpoint, which is defaulted to 0 so it\'s not necessary, like so:Then instead of saying:I say:It\'s very simple. Then, in JavaScript, instead of this:I instead say:And append your records to whatever you were doing with them in the first place. Or just wait until all the calls finish and cobble the results together.I suggest setting it to Int32.MaxValue.You can set it in the config as others have said, or you can set in on an individual instance of the serializer like:For those who are having issues with in MVC3 with JSON that\'s automatically being deserialized for a model binder and is too large, here is a solution.Thanks to http://blog.naver.com/techshare/100145191355 and https://gist.github.com/DalSoft/1588818 for pointing me in the right direction for how to do this. The last link on the first site contains full source code for the solution.I solved the problem adding this code:Simply set MaxJsonLength proprty in MVC\'s Action methodIf you are encountering this sort of issue in View, you can use below method to resolve that. Here Iused Newtonsoft package .use lib\\Newtonsoft.Json.dllSolution for WebForms UpdatePanel:Add a setting to Web.config:https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/981884ScriptRegistrationManager class contains following code:if this maxJsonLength value is a int then how big is its int 32bit/64bit/16bit.... i just want to be sure whats the maximum value i can set as my maxJsonLengthHow about some attribute magic?Then you could either apply it globally using the `` or controller/action-wise.We don\'t need any server side changes. you can fix this only modify by web.config file\nThis helped for me. try this out
