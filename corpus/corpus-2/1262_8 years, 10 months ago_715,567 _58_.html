How do I import a Python module given its relative path?For example, if dirFoo contains Foo.py and dirBar, and dirBar contains Bar.py, how do I import Bar.py into Foo.py?Here\'s a visual representation:Foo wishes to include Bar, but restructuring the folder hierarchy is not an option.Assuming that both your directories are real Python packages (do have the __init__.py file inside them), here is a safe solution for inclusion of modules relatively to the location of the script.I assume that you want to do this, because you need to include a set of modules with your script. I use this in production in several products and works in many special scenarios like: scripts called from another directory or executed with python execute instead of opening a new interpreter.As a bonus, this approach does let you force Python to use your module instead of the ones installed on the system.Warning! I don\'t really know what is happening when current module is inside an egg file. It probably fails too.Be sure that dirBar has the __init__.py file -- this makes a directory into a Python package.You could also add the subdirectory to your Python path so that it imports as a normal script.Just do simple things to import the .py file from a different folder.Let\'s say you have a directory like:Then just keep an empty file in lib folder as namedAnd then useKeep the __init__.py file in every folder of the hierarchy of the import module.If you structure your project this way:Then from Foo.py you should be able to do:Or:Per Tom\'s comment, this does require that the src folder is accessible either via site_packages or your search path. Also, as he mentions, __init__.py is implicitly imported when you first import a module in that package/directory. Typically __init__.py is simply an empty file.The easiest method is to use sys.path.append().However, you may be also interested in the imp module.\nIt provides access to internal import functions.This can be used to load modules dynamically when you don\'t know a module\'s name.I\'ve used this in the past to create a plugin type interface to an application, where the user would write a script with application specific functions, and just drop thier script in a specific directory.Also, these functions may be useful:This is the relevant PEP:http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0328/In particular, presuming dirFoo is a directory up from dirBar...In dirFoo\\Foo.py:The easiest way without any modification to your script is to set PYTHONPATH environment variable. Because sys.path is initialized from these locations:Just run:You sys.path will contains above path, as show below:In my opinion the best choice is to put __ init __.py in the folder and call the file withIt is not recommended to use sys.path.append() because something might gone wrong if you use the same file name as the existing python package. I haven\'t test that but that will be ambiguous.instead of:just in case there could be another dirBar installed and confuse a foo.py reader.If you are just tinkering around and don\'t care about deployment issues, you can use a symbolic link (assuming your filesystem supports it) to make the module or package directly visible in the folder of the requesting module.orNote: A "module" is any file with a .py extension and a "package" is any folder that contains the file __init__.py (which can be an empty file).  From a usage standpoint, modules and packages are identical -- both expose their contained "definitions and statements" as requested via the import command.See: http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.htmlFor this case to import Bar.py into Foo.py, first I\'d turn these folders into Python packages like so:Then I would do it like this in Foo.py:If I wanted the namespacing to look like Bar.whatever, orIf I wanted the namespacing dirBar.Bar.whatever. This second case is useful if you have more modules under the dirBar package.Add an __init__.py file:Then add this code to the start of Foo.py:Relative sys.path example:Based on this answer.Well, as you mention, usually you want to have access to a folder with your modules relative to where your main script is run, so you just import them.Solution:I have the script in D:/Books/MyBooks.py and some modules (like oldies.py). I need to import from subdirectory D:/Books/includes:Place a print(\'done\') in oldies.py, so you verify everything is going OK.  This way always works because by the Python definition sys.path as initialized upon program startup, the first item of this list, path[0], is the directory containing the script that was used to invoke the Python interpreter.If the script directory is not available (e.g. if the interpreter is invoked interactively or if the script is read from standard input), path[0] is the empty string, which directs Python to search modules in the current directory first. Notice that the script directory is inserted before the entries inserted as a result of PYTHONPATH.Another solution would be to install the py-require package and then use the following in Foo.pyLook at the pkgutil module from the standard library. It may help you do what you want.Here\'s a way to import a file from one level above, using the relative path.Basically, just move the working directory up a level (or any relative location), add that to your path, then move the working directory back where it started.Call me overly cautious, but I like to make mine more portable because it\'s unsafe to assume that files will always be in the same place on every computer. Personally I have the code look up the file path first. I use Linux so mine would look like this:That is of course unless you plan to package these together. But if that\'s the case you don\'t really need two separate files anyway.
