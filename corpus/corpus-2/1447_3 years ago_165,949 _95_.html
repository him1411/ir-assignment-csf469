I have an app where the UITableView\'s separator inset is set to custom values - Right 0, Left 0. This works perfectly in iOS 7.x, however in iOS 8.0 I see that the separator inset is set to the default of 15 on the right. Even though in the xib files it set to 0, it still shows up incorrectly.How do I remove the UITableViewCell separator margins?iOS 8.0 introduces the layoutMargins property on cells AND table views.This property isn\'t available on iOS 7.0 so you need to make sure you check before assigning it!Additionally, Apple has added a property to your cell that will prevent it from inheriting your Table View\'s margin settings. When this property is set, your cells are allowed to configure their own margins independently of the table view. Think of it as an override.This property is called preservesSuperviewLayoutMargins, and setting it to NO will allow the cell\'s layoutMargin setting to override whatever layoutMargin is set on your TableView. It both saves time (you don\'t have to modify the Table View\'s settings), and is more concise. Please refer to Mike Abdullah\'s answer for a detailed explanation.NOTE: what follows is a clean implementation for a cell-level margin setting, as expressed in Mike Abdullah\'s answer. Setting your cell\'s preservesSuperviewLayoutMargins=NO will ensure that your Table View does not override the cell settings. If you actually want your entire table view to have consistent margins, please adjust your code accordingly.Setup your cell margins:Setting the preservesSuperviewLayoutMargins property on your cell to NO should prevent your table view from overriding your cell margins. In some cases, it seems to not function properly.If all fails, you may brute-force your Table View margins:...and there you go! This should work on iOS 7 and 8.EDIT: Mohamed Saleh brought to my attention a possible change in iOS 9. You may need to set the Table View\'s cellLayoutMarginsFollowReadableWidth to NO if you want to customize insets or margins. Your mileage may vary, this is not documented very well.This property only exists in iOS 9 so be sure to check before setting.(above code from iOS 8 UITableView separator inset 0 not working)EDIT: Here\'s a pure Interface Builder approach:\nNOTE: iOS 11 changes & simplifies much of this behavior, an update will be forthcoming...Arg!!! After playing around either doing this in your Cell subclass: or setting the cell.layoutMargins = UIEdgeInsetsZero; fixed it for me. Let\'s take a moment to understand the problem before blindly charging in to attempt to fix it.A quick poke around in the debugger will tell you that separator lines are subviews of UITableViewCell. It seems that the cell itself takes a fair amount of responsibility for the layout of these lines.iOS 8 introduces the concept of layout margins. By default, a view\'s layout margins are 8pt on all sides, and they\'re inherited from ancestor views.As best we can tell, when laying out out its separator line, UITableViewCell chooses to respect the left-hand layout margin, using it to constrain the left inset.Putting all that together, to achieve the desired inset of truly zero, we need to:Put like that, it\'s a pretty simple task to achieve:Things to note:I believe this is the same question that I asked here: Remove SeparatorInset on iOS 8 UITableView for XCode 6 iPhone SimulatorIn iOS 8, there is one new property for all the objects inherit from UIView. So, the solution to set the SeparatorInset in iOS 7.x will not be able to remove the white space you see on the UITableView in iOS 8. The new property is called "layoutMargins".The solution:-If you set cell.layoutMargins = UIEdgeInsetsZero; without checking if the layoutMargins exists, the app will crash on iOS 7.x. So, the best way would be checking if  the layoutMargins exists first before setLayoutMargins:UIEdgeInsetsZero.You can use UIAppearance once, at your application startup (before UI is loaded), to set it as default global settings:This way, you keep your UIViewController\'s code clean and can always override it if you want.iOS introduces the layoutMargins property on cells AND table views.This property isn\'t available in iOS 7.0 so you need to make sure you check before assigning it!However, Apple has added a property called preservesSuperviewLayoutMargins to your cell that will prevent it from inheriting your Table View\'s margin settings. This way, your cells can configure their own margins independently of the table view. Think of it as an override.This property is called preservesSuperviewLayoutMargins, and setting it to NO can allow you to override your Table View\'s layoutMargin settings with your own cell\'s layoutMargin setting. It both saves time (you don\'t have to modify the Table View\'s settings), and is more concise. Please refer to Mike Abdullah\'s answer for a detailed explanation.NOTE: this is the proper, less messy implementation, as expressed in Mike Abdullah\'s answer; setting your cell\'s preservesSuperviewLayoutMargins=NO will ensure that your Table View does not override the cell settings.First step - Setup your cell margins:Setting the preservesSuperviewLayoutMargins property on your cell to NO should prevent your table view from overriding your cell margins. In some cases, it seems not to function properly.Second step - Only if all fails, you may brute-force your Table View margins:...and there you go! This should work on iOS 8 as well as iOS 7.Note: tested using iOS 8.1 and 7.1, in my case I only needed to use the first step of this explanation.The Second Step is only required if you have unpopulated cell beneath the rendered cells, ie. if the table is larger than the number of rows in the table model. Not doing the second step would result in different separator offsets.In Swift it\'s slightly more annoying because layoutMargins is a property, so you have to override the getter and setter.This will effectively make layoutMargins readonly, which in my case is fine.For iOS 9 you need to add:For more details please refer to question.I just wanted to share an extension I made to remove the margins from the tableview cell separators.Used in context:Swift:I made it work by doing this:For me the simple line did the jobAs to what cdstamper suggested instead of the table view, adding below lines in the cell\'s layoutSubview method works for me.Swift 3.0 example:(After much investigation here\'s the right way to handle this IMHO)To fully control both separator insets and layout margins on each cell. You only need this code in your tableview delegate. Nothing else is required on iOS8 or iOS9.The cell object controls the separator, and the contentView controls everything else. If your separator inset spaces are showing up in an unexpected color this should solve it:Simple solution in Swift for iOS 8 with a custom UITableViewCellIn this way you are setting layoutMargin and separatorInset just one time instead of doing it for each willDisplayCell as most of the above answers suggest. If you are using a custom UITableViewCell this is the correct place to do it. \nOtherwise you should do it in tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath.Just another hint: you don\'t need to set preservesSuperviewLayoutMargins = false because default value is already NO!Use below code snippet avoid unwanted padding issue for UITableView in IOS 8 & 7.This is the code that\'s working for me, in Swift:This seems the cleanest to me (for now), as all the cell/tableView edge/margin adjustments are done in the tableView:willDisplayCell:forRowAtIndexPath: method, without cramming unneccessary code into tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:.Btw, I\'m only setting the cell\'s left separatorInset/layoutMargins, because in this case I don\'t want to screw up my constraints that I have set up in my cell.Code updated to Swift 2.2 :Just add below code can solve this program. Good luck to you!Most answers are showing separator insets and layout margins being set over a variety of methods (i.e., viewDidLayoutSubviews, willDisplayCell, etc) for cells and tableviews, but I\'ve found that just putting these in cellForRowAtIndexPath works great. Seems like the cleanest way.Instead of updating preservesSuperviewLayoutMargins and layoutMargins every time the cell scrolls in (using willDisplayCell), I\'d suggest to do it once in cellForRowAtIndexPath::Lukasz answer in Swift:In iOS8:Adding this to my UITableViewCell Subclass: and this to "tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath" or "tableView:willDisplayCell":WORKED for me.Here\'s an easy way to globally remove the inset.In UITableViewCell+Extensions.swift:In AppDelegate application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions::You might think to a) also just override separatorInset in the extension, or b) set the appearance proxy for layoutMargins, instead. Neither will work. Even though separatorInset is indicated to be a property, attempting to override it as a property (or method) generates compiler errors. And setting the appearance proxy for UITableViewCell\'s layoutMargins (or, for that matter, also setting the appearance proxies for UITableView\'s layoutMargins and separatorInset) has no effect.After having seen the answers at floor 3, I tried to figure out what the relationship of setting up the separator between TableView & TableViewCell and did some test. Here are my conclusions:we can consider that setting the cell\'s separator to zero has to move the separator in two steps: first step is to set cell\'s separatorinset to zero. second step is to set cell\'s marginlayout to zero.set the TableView\'s separatorinset and marginlayout can affect the Cell\'s separatorinset. However, from the test, I find that the TableView\'s separatorinset seem to be useless, TableView\'s marginlayout can actually affect cell\'s marginlayout.set Cell\'s PreservesSuperviewLayoutMargins = false, can cut off TableView\'s marginlayout effect on Cells.one of the solutions: This is my solution. This applies to the custom cell subclass, just add them both to the subclass.2.And it is convenient that you can customize the position of the separator without asking your designer to draw one for you..........For any specific cell you want to hide the separator.In a more compact way than the most voted answer...}Adding this snippet, simple elegant in Swift works for me in iOS8 :)This worked perfectly for me in iOS 8 and  iOS 9.For OBJ-C
