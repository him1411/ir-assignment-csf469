I want to use multiple private keys to connect to different servers or different portions of the same server (My uses are admin of server, admin of git, and normal git usage within the same server). I tried simply stacking the keys in the id_rsa files to no avail.Apparently straightforward way to do this is use the command That is quite cumbersome.Any suggestions as to how to go about doing this a bit easier?From my .ssh/config:And so on.The answer from Randal Schwartz almost helped me all the way.\nI have a different username on the server, so I had to add the User keyword to my file:Now you can connect using the friendly-name:More keywords can be found on the OpenSSH man page. NOTE: Some of the keywords listed might already be present in your /etc/ssh/ssh_config file.make sure you test it before adding with: If you have any problems with errors sometimes changing the security of the file helpsYou can instruct ssh to try multiple keys in succession when connecting. Here\'s how:This way you don\'t have to specify what key works with which server. It\'ll just use first working key.Also you would only enter a passphrase if a given server is willing to accept the key. As seen above ssh didn\'t try to ask for a password for .ssh/id_rsa even if it has one.Surely it doesn\'t outbeat a per-server configuration as in other answers, but at least you won\'t have to add a configuration for all and every server you connect to!I would agree with Tuomas about using ssh-agent. I also wanted to add a second private key for work and this tutorial worked like a charm for me.Steps are as below :The above answers have properly explained the way to create a config file to manage multiple ssh keys.I think, the important thing that aslo needs to explained is the replacement of host name with alias name while cloning the repo.Suppose, your company\'s github account\'s username is abc1234\nand suppose your personal github account\'s username is jack1234And, suppose you have created two rsa keys namely id_rsa_company and id_rsa_personal. So,your config file will look like below: Now, when you are cloning the repo (named demo) from the company\'s github account,the repository url will be something like:Now ,while doing git clone, you should modify the the above repository url as:Notice how github.com is now replaced with the alias "company" as we have defined in the config file.Similary, you have to modify the clone url of the repo in personal account depending upon the alias provided in the config file.Generate SSH key:  Generate another SSH key:  Now, two public keys (id_rsa.pub, accountB.pub) should be exists in the ~/.ssh/ directory.Create config file ~/.ssh/config with the following contentes:Host bitbucket.org\n  User git\n  Hostname bitbucket.org\n  PreferredAuthentications publickey\n  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa  Host bitbucket-accountB\n  User git\n    Hostname bitbucket.org\n    PreferredAuthentications publickey\n    IdentitiesOnly yes\n    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/accountB  Clone from default account. Clone from accountB account.See More HereUse ssh-agent for your keys.Had run into this issue a while back, when I had two bitbucket accounts and wanted to had to store separate ssh keys for both, this is what worked for me.\nI created two separate ssh configs as followsNow when I had to clone a repo from my work account - the command was as followsgit clone git@bitbucket.org:teamname/project.gitI had to modify this command to git clone git@work.bitbucket.org:teamname/project.gitSimilarly the clone command from my personal account had to be modified to git clone git@personal.bitbucket.org:name/personalproject.gitRefer this link for more informationYou can create a config file named config in your ~/.ssh folder. It can contain .\n    Host aws\n        HostName yourip\n        User youruser\n        IdentityFile idFileThis will allow you to connect to machines like this\n     ssh awsOn Centos 6.5 running OpenSSH_5.3p1, OpenSSL 1.0.1e-fips, I solved the problem by renaming my key files so that none of them had the default name. My .ssh directory contains id_rsa_foo and id_rsa_bar but no id_rsa, etc. IMPORTANT: You must start ssh-agentYou must start ssh-agent (if it is not running already) before using ssh-add as follows:Note that the eval command starts the agent on GIT bash on windows. Other environments may use a variant to start the SSH agent.
