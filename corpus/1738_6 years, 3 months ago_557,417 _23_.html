I am trying to search how to pass parameters in a Bash function, but what comes up is always how to pass parameter from the command line. I would like to pass parameters within my script. I tried:But the syntax is not correct, how to pass a parameter to my function?There are two typical ways of declaring a function. I prefer the second approach.or To call a function with arguments:The function refers to passed arguments by their position (not by name), that is $1, $2, and so forth. $0 is the name of the script itself.Example:Also, you need to call your function after it is declared. Output:Reference: Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide.Knowledge of high level programming languages (C/C++/Java/PHP/Python/Perl ...) would suggest to the layman that bash functions should work like they do in those other languages. Instead, bash functions work like shell commands and expect arguments to be passed to them in the same way one might pass an option to a shell command (ls -l). In effect, function arguments in bash are treated as positional parameters ($1, $2..$9, ${10}, ${11}, and so on). This is no surprise considering how getopts works. Parentheses are not required to call a function in bash.(Note: I happen to be working on Open Solaris at the moment.)Miss out the parens and commas:and the function should look like this:Just to add to what\'s already been said - if you prefer named parameters, it\'s possible (with a few tricks) to actually pass named parameters to functions (also makes it possible to pass arrays).The method I developed allows you to define named parameters passed to a function like this:In other words, not only you can call your parameters by their names (which makes up for a more readable core), you can actually pass arrays (and references to variables - this feature works only in bash 4.3 though)! Plus, the mapped variables are all in the local scope, just as $1 (and others). The code that makes this work is pretty light and works both in bash 3 and bash 4 (these are the only versions I\'ve tested it with). If you\'re interested in more tricks like this that make developing with bash much nicer and easier, you can take a look at my Bash Infinity Framework, the code below was developed for that purpose.I hope this example can help you. It takes two numbers from the user, feeds them to the function called add (in the very last line of the code), and add will sum them up and print them.Thought I\'d pipe in with mention of another way to pass named parameters to bash... passing by reference.  This is supported as of bash 4.0An alternative syntax for bash 4.3 is using a namerefAlthough the nameref is a lot more convenient in that it seamlessly dereferences, some older supported distros still ship an older version so I won\'t recommend it quite yet.
