Got a complex SELECT query, from which I would like to insert all rows into a table variable, but T-SQL doesn\'t allow it.Along the same lines, you cannot use a table variable with SELECT INTO or INSERT EXEC queries.\n  http://odetocode.com/Articles/365.aspxShort example:The data in the table variable would be later used to insert/update it back into different tables (mostly copy of the same data with minor updates). The goal of this would be to simply make the script a bit more readable and more easily customisable than doing the SELECT INTO directly into the right tables.\nPerformance is not an issue, as the rowcount is fairly small and it\'s only manually run when needed.\n...or just tell me if I\'m doing it all wrong.Try something like this:The purpose of SELECT INTO is (per the docs, my emphasis)To create a new table from values in another tableBut you already have a target table! So what you want isThe INSERT statement adds one or more new rows to a tableYou can specify the data values in the\n  following ways: ...By using a SELECT subquery to specify\n  the data values for one or more rows,\n  such as: And in this syntax, it\'s allowed for MyTable to be a table variable.You can also use common table expressions to store temporary datasets. They are more elegant and adhoc friendly:You could try using temporary tables...You skip the effort toto declare the table that way...\nHelps for adhoc queries...Maynot be good option to put into your app though.Try to use INSERT instead of SELECT INTO:First create a temp table :Step  1:**Step 2: ** Insert Some value in Temp table .Step 3: Declare a table Variable to hold temp table data.Step 4: select value from temp table and insert into table variable.Finally value is inserted from a temp table to  Table variable Step 5: Can Check inserted value in table variable.OK, Now with enough effort i am able to insert into @table using the below : INSERT @TempWithheldTable SELECT\n                                a.SuspendedReason,\n                                a.SuspendedNotes,\n                                a.SuspendedBy ,\n                                a.ReasonCode FROM OPENROWSET(    BULK  \'C:\\DataBases\\WithHeld.csv\',    FORMATFILE =\n  N\'C:\\DataBases\\Format.txt\',\n  ERRORFILE=N\'C:\\Temp\\MovieLensRatings.txt\'\n           ) AS a;The main thing here is selecting columns to insert . One reason to use SELECT INTO is that it allows you to use IDENTITY:This would not work with a table variable, which is too bad...
