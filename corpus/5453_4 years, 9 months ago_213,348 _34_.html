Using the Datepicker the year drop down by default shows only 10 years. The user has to click the last year in order to get more years added.How can we set the initial range to be 100 years so that the user will see a large list by default?You can set the year range using this option per documentation here http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-yearRangeor this wayFrom the Docs Default: "c-10:c+10"The range of years displayed in the year drop-down: either relative to today\'s year ("-nn:+nn"), relative to the currently selected year ("c-nn:c+nn"), absolute ("nnnn:nnnn"), or combinations of these formats ("nnnn:-nn"). Note that this option only affects what appears in the drop-down, to restrict which dates may be selected use the minDate and/or maxDate options.This worked perfectly for me.ChangeYear:- When set to true, indicates that the cells of the previous or next month indicated in the calendar of the current month\n  can be selected. This option is used with options.showOtherMonths set\n  to true.YearRange:- Specifies the range of years in the year dropdown. (Default value: \xe2\x80\x9c-10:+10\xe2\x80\xb3)Example:-Refer :- set year range in jquery datepickerPlease use below code We can use + or - sing to increase or decrease the year.Please check below full DEMO LinkDEMOI did this:where 50 is the range from current year.This is a bit late in the day for suggesting this, given how long ago the original question was posted, but this is what I did.I needed a range of 70 years, which, while not as much as 100, is still too many years for the visitor to scroll through.  (jQuery does step through year in groups, but that\'s a pain in the patootie for most people.)The first step was to modify the JavaScript for the datepicker widget:\nFind this code in jquery-ui.js or jquery-ui-min.js (where it will be minimized):And replace it with this:This surrounds the decades (except for the current) with OPTGROUP tags.Next, add this to your CSS file:This hides the decades until the visitor mouses over the base year.  Your visitor can scroll through any number of years quickly.Feel free to use this; just please give proper attribution in  your code.I wanted to implement the datepicker to select the birthdate and I had troubles changing the yearRange as it doesn\'t seemed to work with my version (1.5). I updated to the newest jquery-ui datepicker version here: https://github.com/uxsolutions/bootstrap-datepicker.Then I found out they provide this very helpful on-the-fly tool, so you can config your whole datepicker and see what settings you have to use.That\'s how I found out that the option defaultViewDateis the option I was looking for and I didn\'t find any results searching the web.So for other users: If you also want to provide the datepicker to change the birthdate, I suggest to use this code options:When opening the datepicker you will start with the view to select the years, 20 years ago relative to the current year.
