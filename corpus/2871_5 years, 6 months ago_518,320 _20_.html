How can I convert a List to an Array in Java?Check the code below:I need to populate the array tiendas with the values of tiendasList.Either:or:Note that this works only for arrays of reference types. For arrays of primitive types, use the traditional way:An alternative in Java 8:I think this is the simplest way:I came across this code snippet that solves it.The conversion works as follows: For ArrayList the following works:Example taken from this page: http://www.java-examples.com/copy-all-elements-java-arraylist-object-array-exampleThis is works. Kind of.Then the main method.This (Ondrej\'s answer):Is the most common idiom I see. Those who are suggesting that you use the actual list size instead of "0" are misunderstanding what\'s happening here.

The new instance is instantiated with the passed collection.Try this:
