I am sketching the architecture for a set of programs that share various interrelated objects stored in a database. I want one of the programs to act as a service which provides a higher level interface for operations on these objects, and the other programs to access the objects through that service.I am currently aiming for Python and the Django framework as the technologies to implement that service with. I\'m pretty sure I figure how to daemonize the Python program in Linux. However, it is an optional spec item that the system should support Windows. I have little experience with Windows programming and no experience at all with Windows services.Is it possible to run a Python programs as a Windows service (i. e. run it automatically without user login)? I won\'t necessarily have to implement this part, but I need a rough idea how it would be done in order to decide whether to design along these lines.Edit: Thanks for all the answers so far, they are quite comprehensive. I would like to know one more thing: How is Windows aware of my service? Can I manage it with the native Windows utilities? What is the equivalent of putting a start/stop script in /etc/init.d?Yes you can. I do it using the pythoncom libraries that come included with ActivePython or can be installed with pywin32 (Python for Windows extensions).This is a basic skeleton for a simple service:Your code would go in the main() method\xe2\x80\x94usually with some kind of infinite loop that might be interrupted by checking a flag, which you set in the SvcStop methodThere are a couple alternatives for installing as a service virtually any Windows executable.For Windows Home Server or Windows Server 2003 (works with WinXP too), the Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit Tools comes with utilities that can be used in tandem for this, called instsrv.exe and srvany.exe.  See this Microsoft KB article KB137890 for details on how to use these utils.  For Windows Home Server, there is a great user friendly wrapper for these utilities named aptly "Any Service Installer".  There is another alternative using ServiceInstaller for Windows NT (download-able here) with python instructions available.  Contrary to the name, it works with both Windows 2000 and Windows XP as well.  Here are some instructions for how to install a python script as a service.Installing a Python scriptRun ServiceInstaller to create a new\n  service. (In this example, it is\n  assumed that python is installed at\n  c:\\python25)After installing, open the Control\n  Panel\'s Services applet, select and\n  start the PythonTest service.After my initial answer, I noticed there were closely related Q&A already posted on SO. See also:Can I run a Python script as a service (in Windows)? How?How do I make Windows aware of a service I have written in Python?Although I upvoted the chosen answer a couple of weeks back, in the meantime I struggled a lot more with this topic. It feels like having a special Python installation and using special modules to run a script as a service is simply the wrong way. What about portability and such?I stumbled across the wonderful Non-sucking Service Manager, which made it really simple and sane to deal with Windows Services. I figured since I could pass options to an installed service, I could just as well select my Python executable and pass my script as an option.I have not yet tried this solution, but I will do so right now and update this post along the process. I am also interested in using virtualenvs on Windows, so I might come up with a tutorial sooner or later and link to it here.The simplest way to achive this is to use native command sc.exe:Step by step explanation how to make it work :1- First create a python file according to the basic skeleton mentioned above. And save it to a path for example :  "c:\\PythonFiles\\AppServerSvc.py"2 - On this step we should register our service. Run command prompt as administrator and type as: sc create TestService binpath= "C:\\Python36\\Python.exe c:\\PythonFiles\\AppServerSvc.py" DisplayName= "TestService" start= autothe first argument of binpath is the path of python.exe second argument of binpath  is the path of your python file that we created alreadyDon\'t miss that you should put one space after every "=" sign. Then if everything is ok, you should see [SC] CreateService SUCCESSNow your python service is installed as windows service now. You can see it in Service Manager and registry  under : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\TestService3- Ok now. You can start your service on service manager. You can execute every python file that provides this service skeleton.  pysc: Service Control Manager on PythonExample script to run as a service taken from pythonhosted.org:Create and start serviceStop and delete service
