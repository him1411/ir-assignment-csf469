How to allow multi-line in Android\'s EditText view?By default all the EditText widgets in Android are multi-lined.Here is some sample code:You may find it better to use:This is because android:singleLine is deprecated.This works for me, actually these 2 attributes are important: inputType and lines. Besides, you may need a scrollbar, the code below shows how to make one:This is way i used and its working fine too. Hope, this would help somebody.Cheers! ...Thanks.EditText has singleLine property. You can set in the XML or by calling setSingleLine(false);\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView.html#setSingleLine%28%29Try this,\nadd these lines to your edit text view, i\'ll add mine. make sure you understand itand on your java class make on click listner to this edit text as follows, i\'ll add mine, chane names according to yours.this works fine for meAll of these are nice but will not work in case you have your edittext inside upper level scroll view :) Perhaps most common example is "Settings" view that has so many items that the they go beyond of visible area. In this case you put them all into scroll view to make settings scrollable. In case that you need multiline scrollable edit text in your settings, its scroll will not work.To disable number of lines that was previously assigned in theme use xml attribute: android:lines="@null"I learned this from http://www.pcsalt.com/android/edittext-with-single-line-line-wrapping-and-done-action-in-android/, though I don\'t like the website myself. If you want multiline BUT want to retain the enter button as a post button, set the listview\'s "horizontally scrolling" to false. android:scrollHorizontally="false"If it doesn\'t work in xml, doing it programmatically weirdly works.listView.setHorizontallyScrolling(false);Another neat thing to do is to use android:minHeight along with android:layout_height="wrap_content". This way you can set the size of the edit when it\'s empty, and when the user inputs stuff, it stretches according to how much the user inputs, including multiple lines.
