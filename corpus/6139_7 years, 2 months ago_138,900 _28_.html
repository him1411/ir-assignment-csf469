Is it possible to set the margin or padding for the image which we added with the android:drawableLeft?As cephus mentioned android:drawablePadding will only force padding between the text and the drawable if the button is small enough.When laying out larger buttons you can use android:drawablePadding in conjunction with android:paddingLeft and android:paddingRight to force the text and drawable inward towards the center of the button. By adjusting the left and right padding separately you can make very detailed adjustments to the layout.Here\'s an example button that uses padding to push the text and icon closer together than they would be by default:TextView has an android:drawablePadding property which should do the trick:android:drawablePaddingThe padding between the drawables and the text.Must be a dimension value, which is a floating point number appended\n  with a unit such as "14.5sp". Available units are: px (pixels), dp\n  (density-independent pixels), sp (scaled pixels based on preferred\n  font size), in (inches), mm (millimeters).This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form\n  "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form\n  "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol\n  drawablePadding.android:drawablePadding will only create a padding gap between the text and the drawable if the button is small enough to squish the 2 together.  If your button is wider than the combined width (for drawableLeft/drawableRight) or height (for drawableTop/drawableBottom) then drawablePadding doesn\'t do anything.I\'m struggling with this right now as well.  My buttons are quite wide, and the icon is hanging on the left edge of the button and the text is centered in the middle.  My only way to get around this for now has been to bake in a margin on the drawable by adding blank pixels to the left edge of the canvas with photoshop.  Not ideal, and not really recommended either.  But thats my stop-gap solution for now, short of rebuilding TextView/Button.android:drawablePadding is the easiest way to give padding to drawable icon but You can not give specific one side padding like paddingRight or paddingLeft of drawable icon.To achieve that you have to dig into it.\nAnd If you apply paddingLeft or paddingRight to Edittext then it will place padding to entire Edittext along with drawable icon.Make your drawable resources.xmldefine a shape for your edittext and give it a padding \n    For ExampleThe padding defined in this shape will help in give padding to drawableleft or right\n    ---------------------- Apply this shape on EditViewusing that defined shape as background will give your EditText some style plus margin to drawableLeft.Yes. use drawablePadding as follows,Instead of Button use LinearLayout with ImageView and TextView inside. In child items like ImageView and TextView use android:duplicateParentState="true".You can use android:drawableLeft="@drawable/your_icon" to set the drawable to be shown on the left side. In order to set a padding for the drawable you should use the android:paddingLeft or android:paddingRight to set the left/right padding respectively.You can use a padding for the button and you can play with drawablePadding you can use a specific padding depends where put your drawable, with android:paddingLeft="10dp" or android:paddingBottom="10dp" or android:paddingRight="10dp" or android:paddingTop="10dp"If the size of drawable resouce is fixed, you can do like this: The key here is that:That is, the size of drawable resource plus paddingRight is the paddingLeft.You can see the result in this example Tries to use negative paddingLike:
