I am working on a Android application and created a model with a large number of variables. Since I am planning to add getters and setters for all of them.Is there a shortcut in Android Studio for automatically generating the getters and setters in a given class?Using Alt+ Insert in the editor, you may easily generate getter and setter methods for any fields of your class. This has the same effect as using the Menu Bar -> Code -> Generate...and then using shift or control button, select all the variables you need to add getters and settersIn OSX, \xe2\x8c\x98+N by default.Right-click and choose "Generate..." to see current mapping. You can select multiple fields for which to generate getters/setters with one step.See http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/webhelp/generating-getters-and-setters.htmlAndroid Studio & OSx :Press cmd+n > Generate > Getter and SetterAndroid Studio & Windows :Press Alt + Insert > Generate > Getter and SetterYou can generate getter and setter by following steps:That\'s it. Happy coding!!Android Studio & Windows :You can use AndroidAccessors Plugin of Android Studio to generate getter and setter without m as prefix to methods Ex: mId;\n Will generate getId() and setId() instead of  getmId() and setmId()As noted here, you can also customise the getter/setter generation to take prefixes and suffixes (e.g. m for instance variables) into account. Go to File->Settings and expand Code Style, select Java, and add your prefixes/suffixes under the Code Generation tab.use code=>generate=>getter() and setter() dialog  ,select all the variables ,generate all the getter(),setter() methods at one time.Use Ctrl+Enter on Mac to get list of options to generate setter, getter, constructor etcThis answer deals with your question but is not exactly an answer to it. =) It\'s an interesting library I found out recently and I want to share with you.Project Lombok can generate common methods, such as getters, setters, equals() and hashCode(), toString(), for your classes automatically. It replaces them with annotations reducing boilerplate code. To see an example of code written using Lombok watch a video on the main page or read this article.Example:Android development with Lombok is possible. Lombok should be a compile-time only dependency, as otherwise the entirety of Lombok will end up in your DEX files, wasting precious space. Gradle snippet:There are plugins for IDEs (they are needed to support Lombok features at development time). Also there is Hrisey library which is based on Lombok. Simply put, it\'s Lombok + Parcellable support.Another funny way Type the parameter name anywhere in the object after definition, you will see setter and getter, Just select and click enter :)I tried with Android Studio 2.3Right click on Editor then Select Source -> Generate Getters and Setters or press Alt + Shift + S\nJust in case someone is working with EclipseWindows 8.1 OS | Eclipse Idle LunaDeclare top level variable  private String username Eclipse kindly generate a warning on the left of your screen click that warning and couple of suggestions show up, then select generate.
