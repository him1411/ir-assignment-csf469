Is there a CSS-only way to style a <select> dropdown?I need to style a <select> form as much as humanly possible, without any JavaScript. What are the properties I can use to do so in CSS?This code needs to be compatible with all major browsers:I know I can make it with JavaScript: Example.And I\'m not talking about simple styling. I want to know, what the best we can do with CSS only.I found similar questions on Stack Overflow.And this one on Doctype.com.Here are 3 solutions:To hide the default arrow set appearance: none on the select element, then add your own custom arrow with background-imageBrowser Support:appearance: none has very good browser support (caniuse) - except for ie11- and firefox 34-We can improve this technique and add support for ie10 and ie11 by addingIf ie9 is a concern - we have no way of removing the default arrow (which would mean that we would now have two arrows), but, we could use a funky ie9 selector \nto at least undo our custom arrow - leaving the default select arrow intact.This solution is easy and has good browser support - it should generally suffice.If browser support for ie9- and firefox 34- is necessary then keep reading... (Read more here)Wrap the select element in a div with a fixed width and overflow:hidden.Then give the select element a width of about 20 pixels greater than the div.The result is that the default drop-down arrow of the select element will be hidden (due to the overflow:hidden on the container), and you can place any background image you want on the right-hand-side of the div.The advantage of this approach is that it is cross-browser (Internet Explorer 8 and later, WebKit, and Gecko). However, the disadvantage of this approach is that the options drop-down juts out on the right-hand-side (by the 20 pixels which we hid... because the option elements take the width of the select element).[It should be noted, however, that if the custom select element is necessary only for MOBILE devices - then the above problem doesn\'t apply - because of the way each phone natively opens the select element. So for mobile, this may be the best solution.]If the custom arrow is necessary on Firefox - prior to Version 35 - but you don\'t need to support old versions of IE - then keep reading...(Read more here)The idea here is to overlay an element over the native drop down arrow (to create our custom one) and then disallow pointer events on it.Advantage: Works well in WebKit and Gecko. It looks good too (no jutting out option elements)Disadvantage: Internet Explorer (IE10 and down) doesn\'t support pointer-events, which means you can\'t click the custom arrow. Also, another (obvious) disadvantage with this method is that you can\'t target your new arrow image with a hover effect or hand cursor, because we have just disabled pointer events on them!However, with this method you can use Modernizer or conditional comments to make Internet Explorer revert to the standard built in arrow.NB: Being that Internet Explorer 10 doesn\'t support conditional comments anymore: If you want to use this approach, you should probably use Modernizr. However, it is still possible to exclude the pointer-events CSS from Internet Explorer 10 with a CSS hack described here.It is possible, but unfortunately mostly in Webkit-based browsers to the extent we, as developers, require. Here is the example of CSS styling gathered from Chrome options panel via built-in developer tools inspector, improved to match currently supported CSS properties in most modern browsers:When you run this code on any page within a Webkit-based browser it should change the appearance of the select box, remove standard OS-arrow and add a PNG-arrow, put some spacing before and after the label, almost anything you want.The most important part is appearance property, which changes how the element behaves.It works perfectly in almost all Webkit-based browser, including mobile ones, though Gecko doesn\'t support appearance as well as Webkit, it seems.The select element and its dropdown feature are difficult to style.style attributes for select element by Chris Heilmann confirms what Ryan Dohery said in a comment to the first answer:"The select element is part of the \n  operating system, not the browser chrome. Therefore, it is very \n  unreliable to style, and it does not necessarily make sense to try \n  anyway."The largest inconsistency I\'ve noticed when styling select dropdowns is Safari and Google Chrome rendering (Firefox is fully customizable through CSS). After some searching through obscure depths of the Internet I came across the following, which nearly completely resolves my qualms with WebKit:Safari and Google Chrome fix:This does, however, remove the dropdown arrow. You can add a dropdown arrow using a nearby div with a background, negative margin or absolutely positioned over the select dropdown.*More information and other variables are available in CSS property: -webkit-appearance.<select> tags can be styled through CSS just like any other HTML element on an HTML page rendered in a browser. Below is an (overly simple) example that will position a select element on the page and render the text of the options in blue.Example HTML file (selectExample.html):Example CSS file (selectExample.css):The blog post How to CSS form drop down style no JavaScript works for me, but it fails in Opera though:If style is an important issue using a completely custom widget might help, like the one described in blog post Reinventing a Drop Down with CSS and jQuery.I had this exact problem, except I couldn\'t use images and was not limited by browser support. This should be \xc2\xabon spec\xc2\xbb and with luck start working everywhere eventually.It uses layered rotated background layers to \xc2\xabcut out\xc2\xbb a dropdown arrow, as pseudo-elements wouldn\'t work for the select element. Replace \xc2\xabhotpink\xc2\xbb with your favorite color\xe2\x80\x94I use a variable.I got to your case using Bootstrap. This is the simplest solution that works:Note: the base64 stuff is fa-chevron-down in SVG.Here is a version that works in all modern browsers. The key is using appearance:none which removes the default formatting. Since all of the formatting is gone, you have to add back in the arrow that visually differentiates the select from the input.Working example: https://jsfiddle.net/gs2q1c7p/Use the clip property to crop the borders and the arrow of the select element, then add your own replacement styles to the wrapper:Use a second select with zero opacity to make the button clickable:Coordinates differ between Webkit and other browsers, but a @media query can cover that.ReferencesYes.  You may style any HTML element by its tag name, like this:Of course, you can also use a CSS class to style it, like any other element:Edit this element is not recommended, but if you want to try it\'s like any other HTML element.Edit example:A very nice example that uses :after and :before to do the trick is in Styling Select Box with CSS3 | CSSDeckYou definitely should do it like in Styling select, optgroup and options with CSS. In many ways, background-color and color are just what you would typically need to style options, not the entire select.As of Internet Explorer 10, you can use the ::-ms-expand pseudo element selector to style, and hide, the drop down arrow element. The remaining styling should be similar to other browsers.Here is a basic fork of Danield\'s jsfiddle that applies support for IE10Here\'s a solution based on my favorite ideas from this discussion. This allows styling a  element directly without any additional markup.Works IE10+ with a safe fallback for IE8/9. One caveat for these browsers is that the background image must be positioned and small enough to hide behind the native expand control. http://codepen.io/ralgh/pen/gpgbGxA very good alternative (pure CSS) is this:I found it on the MDN website. It uses Fieldset, radio-buttons and editable input fields and labels to create an awesome editable pseudo-select box. Check this out:https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/4563/editable_select.htmlI know it is not directly answering your question, but it is still worth the look, as you can style "other" elements and simulate a select control without writing any JS code.Have fun! :)This uses a background color for select elements and I removed the image..In modern browsers it\'s relatively painless to style the <select> in CSS. With appearance: none the only tricky part is replacing the arrow (if that\'s what you want). Here\'s a solution that uses an inline data: URI with plain-text SVG:The rest of the styling (borders, padding, colors, etc.) is fairly straightforward.This works in all the browsers I just tried (Firefox 50, Chrome 55, Edge 38, and Safari 10). One note about Firefox is that if you want to use the # character in the data URI (e.g. fill: #000) you need to escape it (fill: %23000).A CSS & HTML only solutionI seems compatible with Chrome, Firefox & IE11. But please leave your feedback regarding other web browsers.As suggested by @Danield answer, I wrap my select in a div (even two divs for x-browser compatibility) to get the expected behavior.See http://jsfiddle.net/bjap2/HTML:Notice the 2 div wrappers.\nAlso notice the extra div added to place the arrow-down button wherever you like (positioned absolutely), here we put it on the left.CSSThe second method in Danield\'s answer (https://stackoverflow.com/a/13968900/280972) can be improved to work with hover-effects and other mouse events. Just make sure that the "button"-element comes right after the select element in the markup. Then target it using the + css-selector:HTML:CSS:This will, however, show the hover effect when hovering anywhere over the select-element, not just over the "button".I\'m using this method in combination with Angular (since my project happens to be an Angular-app anyway), to cover the whole select-element, and let Angular display the text of the selected option in the "button"-element. In this case it makes perfect sense that the hover-effect applies when hovering anywhere over the select. It doesn\'t work without javascript though, so if you want to do this, and your site has to work without javascript, you should make sure that your script adds the elements and classes necessary for the enhancement. That way, a browser without javascript will simply get a normal, unstyled, select, instead of a styled badge that doesn\'t update correctly.There IS a way to style SELECT tags.If there\'s a "size" parameter in the tag, almost any CSS will apply. Using this trick, I\'ve created a fiddle that\'s practically equivalent to a normal select tag, plus the value can be edited manually like a ComboBox in visual languages (unless you put readonly in the input tag).So here\'s a minimal example to see the principle behind:\n(you\'ll need jQuery for the clicking mechanism):Here\'s the fiddle with some more styles:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/dkellner/7ac9us70/(It\'s overstyled of course, just to demonstrate the possibilities.)Notice how  tags don\'t encapsulate the options belonging under them as they normally should; yes this is intentional, it\'s for the styling.  (The well-mannered way would be a lot less stylable.)  And yes they do work perfectly well this way.Before anyone points out the NO-JS part: I know the question said "no Javascript".  To me, this is more like please don\'t bother with plugins, I know they can do it but I need the native way. Understood, no plugins, no extra scripts included, only what fits inside a tag\'s "onclick". The only dependency is jQuery, to avoid the native "document.parentNode.getElementsByTagName" madness. But it can work that way.  So yes, this is a native select tag with native styling and some onclick handlers.  It\'s clearly not "a Javascript solution".Enjoy!
