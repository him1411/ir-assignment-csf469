I have first_name, last_name & alias (optional) which I need to search for. So, I need a query to give me all the names that have an alias set.Only if I could do:So, what is the equivalent to the above?You could do this:If you need to exclude null values and empty strings, the preferred way to do so is to chain together the conditions like so:Chaining these methods together basically checks each condition independently: in the above example, we exclude rows where alias is either null or an empty string, so you get all Name objects that have a not-null, not-empty alias field. The generated SQL would look something like:You can also pass multiple arguments to a single call to exclude, which would ensure that only objects that meet every condition get excluded:Here, rows in which some_field and other_field are true get excluded, so we get all rows where both fields are not true. The generated SQL code would look a little like this:Alternatively, if your logic is more complex than that, you could use Django\'s Q objects:For more info see this page and this page in the Django docs.As an aside: My SQL examples are just an analogy--the actual generated SQL code will probably look different. You\'ll get a deeper understanding of how Django queries work by actually looking at the SQL they generate.Firstly, the Django docs strongly recommend not using NULL values for string-based fields such as CharField or TextField. Read the documentation for the explanation:https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/fields/#nullSolution:\nYou can also chain together methods on QuerySets, I think. Try this:That should give you the set you\'re looking for.From Django 1.8,
