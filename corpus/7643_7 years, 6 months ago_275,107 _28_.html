Sorry if this is duplicate,I would think it would be but couldn\'t find anything.I have a flex application that I am posting data back to a php/mysql server via IE. I haven\'t run into any problems yet, but knowing this ahead of time might save me a bunch of frustration and work. Is there a size limit to posting data via http? This article says no:\nhttp://www.netlobo.com/ie_form_submit.htmlThis discussion says yes:\nhttp://bytes.com/topic/php/answers/538226-what-maximum-limit-using-post-methodAnd it all goes back and forth what I\'m able to find online. So please limit answers to personally tested/verified numbers.I am wanting to post back an XML string that can be quite large (say up to 5mb).If it makes any difference: browser will always be IE (our product requires it), post is coming from and httpService in flex, web server is php, DB is mySql. It depends on a server configuration. If you\'re working with PHP under Linux or similar, you can control it using .htaccess configuration file, like so:And, yes, I can personally attest to the fact that this works :)If you\'re using IIS, I don\'t have any idea how you\'d set this particular value.The url portion of a request (GET and POST) can be limited by both the browser and the server - generally the safe size is 2KB as there are almost no browsers or servers that use a smaller limit.The body of a request (POST) is normally* limited by the server on a byte size basis in order to prevent a type of DoS attack (note that this means character escaping can increase the byte size of the body). The most common server setting is 10MB, though all popular servers allow this to be increased or decreased via a setting file or panel.*Some exceptions exist with older cell phone or other small device browsers - in those cases it is more a function of heap space reserved for this purpose on the device then anything else.Also, in PHP.INI file there is a setting:which in my version of PHP: 5.4.16 defaults to 1000.From the manual:\n"How many input variables may be accepted (limit is applied to $_GET, $_POST and $_COOKIE superglobal separately)"Ref.: http://www.php.net/manual/en/info.configuration.php#ini.max-input-varsYou can post large amount of data by setting php.ini variable: max_input_vars\nDefault size of this variable is 1000 but if you want to sent large amount of data  you have to increase the size accordingly.\nIf you can\'t set the size from ini_set you have to do it through htaccess or by doing changes into php.ini file directly.As David pointed out, I would go with KB in most cases.Note: my form is simple, just a few text boxes, not long text.It is up to the http server to decide if there is a limit.  The product I work on allows the admin to configure the limit.By default, the post request has maximum size of 8mb. But you can modify it according to your requirements.\nThe modification can be done by opening php.ini file (php configuration setting). Findreplace 8 according to your requirements.One of the best solutions for this, you do not use multiple or more than 1,000 input fields. You can concatenate multiple inputs with any special character, for ex. @.See this:Using any script (JavaScript or JScript),With this, you will bypass the max_input_vars issue. If you increase max_input_vars in the php.ini file, that is harmful to the server because it uses more server cache memory, and this can sometimes crash the server.
