How can I detect the page zoom level in all modern browsers? While this thread tells how to do it in IE7 and IE8, I can\'t find a good cross-browser solution.Firefox stores the page zoom level for future access. On the first page load, would I be able to get the zoom level? Somewhere I read it works when a zoom change occurs after the page is loaded.Is there a way to trap the \'zoom\' event?I need this because some of my calculations are pixel-based and they may fluctuate when zoomed.Modified sample given by @tflThis page alerts different height values when zoomed. [jsFiddle]Now it\'s an even bigger mess than it was when this question was first asked. From reading all the responses and blog posts I could find, here\'s a summary. I also set up this page to test all these methods of measuring the zoom level.Edit (2011-12-12): I\'ve added a project that can be cloned: https://github.com/tombigel/detect-zoomHere\'s a binary search for Firefox 4, since I don\'t know of any variable where it is exposed:Thanks for the great summary.For me, for Chrome/Webkit, document.width / jQuery(document).width() did not work. When I made my window small and zoomed into my site such that horizontal scrollbars appeared, document.width / jQuery(document).width() did not equal 1 at the default zoom. This is because document.width includes part of the document outside the viewport.Using window.innerWidth and window.outerWidth worked. For some reason in Chrome, outerWidth is measured in screen pixels and innerWidth is measured in css pixels.You can tryThis will give you browser zoom percentage level. To catch zoom event you can useMy coworker and I used the script from https://github.com/tombigel/detect-zoom.  In addition, we also dynamically created a svg element and check its currentScale property. It works great on Chrome and likely most browsers too. On FF the "zoom text only" feature has to be turned off though.  SVG is supported on most browsers.  At the time of this writing, tested on IE10, FF19 and Chrome28.I found this article enormously helpful. Huge thanks to yonran. I wanted to pass on some additional learning I found while implementing some of the techniques he provided. In FF6 and Chrome 9, support for media queries from JS was added, which can greatly simplify the media query approach necessary for determining zoom in FF. See the docs at MDN here. For my purposes, I only needed to detect whether the browser was zoomed in or out, I had no need for the actual zoom factor. I was able to get my answer with one line of JavaScript:Combining this with the IE8+ and Webkit solutions, which were also single lines, I was able to detect zoom on the vast majority of browsers hitting our app with only a few lines of code.That\'s all you need.This has worked great for me in webkit-based browsers (Chrome, Safari):Doesn\'t seem to work in Firefox though.This also works in WebKit:In Internet Explorer 7, 8 & 9, this works:The "+0.9" is added to prevent rounding errors (otherwise, you would get 104% and 109% when the browser zoom is set to 105% and 110% respectively).In IE6 zoom doesn\'t exists, so it is unnecessary to check the zoom.Your calculations are still based on a number of CSS pixels. They\'re just a different size on the screen now. That\'s the point of full page zoom.What would you want to happen on a browser on a 192dpi device which therefore normally displayed four device pixels for each pixel in an image? At 50% zoom this device now displays one image pixel in one device pixel.What i came up with is :1) Make a position:fixed <div> with width:100% (id=zoomdiv)2) when the page loads :And it worked for me for ctrl+ and ctrl- zooms.or i can add the line to a $(window).onresize() event to get the active zoom levelCode:P.S. : this is my first post, pardon any mistakesI have a solution for this as of Jan 2016. Tested working in Chrome, Firefox and MS Edge browsers. The principle is as follows. Collect 2 MouseEvent points that are far apart. Each mouse event comes with screen and document coordinates. Measure the distance between the 2 points in both coordinate systems. Although there are variable fixed offsets between the coordinate systems due to the browser furniture, the distance between the points should be identical if the page is not zoomed. The reason for specifying "far apart" (I put this as 12 pixels) is so that small zoom changes (e.g. 90% or 110%) are detectable.Reference: \nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/Events/mousemoveSteps: Add a mouse move listenerCapture 4 measurements from mouse events:Measure the distance d_c between the 2 points in the client systemMeasure the distance d_s between the 2 points in the screen systemIf d_c != d_s then zoom is applied. The difference between the two tells you the amount of zoom.N.B. Only do the distance calculations rarely, e.g. when you can sample a new mouse event that\'s far from the previous one.Limitations: Assumes user will move the mouse at least a little, and zoom is unknowable until this time.Didn\'t test this for IE, but if you make an element elem withthen will give you your browser zoom level (including the document.body.style.zoom factor).This is for Chrome, in the wake of user800583 answer ...I spent a few hours on this problem and have not found a better approach, but :So I came to the following ...But this approach has limitations : for example if you play the accordion with the application window (rapidly enlarge and reduce the width of the window) then you will get gaps between zoom levels although the zoom has not changed (may be outerWidth and innerWidth are not exactly updated in the same time).And if you want the factor :I have this solution for mobile only (tested with Android):If you want the zoom level right after the pinch move, you will probably have to set a little timeout because of the rendering delay (but I\'m not sure because I didn\'t test it).This is good:Basically, we have:that should be enough for normal UX. If you need to detect zoom level that might be a sign of bad UI design.Pitch-zoom is harder to track and is not considered currently.here it does not change!:create a simple html file, click on the button. regardless of what zoom level: it will show you the width of 400px (at least with firefox and ie8)This may or may not help anyone, but I had a page I could not get to center correctly no matter what Css tricks I tried so I wrote a JQuery file call Center Page:The problem occurred with zoom level of the browser, the page would shift based upon if you were 100%, 125%, 150%, etc.The code below is in a JQuery file called centerpage.js.From my page I had to link to JQuery and this file to get it work, even though my master page already had a link to JQuery.centerpage.js:Also if you want to center a panel:A workaround for FireFox 16+ to find DPPX (zoom level) purely with JavaScript:This is question was posted like ages back, but today when i was looking for the same answer "How to detect zoom in and out event", i couldn\'t find one answer that would fit all the browsers. As on now : For Firefox/Chrome/IE8 and IE9 , the zoom in and out fires a window.resize event.\nThis can be captured using:
