I am detecting if the user has pressed down for 2 seconds:This is how I handle the long press:The text "double oo" gets printed twice when I press down for longer than 2 seconds. Why is this? How can I fix?UILongPressGestureRecognizer is a continuous event recognizer.  You have to look at the state to see if this is the start, middle or end of the event and act accordingly.  i.e. you can throw away all events after the start, or only look at movement as you need.  From the  Class Reference:Long-press gestures are continuous. The gesture begins (UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan) when the number of allowable fingers (numberOfTouchesRequired) have been pressed for the specified period (minimumPressDuration) and the touches do not move beyond the allowable range of movement (allowableMovement). The gesture recognizer transitions to the Change state whenever a finger moves, and it ends (UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded) when any of the fingers are lifted.Now You Can Track The State Like ThisTo check the state of the UILongPressGestureRecognizer just add an if statement on the selector method:You need to check the correct state, since there are different behaviors for each state. Most likely you\'re going to need the UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan state with the UILongPressGestureRecognizer. ...Objective-CSwift 2.2:Here\'s how to handle it in Swift:Swift 3.0 :your gesture handler receives call for each state of gesture. so you need to put a check for each state and put your code in required state.One must prefer using switch-case over if-else :
