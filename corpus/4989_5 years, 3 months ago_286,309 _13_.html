I have a problem with echo in my script:printsand moves to the next line. In the console it\'s working correcly without newline:There are multiple versions of the echo command, with different behaviors. Apparently the shell used for your script uses a version that doesn\'t recognize -n.The printf command has much more consistent behavior. echo is fine for simple things like echo hello, but I suggest using printf for anything more complicated.What system are you on, and what shell does your script use?bash has a "built-in" command called "echo":Additionally, there is an "echo" command that is a proper executable (that is, the shell forks and execs /bin/echo, as opposed to interpreting echo and executing it):The behavior of either echo\'s WRT to \\c and -n varies.  Your best bet is to use printf, which is available on four different *NIX flavors that I looked at:Try with It works for me as expected (as I understood from your question). Note that I got this information from the man page. The man page also notes the shell may have its own version of echo, and I am not sure if bash has its own version.If you use echo inside an if with other commands, like "read", it might ignore the setting and it will jump to a new line anyway.
