I have a site with the following structure:The navigation is on the left and the content div is on the right. The information for the content div is pulled in through PHP, so it\'s different every time.How to scale the navigation vertically so that its height is the same as the content div\'s height, no matter which page is loaded?NOTE: This answer is applicable to legacy browsers without support for the Flexbox standard. For a modern approach, see: https://stackoverflow.com/a/23300532/1155721I suggest you take a look at Equal Height Columns with Cross-Browser CSS and No Hacks.Basically, doing this with CSS in a browser compatible way is not trivial (but trivial with tables) so find yourself an appropriate pre-packaged solution.Also, the answer varies on whether you want 100% height or equal height. Usually it\'s equal height. If it\'s 100% height the answer is slightly different.For the parent:You should add some prefixes, http://css-tricks.com/using-flexbox/.Edit:\nAs @Adam Garner noted, align-items: stretch; is not needed. Its usage is also for parent, not children. If you want to define children stretching, you use align-self.This is a frustrating issue that\'s dealt with designers all the time. The trick is that you need to set the height to 100% on BODY and HTML in your CSS.This seemingly pointless code is to define to the browser what 100% means. Frustrating, yes, but is the simplest way.I find that setting the two columns to display: table-cell; instead of float: left; works well.If you don\'t mind the navigation div being clipped in the event of an unexpectedly-short content div, there\'s at least one easy way:Elsewise there\'s the faux-columns technique.using jQuery:Try making the bottom margin 100%.height : <percent> will only work if you have all parent nodes with specified percent height with a fixed height in pixels, ems, etc. on top level. That way, the height will cascade down to your element.You can specify 100% to html and body elements as @Travis stated earlier to have the page height cascading down to your nodes.Look at this example.Based on the method described in this article I have created .Less dynamic solution:Html:Less:After long searching and try, nothing solved my problem excepton the children divand for parent apply thisalso I am using bootstrap and this did not corrupt the responsive for me.I know it\'s been a looong time since the question was made, but I found an easy solution and thought someone could use it (sorry about the poor english). Here it goes:CSSHTMLSimple example. Note that you can turn into responsiveness.In RWD project best would be to use jQuery. For small screen you would prabobly want to keep the height auto as the col1, col2 and col3 are stacked one on anoher.However after a media query brak point you would like cols to apear next to each other with equal height for all columns. 1125 px is only an example of window width break point after which you would want to make all columns set to the same height.You could ofcaurse set more break points if you need to. There is a bit of a contradiction in the question\'s title and the content.  The title speaks of a parent div, but the question makes it sound like you want two sibling divs (navigation and content) to be the same height.Do you (a) want both navigation and content to be 100% the height of main, or (b) want navigation and content to be be same height?I\'ll assume (b)...if that is so, I don\'t think you will be able to do it given your current page structure (at least, not with pure CSS and no scripting).  You would probably need to do something like:and set the content div to have a left margin of whatever the width of the navigation pane is.  That way, the content\'s content is to the right of the navigation and you can set the navigation div to be 100% of the content\'s height.EDIT: I\'m doing this completely in my head, but you would probably also need to set the navigation div\'s left margin to a negative value or set it\'s absolute left to 0 to shove it back to the far left.  Problem is, there are many ways to pull this off but not all of them are going to be compatible with all browsers.[Referring to Dmity\'s Less code in another answer] I\'m guessing that this is some kind of "pseudo-code"?From what I understand try using the faux-columns technique that should do the trick.http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fauxcolumns/Hope this helps :)As shown earlier, flexbox is the easiest.\neg. this will align all child elements to the center within the parent element.My solution:The easiest way to do this is to just fake it. A List Apart has covered this extensively over the years, like in this article from Dan Cederholm from 2004.Here\'s how I usually do it:You can easily add a header onto this design by wrapping #container in another div, embedding the header div as #container\'s sibling, and moving the margin and width styles to the parent container. Also, the CSS should be moved into a separate file and not kept inline, etc. etc. Finally, the clearfix class can be found on positioniseverything.
