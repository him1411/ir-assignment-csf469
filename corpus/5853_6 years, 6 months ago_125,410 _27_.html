Using the clear command on the terminal only fools the user into thinking the screen has been cleared...you can still see output from the previous commands when you scroll using the mouse. This makes life difficult when you are drowning in a tsunami of text. Various solutions (escape code etc.) which can be found on the internet are only variations of what the clear command already does.So how do you clear the contents of the bash terminal in Ubuntu for real?Use the following command to do a clear screen instead of merely adding new lines ...yes that\'s a \'printf\' on the bash prompt.You will probably want to define an alias though...So this becomes <ESC>c which is the VT100 escape code for resetting the terminal. Here is some more information on terminal escape codes.Here are a few other ways of doing it...The above does not work on the KDE console (called Konsole) but there is hope! Use the following sequence of commands to clear the screen and the scroll-back buffer...Or perhaps use the following alias on KDE...I got the scroll-back clearing command from here.Try reset.  It clears up the terminal screen but the previous commands can be accessed through  arrow or whichever key binding you have.tput resetThat will do the trick!My favourite human friendly command for this is:Tested on xterm and VT100. It also helps after an abnormal program termination.\nKeeps the command buffer, so up-arrow will cycle through previous commands.cheers :DNone of the answers I read worked in PuTTY, so I found a comment on this article:In the settings for your connection, under "Window->Behavior" you\'ll find a setting "System Menu Appears on ALT alone". Then CTRL+L,ALT,l (that\'s a lower case L) will scroll the screen and then clear the scrollback buffer. (relevant to the OP because I am connecting to an Ubuntu server, but also apparently relevant no matter what your server is running.)The following link will explain how to make that alias permanent so you don\'t have to keep typing it in.https://askubuntu.com/questions/17536/how-do-i-create-a-permanent-bash-aliasThese are the steps detailed at that link.I take no credit for this information just passing it along.With KDE and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and the "Konsole" terminal, none of the posted answers work.  However, pressing default keyboard shortcut CTRL+Shift+X does work!  Source:https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=288913Compile this app.
