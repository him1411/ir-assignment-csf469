I have a std::vector<int>, and I want to delete the n\'th element. How do I do that?To delete a single element, you could do:Or, to delete more than one element at once:The erase method on std::vector is overloaded, so it\'s probably clearer to callwhen you only want to erase a single element.The erase method will be used in two ways:Erasing single element:Erasing range of elements:To delete an element use the following way:for more broad overview you can visit:-\nhttp://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/erase/Actually, the erase function works for two profiles:Removing a single elementRemoving a range of elementsSince std::vec.begin() marks the start of container and if we want to delete the ith element in our vector, we can use:If you look closely, vec.begin() is just a pointer to the starting position of our vector and adding the value of i to it increments the pointer to i position, so instead we can access the pointer to the ith element by:So we can write:The previous answers assume that you always have a signed index. Sadly, std::vector uses size_type for indexing, and difference_type for iterator arithmetic, so they don\'t work together if you have "-Wconversion" and friends enabled. This is another way to answer the question, while being able to handle both signed and unsigned:To remove:To take:If you work with large vectors (size > 100,000) and want to delete lots of elements, I would recommend to do something like this:The code takes every number in vec that can\'t be divided by 3 and copies it to vec2. Afterwards it copies vec2 in vec. It is pretty fast. To process 20,000,000 elements this algorithm only takes 0.8 sec!I did the same thing with the erase-method, and it takes lots and lots of time:If you have an unordered vector you can take advantage of the fact that it\'s unordered and use something I saw from Dan Higgins at CPPCONSince the list order doesn\'t matter, just take the last element in the list and copy it over the top of the item you want to remove, then pop and delete the last item.
