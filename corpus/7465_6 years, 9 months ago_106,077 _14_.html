I\'ve noticed that while working on one or two tickets, if I step away, I\'m not sure what I worked on, what changed, etcetera.Is there a way to see the changes made for a given file before git add and then git commit?You\'re looking for git diff. Depending on your exact situation, there are three useful ways to use it:It\'ll work recursively on directories, and if no paths are given, it shows all changes.Use git-diff:git diff filenamegit diffShow changes between the working tree and the index or a tree, changes between the index and a tree, changes between two trees, or changes between two files on disk.Remember, you\'re committing changes, not files.For this reason, it\'s very rare that I don\'t use git add -p (or the magit equivalent) to add my changes.For me git add -p is the most useful way (and intended I think by git developers?) to review all unstaged changes (it shows the diff for each file), choose a good set of changes that ought to go with a commit, then when you have staged all of those, then use git commit, and repeat for the next commit.  Then you can make each commit be a useful or meaningful set of changes even if they took place in various files.   I would also suggest creating a new branch for each ticket or similar activity, and switch between them using checkout (perhaps using git stash if you don\'t want to commit before switching), though if you are doing many quick changes this may be a pain. Don\'t forget to merge often.path can your be complete system path till the file or \nif you are in the project you paste the modified file path also\nfor Modified files with path use :git statusYou can also use a git-friendly text editor. They show colors on the lines that have been modified, another color for added lines, another color for deleted lines, etc.A good text editor that does this is GitHub\'s Atom 1.0.
