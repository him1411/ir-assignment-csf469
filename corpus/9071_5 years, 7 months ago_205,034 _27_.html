For use in express.js environments. Any suggestions?Before running your app, you can do this in console,Or if you are in windows you could try this:or you can run your app like this:You can also set it in your js file:But I don\'t suggest to do it in your runtime file, since it\'s not easy to open up VIM in your server and change it to production. You can make a config.json file in your directory and everytime your app runs, it reads from it and sets the configuration.in package.json:then run in terminal:export NODE_ENV=production is bad solution, it disappears after restart. if you want not to worry about that variable anymore - add it to this file:don\'t use export syntax, just write (in new line if some content is already there):it works after restart. You will not have to re-enter export NODE_ENV=production command anymore anywhere and just use node with anything you\'d like - forever, pm2...For heroku:which is actually default.This is a good article about NODE_ENV: http://www.hacksparrow.com/running-express-js-in-production-mode.html.For automatically setting from Grunt you can use https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-env plugin.No one mentioned .env in here yet? Make a .env file in your app root, then require(\'dotenv\').config() and read the values. Easily changed, easily read, cross platform.https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenvOn OSX I\'d recommend adding export NODE_ENV=development to your ~/.bash_profile and/or ~/.bashrc and/or ~/.profile.Personally I add that entry to my ~/.bashrc and then have the ~/.bash_profile ~/.profile import the contents of that file, so it\'s consistent across environments.After making these additions, be sure to restart your terminal to pick up settings.For Windows Powershell use commandDaniel has a fantastic answer which is the better approach for the correct deployment (set and forget) process.For those using express. \nYou can use grunt-express-server which is fantastic as well.\nhttps://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-express-serverIf you are on windows. Open your cmd at right folder then firsthit enter then you can start your node withit will start with your env setting
