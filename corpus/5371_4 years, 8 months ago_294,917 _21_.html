I\'m pretty new to AngularJS and I find it a bit awkward. The easy stuff is very easy, but the advanced things are significantly harder (directives, provider / service / factory...)The documentation isn\'t very helpful for someone who\'s just starting to learn those things; and I find myself constantly searching for directives for things I need instead of writing my own.I tried Ember.js and I was much more productive with it, but the API is still being changed significantly so I prefer skipping it for now.Are there any better resources to get into AngularJS properly?This is the most comprehensive AngularJS learning resource repository I\'ve come across:AngularJS-LearningTo pluck out the best parts (in recommended order of learning):Try out these videos egghead.io They are awesome to get startedFor a comprehensive and continually growing collection of links check AngularJS-Learning, a github repo that collects resources, links and interesting blog posts.I\'ve found very helpful the tutorials and videos on the AngularJS youtube channel. They go from the mostly basic stuff to some advanced topics, a good way to start.The official twitter and google+ accounts are a good way to follow news and get some nice links. Also check the AngularJS Mailing list.A nice aggregator of news/link is angularjsdaily.com.Also there\'re some new books out there, so you can keep an eye on your favourite online library.The #angularjs IRC channel on freenode.net is a great way to get real-time responses. Advice for getting help via IRC:The video AngularJS Fundamentals In 60-ish Minutes provides a very good introduction and overview.I would also highly recomend the AngularJS book from O\'Reilly, mentioned by @Atropo.Please keep an eye on the mailing list for problems/solutions discussed by community members. https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/angular . It\'s been really useful to me. Concerning more advanced usage, I find these two pages a must read:This answer is based on the question and title of this book: http://www.packtpub.com/angularjs-web-application-development/book
