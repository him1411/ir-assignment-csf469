I want to create a transparent Activity on top of another activity.How can I achieve this?Add the following style in your res/values/styles.xml file (if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have one, create it.) Here\xe2\x80\x99s a complete file:(The value @color/transparent is the color value #00000000 which I put in the res/values/color.xml file. You can also use @android:color/transparent in later Android versions.)Then apply the style to your activity, for example:It goes like this:With the "AppCompat" library or "Android Design Support Library" it\'s a bit different:In the styles.xml:In the AndroidManifest.xml:Declare your activity in the manifest like this:And add a transparent background to your layout.Assign the translucent theme to the activity that you want to make transparent in the Android manifest file of your project:I wanted to add to this a little bit as I am a new Android developer as well. The accepted answer is great, but I did run into some trouble. I wasn\'t sure how to add in the color to the colors.xml file. Here is how it should be done:In my original colors.xml file I had the tag "drawable":And so I did that for the color as well, but I didn\'t understand that the "@color/" reference meant look for the tag "color" in the XML. I thought that I should mention this as well to help anyone else out.I achieved it on 2.3.3 by just adding android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent" in the activity tag in the manifest.I don\'t know about lower versions...Just let the activity background image be transparent. Or add the theme in the XML file:In the onCreate function, below the setContentView, add this line:In my case, i have to set the theme on the runtime in java based on some conditions. So I created one theme in style (similar to other answers):Then in Java I applied it to my activity:Remember one Important point here: You must call the setTheme() function before super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);. I missed this point and stucked for 2 hours, thinking why my theme is not reflected at run time.The easiest way that I have found is to set the activity\'s theme in the AndroidManifest to android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Holo.Dialog". Then in the activity\'s onCreate method, call getWindow().setBackgroundDrawable(new ColorDrawable(0));.Assign it the Translucent themeI just did two things, and it made my activity transparent. They are below.In the manifest file I just added the below code in the activity tag.And I just set the background of the main layout for that activity as "#80000000". LikeIt perfectly works for me.For dialog activity I use this:But you also need to set your main View in the activity to invisible. Otherwise the background will be invisible while all views in it will be visible.Note 1:In Drawable folder create test.xml and copy the following code//  Note: Corners and shape is as per your requirement.//  Note 2:Create xml:Just add the following line to the activity tag in your manifest file that needs to look transparent.
