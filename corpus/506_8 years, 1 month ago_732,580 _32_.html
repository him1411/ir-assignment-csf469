Just remove that one and init again.If you can\'t find it, it\'s because it is hidden.In Windows 7, you need to go to your folder, click on Organize on the top left, then click on Folder and search options, then click on the View tab and click on the Show hidden files, folders and drives radio button.On a Mac OS:Open a Terminal (via Spotlight: press CMD + SPACE, type terminal and press Enter) and do this command: defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles 1 && killall Finder.Or you could also type cd (the space is important), drag and drop your git repo folder from Finder to the terminal window, press return, then type rm -fr .git, then return again.On Ubuntu, use shortcut Ctrl + H.If you really want to remove all of the repository, leaving only the working directory then it should be as simple as this.The usual provisos about rm -rf apply.

To proceed with the deletion, simply enter y, then Enter.I just collect the ones which work best for me:You can create an alias for it. I am using ZSH shell with Oh-my-Zsh and here is an handy alias:I am using Trash to trash the .git folder since using rm is really dangerous:Then I am re-initializing the git repo:You can use the following command from the command line-Here rm means remove, -rf means recursive force and .git is the repo/file you want to remove.
