Optimizing SQLite is tricky. Bulk-insert performance of a C application can vary from 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second!Background: We are using SQLite as part of a desktop application. We have large amounts of configuration data stored in XML files that are parsed and loaded into an SQLite database for further processing when the application is initialized. SQLite is ideal for this situation because it\'s fast, it requires no specialized configuration, and the database is stored on disk as a single file.Rationale: Initially I was disappointed with the performance I was seeing. It turns-out that the performance of SQLite can vary significantly (both for bulk-inserts and selects) depending on how the database is configured and how you\'re using the API. It was not a trivial matter to figure out what all of the options and techniques were, so I thought it prudent to create this community wiki entry to share the results with StackÂ Overflow readers in order to save others the trouble of the same investigations.The Experiment: Rather than simply talking about performance tips in the general sense (i.e. "Use a transaction!"), I thought it best to write some C code and actually measure the impact of various options. We\'re going to start with some simple data:Let\'s write some code!The Code: A simple C program that reads the text file line-by-line, splits the string into values and then will inserts the data into an SQLite database. In this "baseline" version of the code, the database is created, but we won\'t actually insert data:Running the code as-is doesn\'t actually perform any database operations, but it will give us an idea of how fast the raw C file I/O and string processing operations are.Imported 864913 records in 0.94\n  secondsGreat! We can do 920,000 inserts per second, provided we don\'t actually do any inserts :-)We\'re going to generate the SQL string using the values read from the file and invoke that SQL operation using sqlite3_exec:This is going to be slow because the SQL will be compiled into VDBE code for every insert and every insert will happen in its own transaction. How slow?Imported 864913 records in 9933.61\n  secondsYikes! 2 hours and 45 minutes! That\'s only 85 inserts per second.By default, SQLite will evaluate every INSERT / UPDATE statement within a unique transaction. If performing a large number of inserts, it\'s advisable to wrap your operation in a transaction:Imported 864913 records in 38.03\n  secondsThat\'s better. Simply wrapping all of our inserts in a single transaction improved our performance to 23,000 inserts per second.Using a transaction was a huge improvement, but recompiling the SQL statement for every insert doesn\'t make sense if we using the same SQL over-and-over. Let\'s use sqlite3_prepare_v2 to compile our SQL statement once and then bind our parameters to that statement using sqlite3_bind_text:Imported 864913 records in 16.27\n  secondsNice! There\'s a little bit more code (don\'t forget to call sqlite3_clear_bindings and sqlite3_reset), but we\'ve more than doubled our performance to 53,000 inserts per second.By default, SQLite will pause after issuing a OS-level write command. This guarantees that the data is written to the disk. By setting synchronous = OFF, we are instructing SQLite to simply hand-off the data to the OS for writing and then continue. There\'s a chance that the database file may become corrupted if the computer suffers a catastrophic crash (or power failure) before the data is written to the platter:Imported 864913 records in 12.41\n  secondsThe improvements are now smaller, but we\'re up to 69,600 inserts per second.Consider storing the rollback journal in memory by evaluating PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY. Your transaction will be faster, but if you lose power or your program crashes during a transaction you database could be left in a corrupt state with a partially-completed transaction:Imported 864913 records in 13.50\n  secondsA little slower than the previous optimization at 64,000 inserts per second.Let\'s combine the previous two optimizations. It\'s a little more risky (in case of a crash), but we\'re just importing data (not running a bank):Imported 864913 records in 12.00\n  secondsFantastic! We\'re able to do 72,000 inserts per second.Just for kicks, let\'s build upon all of the previous optimizations and redefine the database filename so we\'re working entirely in RAM:Imported 864913 records in 10.94\n  secondsIt\'s not super-practical to store our database in RAM, but it\'s impressive that we can perform 79,000 inserts per second.Although not specifically an SQLite improvement, I don\'t like the extra char* assignment operations in the while loop. Let\'s quickly refactor that code to pass the output of strtok() directly into sqlite3_bind_text(), and let the compiler try to speed things up for us:Note: We are back to using a real database file. In-memory databases are fast, but not necessarily practicalImported 864913 records in 8.94\n  secondsA slight refactoring to the string processing code used in our parameter binding has allowed us to perform 96,700 inserts per second. I think it\'s safe to say that this is plenty fast. As we start to tweak other variables (i.e. page size, index creation, etc.) this will be our benchmark.I hope you\'re still with me! The reason we started down this road is that bulk-insert performance varies so wildly with SQLite, and it\'s not always obvious what changes need to be made to speed-up our operation. Using the same compiler (and compiler options), the same version of SQLite and the same data we\'ve optimized our code and our usage of SQLite to go from a worst-case scenario of 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second!Before we start measuring SELECT performance, we know that we\'ll be creating indexes. It\'s been suggested in one of the answers below that when doing bulk inserts, it is faster to create the index after the data has been inserted (as opposed to creating the index first then inserting the data). Let\'s try:Create Index then Insert DataImported 864913 records in 18.13\n  secondsInsert Data then Create IndexImported 864913 records in 13.66\n  secondsAs expected, bulk-inserts are slower if one column is indexed, but it does make a difference if the index is created after the data is inserted. Our no-index baseline is 96,000 inserts per second. Creating the index first then inserting data gives us 47,700 inserts per second, whereas inserting the data first then creating the index gives us 63,300 inserts per second.I\'d gladly take suggestions for other scenarios to try... And will be compiling similar data for SELECT queries soon.Several tips:I\'ve also asked similar questions here and here.Try using SQLITE_STATIC instead of SQLITE_TRANSIENT for those inserts. SQLITE_TRANSIENT will cause SQLite to copy the string data before returning. SQLITE_STATIC tells it that the memory address you gave it will be valid until the query has been performed (which in this loop is always the case). This will save you several allocate, copy and deallocate operations per loop. Possibly a large improvement.Avoid sqlite3_clear_bindings(stmt);The code in the test sets the bindings every time through which should be enough.The C API intro from the SQLite docs says Prior to calling sqlite3_step() for the first time or immediately\n  after sqlite3_reset(), the application can invoke one of the\n  sqlite3_bind() interfaces to attach values to the parameters. Each\n  call to sqlite3_bind() overrides prior bindings on the same parameter(see: sqlite.org/cintro.html). There is nothing in the docs for that function saying you must call it in addition to simply setting the bindings.More detail: http://www.hoogli.com/blogs/micro/index.html#Avoid_sqlite3_clear_bindings()Inspired by this post and by the Stack Overflow question that led me here -- Is it possible to insert multiple rows at a time in an SQLite database? -- I\'ve posted my first Git repository:https://github.com/rdpoor/CreateOrUpdatewhich bulk loads an array of ActiveRecords into MySQL, SQLite or PostgreSQL databases. It includes an option to ignore existing records, overwrite them or raise an error. My rudimentary benchmarks show a 10x speed improvement compared to sequential writes -- YMMV.I\'m using it in production code where I frequently need to import large datasets, and I\'m pretty happy with it.  Bulk imports seems to perform best if you can chunk your INSERT/UPDATE statements.  A value of 10,000 or so has worked well for me on a table with only a few rows, YMMV...If you care only about reading, somewhat faster (but might read stale data) version is to read from multiple connections from multiple threads (connection per-thread).First find the items, in the table:then read in pages (LIMIT/OFFSET)where  and  are calculated per-thread, like this:for each thread:For our small (200mb) db this made 50-75% speed-up (3.8.0.2 64-bit on Windows 7). Our tables are heavily non-normalized (1000-1500 columns, roughly 100,000 or more rows).Too many or too little threads won\'t do it, you need to benchmark and profile yourself.Also for us, SHAREDCACHE made the performance slower, so I manually put PRIVATECACHE (cause it was enabled globally for us)I coudn\'t get any gain from transactions until I raised cache_size to a higher value i.e.  PRAGMA cache_size=10000;After reading this question I tried to implement it to my program. I have 4-5 files that contain addresses. Each file has approx 30 million records. I am using the same configuration that you are suggesting but my number of INSERTs per second are way low (10.000 records per sec). So here is where your suggestion fails. You use a single transaction for all the records and a single insert. But what if a record is broken and you are splitting the record to multiple inserts on different tables?The ON CONFLICT command does not apply, cause if you have 10 elements in a record and you need each element inserted to a different table, if element 5 gets a CONSTRAINT error, then all the previous 4 inserts need to go too. So here is where the rollback comes. But if you do a rollback, then you lose all your inserts and start from the top.My solution was to use multiple transactions. I begin and end a transaction every 10.000 records (Don\'t ask why that number, it was the fastest one I tested). I create an array sized 10.000 and insert the successful records there. When the error occurs, I do a rollback, begin a transaction, insert the records from my array, commit and then begin a new transaction after the broken record.Hope that this solution will help others bypass their issues when they are dealing with files containing bad/duplicate records.The algorithm I created helped me reduce my process by 2 hours. Final loading process of file 1hr 30m which is still slow but not compared to the 4hrs that it initially took.If anyone has any other ideas on how to speed it up, I am open for suggestions.UPDATE:In Addition to my answer above, you should keep in mind that inserts per second depend on the hard drive you are using too. I tested it on 3 different PCs with different hard drives and got massive differences in times. PC1 (1hr 30m), PC2 (6hrs) PC3 (14hrs), so I started wondering why would that be.After two weeks of research and checking multiple resources: Hard Drive, Ram, Cache, I found out that some settings on your hard drive can affect the I/O rate. By clicking properties on your desired output drive you can see two options in the general tab. Opt1: Compress this drive, Opt2: Allow files of this drive to have contents indexed.By disabling these two options all 3 PCs now take approximately the same time to finish (1hr and 20 to 40min). If you encounter slow inserts check whether your hard drive is configured with these options. It will save you lots of time and headaches trying to find the solutionThe answer to your question is that newer sqlite3 has improved performance, use that. This answer Why is SQLAlchemy insert with sqlite 25 times slower than using sqlite3 directly? by SqlAlchemy Orm Author has 100k inserts in 0.5 sec, and I have seen similar results with python-sqlite and SqlAlchemy. Which leads me to believe that performance has improved with sqlite3There is great lecture form Paul Betts on how he made C# akavache so fast:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7WnQhwBwqAMaybe you can find some clues for you. It is too long to make short summary here
