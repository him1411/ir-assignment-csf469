When I debug in Visual Studio, Firefox opens and that is annoying because of the hookups that Internet Explorer and Visual Studio have, such as when you close the Internet Explorer browser that starting debug opened, Visual Studio stops debugging.  How can I get Visual Studio to open Internet Explorer instead without having to set Internet Explorer as my default browser?Scott Guthrie has made a post on how to change Visual Studio\'s default browser:1) Right click on a .aspx page in your\n  solution explorer2) Select the "browse with" context\n  menu option3) In the dialog you can select or add\n  a browser.  If you want Firefox in the\n  list, click "add" and point to the\n  firefox.exe filename4) Click the "Set as Default" button\n  to make this the default browser when\n  you run any page on the site.I however dislike the fact that this isn\'t as straightforward as it should be.In Visual Studio 2010 the default browser gets reset often (just about every time an IDE setting is changed or even after restarting Visual Studio). There is now a default browser selector extension for 2010 to help combat this:!!!Update!!! It appears that the WoVS Default Browser Switcher is no longer available for free according to @Cory. You might try Default Browser Changer instead but I have not tested it. If you already have the WoVS plugin I would recommend backing it up so that you can install it later.The following solution may no longer work:WoVS Default Browser Switcher: \nhttp://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/bb424812-f742-41ef-974a-cdac607df921 Edit: This works with ASP.NET MVC applications as well.Note: One negative side effect of installing this extension is that it seems to nag to be updated about once a month. This has caused some to uninstall it because, to them, its more bothersome then the problem it fixes. Regardless it is easily updated through the extension manager and I still find it very useful.You will see the following error when starting VS:The Default Browser Switcher beta bits have expired. Please use the\n  Extension Manager or visit the VS Gallery to download updated bits.For MVC3 you don\'t have to add any dummy files to set a certain browser. All you have to do is:Right-click on an aspx file and choose \'browse with\'. I think there\'s an option there to set as default.Also may be helpful for ASP.NET MVC:In an MVC app, you have to right-click\n  on Default.aspx, which is the only\n  \xe2\x80\x98real\xe2\x80\x99 web page in that solution. The\n  default page displays \xe2\x80\x98Browse with\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99From http://avaricesoft.wordpress.com/2008/08/04/...If you\'re running an MVC 3 application - in your solution explorer click the show all files icon and then under the Global.asax file there should be a file called YourProjectName.Publish.XML right-click it and then click "Browse With..." and select your favorite browser as the default.In the Solution Explorer, right-click any ASPX page and select "Browse With" and select IE as the default.Note... the same steps can be used to add Google Chrome as a browser option and to optionally set it as the default browser.Quick note if you don\'t have an .aspx in your project (i.e. its XBAP) but you still need to debug using IE, just add a htm page to your project and right click on that to set the default. It\'s hacky, but it works :PYou may debug by firefox also. Follow these steps: Tool->Attach to process and select firefox.exe or your default browser. Then debugger will work with this browser. But I had some trouble when firefox is 32 bit and and VS2010 is 64 bit. Anyway right click the current document, browse with --> than choose your browser, than set it as default. This way is better. B\'cause firefox\'s process id may change, so you will be annoyed for attaching the process again.You mentioned Visual Studio. This is for Visual Studio 2013. In the "Menu and Tools" in the second line , right below Debug you have a dropdown box giving you the list / option of "Emulators" .Your IE should be in the option , select that and you are good to go. Easy way .With VS 2017, debugging ASP.NET project with Chrome doesn\'t sign you in with your Google account.To fix that go to Tools -> Options -> Debugging -> General and turn off the setting Enable JavaScript Debugging for ASP.NET (Chrome and IE).In visual studio 2013, this can be done as follows:1) Ensure you have selected a start up project from your solution explore window\n2) This brings a drop down to the left of the debug drop down. You can choose browser from this new drop down. Key is there should be a project selected as start upAnother way is to do the following in Visual Studio:
