I Installed DotNetOpenAuth SDK-3.4.5.10201.vsix and I can\'t get it working.\nIt works locally (when I run as localhost) but when i try to publish it ain\'t working. The IIS error message I get is Error Summary\n    HTTP Error 500.22 - Internal Server Error\n    An ASP.NET setting has been detected that does not apply in Integrated managed pipeline mode.ANDthen there are some suggestions on how to solve the problem:Things you can try:Migrate the configuration to the\n     system.webServer/modules section. You\n     can do so manually or by using AppCmd\n     from the command line - for example,\n     %SystemRoot%\\system32\\inetsrv\\appcmd\n     migrate config "Default Web Site/".\n     Using AppCmd to migrate your\n     application will enable it to work in\n     Integrated mode, and continue to work\n     in Classic mode and on previous\n     versions of IIS.If you are certain that it is OK to\n     ignore this error, it can be disabled\n     by setting\n     system.webServer/validation@validateIntegratedModeConfiguration\n     to false.  Alternatively, switch the application\n     to a Classic mode application pool -\n     for example,\n     %SystemRoot%\\system32\\inetsrv\\appcmd\n     set app "Default Web Site/"\n     /applicationPool:"Classic .NET\n     AppPool". Only do this if you are\n     unable to migrate your application.\n     (Set "Default Web Site" and "Classic .NET AppPool" to your application path and application pool name)But the problem is that I don\'t have access to the ISS server as I am not the owner of it. Is there any way to solve this?The 2nd option is the one you want.In your web.config, make sure these keys exist:Adding <validation validateIntegratedModeConfiguration="false"/> addresses the symptom, but is not appropriate for all circumstances. Having ran around this issue a few times, I hope to help others not only overcome the problem but understand it. (Which becomes more and more important as IIS 6 fades into myth and rumor.)Background:This issue and the confusion surrounding it started with the introduction of ASP.NET 2.0 and IIS 7. IIS 6 had and continues to have only one pipeline mode, and it is equivalent to what IIS 7+ calls "Classic" mode. The second, newer, and recommended pipeline mode for all applications running on IIS 7+ is called "Integrated" mode.So, what\'s the difference? The key difference is how ASP.NET interacts with IIS.Classic mode is limited to an ASP.NET pipeline that cannot interact with the IIS pipeline. Essentially a request comes in and if IIS 6/Classic has been told, through server configuration, that ASP.NET can handle it then IIS hands off the request to ASP.NET and moves on. The significance of this can be gleaned from an example. If I were to authorize access to static image files, I would not be able to do it with an ASP.NET module because the IIS 6 pipeline will handle those requests itself and ASP.NET will never see those requests because they were never handed off.* On the other hand, authorizing which users can access a .ASPX page such as a request for Foo.aspx is trivial even in IIS 6/Classic because IIS always hands those requests off to the ASP.NET pipeline. In Classic mode ASP.NET does not know what it hasn\'t been told and there is a lot that IIS 6/Classic may not be telling it.Integrated mode is recommended because ASP.NET handlers and modules can interact directly with the IIS pipeline. No longer does the IIS pipeline simply hand off the request to the ASP.NET pipeline, now it allows ASP.NET code to hook directly into the IIS pipeline and all the requests that hit it. This means that an ASP.NET module can not only observe requests to static image files, but can intercept those requests and take action by denying access, logging the request, etc.Overcoming the error:Then again maybe you are giving your application a face-lift or it was chugging along just fine until you installed a 3rd party library via NuGet, manually, or by some other means. In that case it is entirely possible httpHandlers or httpModules have been added to system.web. The outcome is the error that you are seeing because validateIntegratedModeConfiguration defaults true. Now you have two choices:Good reads:*Of course there are ways to get all kind of strange things into the ASP.NET pipeline from IIS 6/Classic via incantations like wildcard mappings, if you like that sort of thing.If you still need to use the HTTP Module you need to configure it (.NET 4.0 framework) as follows:I ran into this issue but had a different fix. It involved updating the Control Panel>Administrative Tools>IIS Manager and reverting my App site\'s Managed Pipeline from Integrated to Classic.Check if there is any conflict in your IIS authentication. i.e. you enable the anonymous authentication and ASP.NET impersonation both might cause the error also.This worked for me:Seems like something went south when I originally created the site.  I hate solutions that are similar to "Restart your machine, then reinstall windows" without knowing what caused the error.  But, this worked for me.  Quick and simple.  Hope it helps someone else.I ran into this problem and inspired by @Jeremy Cook\'s answer, I bit the bullet to find out what the heck caused IIS 7 Integrated mode to not like my web.config. Here\'s my scenario:I wanted to use attribute routing in a project that (unfortunately) had to use .NET 4 and hence could not use Web API 2.2 (which needs .NET 4.5). The well meaning NuGet package added this section under the <system.web> section:[I say well meaning, because this part is required on older versions of IIS]Removing this section got me past the HTTP 500.23!!Summary:\nI second Jeremy\'s words that it is important to understand why things don\'t work rather than just "masking the symptom". Even if you have to mask the symptom, you know what you are doing (and why) :-)In your web.config make sure these keys exist:As well as check the Asp.Net Impresonation = Disable In IIS Site Authetication The method for local Is the error
