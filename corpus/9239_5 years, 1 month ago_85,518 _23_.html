Seems like UITextAlignmentCenter is deprecated in iOS 6. I still use it and works well, but it gives a warning.How can I fix this?Thanks.In iOS6 you can use Hope this helps.The labelAlignment property change is probably related to Apple\xe2\x80\x99s introducing NSAttributedStrings to more of the iOS controls, and therefore needing to change the UIText\xe2\x80\xa6 properties to NSText\xe2\x80\xa6 properties.So if you\xe2\x80\x99ve upgraded to iOS6, you\xe2\x80\x99re in clover; just switch from UITextAlignmentCenter to NSTextAlignmentCenter and enjoy the fancy new strings.But if you\xe2\x80\x99re working with a complex project and would prefer that the earth not move so much under your feet, you might want to stick with an older version for a while, and adapt your code for multiple versions, something like this:The above approach works for new methods; you get warnings but everything runs fine. But when the compiler sees a constant that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know about, it turns red and stops in its tracks. There\xe2\x80\x99s no way to sneak NSTextAlignmentCenter past it. (Well, there might be a way to customize the compiler\xe2\x80\x99s behavior here, but it seems inadvisable.)The workaround is to add some conditional preprocessor defines. If you put something like this in your class\xe2\x80\x99s h file (or perhaps in an imported constants file -- which must itself include #import <UIKit/UIKit.h> in order to ever know about the NSText... constants)\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6you can do this:And this:Etc. Since these UIText/NSText changes are likely to be popping up for multiple controls, this approach is quite handy.(Caveat: Being a member of the aforementioned steady-earth lovers, I have tested this with an old version, but not yet with iOS6.)NSTextAlignmentCenter can be used in place of UITextAlignmentCenter and a list of other replacements is below:You don\'t have to do either of these.  Xcode 4.5 will compile the NSTextAlignmentCenter, etc. fine in iOS 5.I had a similar issue and used the following:\ndetailsLabel.textAlignment = NSTextAlignmentCenter;in iOS 6 or greater use this value :self.lbl_age.textAlignment=NSTextAlignmentCenter;Swift 3:
