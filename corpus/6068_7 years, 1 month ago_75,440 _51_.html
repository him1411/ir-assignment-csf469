I have the following error during sqlite3-ruby install:sqlite3.h is located in /usr/include/doesn\'t workUbuntu 10.04You need the SQLite3 development headers for the gem\xe2\x80\x99s native extension to compile against. You can install them by running (possibly with sudo):You just need a -- in there.That specifies that the option is not to gem directly, but the specific gem.If you run in ubuntu,and using RVM for ruby on rails,please add FIRST:OR You can check with these commands:This command will prepare for you two packages : sqllite3 and libsqlite3-devsudo apt-get install sqlite3\n  libsqlite3-dev-Now,install sqlite gem -using Ubuntu doesn\'t need sudo.Goodluck! Note: i\'m using Ubuntu 10.10 and it\'s working.This is what I did:from : http://cuasan.wordpress.com/2010/10/13/rails-3-on-debian-with-sqlite-3/In my case I have no basic compilers installed, sosolved my problem, but for most the people I think https://stackoverflow.com/a/3649005/417267 is the solution.Tried ALL of other solutions, none helped.It turned out that you also need dev package for ruby itself. For me, it helpedIt has a lot of nasty dependencies though (like emacs, wtf?), justshould be fine. After it\'s installed (and you have the sqlite and sqlite-dev packages installed)works like a charm.This was simply enough to make it workThanks to marshlucaHere\'s a better answer from HEROKU - cannot run git push heroku masterSince you can\'t use sqlite3 on heroku add this to your Gemfile:Had this same problem and the following worked for me:compile sqlite3 as static library, install somewhere in your home directory and then provide that option for the gem install process.Go to the download page and grab the source. Most recent version at this time is http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite-autoconf-3070400.tar.gztar -xf on the file or do whatever you normally do to uncompress; enter directory./configure --disable-shared --enable-static --prefix=/some/path/in/my/homecompile, install, and when you\'re installing the gem...gem install sqlite3-ruby -- --with-sqlite3-dir=/some/path/in/my/homeFrom sqlite3-ruby gem can't find sqlite3.h on ubuntu:You also need to install gcc itself, so in total it would be:Apparently you get a wrong error pointing to a missing sqlite3.h when the actual problem is missing gcc itself.The solution is to add -- to separate configure parameters from gem parameters.instead oftry this, all on one line, make sure to include -- after the last gem parameter and before configure parameters:This should get you around this error:Not --without-sqlite3-include=/usr/include, but --with-sqlite3-include=/usr/include.This is the exact same problem I had a few weeks ago. I found out I needed to download the most recent headers/libraries from the SQLite Download Page. Try it out, hope this helps!For me the problem was solved by getting mkmf, which is in ruby1.8-dev. Thanks to mentalized for that one.I agree with Danya Vershinin & EnotionZ.If can\'t use apt-get: You have broken version of RVM. Ubuntu does something to RVM that produces lots of errors, the only safe way of fixing for now is to: sudo apt-get --purge remove ruby-rvm sudo rm -rf /usr/share/ruby \xe2\x80\xa6 , if it does not help then restart your computer. install RVM: \\curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby --autolibs=enable --auto-dotfiles If you find you need some hand-holding, take a look at Installing Ruby on Ubuntu 12.04, which gives a bit more explanatForget everything and do this,runThat\'s for rhel, run same for ubuntu.
