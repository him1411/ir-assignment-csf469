Using Git, is there a way to tell it to accept a self signed certificate?I am using an https server to host a git server but for now the certificate is self signed.When I try to create the repo there for the first time:I get the error:To permanently accept a specific certificate, try http.sslCAPath or http.sslCAInfo. Adam Spiers\'s answer gives some great examples. This is the most secure solution to the question.To disable TLS/SSL verification for a single git command, try passing -c to git with the proper config variable, or use Flow\'s answer:To disable SSL verification for that singular repository, assuming it\'s completely under your control, you can try:Disabling TLS(/SSL) certificate verification globally is a terribly insecure practice. Don\'t do it. Do not issue the above command with a --global modifier.There are quite a few  SSL configuration options in git. From the man page of git config:A few other useful SSL configuration options:You can set GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY to true:or alternatively configure Git not to verify the connection on the command line:Note that if you don\'t verify SSL/TLS certificates, then you are susceptible to MitM attacks.I\'m not a huge fan of the [EDIT: original versions of the] existing answers, because disabling security checks should be a last resort, not the first solution offered.  Even though you cannot trust self-signed certificates on first receipt without some additional method of verification, using the certificate for subsequent git operations at least makes life a lot harder for attacks which only occur after you have downloaded the certificate.  In other words, if the certificate you downloaded is genuine, then you\'re good from that point onwards.  In contrast, if you simply disable verification then you are wide open to any kind of man-in-the-middle attack at any point.To give a specific example: the famous repo.or.cz repository provides a self-signed certificate.  I can download that file, place it somewhere like /etc/ssl/certs, and then do:Note that using local git config here (i.e. without --global) means that this self-signed certificate is only trusted for this particular repository, which is nice.  It\'s also nicer than using GIT_SSL_CAPATH since it eliminates the risk of git doing the verification via a different Certificate Authority which could potentially be compromised.I keep coming across this problem, so have written a script to download the self signed certificate from the server and install it to ~/.gitcerts, then update git-config to point to these certificates.  It is stored in global config, so you only need to run it once per remote.https://github.com/iwonbigbro/tools/blob/master/bin/git-remote-install-cert.shFor my own and my colleagues\' sake here is how we managed to get self signed certificates to work without disabling sslVerify. Edit your .gitconfig to using git config --global -e add these:\nReferences:If you need to apply it on a per repo basis, the documentation tells you to just run git config --local in your repo directory. Well that\'s not useful when you haven\'t got the repo cloned locally yet now is it?You can do the global -> local hokey-pokey by setting your global config as above and then copy those settings to your local repo config once it clones... OR what you can do is specify config commands at git clone that get applied to the target repo once it is cloned.If you are trying this on CentOS and your .pem file is giving you Then you will want this StackOverflow answer about how curl uses NSS instead of Open SSL.And you\'ll like want to rebuild curl from source:restart computer since libcurl is still in memory as a shared libraryBe careful when you are using one liner using sslKey or sslCert, as in Josh Peak\'s answer:Only Git 2.14.x/2.15 (Q3 2015) would be able to interpret a path like ~username/mykey correctly (while it still can interpret an absolute path like /path/to/privatekey).See commit 8d15496 (20 Jul 2017) by Junio C Hamano (gitster).\nHelped-by: Charles Bailey (hashpling).\n(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit 17b1e1d, 11 Aug 2017) Back when the modern http_options() codepath was created to parse\n  various http.* options at 29508e1 ("Isolate shared HTTP request\n  functionality", 2005-11-18, Git 0.99.9k), and then later was corrected for\n  interation between the multiple configuration files in 7059cd9\n  ("http_init(): Fix config file parsing", 2009-03-09, Git 1.6.3-rc0), we parsed\n  configuration variables like http.sslkey, http.sslcert as plain\n  vanilla strings, because git_config_pathname() that understands\n  "~[username]/" prefix did not exist.  Later, we converted some of them (namely, http.sslCAPath and http.sslCAInfo) to use the function, and added variables like http.cookeyFile http.pinnedpubkey to use the function from the beginning.  Because of that, these variables all understand "~[username]/" prefix.Make the remaining two variables, http.sslcert and http.sslkey, also\n  aware of the convention, as they are both clearly pathnames to\n  files.Run the following command :
