I would like to show a div when someone hovers over an <a> element, but I would like to do this in CSS and not JavaScript. Do you know how this can be achieved?You can do something like this: \nThis uses the adjacent sibling selector, and is the basis of the suckerfish dropdown menu. HTML5 allows anchor elements to wrap almost anything, so in that case the div element can be made a child of the anchor. Otherwise the principle is the same - use the :hover pseudo-class to change the display property of another element. jsfiddleSince this answer is popular I think a small explanation is needed. Using this method when you hover on the internal element, it wont disappear.\nBecause the .showme is inside .showhim it will not disappear when you move your mouse between the two lines of text (or whatever it is). These are example of quirqs you need to take care of when implementing such behavior.It all depends what you need this for. This method is better for a menu style scenario, while Yi Jiang\'s is better for tooltips.I found using opacity is better, it allows you to add css3 transitions to make a nice finished hover effect. The transitions will just be dropped by older IE browsers, so it degrades gracefully to.I\'m by know means an expert, but I\'m incredibly proud of myself for having worked something out about this code. If you do:(Note the \'>\') You can contain the whole thing in an a tag, then, as long as your trigger (which can be in it\'s own div, or straight up in the a tag, or anything you want) is physically touching the revealed div, you can move your mouse from one to the other.Maybe this isn\'t useful for a great deal, but I had to set my revealed div to overflow: auto, so sometimes it had scroll bars, which couldn\'t be used as soon as you move away from the div.In fact, after finally working out how to make the revealed div, (although it is now a child of the trigger, not a sibling), sit behind the trigger, in terms of z-index, (with a little help from this page: How to get a parent element to appear above child) you don\'t even have to roll over the revealed div to scroll it, just stay hovering over the trigger and use your wheel, or whatever.My revealed div covers most of the page, so this technique makes it a lot more permanent, rather than the screen flashing from one state to another with every move of the mouse. It\'s really intuitive actually, hence why I\'m really quite proud of myself.The only downside is that you can\'t put links within the whole thing, but you can use the whole thing as one big link.I would like to offer this general purpose template solution that expands on the correct solution provided by Yi Jiang\'s.The additional benefits include:In the html you place the following structure:In the css you place the following structure:As additional information.  When the popup contains information that you might want to cut and paste or contains an object that you might want to interact with then first replace:withAnd second, adjust the position of div.popup so that there is an overlap with div.information.  A few pixels is sufficient to ensure that the div.popup is can receive the hover when moving the cusor off div.information.This does not work as expected with Internet Explorer 10.0.9200 and does work as expected with Opera 12.16, Firefox 18.0 and Google Chrome 28.0.15.See fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/F68Le/ for a complete example with a popup multilevel menu.This answer doesn\'t require that you know the what type of display (inline, etc.) the hideable element is supposed to be when being shown:This uses the adjacent sibling selector and the not selector. please test this codeFor me, if I want to interact with the hidden div without seeing it disappear each time I leave the triggering element (a in that case) I must add:From my testing using this CSS:  And this HTML:, it resulted that it does expand using the second , but does not expand using the first one. So if there is a div between the hover target and the hidden div, then it will not work.
