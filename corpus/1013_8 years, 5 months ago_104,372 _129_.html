There are a plethora of questions where people talk about common tricks, notably "Vim+ctags tips and tricks".However, I don\'t refer to commonly used shortcuts that someone new to Vim would find cool. I am talking about a seasoned Unix user (be they a developer, administrator, both, etc.), who thinks  they know something 99% of us never heard or dreamed about. Something that not only makes their work easier, but also is COOL and hackish. After all, Vim resides in the most dark-corner-rich OS in the world, thus it should have intricacies that only a few privileged know about and want to share with us.Might not be one that 99% of Vim users don\'t know about, but it\'s something I use daily and that any Linux+Vim poweruser must know. Basic command, yet extremely useful.I often forget to sudo before editing a file I don\'t have write permissions on. When I come to save that file and get a permission error, I just issue that vim command in order to save the file without the need to save it to a temp file and then copy it back again.You obviously have to be on a system with sudo installed and have sudo rights.Something I just discovered recently that I thought was very cool:Reverts the document back to how it was 15 minutes ago. Can take various arguments for the amount of time you want to roll back, and is dependent on undolevels. Can be reversed with the opposite command :later:! [command] executes an external command while you\'re in Vim.But add a dot after the colon,  :.! [command], and it\'ll dump the output of the command into your current window. That\'s :  .  ! For example:I use this a lot for things like adding the current date into a document I\'m typing:Not exactly obscure, but there are several "delete in" commands which are extremely useful, like..Others can be found on :help text-objectsde Delete everything till the end of the word by pressing . at your heart\'s desire.ci(xyz[Esc] -- This is a weird one. Here, the \'i\' does not mean insert mode. Instead it means inside the parenthesis. So this sequence cuts the text inside parenthesis you\'re standing in and replaces it with "xyz". It also works inside square and figure brackets -- just do ci[ or ci{ correspondingly. Naturally, you can do di (if you just want to delete all text without typing anything. You can also do a instead of i if you want to delete the parentheses as well and not just text inside them.ci" - cuts the text in current quotesciw - cuts the current word. This works just like the previous one except that ( is replaced with w.C - cut the rest of the line and switch to insert mode.ZZ -- save and close current file (WAY faster than Ctrl-F4 to close the current tab!)ddp - move current line one row downxp -- move current character one position to the rightU - uppercase, so viwU upercases the word~ - switches case, so viw~ will reverse casing of entire wordCtrl+u / Ctrl+d scroll the page half-a-screen up or down. This seems to be more useful than the usual full-screen paging as it makes it easier to see how the two screens relate. For those who still want to scroll entire screen at a time there\'s Ctrl+f for Forward and Ctrl+b for Backward. Ctrl+Y and Ctrl+E scroll down or up one line at a time.Crazy but very useful command is zz -- it scrolls the screen to make this line appear in the middle. This is excellent for putting the piece of code you\'re working on in the center of your attention. Sibling commands -- zt and zb -- make this line the top or the bottom one on the sreen which is not quite as useful.% finds and jumps to the matching parenthesis.de -- delete from cursor to the end of the word (you can also do dE to delete until the next space)bde -- delete the current word, from left to right delimiterdf[space] -- delete up until and including the next spacedt. -- delete until next dotdd -- delete this entire lineye (or yE) -- yanks text from here to the end of the wordce - cuts through the end of the wordbye -- copies current word (makes me wonder what "hi" does!)yy -- copies the current linecc -- cuts the current line, you can also do S instead. There\'s also lower cap s which cuts current character and switches to insert mode.viwy or viwc. Yank or change current word. Hit w multiple times to keep selecting each subsequent word, use b to move backwardsvi{ - select all text in figure brackets. va{ - select all text including {}svi(p - highlight everything inside the ()s and replace with the pasted textb and e move the cursor word-by-word, similarly to how Ctrl+Arrows normally do. The definition of word is a little different though, as several consecutive delmiters are treated as one word. If you start at the middle of a word, pressing b will always get you to the beginning of the current word, and each consecutive b will jump to the beginning of the next word. Similarly, and easy to remember, e gets the cursor to the end of the current, and each subsequent, word.similar to b/e, capital B and E move the cursor word-by-word using only whitespaces as delimiters.capital D (take a deep breath) Deletes the rest of the line to the right of the cursor, same as Shift+End/Del in normal editors (notice 2 keypresses -- Shift+D -- instead of 3)One that I rarely find in most Vim tutorials, but it\'s INCREDIBLY useful (at least to me), is theg; and g,to move (forward, backward) through the changelist.Let me show how I use it. Sometimes I need to copy and paste a piece of code or string, say a hex color code in a CSS file, so I search, jump (not caring where the match is), copy it and then jump back (g;) to where I was editing the code to finally paste it. No need to create marks. Simpler.Just my 2cents.Make vim into a hex editor.Revert.Warning: If you don\'t edit with binary (-b), you might damage the file. \xe2\x80\x93  Josh Lee in the comments.Reselects last visual selection.Sometimes a setting in your .vimrc will get overridden by a plugin or autocommand. To debug this a useful trick is to use the :verbose command in conjunction with :set. For example, to figure out where cindent got set/unset:This will output something like:This also works with maps and highlights. (Thanks joeytwiddle for pointing this out.) For example:Not sure if this counts as dark-corner-ish at all, but I\'ve only just learnt it...will yank (copy) all lines containing "match" into the "a/@a register. (The capitalization as A makes vim append yankings instead of replacing the previous register contents.) I used it a lot recently when making Internet Explorer stylesheets.:%TOhtmlCreates an html rendering of the current file.Want to look at your :command history?Then browse, edit and finally  to execute the command.Ever make similar changes to two files and switch back and forth between them? (Say, source and header files?)Then tab back and forth between those files.Vim will open a URL, for exampleNice when you need to pull up the source of a page for reference.Macros can call other macros, and can also call itself.eg:...will delete the first word from every line until the end of the file.This is quite a simple example but it demonstrates a very powerful feature of vimAssuming you have Perl and/or Ruby support compiled in, :rubydo and :perldo will run a Ruby or Perl one-liner on every line in a range (defaults to entire buffer), with $_ bound to the text of the current line (minus the newline).  Manipulating $_ will change the text of that line.You can use this to do certain things that are easy to do in a scripting language but not so obvious using Vim builtins.  For example to reverse the order of the words in a line:To insert a random string of 8 characters (A-Z) at the end of every line:You are limited to acting on one line at a time and you can\'t add newlines.^O and ^IGo to older/newer position. \nWhen you are moving through the file (by searching, moving commands etc.) vim rember these "jumps", so you can repeat these jumps backward (^O - O for old) and forward (^I - just next to I on keyboard). I find it very useful when writing code and performing a lot of searches.giGo to position where Insert mode was stopped last.\nI find myself often editing and then searching for something. To return to editing place press gi.gfput cursor on file name (e.g. include header file), press gf and the file is openedgFsimilar to gf but recognizes format "[file name]:[line number]". Pressing gF will open [file name] and set cursor to [line number].^P and ^NAuto complete text while editing (^P - previous match and ^N next match)^X^LWhile editing completes to the same line (useful for programming).\nYou write code and then you recall that you have the same code somewhere in file. Just press ^X^L and the full line completed^X^FComplete file names.\nYou write "/etc/pass" Hmm. You forgot the file name. Just press ^X^F and the filename is completed^Z or :shMove temporary to the shell. If you need a quick bashing:This is a nice trick to reopen the current file with a different encoding:Useful when you have to work with legacy encodings. The supported encodings are listed in a table under encoding-values (see help encoding-values). Similar thing also works for ++ff, so that you can reopen file with Windows/Unix line ends if you get it wrong for the first time (see help ff).Typing == will correct the indentation of the current line based on the line above.Actually, you can do one = sign followed by any movement command. ={movement}For example, you can use the % movement which moves between matching braces. Position the cursor on the { in the following code:And press =% to instantly get this:Alternately, you could do =a{ within the code block, rather than positioning yourself right on the { character.Let\'s see some pretty little IDE editor do column transposition.Explanation\\( and \\) is how to remember stuff in regex-land. And \\1, \\2 etc is how to retrieve the remembered stuff.Remember everything followed by ^I (tab) followed by everything.Replace the above stuff with "2nd stuff you remembered" followed by "1st stuff you remembered" - essentially doing a transpose.Not exactly a dark secret, but I like to put the following mapping into my .vimrc file, so I can hit "-" (minus) anytime to open the file explorer to show files adjacent to the one I just edit. In the file explorer, I can hit another "-" to move up one directory, providing seamless browsing of a complex directory structures (like the ones used by the MVC frameworks nowadays):These may be also useful for somebody. I like to scroll the screen and advance the cursor at the same time:Tab navigation - I love tabs and I need to move easily between them:Only on Mac OS X: Safari-like tab navigation:Often, I like changing current directories while editing - so I have to specify paths less.I like to use \'sudo bash\', and my sysadmin hates this. He locked down \'sudo\' so it could only be used with a handful of commands (ls, chmod, chown, vi, etc), but I was able to use vim to get a root shell anyway:I often use many windows when I work on a project and sometimes I need to resize them. Here\'s what I use:These mappings allow to increase and decrease the size of the current window. It\'s quite simple but it\'s fast.pastes the output of an external command into the buffer.Do some math and get the result directly in the text:Get the list of files to compile when writing a Makefile:Don\'t look up that fact you read on wikipedia, have it directly pasted into the document you are writing:I just found this one today via NSFAQ:Comment blocks of code.Enter Blockwise Visual mode by hitting CTRL-V.Mark the block you wish to comment.Hit I (capital I) and enter your comment string at the beginning of the line. (// for C++)Hit ESC and all lines selected will have // prepended to the front of the line.Not an obscure feature, but very useful and time saving. If you want to save a session of your open buffers, tabs, markers and other settings, you can issue the following:You can open your session using:Map F5 to quickly ROT13 your buffer:You can use it as a boss key :).I use vim for just about any text editing I do, so I often times use copy and paste. The problem is that vim by default will often times distort imported text via paste. The way to stop this is to usebefore pasting in your data. This will keep it from messing up.Note that you will have to issue :set nopaste to recover auto-indentation. Alternative ways of pasting pre-formatted text are the clipboard registers (* and +), and :r!cat (you will have to end the pasted fragment with ^D).It is also sometimes helpful to turn on a high contrast color scheme. This can be done withI\'ve noticed that it does not work on all the versions of vim I use but it does on  most.
