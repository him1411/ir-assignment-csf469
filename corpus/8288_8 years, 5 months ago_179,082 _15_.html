I\'m used to using vim to modify a file\'s line endings:Is it possible to use a similar process to change a file\'s unicode encoding?  I\'m trying the following, which doesn\'t work:I saw someone say that he could "set fileencoding=utf-8, then update and write the file, and it works," but I seem to be missing something, or else he was confused.  I don\'t know what he meant by "then update."From the doc::write ++enc=utf-8 russian.txtSo you should be able to change the encoding as part of the write command.Notice that there is a difference between andIn the first case, you\'ll change the output encoding that is shown in the terminal. In the second case, you\'ll change the output encoding of the file that is written.While using vim to do it is perfectly possible, why don\'t you simply use iconv? I mean - loading text editor just to do encoding conversion seems like using too big hammer for too small nail.Just:And you\'re done.Just like your steps, setting fileencoding should work. However, I\'d like to add one "set bomb" to help editor consider the file as UTF8.It could be useful to change the encoding just on the command line before the file is read:See starting, --cmd.
