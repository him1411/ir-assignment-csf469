I want to use my Amazon ec2 instance but faced the following error: I have created my key pair and downloaded .pem file.Given:               Then, this commandBut have this error:Also, how can I connect with filezilla to upload/download files?This error message means you failed to authenticate. These are common reasons that can cause that:Note that 1. will also happen if you have messed up the /home/<username>/.ssh/authorized_keys file on your EC2 instance. About 2., the information about which username you should use is often lacking from the AMI Image description. But you can find some in AWS EC2 documentation, bullet point 4. : \nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.htmlUse the ssh command to connect to the instance. You\'ll specify the private key (.pem) file and user_name@public_dns_name. For Amazon Linux, the user name is ec2-user. For RHEL5, the user name is either root or ec2-user. For Ubuntu, the user name is ubuntu. For Fedora, the user name is either fedora or ec2-user. For SUSE Linux, the user name is root. Otherwise, if ec2-user and root don\'t work, check with your AMI provider.Finally, be aware that there are many other reasons why authentication would fail. SSH is usually pretty explicit about what went wrong if you care to add the -v option to your SSH command and read the output, as explained in many other answers to this question.  In this case the problem arises from lost Key Pair. About this:You can follow these steps:In general, remember you have to allow your EC2 instance to accept inbound SSH traffic.To do this, you have to create a specific rule for the Security Group of your EC2 instance.\nYou can follow these steps.Hope this can help someone as helped me.This is how I solved the problemI solved the problem just putting sudo beforeBut the proper solution is to change the ownership first, and then connect as a normal user as Janus Troelsen said below. In my case it would be:Try usingORAnother possible cause of this error:When user\'s home directory is group writeable, the user cannot login.(Reproduced on Ubuntu instance.)You need to do the following steps:If ubuntu user is not working then try with ec2-user.for the ubuntu 12.04 lts micro instance i had to set the user name as option Also for some Debian OS the username is admin. At least for 6.5 and 7.0 versions.I struggled with the same permission denied error apparently due to In my situation the cause was the ssh config file of the current user (~/.ssh/config).Using the following:The initial output showed:...  many debug lines cut here ...The third line above is where the problem actual was identified; however, I looked for at the debug message four lines from the bottom (above) and was misled. There isn\'t a problem with the key but I tested it and compared other configurations.My user ssh config file reset the host via an unintended global setting as shown below. The first Host line should not have been a comment.I hope someone else finds this helpful.I forgot to add the username (ubuntu) when connecting my Ubuntu instance. So I tried this:and the correct way wasThis has happened to me multiple times. I have used Amazon Linux AMI 2013.09.2 and Ubuntu Server 12.04.3 LTS which are both on the free tier. Every time I have launched an instance I have permission denied show up. I haven\'t verified this but my theory is that the server is not completely set up before I try to ssh into it. After a few tries with permission denied, I wait a few minutes and then I am able to connect. If you are having this problem I suggest waiting five minutes and trying again. Here is a possible frustrating scenarios that produces this error:If you are lunching a new instance from an AMI you created of another instance (say instance xyz), then the new instance will only accept the same key that instance A used. This is totally understandable but it gets confusing because during the step by step process of creating the new instance, you are asked to select or create a key (at the very last step) which will not work. Regardless of the key you create or select, only the key you were using for instance XYZ will will be accepted by the new instance.In my own case, i did the following:I was initially using root@ part and i got this prompt:I\'m in Windows with WinSCP. It works great on both File Explorer and PuTTY SSH Shell to access my Amazon EC2-VPC Linux. There is nothing to do with chmod pem file as it uses myfile.ppk converted by PuTTYgen from the pem file.I struggled with this for a while too until I found the following:When you use that from the project directory, bingo-bango no muss no fuss, you\'re inThis issue can be solved by login into Ubuntu box using below command:I\'ve twice had keys and ssh command line correct (I know because I\'m duplicating a working Ubuntu 14.04 instance), but just not been able to ssh into a new instance, even after waiting 5 minutes as suggested by Wade Anderson above.I had to destroy and re-create the machine.  This has happened on two separate occasions.  Since I can\'t get in initially, I can\'t see what\'s wrong.So, if you have this problem, try that.you must check these few things:I had the same problem, and it solved after I changed username to ubuntu. In AWS documentation was mentioned to user ec2-user but somehow does not work for me.My private key was set to permission 400 and was resulting in Permission denied setting it to \'644\' helped me .key_load_private_type: Permission denied is the specific error I was gettingSolution:\nSudo chmod 644 <key.pem>Note: set to 644 is must, it was not working with 400When you try doing ssh -i <.pem path> root@ec2-public-dns\nYou get a message advising you to use the ec2-user. Please login as the user "ec2-user" rather than the user "root".\nSo usessh -i <.pem path> ec2-user@ec2-public-dns\nI had same problem and its very strange. If you believe you are doing all good than follow this:\nSome times there is confusion about user for the EC2 instance!! Some times you get ec2-user, ubuntu, centos etc. So check your username for the machie!!Login with root user\n\nssh -i yourkey.pem (400 permission) root@<ip>\n\nIt will throw error and will give you the available username. then login with that user.It\'s a basic thing, but always confirm which user you are trying to do the login. Im my case was just a distraction. I was trying using a root user:But was another user:i had same error but different situation. to me it happened out of the blue after a lot of time i could ssh successfully to my remote computer out there. after a lot of searching the solution to my problem where file permissions. it is strange of course because i didn\'t change any permissions in my computer or the remote one belonging to the ssh\'s files/directories. so from the good archlinux wiki here it is: For the local machine do this:For the remote machine do that:after that my ssh started to working again without the permission denied (publickey) thing.My problem may be related to @Stepan.For some reason, I couldn\'t do it in my Desktop folder on my OS-X. When I do it in another folder, it works.My answer: try in another folder, it may work at least it worked for me.I was able to SSH from one machine, but not from another. Turns out I was using the wrong private key.The way I figured this out was by getting the public key from my private key, like this:ssh-keygen -y -f ./myprivatekey.pemWhat came out didn\'t match what was in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the EC2 instance.
