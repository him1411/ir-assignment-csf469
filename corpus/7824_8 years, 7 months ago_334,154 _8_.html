I\'d like gcc to include files from $HOME/include in addition to the usual include directories, but there doesn\'t seem to be an analogue to $LD_LIBRARY_PATH. I know I can just add the include directory at command line when compiling (or in the makefile), but I\'d really like a universal approach here, as in the library case.Try setting C_INCLUDE_PATH (for C header files) or CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH (for C++ header files).As Ciro mentioned, CPATH will set the path for both C and C++.More details here.Create an alias for gcc with your favorite includes.Here is link to GCC 4.8.1 manual where C_INCLUDE_PATH and CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH environment variables are documented.A gcc spec file can do the job, however all users on the machine will be affected.See here
