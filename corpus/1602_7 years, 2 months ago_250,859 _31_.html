I have made several commits on different files, but so far I would like to push to my remote repository only a specific commit.Is that possible?To push up through a given commit, you can write:provided <remotebranchname> already exists on the remote.  (If it doesn\'t, you can use git push <remotename> <commit SHA>:refs/heads/<remotebranchname> to autocreate it.)If you want to push a commit without pushing previous commits, you should first use git rebase -i to re-order the commits.EDITto a more complete description of what to do check @Samuel\'s answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/27907287/889213References:Tried the suggested solution:git push <remotename> <commit SHA>:<remotebranchname>like this:git push origin 712acff81033eddc90bb2b45e1e4cd031fefc50f:masterIn my case master was 5 commits ahead and I just wanted to push my last commit but the above ended up pushing all of my changes up to and including the named commit. It seems to me that the cherry-pick method might be a better approach for this usecase.I\'d suggest using git rebase -i; move the commit you want to push to the top of the commits you\'ve made.  Then use git log to get the SHA of the rebased commit, check it out, and push it.  The rebase will have ensures that all your other commits are now children of the one you pushed, so future pushes will work fine too.The other answers are lacking on the reordering descriptions.will push a single commit, but that commit has to be the OLDEST of your local, non-pushed, commits, not to be confused with the top, first, or tip commit, which are all ambiguous descriptions in my opinion. The commit needs to the oldest of your commits, i.e. the furthest from your most recent commit. If it\'s not the oldest commit then all commits from your oldest, local, non-pushed SHA to the SHA specified will be pushed. To reorder the commits use:After reordering the commit you can safely push it to the remote repository.To summarize, I usedto push a single commit to my remote master branch.References:See also:Cherry-pick works best compared to all other methods while pushing a specific commit.The way to do that is:Create a new branch - Update your new-branch with your origin branch - These actions will make sure that you exactly have the same stuff as your origin has.Cherry-pick the sha id that you want to do push -You can get the sha id by running Push it to your origin - Run gitk to see that everything looks the same way you wanted.I believe you would have to "git revert" back to that commit and then push it. Or you could cherry-pick a commit into a new branch, and push that to the branch on the remote repo. Something like :
