I\'m looking for a way to print the call stack in PHP. Bonus points if the function flushes the IO buffer.If you want to generate a backtrace, you are looking for debug_backtrace and/or debug_print_backtrace.\nThe first one will, for instance, get you an array like this one (quoting the manual) :\nThey will apparently not flush the I/O buffer, but you can do that yourself, with flush and/or ob_flush.(see the manual page of the first one to find out why the "and/or" ;-) )More readable than debug_backtrace():To log the traceThanks @TobiaszBacktrace dumps a whole lot of garbage that you don\'t need. It takes is very long, difficult to read. All you usuall ever want is "what called what from where?" Here is a simple static function solution. I usually put it in a class called \'debug\', which contains all of my debugging utility functions.You call it like this:And it produces output like this:Strange that noone posted this way:This actually prints backtrace without the garbage - just what method was called and where.See debug_print_backtrace. I guess you can call flush afterwards if you want.Does that do what you want?If you want a stack trace which looks very similar to how php formats the exception stack trace than use this function I wrote: This will return a stack trace formatted like this: Use debug_backtrace to get a backtrace of what functions and methods had been called and what files had been included that led to the point where debug_backtrace has been called.phptrace is a great tool to print PHP stack anytime when you want without installing any extensions. There are two major function of phptrace: first, print call stack of PHP which need not install anything, second, trace php execution flows which needs to install the extension it supplies.as follows:debug_backtrace()You might want to look into debug_backtrace, or perhaps debug_print_backtrace.please take a look at this utils class, may be helpful:Usage: Source class: https://github.com/augustowebd/utils/blob/master/Who.phpWalltearer\'s solution is excellent, particularly if enclosed in a \'pre\' tag:- which sets out the calls on separate lines, neatly numbered
