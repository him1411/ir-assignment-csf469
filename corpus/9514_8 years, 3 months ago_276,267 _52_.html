Is there any way to easily make a HTTP request with C++?  Specifically, I want to download the contents of a page (an API) and check the contents to see if it contains a 1 or a 0. Is it also possible to download the contents into a string?I had the same problem. libcurl is really complete. There is a C++ wrapper curlpp that might interest you as you ask for a C++ library. neon is another interesting C library that also support webdav.curlpp seems natural if you use C++. There are many examples provided in the source distribution.\nTo get the content of an URL you do something like that (extracted from examples) :See the examples directory in curlpp source distribution, there is a lot of more complex cases.my 2 cents ...Windows code:Here is a much better implementation: On Linux, I tried cpp-netlib, libcurl, curlpp, urdl, boost::asio and considered Qt (but turned it down based on the license). All of these were either incomplete for this use, had sloppy interfaces, had poor documentation, were unmaintained or didn\'t support https.Then, at the suggestion of https://stackoverflow.com/a/1012577/278976, I tried POCO. Wow, I wish I had seen this years ago. Here\'s an example of making an HTTP GET request:http://xjia.heroku.com/2011/09/10/learning-poco-get-with-http/POCO is free, open source (boost license). And no, I don\'t have any affiliation with the company; I just really like their interfaces. Great job guys (and gals).http://pocoproject.org/download/index.htmlHope this helps someone... it took me three days to try all of these libraries out.As you want a C++ solution, you could use Qt. It has a QHttp class you can use.You can check the docs:Qt also has a lot more to it that you could use in a common C++ app.There is a newer, less mature curl wrapper being developed called C++ Requests. Here\'s a simple GET request:It supports a wide variety of HTTP verbs and curl options. There\'s more usage documentation here.Disclaimer: I\'m the maintainer of this library.libCURL is a pretty good option for you. Depending on what you need to do, the tutorial should tell you what you want, specifically for the easy handle. But, basically, you could do this just to see the source of a page:I believe this will cause the result to be printed to stdout. If you want to handle it instead -- which, I assume, you do -- you need to set the CURL_WRITEFUNCTION. All of that is covered in the curl tutorial linked above.Here is my minimal wrapper around cURL to be able just to fetch a webpage as a string. This is useful, for example, for unit testing.  It is basically a RAII wrapper around the C code.Install "libcurl" on your machine yum install libcurl libcurl-devel or equivalent.Usage example:Class implementation:With this answer I refer to the answer from Software_Developer. By rebuilding the code I found that some parts are deprecated (gethostbyname()) or do not provide error handling (creation of sockets, sending something) for an operation.The following windows code is tested with Visual Studio 2013 and Windows 8.1 64-bit as well as Windows 7 64-bit. It will target an IPv4 TCP Connection with the Web Server of www.google.com.References:Deprecation of gethostbynameReturn Value of socket()Return Value of send()C++ does not provide any way to do it directly. It would entirely depend on what platforms and libraries that you have.At worst case, you can use the boost::asio library to establish a TCP connection, send the HTTP headers (RFC 2616), and parse the responses directly. Looking at your application needs, this is simple enough to do.You may want to check C++ REST SDK (codename "Casablanca"). http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj950081.aspxWith the C++ REST SDK (codename "Casablanca"), you can more easily connect to HTTP servers from your C++ app. The C++ REST SDK (codename "Casablanca") is a Microsoft project for cloud-based client-server communication in native code using a modern asynchronous C++ API design.You can use embeddedRest library. It is lightweight header-only library. So it is easy to include it to your project and it does not require compilation cause there no .cpp files in it.Request example from readme.md from repo:C and C++ don\'t have a standard library for HTTP or even for socket connections. Over the years some portable libraries have been developed. The most widely used, as others have said, is libcurl.Here is a list of alternatives to libcurl (coming from the libcurl\'s web site).Also, for Linux, this is a simple HTTP client. You could implement your own simple HTTP GET client, but this won\'t work if there are authentication or redirects involved or if you need to work behind a proxy. For these cases you need a full-blown library like libcurl.For source code with libcurl, this is the closest to what you want (Libcurl has many examples). Look at the main function. The html content will be copied to the buffer, after a successfully connection. Just replace parseHtml with your own function.Here is some (relatively) simple C++11 code that uses libCURL to download a URL\'s content into a std::vector<char>:Generally I\'d recommend something cross-platform like cURL, POCO, or Qt. However, here is a Windows example!:    The HTTP protocol is very simple, so it is very simple to write a HTTP client.\nHere is onehttps://github.com/pedro-vicente/lib_netsocketsIt uses HTTP GET to retrieve a file from a web server, both server and file are command line parameters. The remote file is saved to a local copy.Disclaimer: I am the authorEDIT: edited URLAlthough a little bit late. You may prefer https://github.com/Taymindis/backcurl .It allows you to do http call on mobile c++ development. Suitable for Mobile game developementYou can use ACE in order to do so:
