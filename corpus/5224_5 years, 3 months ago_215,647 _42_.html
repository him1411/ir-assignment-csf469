I am using bootstrap on my site and am having issues with the navbar fixed top. When I am just using the regular navbar, everything is fine. However, when i try to switch it to navbar fixed top, all the other content on the site shifts up like the navbar isn\'t there and the navbar overlaps it. here\'s basically how i laid it out:i tried to copy bootstraps examples exactly but still having this issue only when using navbar fixed top. what am I doing wrong?Your answer is right in the docs:The fixed navbar will overlay your other content, unless you add padding to the top of the <body>. Try out your own values or use our snippet below. Tip: By default, the navbar is 50px high.Make sure to include this after the core Bootstrap CSS.As others have stated adding a padding-top to body works great.\nBut when you make the screen narrower (to cell phone widths) there is a gap between the navbar and the body. Also, a crowded navbar can wrap to a multi-line bar, overwriting some of the content again.This solved these kinds of issues for meThis makes a 40px padding by default and 0px when under 768px width (which according to bootstrap\'s docs is the cell phone layout cutoff where the gap would be created)This issue is known and there\'s a workaround in the twitter bootstrap site:When you affix the navbar, remember to account for the hidden area\n  underneath. Add 40px or more of padding to the <body>. Be sure to add\n  this after the core Bootstrap CSS and before the optional responsive\n  CSS.This worked for me:@Ryan, you are right, hard-coding the height will make it work bad in case of custom navbars. This is the code I am using for BS 3.0.0 happily:I put this before the yield container:I like this approach because it documents the hack needed to get it work, plus it also works for the mobile nav.EDIT - this works much better:a much more handy solution for your reference, it works perfect in all of my projects:change your first line fromtoAll the previous solutions hard-code 40 pixels specifically into the html or CSS in one fashion or another.  What if the navbar contains a different font-size or an image?  What if I have a good reason not to mess with the body padding in the first place?  I have been searching for a solution to this problem, and here is what I came up with:You can move it up or down by adjusting the \'1\'.  It seems to work for me regardless of the size of the content in the navbar, before and after resizing.  I am curious what others think about this:  please share your thoughts.  (It will be refactored as not to repeat, btw.)  Besides using jQuery, are there any other reasons not to approach the problem this way?  I\'ve even got it working with a secondary navbar like this: PS: Above is on Bootstrap 2.3.2 - will it work in 3.x As long as the generic class names remain... in fact, it should work independent of bootstrap, right?EDIT: Here is a complete jquery function that handles two stacked, responsive fixed navbars of dynamic size.  It requires 3 html classes(or could use id\'s): user-top, admin-top, and contentwrap:The problem is with navbar-fixed-top, which will overlay your content unless specify body-padding. No solution provided here works in 100% cases. The JQuery solution blink/shift the page after the page is loaded, which looks weird.The real solution for me is not to use navbar-fixed-top, but navbar-static-top.As I\'ve posted in a similar question, I\'ve had good success with creating a dummy non-fixed nav bar right before my real fixed nav bar.The spacing works out great on all screen sizes.For handling wrapping lines in menu-bar, apply an id to the navbar, like this:and add this small script in the head after including the jquery, like this:That way, the top-padding of the body gets automatically adjusted.for Bootstrap 3.+ , I\'d use following CSS to fix navbar-fixed-top  and the anchor jump overlapped issue based on \nhttps://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/1768All you have to do is Further to Nick Bisby\'s answer, if you get this problem using HAML in rails and you have applied Roberto Barros\' fix here:I replaced the require in the "bootstrap_and_overrides.css" to:=require twitter-bootstrap-static/bootstrap.css.erb(See https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails/issues/91)... you need to put the body CSS before the require statement as follows:If the require statement is before the body CSS, it will not take effect.I would do this:This should make sure the nav block doesn\'t stretch downpage and covers the page content.I just wrapped the navbar in a No fancy hocus pocus but it worked..
