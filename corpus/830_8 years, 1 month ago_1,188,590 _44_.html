I\'ve seen such hrefs many times, but I don\'t know what exactly that means.The void operator evaluates the given\n  expression and then returns undefined.The void operator is often used merely\n  to obtain the undefined primitive\n  value, usually using \xe2\x80\x9cvoid(0)\xe2\x80\x9d (which\n  is equivalent to \xe2\x80\x9cvoid 0\xe2\x80\x9d). In these\n  cases, the global variable undefined\n  can be used instead (assuming it has\n  not been assigned to a non-default\n  value).An explanation is provided here: void operator.The reason you\xe2\x80\x99d want to do this with the href of a link is that normally, a javascript: URL will redirect the browser to a plain text version of the result of evaluating that JavaScript. But if the result is undefined, then the browser stays on the same page. void(0) is just the smallest script possible that evaluates as undefined.In addition to the technical answer, javascript:void means the author is Doing It Wrong.There is no good reason to use a javascript: pseudo-URL(*). In practice it will cause confusion or errors should anyone try things like \xe2\x80\x98bookmark link\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98open link in a new tab\xe2\x80\x99, and so on. This happens quite a lot now people have got used to middle-click-for-new-tab: it looks like a link, you want to read it in a new tab, but it turns out to be not a real link at all, and gives unwanted results like a blank page or a JS error when middle-clicked.<a href="#"> is a common alternative which might arguably be less bad. However you must remember to return false from your onclick event handler to prevent the link being followed and scrolling up to the top of the page.In some cases there may be an actual useful place to point the link to. For example if you have a control you can click on that opens up a previously-hidden <div id="foo">, it makes some sense to use <a href="#foo"> to link to it. Or if there is a non-JavaScript way of doing the same thing (for example, \xe2\x80\x98thispage.php?show=foo\xe2\x80\x99 that sets foo visible to begin with), you can link to that.Otherwise, if a link points only to some script, it is not really a link and should not be marked up as such. The usual approach would be to add the onclick to a <span>, <div>, or an <a> without an href and style it in some way to make it clear you can click on it. This is what StackOverflow [did at the time of writing; now it uses href="#"].The disadvantage of this is that you lose keyboard control, since you can\'t tab onto a span/div/bare-a or activate it with space. Whether this is actually a disadvantage depends on what sort of action the element is intended to take. You can, with some effort, attempt to mimic the keyboard interactability by adding a tabIndex to the element, and listening for a Space keypress. But it\'s never going to 100% reproduce the real browser behaviour, not least because different browsers can respond to the keyboard differently (not to mention non-visual browsers).If you really want an element that isn\'t a link but which can be activated as normal by mouse or keyboard, what you want is a <button type="button"> (or <input type="button"> is just as good, for simple textual contents). You can always use CSS to restyle it so it looks more like a link than a button, if you want. But since it behaves like a button, that\'s how really you should mark it up.(*: in site authoring, anyway. Obviously they are useful for bookmarklets. javascript: pseudo-URLs are a conceptual bizarreness: a locator that doesn\'t point to a location, but instead calls active code inside the current location. They have caused massive security problems for both browsers and webapps, and should never have been invented by Netscape.)It means it\xe2\x80\x99ll do nothing. It\xe2\x80\x99s an attempt to have the link not \xe2\x80\x98navigate\xe2\x80\x99 anywhere. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not the right way.You should actually just return false in the onclick event, like so:Typically it\xe2\x80\x99s used if the link is doing some \xe2\x80\x98JavaScript-y\xe2\x80\x99 thing. Like posting an AJAX form, or swapping an image, or whatever. In that case you just make whatever function is being called return false.To make your website completely awesome, however, generally you\xe2\x80\x99ll include a link that does the same action, if the person browsing it chooses not to run JavaScript.There is a HUGE difference in the behaviour of "#" vs javascript:void"#" scrolls you to the TOP of the page\nwhile "javascript:void(0);" does not.This is very important if you are coding dynamic pages.\nthe user does not want to go back to top just because he clicked a link on the page.It is used very popularly to add js functions to the html link, for example: the [Print] link that you see on many webpages. Code is like:Why need \'href\' while \'onclick\' alone can get the job done? Because if we omit the \'href\', when users mouse over the text "Print" the cursor will change to "I". Having \'href\' allow the cursor to display as if it was a hyperlink: a pointing hand.PS: There are 2 methods: 1. href="javascript:void(0);" and 2. href="#" - both have the same effect. But the 1st require JS to be turned on in web browser while the 2nd does not. So the 2nd seems to be more compatible.You should always have an href on your a tags. Calling a Javascript function that returns \'undefined\' will do just fine. So will linking to \'#\'.Anchor tags in IE6 without an href do not get the a:hover style applied.Yes it is terrible and a minor crime against humanity, but then again so is IE6 in general.Hope this helps.EDIT: IE6 is actually a major crime against humanityThe void operator evaluates the given expression and then returns undefined.\nIt avoids refreshing the page.void is an operator that is used to return a undefined value so the browser will not be able to load a new page. Web browsers will try and take whatever is used as an URL and load it unless it is a javascript function that returns null. for example, if we click a link like this: then an alert message will show up without loading a new page, and that is because alert is a function that returns a null value. This means that when the browser attempts to load a new page it sees null and has nothing to loadAn important thing to note about the void operator is that it requires a value and cannot be used by itself. we should use it like this: To understand this concept one should first understand the void operator in javascript.The syntax for the void operator is: void \xc2\xabexpr\xc2\xbb which evaluates expr and returns undefined.If you implement void as a function, it looks as follows:This void operator has one important usage that is - Discarding the result of an expression.In some situations, it is important to return undefined as opposed to the result of\nan expression. Then void can be used to discard that result. One such situation\ninvolves javascript: URLs, which should be avoided for links, but are useful for\nbookmarklets. When you visit one of those URLs, many browsers replace the current document with the result of evaluating the URL\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccontent,\xe2\x80\x9d but only if the result\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t undefined . Hence, if you want to open a new window without changing the\ncurrently displayed content, you can do the following:It\'s worth mentioning that you\'ll sometimes see void 0 when checking for undefined, simply because it requires less characters.For example:vs.Some minification methods replace undefined with void 0 for this reason.Another example where is used javascript.void(0) . I\'m not sure whether it is the correct way, but does the job
