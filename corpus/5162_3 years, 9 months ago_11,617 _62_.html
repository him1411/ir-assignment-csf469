Usually textareas are rectangular or square, like this: But I want a custom-shaped textarea, like this, for example: How is this possible?First, there are many solutions, proposed in other posts. I think this one is currently (in 2013) the one which can be compatible with the largest number of browsers, because it doesn\'t need any CSS3 properties. However, the method will not work on browsers which doesn\'t support contentdeditable, be careful.As proposed by @Getz, you can use a div with contenteditable and then shape it with some div on it. Here is an example, with two blocks which float at the upper left and the upper right of the main div:As you can see, you have to play a little with the borders if you want the same result as you requested in your post. The main div has the blue border on every side. Next, red blocks has to be sticked to hide top borders of the main div, and you need to apply border to them only on particular sides (bottom and left for the right block, bottom and right for the left).After that, you can get the content via Javascript, when the "Submit" button is triggered for example. And I think you can also handle the rest of the CSS (font-size, color, etc.) :)In the near future we can use so called css-shapes to achieve this. A div with the contenteditable attribute set to true combined with css-shapes can make a text area any kind of shape.Currently Chrome Canary already supports css-shapes. An example what is possible with css-shapes is:Here they are using a polygon shape to define the text-flow. It should be possible to create two polygons to match the shape you want for your textarea.More information about css-shapes has been written at: http://sarasoueidan.com/blog/css-shapes/To enable css-shapes in Chrome Canary:Click the \'Relaunch Now\' button at the bottom of the\n  browser window.from: http://html.adobe.com/webplatform/enable/Polygon created with: http://betravis.github.io/shape-tools/polygon-drawing/Resulthttp://jsfiddle.net/A8cPj/1/Maybe it\'s possible with Content Editable ?It\'s not a textarea, but if you succeed to create a div with this shape, it could work.I think it\'s not possible with just textarea...A little example: http://jsfiddle.net/qgfP6/5/You could work with a contenteditable div, with two corners divs:You could also do this with CSS RegionsWith Regions, you can use CSS properties to flow content into existing\n  styled containers, specifying any container order you choose,\n  regardless of their position on the page.(Web Platform)[Currently supported in WebKit Nightly, Safari 6.1+ and iOS7 and already usable in chrome and opera after enabling the flag: enable-experimental-web-platform-features - caniuse, Web Platform ]So you could make that textarea shape by flowing the text through 2 regions, and edit it by adding contenteditable on the content.The result:For more info about regions - here\'s a good aricle: CSS3 regions: Rich page layout with HTML and CSS3A long line of text in the box will drop the cursor down past the middle edges and I can\'t seem to fix that.That\'s not possible sire! A textarea is generally a rect or square box, where you can type in.However, to make something like that you can use 2 textarea\'s and then give them a specified width and height. Otherwise I don\'t think its gonna happen!Second method would be to make an editable element. http://jsfiddle.net/afzaal_ahmad_zeeshan/at2ke/The code is: Using this, you can make any element editable! You can give dimensions to it, and it will work! You will get it just as a textarea.Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_EditableIf you combine CSS shapes with contenteditable this can be done in webkit browsers.First you have to enable the flag: enable-experimental-web-platform-featuresThen restart your webkit browser and then check this FIDDLE out !This method will work for non-standard shapes as well.So how on earth did I get that polygon shape?Go to this site and make your own custom shape!Notes about enabling the flag:\n(from here)To enable Shapes, Regions, and Blend Modes:Copy and paste\n  chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features into the\n  address bar, then press enter. Click the \'Enable\' link within that\n  section. \n  Click the \'Relaunch Now\' button at the bottom of the browser\n  window.You can use Google web designer tool for creating complex shapes using HTML5-canvas and CSS.More over you will get other tools like typing tools to enter texts inside these shapes.As the output file contains much code, providing a fiddle of a sample demo created using Google Web Designer toolFIDDLE DEMO>>If, for whatever reason, you really need to support browsers that don\'t have contenteditable, you could probably do the same thing in JavaScript, by using events, although this is a very messy workaround.Pseudocode:
