What is the easiest way to convert toIf you\'re using ruby 1.8.7 or 1.9, you can use the fact that iterator methods like each_with_index, when called without a block, return an Enumerator object, which you can call Enumerable methods like map on. So you can do:In 1.8.6 you can do:Ruby >= 1.9.3 has Enumerator#with_index(offset = 0). To convert the array to an enumerator, use Object#to_enum or Array#map, whatever feels more declarative to you:In ruby 1.9.3 there is a chainable method called with_index which can be chained to map.For example:\n\narray.map.with_index { |item, index| ... }\nOver the top obfuscation:Here are two more options for 1.8.6 (or 1.9) without using enumerator:I have always enjoyed the syntax of this style:Invoking each_with_index gets you an enumerator you can easily map over with your index available.I often do this:Instead of directly iterating over the elements of the array, you\'re iterating over a range of integers and using them as the indices to retrieve the elements of the array.A fun, but useless way to do this:
