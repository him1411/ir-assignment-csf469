I am yet to find a high-level definition of Spring beans that I can understand. I see them referenced often in Grails documentation and books, but I think that understanding what they are would be beneficial. So what are Spring beans? How can they be used? Do they have something to do with Dependency Injection?The objects that form the backbone of your application and that are\n  managed by the Spring IoC container are called beans. A bean is an\n  object that is instantiated, assembled, and otherwise managed by a\n  Spring IoC container. These beans are created with the configuration\n  metadata that you supply to the container, for example, in the form of\n  XML  definitions.More to learn about beans and scope from SpringSource:When you create a bean definition what you are actually creating is a\n  recipe for creating actual instances of the class defined by that bean\n  definition. The idea that a bean definition is a recipe is important,\n  because it means that, just like a class, you can potentially have\n  many object instances created from a single recipe.You can control not only the various dependencies and configuration\n  values that are to be plugged into an object that is created from a\n  particular bean definition, but also the scope of the objects created\n  from a particular bean definition. This approach is very powerful and\n  gives you the flexibility to choose the scope of the objects you\n  create through configuration instead of having to \'bake in\' the scope\n  of an object at the Java class level. Beans can be defined to be\n  deployed in one of a number of scopesSpring beans are just object instances that are managed by the Spring container, namely, they are created and wired by the framework and put into a "bag of objects" (the container) from where you can get them later.The "wiring" part there is what dependency injection is all about, what it means is that you can just say "I will need this thing" and the framework will follow some rules to get you the proper instance.For someone who isn\'t used to Spring, I think Wikipedia Spring\'s article has a nice description:Central to the Spring Framework is its inversion of control container,\n  which provides a consistent means of configuring and managing Java\n  objects using reflection. The container is responsible for managing\n  object lifecycles of specific objects: creating these objects, calling\n  their initialization methods, and configuring these objects by wiring\n  them together.Objects created by the container are also called managed objects or\n  beans. The container can be configured by loading XML files or\n  detecting specific Java annotations on configuration classes. These\n  data sources contain the bean definitions which provide the\n  information required to create the beans.Objects can be obtained by means of either dependency lookup or\n  dependency injection. Dependency lookup is a pattern where a caller\n  asks the container object for an object with a specific name or of a\n  specific type. Dependency injection is a pattern where the container\n  passes objects by name to other objects, via either constructors,\n  properties, or factory methods.Well you understood it partially. You have to tailor the beans according to your need and inform Spring container to manage it when required, by using a methodology populalrly known as IoC (Inversion of Control) coined by Martin Fowler, also known as Dependency Injection (DI). You wire the beans in a way, so that you do not have to take care of the instantiating or evaluate any dependency on the bean. This is popularly known as Hollywood Principle.Google is the best tool to explore more on this in addition to the links you would get flooded with here in this question. :)Spring have the IoC container  which carry the Bag of Bean ; creation maintain and deletion are the responsibilities of Spring Container.\nWe can put the bean in to Spring by Wiring and Auto Wiring.\nWiring mean we manually configure it into the XML file and "Auto Wiring" mean we put the annotations in the Java file then Spring  automatically scan the root-context where java configuration file, make it and put into the bag of Spring.Here is the detail URI where you got more information about BeansBeans are at the core of Spring. They are standard Java objects instantiated and managed by Spring.Beans are mostly used to:In Spring, those objects that form the backbone of your application and that are managed by the Spring IoC\ncontainer are referred to as beans. A bean is simply an object that is instantiated, assembled and otherwise\nmanaged by a Spring IoC container; Spring beans are just object instances that are managed by the Spring IOC container.Spring IOC container carry the Bag of Bean.Bean creation,maintain and deletion    are the responsibilities of Spring Container. We can put the bean in to Spring by Wiring and Auto Wiring.Wiring mean we manually configure it into the XML file.Auto Wiring mean we put the annotations in the Java file then Spring automatically scan the root-context where java configuration file, make it and put into the bag of Spring.Spring beans are classes. Instead of instantiating a class (using new), you get an instance as a bean casted to your class type from the application context, where the bean is what you configured in the application context configuration. This way, the whole application maintains singleton-scope instance throughout the application. All beans are initialized following their configuration order right after the application context is instantiated. Event if you don\'t get any beans in your application, all beans instances are already created the moment after you created the application context.JAVA beanA Java Bean is a Java class that should follow following conventions:let understand Spring beanSpring beanSpring Bean is nothing special, any object in the Spring framework that we initialize through Spring container is called Spring Bean. Any normal Java POJO class can be a Spring Bean if it\xe2\x80\x99s configured to be initialized via container by providing configuration metadata information.Simple beanIOC container manage the life cycle of bean through metadata(spring.xml) filemy spring.xmlI\'m trying to demonstrate in simplest wayFor Spring, all objects are beans! The fundamental step in the Spring\n  Framework is todefine your objects as beans. Beans are nothing but object instances\n  that would becreated by the spring framework by looking at their class definitions.\n  These definitionsbasically form the configuration metadata. The framework then creates\n  a plan for whichobjects need to be instantiated, which dependencies need to be set and\n  injected, thescope of the newly created instance, etc., based on this configuration\n  metadata.The metadata can be supplied in a simple XML file, just like in thefirst chapter. Alter- natively, one could provide the metadata asAnnotation or Java Configuration.Book:Just Spring
