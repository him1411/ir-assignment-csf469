I accidently checked the "disable alerts from this site" box in Chrome, and now I cannot get any window.alert to work on my localhost.I have tried resetting the settings in advanced but no luck.Close and re-open the tab. That should do the trick.I can see that this only for actually turning the dialogs back on.  But if you are a web dev and you would like to see a way to possibly have some form of notification when these are off...in the case that you are using native alerts/confirms for validation or whatever.
