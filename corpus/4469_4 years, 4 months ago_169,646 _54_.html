Is there a way to delete a module within Android Studio?\nWhen I right click on a module I can\'t find an option for deletion, is it elsewhere?The "Mark as Excluded" option isn\'t there anymore.The current (Android Studio 0.8.x - 2.2.x) way to do this is via the Project Structure dialog. It can be accessed via "File -> Project Structure" or by right-clicking on a Module and selecting "Module Settings".Then select the module, and click the "minus" button to remove it.The directory will still be visible in the "Project" view (though not in the "Android" view) since it\'s not actually deleted, but it will no longer be treated as a module.If you want, you can then physically delete the files it by right-clicking on it and pressing "Delete".(Editor\'s Note: This answer was correct in May 2013 for Android Studio v0.1, but is no longer accurate as of July 2014, since the mentioned menu option does not exist anymore -- see this answer for up-to-date alternative).First you will have to mark it as excluded. \nThen on right click you will be able to delete the project.In Android Studio 1.0 - 1.1b4, I found this to be the easiest way to remove a module:Open settings.gradle found under Gradle ScriptsDelete module\'s name from the include statementSync Project with Gradle FilesOptionally, delete it manually from the project folderExampleOld:New:As I saw that in Android Studio 0.5.1, you have to close your project by doing simply File -> Close Project then move your mouse over the project which you want to delete then keep your mouse on the same project and press delete then click on "OK" button that would delete your project from Android Studio.In Android studio v1.0.2Method 1Go to project structure, File -> Project Structure..., as the following picture show, click - icon to remove the module.Method 2Edit the file settings.gradle and remove the entry you are going to delete. e.g. edit the file from include \':app\', \':apple\' to include \':app\'.That will work in most of the situation, however finally you have to delete the module from disk manually if you don\'t need it anymore.I\'m currently running the 0.5.8 version of Android Studio and I can\'t even find the "Mark folder as" option when I right click, what I do is:Right click on project -> Click on Show in Explorer and then just delete it from there.You can achieve the same result by deleting it directly through Windows Explorer. That\'s the only way I\'ve been able to get rid of Projects I did not want anymore. Oh and of course, this also removes it from the hard disk.Deleting is such a headache. I am posting the solution for Android Studio 1.0.2.Step 1: Right click on the "Project Name" selected from the folder hierarchy like shown. Note: It can also be deleted from the Commander View from right hand side of your window by right clicking the project name and selecting delete from the context menu.Step 2: The project is deleted(seemingly) but gradle seems to keep the record of the project app folder(Check it by clcking on the Gradle View). Now go to File->Close Project.Step 3: Now you are at the start window. Move the cursor on the  in recent project list. Press Delete.Step 4: Delete the folder from the explorer by moving or deleting it actually. This location is in your_user_name->Android Studio Projects->...Step 5: Go back to the Android studio window and the project is gone for good. You can start a new project now.The most reliable way I have found to do this it to go to project structure and remove it from dependencies and remove it from your setting.gradle file.It will appear as if it is fully deleted at his point but it is not. If you try to re add the module it will say that it already exist in the project. The final step is to go to the location of your project using file explorer etc and delete the module.This work 100% of the time on studio 1.3.1Assuming the following:You can delete an Android Studio module as follows:In android-studio version 2. just goRight Click on Project-->Open Module Option-->Click Your Module --> click sign done then press ok button.Here is for Android studio 2.3.3\nI did not find any Project Structure under File menu. \nSo here are steps in pictures\nAfter doing what\'s referred in [this answer]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/24592192/82788Select the module(since it\'s still visible on the Project view),pressing Delete button on the keyboard can delete this module on disk.(Before doing what\'s referred in that answer, the Delete button has no effect.)Remove from File > File Structure > Dependencies > - button. Then if it is stull there you can remove the module by going to the settings.gradle file and removing it from the include line.
