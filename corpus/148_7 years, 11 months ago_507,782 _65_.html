I have an Android Activity, with two elements:When my Activity starts, the EditText immediately has input focus (flashing cursor). I don\'t want any control to have input focus at startup. I tried:No luck. How can I convince the EditText to not select itself when the Activity starts?Excellent answers from Luc and Mark however a good code sample is missing:Is the actual problem that you just don\'t want it to have focus at all?  Or you don\'t want it to show the virtual keyboard as a result of focusing the EditText?  I don\'t really see an issue with the EditText having focus on start, but it\'s definitely a problem to have the softInput window open when the user did not explicitly request to focus on the EditText (and open the keyboard as a result).If it\'s the problem of the virtual keyboard, see the AndroidManifest.xml <activity> element documentation.android:windowSoftInputMode="stateHidden" - always hide it when entering the activity.or android:windowSoftInputMode="stateUnchanged" - don\'t change it (e.g. don\'t show it if it isn\'t already shown, but if it was open when entering the activity, leave it open).A simpler solution exists. Set these attributes in your parent layout:And now, when the activity starts this main layout will get focus by default.Also, we can remove focus from child views at runtime (e.g., after finishing child editing) by giving the focus to the main layout again, like this:Good comment from Guillaume Perrot:android:descendantFocusability="beforeDescendants" seems to be the\n  default (integer value is 0). It works just by adding\n  android:focusableInTouchMode="true".Really, we can see that the beforeDescendants set as default in the ViewGroup.initViewGroup() method (Android 2.2.2). But not equal to 0. ViewGroup.FOCUS_BEFORE_DESCENDANTS = 0x20000;Thanks to Guillaume.The only solution I\'ve found is:And the EditText won\'t get the focus after starting the activityThe problem seems to come from a property that I can only see in the XML form of the layout.Make sure to remove this line at the end of the declaration of the EditText :That should give something like that :using the information provided by other posters, I used the following solution:in the layout XMLin onCreate()and finally, in onResume()The following will stop edittext from taking focus when created, but grab it when you touch them.So you set focusable to false in the xml, but the key is in the java, which you add the following listener:Because you are returning false, i.e. not consuming the event, the focusing behavior will proceed like normal.Try clearFocus() instead of setSelected(false).  Every view in Android has both focusability and selectability, and I think you want to just clear the focus.I had tried serval answer individually but the focus is still at the EditText. I only manage to solve it by using two of the above solution together.( Reference from Silver https://stackoverflow.com/a/8639921/15695 )and removeat EditText ( Reference from floydaddict https://stackoverflow.com/a/9681809 )None of this solutions worked for me. The way I fix the autofocus was:Simple solution:\nIn AndroidManifest in Activity tag useYou can just set "focusable" and "focusable in touch mode" to value true on the first TextView of the layout. In this way when the activity starts the TextView will be focused but , due to its nature, you will see nothing focused on the screen and ,of course, there will be no keyboard displayed...The following worked for me in Manifest. Write ,I needed to clear focus from all fields programmatically. I just added the following two statements to my main layout definition.That\'s it. Fixed my problem instantly. Thanks, Silver, for pointing me in the right direction.Add android:windowSoftInputMode="stateAlwaysHidden" in the activity tag of the Manifest.xml file.SourceTry this before your first editable field:If you have another view on your activity like a ListView, you can also do:in your onResume() to grab focus from the editText.I know this question has been answered but just providing an alternative solution that worked for me :)Add following in onCreate method:Being that I don\'t like to pollute the XML with something that is related to functionality, I created this method that "transparently" steals the focus from the first focusable view and then makes sure to remove itself when necessary!Late, but maybe helpful. Create a dummy EditText at the top of your layout then call myDummyEditText.requestFocus() in onCreate()That seems to behave as I expect. No need to handle configuration changes, etc. I needed this for an Activity with a lengthy TextView (instructions).Yeah I did the same thing - create a \'dummy\' linear layout which gets initial focus. Furthermore, I set the \'next\' focus IDs so the user can\'t focus it any more after scrolling once:a lot of work just to get rid of focus on a view.. ThanksThe simplest thing I did is to set focus on another view in onCreate:This stopped the soft keyboard coming up and there was no cursor flashing in the EditText.For me, what worked on all devices is this:Just put this as a view before the problematic focused view, and that\'s it.This is the perfect and most easiest solution.I always use this in my app.                        At onCreate of your Activity, just add use clearFocus() on your EditText element.\nFor example,And if you want to divert the focus to another element, use requestFocus() on that.\nFor example,You can achieve this by creating a dummy EditText with layout width and height set to 0dp, and request focus to that view.\nAdd the following code snippet in your xml layout:Make sure to remove the line "<requestFocus />" from the EditText tag in xml.I use the following code to stop an EditText from stealing the focus when my button is pressed.Basicly, hide the edit text and then show it again. This works for me as the EditText is not in view so it doesn\'t matter whether it is showing.You could try hiding and showing it in succession to see if that helps it lose focus.When your activity is opened, keyboard gets visible automatically which causes focusing of EditText. You can disable keyboard by writing the following line in your activity tag in manifest.xml file.
