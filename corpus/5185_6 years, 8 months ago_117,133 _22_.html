I\'m working on a little personal todo list app and so far everything has been working quite well. There is one little quirk I\'d like to figure out. Whenever I go to add a new item, I have a Dialog with an EditText view showing inside. When I select the EditText view, the keyboard comes up to enter text, as it should. In most applications, the default seems to be that the shift key is held for the first letter... although it does not do this for my view. There has to be a simple way to fix, but I\'ve searched the reference repeatedly and cannot find it. I\'m thinking there has to be an xml attribute for the reference loaded by the Adapter, but I can\'t find out what it is.Statically (i.e. in your layout XML file): set android:inputType="textCapSentences" on your EditText.Programmatically: you have to include InputType.TYPE_CLASS_TEXT in the InputType of the EditText, e.g.Can be combined with text and its variations to request capitalization of the first character of every sentence. - Google DocsJust use android:inputType="textCapWords" in your EditText element.For example:Refer to the following link for reference:\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView.html#attr_android%3ainputTypeor android:inputType="textCapSentences" will only work If your device keyboard Auto Capitalize Setting enabled.I encountered the same problem, just sharing what I found out. Might help you and others...Try this on your layout.add the line below in your EditText.works fine on me.. hope it works also on you...Apply following line in your edit test in xml.It will also allow multi line support.Try This Code, it will capitalize first character of all words.- set addTextChangedListener for EditText viewedt_text.addTextChangedListener(watcher);- Add TextWatcher Earlier it used to be android:capitalize="words", which is now deprecated. The recommended alternative is to use android:inputType="textCapWords"Please note that this will only work if your device keyboard Auto Capitalize Setting enabled.To do this programatically, use the following method:setInputType(InputType.TYPE_CLASS_TEXT | InputType.TYPE_TEXT_FLAG_CAP_WORDS);
