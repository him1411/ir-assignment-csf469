I have a scenario where, after logging in through a login page, there will be a sign-out button on each activity.On clicking sign-out, I will be passing the session id of the signed in user to sign-out. Can anyone guide me on how to keep session id available to all activities?Any alternative to this case The easiest way to do this would be to pass the session id to the signout activity in the intent you\'re using to start the activity:Access that intent on next activityThe docs for Intents has more information (look at the section titled "Extras").In your current Activity, create a new Intent:Then in the new Activity, retrieve those values:Use this technique to pass variables from one Activity to the other.Passing Intent extras is a good approach as Erich noted. The Application object is another way though, and it is sometimes easier when dealing with the same state across multiple activities (as opposed to having to get/put it everywhere), or objects more complex than primitives and Strings. You can extend Application, and then set/get whatever you want there and access it from any Activity (in the same application) with getApplication().Also keep in mind that other approaches you might see, like statics, can be problematic because they can lead to memory leaks. Application helps solve this too.Source class:Destination Class (NewActivity class):You just have to send extras while calling your intent.Like this:Now on the OnCreate method of your SecondActivity you can fetch the extras like this.If the value you sent was in long:If the value you sent was a String:If the value you sent was a Boolean:Updated Note that I had mentioned the use of SharedPreference. It has a simple API and is accessible across an application\'s activities. But this is a clumsy solution, and is a security risk if you pass around sensitive data. It\'s best to use intents. It has an extensive list of overloaded methods that can be used to better transfer many different data types between activities. Have a look at intent.putExtra. This link presents the use of putExtra quite well.Try to do the following:Create a simple "helper" class (factory for your Intents), like this:This will be the factory for all your Intents. Everytime you need a new Intent, create a static factory method in IntentHelper. To create a new Intent you should just say it like this:In your activity. When you want to "save" some data in a "session" just use the following:And send this Intent. In the target Activity your field will be available as:So now we can use Intent like same old session (like in servlets or JSP).You can also pass custom class objects by making a parcelable class. Best way to make it parcelable is to write your class and then simply paste it to a site like http://www.parcelabler.com/. Click on build and you will get new code. Copy all of this and replace the original class contents. \nThen-and get the result in NextActivity like-Now you can simply use the foo object like you would have used.Another way is to use a public static field in which you store data, i.e.:The standard approach. Now in your second activity retrieve your data from the bundle:Get the bundleExtract the data\xe2\x80\xa6The most convenient way to pass data between activities is by passing intents. In the first activity from where you want to send data, you should add code,You should also importThen in the next Acitvity(SecondActivity), you should retrieve the data from the intent using the following code.You can use SharedPreferences...Logging. Time store session id in SharedPreferencesSignout. Time fetch session id in sharedpreferencesIf you don\'t have the required session id, then remove sharedpreferences:That is very useful, because one time you save the value and then retrieve anywhere of activity.From ActivityTo ActivityYou can send data between activities using intent object.\nConsider you have two activities namely FirstActivity and SecondActivity.Inside FirstActivity:Using Intent:Inside SecondActivityNow you can use different bundle class methods to get values passed from FirstActivity  by Key.E.g.\nbundle.getString("key"),bundle.getDouble("key") ,bundle.getInt("key") etc.If you want to tranfer bitmap between Activites/FragmentsActivityTo pass a bitmap between ActivitesAnd in the Activity classFragmentTo pass a bitmap between FragmentsTo receive inside the SecondFragmentTransfering Large BitmapsIf you are getting failed binder transaction, this means you are exceeding the binder transaction buffer by transferring large element from one activity to another activity. So in that case you have to compress the bitmap as an byte\'s array and then uncompress it in another activity, like thisIn the FirstActivityAnd in the SecondActivityYou can retrieve it in another activity. Two ways:The second way is:You can try Shared Preference, it may be a good alternative for sharing data between the activities    To save session id -To get them -The passing of data between activities is mainly by means of an intent object.First you have to attach the data to the intent object with the use of the Bundle class. Then call the activity using either startActivity() or startActivityForResult() methods.You can find more information about it, with an example from the blog post Passing data to an Activity.The actual process of passing data has already been answered, however most of the answers use hard coded strings for the key name in the Intent. This is usually fine when used only within your app. However, the documentation recommends using the EXTRA_* constants for standardized data types.Example 1: Using Intent.EXTRA_* keysFirst activitySecond activity:Example 2: Defining your own static final keyIf one of the Intent.EXTRA_* Strings does not suit your needs, you can define your own at the beginning of the first activity.Including the package name is just a convention if you are only using the key in your own app. But it is a necessity to avoid naming conflicts if you are creating some sort of service that other apps can call with an Intent.First activity:Second activity:Example 3: Using a String resource keyAlthough not mentioned in the documentation, this answer recommends using a String resource to avoid dependencies between activities.strings.xmlFirst activitySecond activityTry this:CurrentActivity.javaTargetActivity.javaHere is my best practice and it helps a lot when the project is huge and complex. Suppose that I have 2 activities, SplashActivity and HomeActivity.\nI want to pass 2 parameters (username & password) from SplashActivity to HomeActivity.First, I create my HomeIntentHere is how I pass the data in my SplashActivityFinal step, here is how I receive the data in HomeActivityDone! Cool :) I just want to share my experience. If you working on small project this shouldn\'t be the big problem. But when your working on big project, it really pain when you want to do refactoring or fixing bugs.It helps me to see things in context. Here are two examples.MainActivity.javaSecondActivity.javaMainActivity.javaSecondActivity.javaI use static fields in a class, and get/set them:Like:For getting a value, use this in an Activity:For setting a value:You can use IntentAnother way you can use singleton pattern also:}From your FirstActivity On SecondActivityI recently released Vapor API, a jQuery flavored Android framework that makes all sorts of tasks like this simpler. As mentioned, SharedPreferences is one way you could do this.VaporSharedPreferences is implemented as Singleton so that is one option, and in Vapor API it has a heavily overloaded .put(...) method so you don\'t have to explicitly worry about the datatype you are committing - providing it is supported. It is also fluent, so you can chain calls:It also optionally autosaves changes, and unifies the reading and writing process under-the-hood so you don\'t need to explicitly retrieve an Editor like you do in standard Android.Alternatively you could use an Intent. In Vapor API you can also use the chainable overloaded .put(...) method on a VaporIntent:And pass it as an extra, as mentioned in the other answers. You can retrieve extras from your Activity, and furthermore if you are using VaporActivity this is done for you automatically so you can use:To retrieve them at the other end in the Activity you switch to.Hope that is of interest to some :)Use a global class:You can call the setters and the getters of this class from all other classes.\nDo do that, you need to make a GlobalClass-Object in every Actitity:Then you can call for example:Charlie Collins gave me a perfect answer using the Application class. I was not aware that we could subclass it that easily. Here is a simplified example using a custom application class.Give the android:name attribute to use your own application class.Use this as a global reference holder. It works fine within a same process.Set the global "singleton" reference to the application instance.A simple example where I use a main activity from another activity instance.I use public static fields to store shared data between activities, but to minimize its side effects, you may:There are multiple ways to pass data between activities, and the documentation has many of them.For most cases, Intent.putExtras is enough.
