I would like to detect whether the user has pressed Enter using jQuery.How is this possible? Does it require a plugin?EDIT: It looks like I need to use the keypress() method. I wanted to know if anyone knows if there are browser issues with that command - like are there any browser compatibility issues I should know about?The whole point of jQuery is that you don\'t have to worry about browser differences. I am pretty sure you can safely go with enter being 13 in all browsers. So with that in mind, you can do this:I wrote a small plugin to make it easier to bind the "on enter key pressed" a event:Usage:I couldn\'t get the code posted by @Paolo Bergantino to work but when I changed it to $(document) and e.which instead of e.keyCode then I found it to work faultlessly.Link to example on JS BinI found this to be more cross-browser compatible:You can do this using the jquery \'keydown\' event handleThere\'s a keypress() event method. The Enter key\'s ascii number is 13 and is not dependent on which browser is being used.A minor extension of Andrea\'s answer above makes the helper method more useful when you may also want to capture modified enter presses (i.e. ctrl-enter or shift-enter). For example, this variant allows binding like:to submit a form when the user presses ctrl-enter with focus on that form\'s textarea.(see also Ctrl+Enter jQuery in TEXTAREA)I spent sometime coming up with this solution i hope it helps someone.In some cases, you may need to suppress the ENTER key for a certain area of a page but not for other areas of a page, like the page below that contains a header <div> with a SEARCH field.It took me a bit to figure out how to do this, and I am posting this simple yet complete example up here for the community.Link to JSFiddle Playground: The [Submit] button does not do anything, but pressing ENTER from one of the Text Box controls will not submit the form.link about thishttp://www.rambeck.com/blog/2008/05/jquery-enter-tab(Dead Link)orhttp://docs.jquery.com/Events/keypressThe easy way to detect whether the user has pressed enter is to use key number the enter key number is =13 to check the value of key in your deviceby pressing the enter key you will get result as 13 . using the key value you can call a function or do whatever you wish if you want to target a button once enter key is pressed you can use the code Hope it help I think the simplest method would be using vanilla javacript:Mozilla DocsSupported Browsers
