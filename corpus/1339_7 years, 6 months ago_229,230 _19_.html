I am using git and working on master branch. This branch has a file called app.js.I have an experiment branch in which I made a bunch of changes and tons of commits. Now I want to bring all the changes done only to app.js from experiment to master branch.How do I do that?Once again I do not want a merge. I just want to bring all the changes in app.js from experiment branch to master branch.See also git how to undo changes of one file?As Jakub Nar\xc4\x99bski mentions in the comments:works too, except that, as detailed in the SO question "How to retrieve a single file from specific revision in Git?", you need to use the full path from the root directory of the repo.\nHence the path/to/app.js used by Jakub in his example.As Frosty mentions in the comment:you will only get the most recent state of app.jsBut, for git checkout or git show, you can actually reference any revision you want, as illustrated in the SO question "git checkout revision of a file in git gui":would be the same is $FILENAME is a full path of a versioned file.$REVISION can be as shown in git rev-parse:and so on.Everything is much simpler, use git checkout for that.Suppose you\'re on master branch, to get app.js from new-feature branch do:This will bring you the contents of the desired file. You can, as always, use part of sha1 instead of new-feature branch name to get the file as it was in that particular commit.Supplemental to VonC\'s and chhh\'s answers.orOr in my case I wanted all the files from another branch so:
