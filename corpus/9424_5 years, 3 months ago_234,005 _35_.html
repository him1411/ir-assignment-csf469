How to pass an array into a SQL Server stored procedure?For example, I have list of employees. I want to use this list as a table and join it with another table. But list of employees should be passed as parameter from C#.Since you have a List already, I think there are more straightforward ways than XML.First, in your database, create the following two objects:Now in your C# code:If you are using SQL Server 2005, I would still recommend a split function over XML. First, create a function:Now your stored procedure can just be:And in your C# code you just have to pass the list as \'1,2,3,12\'...I recommend you compare the maintainability and performance of these options against the method you selected.Use a table-valued parameter for your stored procedure.When you pass it in from C# you\'ll add the parameter with the data type of SqlDb.Structured.See here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb675163.aspxExample: Based on my experience, by creating a delimited expression from the employeeIDs, there is a tricky and nice solution for this problem.  You should only create an string expression like \';123;434;365;\' in-which 123, 434 and 365 are some employeeIDs. By calling the below procedure and passing this expression to it, you can fetch your desired records. Easily you can join the "another table" into this query. This solution is suitable in all versions of SQL server. Also, in comparison with using table variable or temp table, it is very faster and optimized solution.You need to pass it as an XML parameter.Edit: quick code from my project to give you an idea:Then you can use the temp table to join with your tables.\nWe defined arrayOfUlong as a built in XML schema to maintain data integrity, but you don\'t have to do that. I\'d recommend using it so here\'s a quick code for to make sure you always get an XML with longs.Context is always important, such as the size and complexity of the array. For small to mid-size lists, several of the answers posted here are just fine, though some clarifications should be made:With all of that said, IF the data you are using is large or is not very large yet but consistently growing, then the IEnumerable TVP method is the best choice as it streams the data to SQL Server (like the DataTable method), BUT doesn\'t require any duplication of the collection in memory (unlike any of the other methods). I posted an example of the SQL and C# code in this answer: Pass Dictionary<string,int> to Stored Procedure T-SQL.There is no support for array in sql server but there are several ways by which you can pass collection to a stored proc .The below link may help you passing collection to a stored procedureI\'ve been searching through all the examples and answers of how to pass any array to sql server without the hassle of creating new Table type,till i found this linK, below is how I applied it to my project:--The following code is going to get an Array as Parameter and insert the values of that\n--array into another tableHope you enjoy itThis will help you. :) Follow the next steps,Copy Paste the Following code as it is,it will create the Function which convert the String to IntCreate the Following stored procedureExecute this SP Using exec sp_DeleteId \'1,2,3,12\' this is a string of Id\'s which you want to delete,You convert your array to string in C# and pass it as a Stored Procedure parameter\xc2\xa0This will delete multiple rows, All the bestIt took me a long time to figure this out, so in case anyone needs it...This is based on the SQL 2005 method in Aaron\'s answer, and using his SplitInts function (I just removed the delim param since I\'ll always use commas).  I\'m using SQL 2008 but I wanted something that works with typed datasets (XSD, TableAdapters) and I know string params work with those.I was trying to get his function to work in a "where in (1,2,3)" type clause, and having no luck the straight-forward way.  So I created a temp table first, and then did an inner join instead of the "where in".  Here is my example usage, in my case I wanted to get a list of recipes that don\'t contain certain ingredients:
