I had SQL Server 2008 R2 and Visual Studio 2008 and 2010 on my laptop. I\'ve installed SQL Server 2012 and have finally got SQL Server Data Tools to show up, so that I can create SSRS reports in Visual Studio 2010.Although I\'ve installed Management tools - many times - on two separate instances of SQL Server 2012, I can\'t find them in Programs and can\'t run them. The only SSMS program I can find runs SSMS 2008 R2.I realise that common advice is to install SQL Server before Visual Studio, but I really don\'t want to uninstall Visual Studio, as this will bring a host of other problems. How can I fix this problem?You can get SSMS Express tools from here or full SQL Server Eval tools from here. MSDN/TechNet Downloads is currently the only place to get RTM versions (non-eval) of the SSMS 2012 toolset.Just download SQLEXPRWT_x64_ENU.exe from Microsoft Downloads - SQL Server\xc2\xae 2012 Express with SP1I just ran into this problem. I had to open back the installation for SQL Server and click Installation -> New SQL server installation or add features to existing installation. Then when we follow the instruction until we reach feature selection, just check the SQL Management tools checkbox and continue.I have no idea why this software is considered a feature and hidden like this. It should be a stand-alone software installation.I\'ve found that the command line is my friend in these situations.I installed the SQL Server 2012 Enterprise Management Tools, including Management Studio, off the DVD (mounted ISO actually), without installing anything else using this command:Run the command prompt with elevated privileges.  And be patient, as it has to unpack the installation files.  Don\'t try to install the MSI files directly, as you lose the dependency checking packaged with the main installer.Again, this is to install the full version off the Enterprise or Developer media, if you have it, and do not wish to settle for the free Express edition.I was very confused at a perceived lack of Management Studio on a newly provisioned SQL Server 2012 SP1 standard and enterprise edition on Azure running on Windows Server 2012.Normally it would be found from the Start Button Shortcuts or at least in C:\\Program Files somewhere.Eventually, I located C:\\SQLServer_11.0_Full, the image install path - executed and confirmed Management Studio was in fact installed by default even although it could not been seen via Add Remove Programs.In short, if you provision an SQL Server 2012 VM on Windows Server 2012 on Azure simply run PowerShell and then enter ssms.exe to access Management Studio.On the Official SQL Server 2012 ISO that\'s for download, just navigate to \\x64\\Setup\\ (or \\x86\\Setup) and you will find "sql_ssms.msi".  It\'s only about 60 MB, and since it\'s an .MSI you can probably provision it to be installed automatically (say for a large lab or classroom environment).After going back into the installer & checking off "Management Tools", ssms.exe was available under "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SQL Server\\110\\Tools\\Binn\\ManagementStudio" (thanks to everyone for pointing out where to find it).Late answer but could be of use to other readersAlthough SQL Server Management Studio installation is user friendly (more or less) people still seem to bump into different issues. There are lots of tutorials and instructions online, and I personally followed the ones found in this article: http://www.sqlshack.com/sql-server-management-studio-step-step-installation-guide/ It explains installing a standalone SSMS, but you can also install SSMS along with SQL Server \xe2\x80\x93 just make sure that you have selected Management Tools in the Feature selection screen.I also recommend reading a step-by-step tutorial on installing SSMS 2008 Express after Visual Studio 2010 which can be found here: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bethmassi/archive/2011/02/18/step-by-step-installing-sql-server-management-studio-2008-express-after-visual-studio-2010.aspx It can help if you\xe2\x80\x99ve just installed Visual Studio 2010 but also want to install SQL Server Management Studio.Direct MSDN link to Management Studio 2012 ONLY: SQL Server 2012 Express Management Studio with Service Pack 1 (x64) - (English)I found it here:\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29062This did not require any TechNet rigamarole or the use of their horrible Java 7 based download manager.I uninstalled all parts of SQL Server 2012 using Control Panel in Windows and then reinstalled (choosing "All Features"). Now it works!For separate modules (x86 and x64), if you want a customized installation without downloading loads of crap, see Servers\nMicrosoft\xc2\xae SQL Server\xc2\xae 2012 Express.I downloaded it from here (named \'Microsoft SQL Server Data Tools\'). In this version you will get a Visual Studio 2012 installation with the functionality to manage the SQL Server 2012 server.Install SQLEXPRADV_x64_ENU for x64 bit version from here and choose to install all components.
