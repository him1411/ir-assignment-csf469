The situation:Then I started working on quickfix2, but by accident took quickfix1 as the source branch to copy, not the master. Now quickfix2 is at X + 2 commits + 2 relevant commits.Now I want to have a branch with quickfix2, but without the 2 commits that belong to quickfix1.I tried to create a patch from a certain revision in quickfix2, but the patch doesn\'t preserve the commit history. Is there a way to save my commit history, but have a branch without changes in quickfix1?This is a classic case of rebase --onto:So you should go fromto:This is best done on a clean working tree.\nSee git config --global rebase.autostash true, especially after Git 2.10.You can use git cherry-pick to just pick the commit that you want to copy over.Probably the best way is to create the branch out of master, then in that branch use git cherry-pick on the 2 commits from quickfix2 that you want.The simplest thing you can do is cherry picking a range. It does the same as the rebase --onto but is easier for the eyes :)I believe it\'s:The only working way that I found:Then you need to commit the changes again, but it\'s much easier then doing it manually...
