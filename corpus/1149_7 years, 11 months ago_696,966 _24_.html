I see that this question has been answered for Java, JavaScript, and PHP, but not C#. So, how might one calculate the number of days between two dates in C#?Assuming StartDate and EndDate are of type DateTime:Use TimeSpan object which is the result of date substraction:I think this will do what you want:The top answer is correct, however if you would like only WHOLE days as an int and happy to forgo the time component of the date then consider:Again assuming StartDate and EndDate are of type DateTime:In case someone wants numer of whole days as a double (a, b of type DateTime):You can try this// Difference in days, hours, and minutes.// Difference in days.// Difference in Hours.// Difference in Minutes.You can also get difference in seconds,Milliseconds and also ticks.For a and b as two DateTime types:First declare a class that will return later:Use a button control to call the above class. Here is an example:You can use the code below:Get the difference between the two dates and then get the days from:Using timespan would solve the problems as it has many attributesFor beginners like me that will stumble upon this tiny problem, in simple line, with sample conversion to intThis calculates the total days from today (DateTime.UtcNow.Date) to a desired Date (myDateTime.Date).If myDateTime is yesterday, or older date than today, this will give a positive (+) integer result.On the other side, if the myDateTime is tomorrow or on the future date, this will give a negative (-) integer result due to rules of addition.Happy coding! ^_^
