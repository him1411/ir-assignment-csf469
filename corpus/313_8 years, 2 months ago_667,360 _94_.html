I have an array of JavaScript objects:How can I sort them by the value of last_nom in JavaScript?I know about sort(a,b), but that only seems to work on strings and numbers. Do I need to add a toString method to my objects?It\'s easy enough to write your own comparison function:Or inline (c/o Marco Demaio): You can also create a dynamic sort function that sorts objects by their value that you pass:So you can have an array of objects like this:...and it will work when you do:Actually this already answers the question. Below part is written because many people contacted me, complaining that it doesn\'t work with multiple parameters.You can use the function below to generate sort functions with multiple sort parameters.Which would enable you to do something like this:(Implementation which is just below is inspired from Mike R\'s answer)I wouldn\'t recommend changing a native object prototype but just to give an example so you can implement it on your own objects (For the environments that support it, you can also use Object.defineProperty as shown in the next section, which at least doesn\'t have the negative side-effect of being enumerable, as described at the last part)Prototype implementation would be something like the following (Here\'s a working example):If you\'re targeting IE v9.0 and up then, as I previously mentioned, use Object.defineProperty like this (working example):This can be an acceptable compromise until the bind operator arrives.All those prototype fun enables this:If you use the direct prototype access method (Object.defineProperty is fine) and other code does not check hasOwnProperty, kittens die! Ok, to be honest, no harm comes to any kitten really but probably things will break and every other developer in your team will hate you:See that last "SortBy"? Yeah. Not cool. Use Object.defineProperty where you can, and leave the Array.prototype alone otherwise.underscore.jsuse underscore, its small and awesome...sortBy_.sortBy(list, iterator, [context])  Returns a sorted copy of\n  list, ranked in ascending order by the results of running each value\n  through iterator. Iterator may also be the string name of the property\n  to sort by (eg. length).Don\'t get why people make it so complicated:For stricter engines:Swap the operator to have it sorted by reverse alphabetical order.In ES6/ES2015 or later you can do this way:If you have duplicate last names you might sort those by first name-Simple and quick solution to this problem using prototype inheritance:Example / UsageUpdate: No longer modifies original array.Instead of using a custom comparison function, you could also create an object type with custom toString() method (which is invoked by the default comparison function):Since you probably encounter more complex data structures like this array, I would expand the solution. Are more pluggable version based on @ege-\xc3\x96zcan\'s very lovely answer.I encountered the below and couldn\'t change it. I also did not want to flatten the object temporarily. Nor did I want to use underscore / lodash, mainly for performance reasons and the fun to implement it myself.The goal is to sort it primarily by People.Name.name and secondarily by People.Name.surnameNow, in the base solution uses bracket notation to compute the properties to sort for dynamically. Here, though, we would have to construct the bracket notation dynamically also, since you would expect some like People[\'Name.name\'] would work - which doesn\'t. Simply doing People[\'Name\'][\'name\'], on the other hand, is static and only allows you to go down the n-th level.The main addition here will be to walk down the object tree and determine the value of the last leaf, you have to specify, as well as any intermediary leaf.Working example on JSBinExample Usage:Script: I know this question is too old, but I didn\'t see any implementation similar to mine.\nThis version is based on the Schwartzian transform idiom. Here\'s an example how to use it:There are many good answers here, but I would like to point out that they can be extended very simply to achieve a lot more complex sorting. The only thing you have to do is to use the OR operator to chain comparision functions like this:Where fn1, fn2, ... are the sort functions which return [-1,0,1]. This results in "sorting by fn1", "sorting by fn2" which is pretty much equal to ORDER BY in SQL.This solution is based on the behaviour of || operator which evaluates to the first evaluated expression which can be converted to true.The simplest form has only one inlined function like this:Having two steps with  last_nom,first_nom sort order would look like this:A generic comparision function could be something like this:This function could be extended to support numeric fields, case sensitity, arbitary datatypes etc.You can them use it with chaining them by sort priority:The point here is that pure JavaScript with functional approach can take you a long way without external libraries or complex code. It is also very effective, since no string parsing have to be doneadditional desc params for Ege \xc3\x96zcan codeAcording your example, you need to sort by two fields (last name, first name), rather then one. You can use Alasql library to make this sort in one line:Try this example at jsFiddle.A simple way:See that \'.toLowerCase()\' is necessary to prevent erros \nin comparing strings.Combining Ege\'s dynamic solution with Vinay\'s idea, you get a nice robust solution:Usage:One more option:sorts ascending by default.You may need to convert them to the lower case in order to prevent from confusion.I Just enhanced Ege \xc3\x96zcan\'s dynamic sort to dive deep inside objects. \nIf Data looks like this: and if you want to sort it over a.a property I think my enhancement helps very well. I add new functionality to objects like this:and changed _dynamicSort\'s return function:And now you can sort by a.a. this way:See Commplete script in JSFiddleThis is a simple problem, don\'t know why people have such complex solution.\nA simple sort function (based on quick-sort algorithm):Use example:Using xPrototype: https://github.com/reduardo7/xPrototype/blob/master/README.md#sortbycol1-col2-colnI came into problem of sorting array of objects, with changing priority of values, basically I want to sort array of peoples by their Age, and then by surname - or just by surname, name. \nI think that this is most simple solution compared to another answers.it\' is used by calling sortPeoples([\'array\', \'of\', \'properties\'], reverse=false)So here is one sorting algorithm which can sort in any order , throughout array of any kind of objects , without the restriction of datatype comparison ( i.e. Number , String )the first argument items is the array of objects , prop is the key of the object on which you want to sort ,reverse is a boolean parameter which on being true results in Ascending  order and in false it returns descending order.Using Ramda,npm install ramdaLodash.js (superset of Underscore.js)It\'s good not to add a framework for every simple piece of logic, but relying on a well tested utility frameworks, speed up development and reduce the amount of bugs written is no shame.Lodash produces very clean code and promotes a more functional programming style, which results in less bugs. In one glimpse it becomes clear what the intent if the code is.OP\'s issue can simply be solved as:More info? E.g. we have following nested object:We now can use the _.property shorthand user.age to specify the path to the property that should be matched. We will sort the user objects by the nested age property. Yes, it allows for nested property matching!Want it reversed? No problem. Use _.reverse.Want to combine both using Chaining instead?Console log output:Adapted based on this source: http://www.levihackwith.com/code-snippet-how-to-sort-an-array-of-json-objects-by-property/This will sort a two level nested array by the property passed to it in alpha numeric order.Usage:I will give you a solution implementing QuickSort algorithm ,it is simple and effectiveGreat to see such great answers
