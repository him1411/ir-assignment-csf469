how can I change the text color of the ActionBar? I\'ve inherited the Holo Light Theme, I\'m able to change the background of the ActionBar but I don\'t find out what is the attribute to tweak to change the text color.Ok, I\'m able to change the text color with the attribute android:textColorPrimary but it also changes the text color of the dropdown menu displayed when an overflow happen on the ActionBar buttons. Any idea how to change the color of those dropdown menu / List ?Ok, I\'ve found a better way. I\'m now able to only change the color of the title. You can also tweak the subtitle.Here is my styles.xml:I was having the same problem as you, it\'s a Holo.Light theme but I wanted to style the ActionBar color, so I needed to change the text color as well and also both Title and Menus. So at the end I went to git hub and looked at source code until I find the damn correct style:so now all you have to do is set whatever @color/actionBarText and@drawable/actionbarbground you want!I found a way that works well with any flavor of ActionBar (Sherlock, Compat, and Native):Just use html to set the title, and specify the text color. For example, to set the ActionBar text color to red, simply do this:You can also use the red hex code #FF0000 instead of the word red. If you are having trouble with this, see Android Html.fromHtml(String) doesn't work for <font color='#'>text</font>.Additionally, if you want to use a color resource, this code can be used to get the correct HEX String, and removing the alpha if needed (the font tag does not support alpha):The ActionBar ID is not available directly, so you have to do little bit of hacking here.i have done with simple one line code Add it to the root of the action bar. I had this problem. actionMenuTextColor - changes text color for the action bar text, it never worked when it was part of the Widget.Styled.ActionBar, so I had to add it to the root. Other 2 attributes change title and subtitle of an action bar.Setting a HTML string on the action bar doesn\'t work on the Material theme in SDK v21+If you want to change it you should set the primary text color in your style.xmlIf you want to style the subtitle also then simply add this in your custom style.People who are looking to get the same result for AppCompat library then this is what I used:Its an old topic but for future readers, If you use ToolBar it makes everything very easy:This is the solution I used after checking all answers\nChange the required colors it will workFound the way to do it nicely without creating your own layout on API >= 21.It will only colorize texts and control drawables inside the action bar.Hope it will be useful for someone.This function works wellthen to use it just feed it your action bar and the new color ieTry a lot of methods, in the low version of the API,a feasible method is <item name="actionMenuTextColor">@color/your_color</item> and don\'t use the Android namespace,hope can help youps:Try adding this in your Activity\'s onCreate. Works on almost every Android version.orThe most straight-forward way is to do this in the styles.xml.Google\'s template styles.xml currently generates the following:If you add one more line before the closing  tag, as shown, that will change the text color to what it should be with a Dark ActionBar:If you want to customize the color to something else, you can either specify your own color in colors.xml or even use a built-in color from Android using the android:textColorPrimary attribute:Note: This changes the color of the title and also the titles of any MenuItems displayed in the ActionBar.A nice solution is to user a SpannableStringBuilder and set the color that way. You can even use different colors on different parts of the string, add images etc.Tested with the new support library.See Android: Coloring part of a string using TextView.setText()?This is not the recommended solution as I am going in android apis here but as my application requires to change the theme dynmically on conditions  xml not possible here, So I need to do this. But This solution is working very nice.For Android 5 (lollipop) you will have to use android:actionBarPopupTheme to set the textColor for the overflow menu.
