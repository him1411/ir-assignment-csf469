What is the module/method used to get current time?And just the time:The same but slightly more compact:See the documentation for more info.To save typing, you can import the datetime object from the datetime module:Then remove the leading datetime. from all the above.You can use time.strftime():    Similar to Harley\'s answer, but use the str() function for a quick-n-dirty, slightly more human readable format:For this example, the output will be like this: \'2013-09-18 11:16:32\'The format for strftime is at:\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.strftimeDoThere is some difference for Unix and Windows platforms.The time module provides functions that tells us the time in "seconds since the epoch" as well as other utilities.This is the format you should get timestamps in for saving in databases. It is a simple floating point number that can be converted to an integer. It is also good for arithmetic in seconds, as it represents the number of seconds since Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00, and it is memory light relative to the other representations of time we\'ll be looking at next:This timestamp does not account for leap-seconds, so it\'s not linear - leap seconds are ignored. So while it is not equivalent to the international UTC standard, it is close, and therefore quite good for most cases of record-keeping. This is not ideal for human scheduling, however. If you have a future event you wish to take place at a certain point in time, you\'ll want to store that time with a string that can be parsed into a datetime object or a serialized datetime object (these will be described later).You can also represent the current time in the way preferred by your operating system (which means it can change when you change your system preferences, so don\'t rely on this to be standard across all systems, as I\'ve seen others expect). This is typically user friendly, but doesn\'t typically result in strings one can sort chronologically:You can hydrate timestamps into human readable form with ctime as well:This conversion is also not good for record-keeping (except in text that will only be parsed by humans - and with improved Optical Character Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, I think the number of these cases will diminish).The datetime module is also quite useful here:The datetime.now is a class method that returns the current time. It uses the time.localtime without the timezone info (if not given, otherwise see timezone aware below). It has a representation (which would allow you to recreate an equivalent object) echoed on the shell, but when printed (or coerced to a str), it is in human readable (and nearly ISO) format, and the lexicographic sort is equivalent to the chronological sort:You can get a datetime object in UTC time, a global standard, by doing this:UTC is a time standard that is nearly equivalent to the GMT timezone. (While GMT and UTC do not change for Daylight Savings Time, their users may switch to other timezones, like British Summer Time, during the Summer.) However, none of the datetime objects we\'ve created so far can be easily converted to various timezones. We can solve that problem with the pytz module:Equivalently, in Python 3 we have the timezone class with a utc timezone instance attached, which also makes the object timezone aware (but to convert to another timezone without the handy pytz module is left as an exercise to the reader):And we see we can easily convert to timezones from the original utc object.You can also make a naive datetime object aware with the pytz timezone localize method, or by replacing the tzinfo attribute (with replace, this is done blindly), but these are more last resorts than best practices:The pytz module allows us to make our datetime objects timezone aware and convert the times to the hundreds of timezones available in the pytz module.One could ostensibly serialize this object for UTC time and store that in a database, but it would require far more memory and be more prone to error than simply storing the Unix Epoch time, which I demonstrated first. The other ways of viewing times are much more error prone, especially when dealing with data that may come from different time zones. You want there to be no confusion as to which timezone a string or serialized datetime object was intended for.If you\'re displaying the time with Python for the user, ctime works nicely, not in a table (it doesn\'t typically sort well), but perhaps in a clock. However, I personally recommend, when dealing with time in Python, either using Unix time, or a timezone aware UTC datetime object. That outputs the current GMT in the specified format. There is also a localtime() method. This page has more details.why not just keep things simple. All good suggestions, but I find it easiest to use ctime() myself:This gives a nicely formatted string representation of current local time.If you need current time as a time object:Quickest way isI\'ll contribute to this because .isoformat() is in the documentation but not yet here\n(this is mighty similar to @Ray Vega\'s answer):Why not ask the U.S. Naval Observatory, the official timekeeper of the United States Navy?If you live in the D.C. area (like me) the latency might not be too bad...This is what I ended up going with: Also, this table is a necessary reference for choosing the appropriate format codes to get the date formatted just the way you want it (from Python "datetime" documentation here).datetime.now() returns the current time as a naive datetime object that represents time in the local timezone. That value may be ambiguous e.g., during DST transitions ("fall back"). To avoid ambiguity either UTC timezone should be used:Or a timezone-aware object that has the corresponding timezone info attached (Python 3.2+):You can use the time module.The use of the captial Y gives the full year, using y would give 06/02/15You could also use to give a more lengthy time.Try the arrow module from http://crsmithdev.com/arrow/or the utc versionto change it\'s output add .format()for a specific timezone?an hour agoor if you want the gist.do dir(date) or any variables including the package, you can get all the attributes and methods associated to the variable.This is what i use to get the time without having to format , some people dont like the split method but it is useful here :Will print in HH:MM:SS formatI am a simple man and i want time with milliseconds. Simple way to get them:But i want only miliseconds, right? Shortest way to get them:Add or remove zeroes from the last multiplication to adjust number of decimal points, or just:date will print date and time will print time.using pandas to get current time, kind of over killing the problem at hand.output:
