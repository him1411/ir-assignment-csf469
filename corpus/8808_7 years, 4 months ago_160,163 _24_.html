I\'m curious, whether there is any way to print formatted numpy.arrays, e.g., in the way similar to this:If I want to print the numpy.array of floats, it prints several decimals, often in \'scientific\' format, which is rather hard to read even for low-dimensional arrays. However, numpy.array apparently has to be printed as a string, i.e., with %s. Is there any solution for this purpose? You can use set_printoptions to set the precision of the output:And suppress suppresses the use of scientific notation for small numbers:See the docs for set_printoptions for other options.To apply print options locally, you could use a contextmanager:For example, inside the with-suite precision=3 and suppress=True are set:But outside the with-suite the print options are back to default settings:To prevent zeros from being stripped from the end of floats:np.set_printoptions now has a formatter parameter which allows you to specify a format function for each type.which printsinstead of Unutbu gave a really complete answer (they got a +1 from me too), but here is a lo-tech alternative:As a function (using the format() syntax for formatting):Usage:The index of the array is accessible in the format string:You can get a subset of the np.set_printoptions functionality from the np.array_str command, which applies only to a single print statement.http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.array_str.htmlFor example:And here is what I use, and it\'s pretty uncomplicated:The gem that makes it all too easy to obtain the result as a string (in today\'s numpy versions) is hidden in denis answer:\nnp.array2stringYears later, another one is below. But for everyday use I justI often want different columns to have different formats.  Here is how I print a simple 2D array using some variety in the formatting by converting (slices of) my NumPy array to a tuple:numpy.char.mod may also be useful, depending on the details of your application e.g.:numpy.char.mod(\'Value=%4.2f\', numpy.arange(5, 10, 0.1)) will return a string array with elements "Value=5.00", "Value=5.10" etc. (as a somewhat contrived example).
