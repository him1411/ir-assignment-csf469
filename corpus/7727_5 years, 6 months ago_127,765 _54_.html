I\'m trying to rotate a UIImageView 360 degrees, and have looked at several tutorials online. I could get none of them working, without the UIView either stopping, or jumping to a new position.The latest thing I\'ve tried is:But if I use 2*pi, it doesn\'t move at all (since it\'s the same position). If I try to do just pi (180 degrees), it works, but if I call the method again, it rotates backwards.EDIT:doesn\'t work either. It goes to 180 degrees, pauses for a split second, then resets back to 0 degrees before it starts again.Found a method (I modified it a bit) that worked perfectly for me: iphone UIImageView rotationKudos to Richard J. Ross III for the idea, but I found that his code wasn\'t quite what I needed.  The default for options, I believe, is to give you UIViewAnimationOptionCurveEaseInOut, which doesn\'t look right in a continuous animation.  Also, I added a check so that I could stop my animation at an even quarter turn if I needed (not infinite, but of indefinite duration), and made the acceleration ramp up during the first 90 degrees, and decelerate during the last 90 degrees (after a stop has been requested):I added the ability to handle requests to start spinning again (startSpin), while the previous spin is winding down (completing). Sample project here on Github.Nate\'s answer above is ideal for stop and start animation and gives a better control. I was intrigued why yours didn\'t work and his does. I wanted to share my findings here and a simpler version of the code that would animate a UIView continuously without stalling.This is the code I used,I used \'CGAffineTransformRotate\' instead of \'CGAffineTransformMakeRotation\' because the former returns the result which is saved as the animation proceeds. This will prevent the jumping or resetting of the view during the animation.Another thing is not to use \'UIViewAnimationOptionRepeat\' because at the end of the animation before it starts repeating, it resets the transform making the view jump back to its original position. Instead of a repeat, you recurse so that the transform is never reset to the original value because the animation block virtually never ends.And the last thing is, you have to transform the view in steps of 90 degrees (M_PI / 2) instead of 360 or 180 degrees (2*M_PI or M_PI). Because transformation occurs as a matrix multiplication of sine and cosine values. So, say if you use 180-degree transformation, the cosine of 180 yields -1 making the view transform in opposite direction each time (Note-Nate\'s answer will also have this issue if you change the radian value of transformation to M_PI). A 360-degree transformation is simply asking the view to remain where it was, hence you don\'t see any rotation at all.  In Swift, you can use the following code for infinite rotation:Stopping is like:If all you want to do is rotate the image endlessly, this works quite well, and is very simple:In my experience, this works flawlessly, but be sure your image is capable of being rotated around its center without any offsets, or the image animation will "jump" once it makes it around to PI.To change the direction of the spin, change the sign of angle (angle *= -1).Update Comments by @AlexPretzlav made me revisit this, and I realized that when I wrote this the image I was rotating was mirrored along both the vertical and horizontal axis, meaning the image was indeed only rotating 90 degrees and then resetting, though it looked like it was continuing to rotate all the way around.So, if your image is like mine was, this will work great, however, if the image is not symmetrical, you\'ll notice the "snap" back to the original orientation after 90 degrees.To rotate a non-symmetrical image, you\'re better off with the accepted answer.One of these less elegant solutions, seen below, will truly rotate the image, but there may be a noticeable stutter when the animation is restarted:You could also do this just with blocks, as @richard-j-ross-iii suggests, but you will get a retain loop warning since the block is capturing itself:My contribution with a Swift Extension from the checked solution :Use quarter turn, and increase the turn incrementally.I have found nice code in this repository,Here is the code from it i have done small changes according to my need for speed :)UIImageView+Rotate.hUIImageView+Rotate.mThis was working for me:Here is my swift solution as a UIView extension. It could be considered as a simulation of a UIActivityIndicator behaviour on any UIImageView.A Swift3 version:And remember to call startRotate in viewWillAppear not in viewDidLoad.You can also do the same type of animation using UIView and blocks. Here is a class extension method which can rotate the view by any angle.If anyone wanted nates\' solution but in swift, then here is a rough swift translation:This is how I rotate 360 in right direction.@ram\'s answer was really helpful. Here\'s a Swift version of the answer.Create the animationAdd it to a view like thisHow is this answer different? You will have way cleaner code if most of your functions returns objects instead of just manipulating some objects here and there. for xamarin ios:I has developed a shiny animation framework which can save you tone of time!\nUsing it this animation can be created very easily:to stop this animation simply set nil to endlessRotater.If you are interested, please take a look: https://github.com/hip4yes/AnimaticsSwift : Swift 3 :There are following different ways to perform 360 degree animation with UIView.Using CABasicAnimation\nHere is an extension functions for UIView that handles start & stop rotation operations:\nNow using, UIView.animation closure:Swift 4,RefI think you should better add a UIVIew Category:
