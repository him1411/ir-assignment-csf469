Consider the following code:I would like the two divs to be next to each other inside the wrapper div. In this case, the height of the green div should determine the height of the wrapper.How could I achieve this via CSS ?Float one or both inner divs.Floating one div:or if you float both, you\'ll need to encourage the wrapper div to contain both the floated children, or it will think it\'s empty and not put the border around themFloating both divs:Having two divs,you could also use the display property:jsFiddle example here.If div1 exceeds a certain height, div2 will be placed next to div1 at the bottom. To solve this, use vertical-align:top; on div2.jsFiddle example here.You can sit elements next to each other by using the CSS float property:You\'d need to make sure that the wrapper div allows for the floating in terms of width, and margins etc are set correctly.here is the solution:your demo updated;http://jsfiddle.net/dqC8t/1/Option 1Use float:left on both div elements and set a % width for both div elements with a combined total width of 100%.Use box-sizing: border-box; on the floating div elements. The value border-box forces the padding and borders into the width and height instead of expanding it.Use clearfix on the <div id="wrapper"> to clear the floating child elements which will make the wrapper div scale to the correct height.http://jsfiddle.net/dqC8t/3381/Option 2Use position:absolute on one element and a fixed width on the other element.Add position:relative to <div id="wrapper"> element to make child elements absolutely position to the <div id="wrapper"> element.http://jsfiddle.net/dqC8t/3382/Option 3Use display:inline-block on both div elements and set a % width for both div elements with a combined total width of 100%.And again (same as float:left example) use box-sizing: border-box; on the div elements. The value border-box forces the padding and borders into the width and height instead of expanding it.NOTE: inline-block elements can have spacing issues as it is affected by spaces in HTML markup.
