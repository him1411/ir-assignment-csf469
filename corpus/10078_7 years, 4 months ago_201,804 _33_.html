I\'m requesting data from a server which returns data in the JSON format. Casting a HashMap into JSON when making the request wasn\'t hard at all but the other way seems to be a little tricky. The JSON response looks like this:What way would be easiest to access this data? I\'m using the GSON module.Here you go This code works:I know this is a fairly old question, but I was searching for a solution to generically deserialize nested JSON to a Map<String, Object>, and found nothing.The way my yaml deserializer works, it defaults JSON objects to Map<String, Object> when you don\'t specify a type, but gson doesn\'t seem to do this.  Luckily you can accomplish it with a custom deserializer.I used the following deserializer to naturally deserialize anything, defaulting JsonObjects to Map<String, Object> and JsonArrays to Object[]s, where all the children are similarly deserialized.The messiness inside the handlePrimitive method is for making sure you only ever get a Double or an Integer or a Long, and probably could be better, or at least simplified if you\'re okay with getting BigDecimals, which I believe is the default.You can register this adapter like:And then call it like:I\'m not sure why this is not the default behavior in gson, since it is in most other semi-structured serialization libraries...Update for new Gson lib:\nYou now can parse nested Json to Map directly, but you should be aware in case you try to parse Json to Map<String, Object> type: it will raise exception. To fix this, just declare the result as LinkedTreeMap type.  Example below:With google\'s Gson 2.7 (probably earlier versions too, but I tested with the current version 2.7) it\'s as simple as:Which returns a Map of type com.google.gson.internal.LinkedTreeMap and works recursively on nested objects, arrays, etc.I ran the OP example like so (simply replaced double- with single-quotes and removed whitespace):And got the following output:I had the exact same question and ended up here.  I had a different approach that seems much simpler (maybe newer versions of gson?).with the following json The followingoutputsYou could dynamically check using instanceof when navigating your jsonObject.  Something likeIt works for me, so it must work for you ;-)Try this, it will worked. I used it for Hashtable.Replace KioskStatusResource to your class and Integer to your key class.Here is what I have been using:I have overcome a similar problem with a Custom JsonDeSerializer. I tried to make it a bit generic but still not enough. It is a solution though that fits my needs. First of all you need to implement a new JsonDeserializer for Map objects.And the deserialize method will look similar to this:The con with this solution, is that my Map\'s key is always of Type "String". However by chaning some things someone can make it generic. In addition, i need to say, that the value\'s class should be passed in the constructor. So the method getMyType() in my code returns the type of the Map\'s values, which was passed in the constructor.You can reference this post How do I write a custom JSON deserializer for Gson? in order to learn more about custom deserializers.I used this code:JSONObject typically uses HashMap internally to store the data. So, you can use it as Map in your code. Example,
