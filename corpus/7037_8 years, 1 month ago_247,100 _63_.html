I would like to create a div, that is situated beneath a block of content but that once the page has been scrolled enough to contact its top boundary, becomes fixed in place and scrolls with the page. I know I\'ve seen at least one example of this online but I cannot remember it for the life of me.Any thoughts?You could use simply css, positioning your element as fixed:Edit: You should have the element with position absolute, once the scroll offset has reached the element, it should be changed to fixed, and the top position should be set to zero.You can detect the top scroll offset of the document with the scrollTop function:When the scroll offset reached 200, the element will stick to the top of the browser window, because is placed as fixed.You\'ve seen this example on Google Code\'s issue page and (only recently) on Stack Overflow\'s edit page.CMS\'s answer doesn\'t revert the positioning when you scroll back up.

You can add 3 extra rows so when the user scroll back to the top, the div will stick on its old place:Here is the code:I have links setup in a div so it is a vertical list of letter and number links.I then setup this handy jQuery function to save the loaded position and then change the position to fixed when scrolling beyond that position.NOTE: this only works if the links are visible on page load!!I used some of the work above to create this tech. I improved it a bit and thought I would share my work. Hope this helps.jsfuddle CodeThis is a little bit more dynamic of a way to do the scroll.
