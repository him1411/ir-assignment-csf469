Possible Duplicate:\n  What does \xe2\x80\x9c>\xe2\x80\x9d mean in CSS rules? I\'ve seen the "greater than" (>) used in CSS code a few times, but I can\'t work out what it does. What does it do?For example, if you have nested divs like such:and you declare a css rule in your stylesheet like such:your rules will apply only to those divs that have a class of "middle" since those divs are direct descendants (immediate children) of elements with class "outer" (unless, of course, you declare other, more specific rules overriding these rules). See fiddle.If you, instead, had a space  between selectors instead of >, your rules would apply to both of the nested divs. The space is much more commonly used and defines a "descendant selector", which means it looks for any matching element down the tree rather than just immediate children as the > does.NOTE: The > selector is not supported by IE6. It does work in all other current browsers though, including IE7 and IE8.If you\'re looking into less-well-used CSS selectors, you may also want to look at +, ~, and [attr] selectors, all of which can be very useful.This page has a full list of all available selectors, along with details of their support in various browsers (its mainly IE that has problems), and good examples of their usage.A space  selector will select all deep descendants whereas a greater than > selector will only select all immediate descendants. See fiddle for example.It is the CSS child selector. Example:div > p selects all paragraphs that are direct children of div.See thisAs others have said, it\'s a direct child, but it\'s worth noting that this is different to just leaving a space... a space is for any descendant.div>span would match this, but it would not match this:To match that, you could do div>p>span or div span.It declares parent reference, look at this page for definition:http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html#child-selectorsIt is a Child Selector.It matches when an element is the child of some element. It is made up of two or more selectors separated by ">".Example(s):The following rule sets the style of all P elements that are children of BODY:Example(s):The following example combines descendant selectors and child selectors:It matches a P element that is a descendant of an LI; the LI element must be the child of an OL element; the OL element must be a descendant of a DIV. Notice that the optional white space around the ">" combinator has been left out. It means parent/childexample:html>bodythat\'s saying that body is a child of htmlCheck out: Selectors
