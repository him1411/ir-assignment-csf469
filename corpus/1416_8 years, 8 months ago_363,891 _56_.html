I am looking for a command that will accept as input multiple lines of text, each line containing a single integer, and output the sum of these integers.As a bit of background, I have a log file which includes timing measurements, so through grepping for the relevant lines, and a bit of sed reformatting I can list all of the timings in that file.  I\'d like to work out the total however, and my mind has gone blank as to any command I can pipe this intermediate output to in order to do the final sum.  I\'ve always used expr in the past, but unless it runs in RPN mode I don\'t think it\'s going to cope with this (and even then it would be tricky).What am I missing?  Given that there are probably several ways to achieve this, I will be happy to read (and upvote) any approach that works, even if someone else has already posted a different solution that does the job.Related question: Shortest command to calculate the sum of a column of output on Unix?  (credits @Andrew)Update: Wow, as expected there are some nice answers here.  Looks like I will definitely have to give awk deeper inspection as a command-line tool in general!Bit of awk should do it? Note: some versions of awk have some odd behaviours if you are going to be adding anything exceeding 2^31 (2147483647). See comments for more background. One suggestion is to use printf rather than print:Paste typically merges lines of multiple files, but it can also be used to convert individual lines of a file into a single line.  The delimiter flag allows you to pass a x+x type equation to bc.Alternatively, when piping from stdin,The one-liner version in Python:Plain bash:Note that negative numbers prefixed with minus sign should be translated for dc, since  it uses _ prefix rather than - prefix for that. For example, via tr \'-\' \'_\' | dc -f- -e \'...\'.The expression [+z1<r]srz1<rp does the following:As pseudo-code:To really understand the simplicity and power of dc, here is a working Python script that implements some of the commands from dc and executes a Python version of the above command:I would put a big WARNING on the commonly approved solution:that is because in this form awk uses a 32 bit signed integer representation: it will overflow for sums that exceed 2147483647 (i.e., 2^31).A more general answer (for summing integers) would be:P.S. I would have liked to comment the first answer, but I don\'t have enough reputation..Pure and short bash.With jq:My fifteen cents: Example:BASH solution, if you want to make this a command (e.g. if you need to do this frequently): Then usage: Plain bash one linerYou can using num-utils, although it may be overkill for what you need. This is a set of programs for manipulating numbers in the shell, and can do several nifty things, including of course, adding them up. It\'s a bit out of date, but they still work and can be useful if you need to do something more.http://suso.suso.org/programs/num-utils/The following works in bash:I realize this is an old question, but I like this solution enough to share it.If there is interest, I\'ll explain how it works.Pure bash and in a one-liner :-)Alternative pure Perl, fairly readable, no packages or options required:I think AWK is what you are looking for:\n\nawk \'{sum+=$1}END{print sum}\'\nYou can use this command either by passing the numbers list through the standard input or by passing the file containing the numbers as a parameter.For Ruby LoversYou can do it in python, if you feel comfortable:Not tested, just typed:Sebastian pointed out a one liner script:The following should work (assuming your number is the second field on each line).One-liner in Racket:C (not simplified)My version:Or use awk rather than sed : arithmetic sampleAWK has already been mentioned, so in addition I\'d like to suggest that you use this language instead of GREP and SED for scanning the original log file. A suitable AWK script can easily do the job of both and calculate the interesting value as Paul and Alf have already pointed out.Or, you can type in the numbers on the command line:However, this one slurps the file so it is not a good idea to use on large files. See j_random_hacker\'s answer which avoids slurping.Apologies in advance for readability of the backticks ("`"), but these work in shells other than bash and are thus more pasteable.  If you use a shell which accepts it, the $(command ...) format is much more readable (and thus debuggable) than `command ...` so feel free to modify for your sanity.I have a simple function in my bashrc that will use awk to calculate a number of simple math itemsThis will do +,-,*,/,^,%,sqrt,sin,cos, parenthesis ....(and more depending on your version of awk) ... you could even get fancy with printf and format floating point output, but this is all I normally needfor this particular question, I would simply do this for each line:so the code block to sum each line would look something like this:That\'s if you wanted to only sum them line by line.  However for a total of every number in the datafilebtw if I need to do something quick on the desktop, I use this:A lua interpreter is present on all fedora-based systems [fedora,RHEL,CentOS,korora etc. because it is embedded with rpm-package(the package of package manager rpm), i.e rpm-lua] and if u want to learn lua this kind of problems are ideal(you\'ll get your job done as well).and it works. Lua is verbose though, you might have to endure some repeated keyboard stroke injury :)
