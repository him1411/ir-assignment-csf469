I have a string, and I need to get its first character.How can I fix my code?What you want is charAt.In JavaScript you can do this:x.substring(0,1)The charAt() method allows you to specify the position of the character you want.What you were trying to do is get the character at the position of an array "x", which is not defined as X is not an array.You can use any of these.There is a little difference between all of these\nSo be careful while using it in conditional statement.You can even use slice to cut-off all other characters:Tested in IE6+, FF, Chrome, safari.Try this as well:Example of all methodFirst : string.charAt(index)Return the caract at the index indexSecond : string.substring(start,length);Return the substring in the string who start at the index start and stop after the length lengthHere you only want the first caract so : start = 0 and length = 1Alternative : string[index]A string is an array of caract. So you can get the first caract like the first cell of an array.Return the caract at the index index of the stringx.substring(0,1) substring(start, end)  extracts the characters from a string, between the 2 indices "start" and "end", not including "end" itself.
