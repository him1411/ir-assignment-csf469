How to add days to current Date using JavaScript. Does JavaScript have a built in function like .Net\'s AddDay?You can create one with:-This does take care of automatically incrementing the month if necessary. For example:8/31 + 1 day will become 9/1.The problem with using setDate directly is that it\'s a mutator and that sort of thing is best avoided. ECMA saw fit to treat Date as a mutable class rather than an immutable structure.Correct Answer:Incorrect Answer:This answer sometimes provides the correct result but very often returns the wrong year and month. The only time this answer works is when the date that you are adding days to happens to have the current year and month.Proof / ExampleCheck this JsFiddleBe careful, because this can be tricky.  When setting "tomorrow", it only works because it\'s current value matches the year and month for "today".  However, setting to a date number like "32" normally will still work just fine to move it to the next month.My solution is:this solution does not have problem with daylight saving. Also, one can add/sub any offsets for years, months, days etc.is correct code.These answers seem confusing to me, I prefer:getTime() gives us milliseconds since 1970, and 86400000 is the number of milliseconds in a day. \nHence, ms contains milliseconds for the desired date. Using the millisecond constructor gives the desired date object.Try Using setDate() to add a date wont solve your problem, try adding some days to a Feb month, if you try to add new days to it, it wont result in what you expected.Just spent ages trying to work out what the deal was with the year not adding when following the lead examples below.If you want to just simply add n days to the date you have you are best to just go:myDate.setDate(myDate.getDate() + n);or the longwinded versionThis today/tomorrow stuff is confusing. By setting the current date into your new date variable you will mess up the year value. if you work from the original date you won\'t.If you can, use moment.js. JavaScript doesn\'t have very good native date/time methods. The following is an example Moment\'s syntax:Reference: http://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/add/I created these extensions last night:\nyou can pass either positive or negative values;example:CodePenThe simplest solution.Thanks Jason for your answer that works as expected, here is a mix from your code and the handy format of AnthonyWJones :Late to the party, but if you use jQuery then there\'s an excellent plugin called Moment:http://momentjs.com/http://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/And lots of other good stuff in there!Edit: jQuery reference removed thanks to aikeru\'s commentOld I know, but sometimes I like this:The mozilla docs for setDate() don\'t indicate that it will  handle end of month scenarios.\nSee https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DatesetDate()That is why I use setTime() when I need to add days.I use something like:Works with day saving time:Works with new year:It can be parametrized:I guess I\'ll give an answer as well:\nPersonally, I like to attempt to avoid gratuitous variable declaration, method calls, and constructor calls, as they are all expensive on performance. (within reason, of course)\nI was going to leave this as just comment under the Answer given by @AnthonyWJones but thought better of it.The above will respect DST. Meaning if you add a number of days that cross DST, the displayed time (hour) will change to reflect that.\nExample:\nNov 2, 2014 02:00 was the end of DST.If you\'re looking to retain the time across DST (so 10:30 will still be 10:30)...So, now you have...I am using the following solution.Date has a constructor that accepts an int. This argument represents total milliseconds before/after Jan 1, 1970. It also has a method setTime which does the same without creating a new Date object.What we do here is convert days to milliseconds and add this value to the value provided by getTime. Finally, we give the result to Date(milliseconds) constructor or setTime(milliseconds) method.Edit:\nInstead of setTime() (or setHours()) you could do it this way:Old:Instead of using setTime() you can use setHours():See the JSFiddle...I had issues with daylight savings time with the proposed solution.By using getUTCDate / setUTCDate instead, I solved my issue.Very simple code to add days in date in java script.No, javascript has no a built in function, but\nyou can use a simple line of codeYou can create your custom helper function hereBy the way, this is generic solution for adding seconds or minutes or days whatever you want.For those using Angular:Just do:A lot of these answers either require a large library, don\'t handle daylight saving time, or require overly complex syntax. I wrote a lightweight component which solves all of these problems and also works for any time unit instead of just days. Hopefully this will help a few people still looking at these answers. You can simply use the dateAdd() function and pass in a date object, a value to increment (+/-), and the unit to increment. You\'ll get back an updated Date object.For example, to add 5 days:You can also use this with seconds, minutes, months, years, etc.This solution doesn\'t do anything special for daylight saving time when adding small time units (up to hours) but takes it into account when adding larger units. This means that adding 5 hours to a time which will cross DST will really seem like adding 6/4 hours depending on spring/fall. For the larger time units however, the hours will stay the same and only the day/month/year will update. This means that when crossing a DST boundary, adding 24 hours will behave differently from adding 1 day. This allows you to specify whichever behavior you prefer since there are times when both outcomes make sense (incrementing the day vs adding a full 24 hours).DST examples (EST):Feel free to import the component to use it!I\'ve used this approach to get the right date in one line to get the time plus one day following what people were saying above.I just figured I would build off a normal (new Date()):Using the code above I can now set all of that within Date() in (new Date()) and it behaves normally.or to get the Date object:I can\'t believe there\'s no cut\'n\'paste solution in this thread after 5 years!\nSO: To get the same time-of-day regardless of summertime interference:  There. Done!2.39KB minified. One file. https://github.com/rhroyston/clock-jsOur team considers date-fns the best library in this space.  It treats dates as immutable (Moment.js will probably never adopt immutability), it\'s faster, and can be loaded modularly.
