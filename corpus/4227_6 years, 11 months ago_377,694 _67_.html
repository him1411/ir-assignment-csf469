What are the steps to create a keystore for android (in an eclipse environment)?\nI need to use google maps in my app and I don\'t know what steps I missed.\nPlease provide me with the specific detailed steps (I didn\'t understand it from the guides).To answer the question in the title, you create a keystore with the Java Keytool utility that comes with any standard JDK distribution and can be located at %JAVA_HOME%\\bin. On Windows this would usually be C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre7\\bin.So on Windows, open a command window and switch to that directory and enter a command like thisKeytool prompts you to provide passwords for the keystore, provide the Distinguished Name fields and then the password for your key. It then generates the keystore as a file called my-release-key.keystore in the directory you\'re in. The keystore and key are protected by the passwords you entered. The keystore contains a single key, valid for 10000 days. The alias is a name that you \xe2\x80\x94 will use later, to refer to this keystore when signing your application.For more information about Keytool, see the documentation at: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/windows/keytool.html and for more information on signing Android apps go here: http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.htmlTo sign your app in release mode in Android Studio, follow these steps:1- On the menu bar, click Build > Generate Signed APK.2-On the Generate Signed APK Wizard window, click Create new to create a new keystore.\n  If you already have a keystore, go to step 4.3- On the New Key Store window, provide the required information as shown in figure \n  Your key should be valid for at least 25 years, so you can sign app updates with the same key through the lifespan of your app.4- On the Generate Signed APK Wizard window, select a keystore, a private key, and enter the passwords for both. Then click Next.5- On the next window, select a destination for the signed APK and click Finish.\n  http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.htmlI was crazy looking how to generate a .keystore using the shell in a single line command, so i could run it from another application. This is the way:It worked really well for me, it doesnt ask for anything else in the console, just creates the file.

It is simple but the instructions on developer.android.com are a little too brief.The part I was unsure about was where to save and what name to give the keystore file.I seems it doesn\'t matter where you put it just be sure to keep it safe and keep a number of backups.\nI just put it in my app directoryName the file "something.keystore" where something can be whatever you want. I used app_name.keystore, where app_name was the name of my app.The next part was what to name the alias. Again it doesn\'t seem to matter so again I just used the app_name again. Keep the passwords the same as you used before. Fill out the rest of the fields and you are done.I followed this guide to create the debug keystore.The command is:Use this command to create debug.keystoreFirst thing to know is wether you are in Debug or Release mode. From the developer site "There are two build modes: debug mode and release mode. You use debug mode when you are developing and testing your application. You use release mode when you want to build a release version of your application that you can distribute directly to users or publish on an application marketplace such as Google Play."If you are in debug mode you do the following   ...\n  A. Open terminal and type:  Note: For Eclipse, the debug keystore is typically located at ~/.android/debug.keystore...B. when prompted for a password simply enter "android" ...C. If you are in Release mode follow the instructions on...http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html <-- this link pretty much explains everything you need to know.
