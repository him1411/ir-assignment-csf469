What\'s the best way to edit GitHub\'s Readme.md?I find myself editing the Readme, then I push it, I see mistakes or formatting errors, editing it again, then pushing it...It really does a number on the commit history.Is there a better way? Or should I not care about the commit history, and just go bananas on Readme.Maybe I shouldn\'t even use Readme at all, but instead use GH pages?How can I test what my readme.md file will look like before committing to github? - Just found similar question, but more verbose questions above.I just edit the readme on github as a raw file. You can view a preview before you commit the changes.http://prose.io is a great tool! It\'s hosted on github pages and is a database-less app that works totally through the github API. Has some neat features for editor experience if you happen to have a GitHub Jekyll website as well.And hey, it\'s open source! http://github.com/prose/proseI\'m using Atom, it\'s a text editor by GithubYou can have a side by side instant preview. You don\'t have to switch app or execute any additional command.Preview shortcut is Ctrl+Shift+m, \nOr you can check below image.I suggest stackedit which is an online editor. You don\'t need to install anything.Also, it supports drag & drop of the file into the editor itself.Also, it supports an online change view, what makes it more powerful!Also, you can then save, publish, share, or download the file.Once you know how to format it, you can minimize the commits unless you are not making spelling mistakes :)You can use any of the following markups:I use http://dillinger.io/. Copy and paste the content of the README.md file, edit it and bring it back. The best markdown editor I have run across.With respect to readme vs GH pages, keep in mind that the readme file should be just that: a readme file that acts as a useful starting point for information (installation instructions, a link to the project page, etc.) included in a downloaded archive copy of your project. Suppose I download your project as an end-user. I extract the archive. What do I need to know right now? That is what has to be in the readme file.If you\'re using the readme file as the go-to place for information about your project because of how prominently GitHub displays it on the project page, you definitely should think about using GH Pages.A little late to the game, but I wrote a small CLI in Python to do exactly this. It\'s called Grip (Github Readme Instant Preview).The preview on GitHub is nice for making small edits, but I personally find myself investing a lot of time editing the README. As @Zorayr points out, you need to be careful with GitHub\'s preview, and worse, you can\'t temporarily save new prose now to edit / rewrite later without actually committing your rough draft. That\'s more noise in your git history than necessary.With Grip, all your changes are local until you\'re ready. And you can use whichever editor you\'re most comfortable with.Install it with:And to use it, simply:Then visit localhost:5000 to view the readme.md file at that location.You can also specify your own file:And change the port:Or combine the previous two:You can even render GitHub-Flavored Markdown (i.e. how comments and issues are rendered), optionally with repo context to auto-hyperlink references to other issues:Other notable features:Hope this helps. Check it out.(Note: This is a re-post of this answer with a few edits for context.)There is a Sublime Plugin that allows you to preview your markdown, Github or regular markdown, in your browser. Pretty easy to use, and it has key board shortcuts. I am using it in Sublime Text 3.For mac there is a good free tool http://mouapp.com/. You have live preview of your code in the separate window.Just go to your Github repo through Github website and click on your README.md file.You\'ll have some buttons on the right of the screen "Raw, Blame, History ..." and an "edit" button with pencil icon.Click on it, now you have an editor that let you write some markdown and update/preview your README file.A guy on github released this just 3 months ago. Maybe he read this post.\nhttps://github.com/gedex/preview-github-readme.mdIt is a php file and you just point to the url and add your file as a param ieAnd it will run it against their api.There is another good git repo that does something similar, but just uses html and javascript.\nhttps://github.com/dzello/preview_markdown_locally\nI believe the first should be more accurate. I also like to just use the editor on their site. +1 to Matt EschI use this online editor stackedit.io. it is perfectI found Dillinger.io helpful to edit README.md files using an online editor.Use this cheat sheet to help you around https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-CheatsheetTwo ways:Go to your repo and click readme.md and select edit option. So you can edit it online using the cheat sheet.Go to your local repo where you cloned and edit using the cheat sheet.But i recommend to go with online edit where you can see live preview :)Have you tried using Stack Edit? It converts html (or text) into markdown. You can access it on their website or using the Chrome app. You can create titles and lists in the editor here, and it will show you the corresponding text in markdown format. You can then save, publish, share, or download the file.If you use Chrome browse, you can use the extension I build MarkView to view your local Markdown file.I use Brackets. After that I install Markdown Preview extension that allows me to check the final version of my .md in real time. Very useful.I wrote a single, small HTML file to preview GitHub readmes. It uses the GitHub API to render the Markdown into HTML, and GitHub Primer CSS to style the HTML.The HTML file uses an Ajax request to get your README.md. Use whatever you like (your favorite text editor) to edit your README.md, then use the HTML file to preview it.Edit the file on your computer with whatever editor you prefer.Commit the changes and push it to a brand new temporary branch that no-one else is looking at yet - perhaps a branch on your personal fork of the project.View the file on github and check that you\'re content with the html rendering. If you\'re not content with it edit the file, git commit --amend and git push --force until you are.Now merge your commit into a branch that other people do care about, and push that. You may want to delete your new branch.If you are using IntelliJ create a file with the .md file extension. IntelliJ will automatically show a preview for that file when editing it.
