I\'m using grep to match string in a file. Here is an example file:grep -i null myfile.txt returns How can I return matched lines together with their line numbers like this:I know -c returns total matched lines, but I don\'t how to format it properly to add total null count in front, and I don\'t know how to add the line numbers.What can I do?-n returns line number.-i is for ignore-case. Only to be used if case matching is not necessaryCombine with awk to print out the line number after the match:Use command substitution to print out the total null count:Use -n or --line-number.Check out man grep for lots more options.Or use awk instead:use grep -n -i null myfile.txt to output the line number in front of each match.I dont think grep has a switch to print the count of total lines matched, but you can just pipe grep\'s output into wc to accomplish that:grep find the lines and output the line numbers, but does not let you "program" other things. If you want to include arbitrary text and do other "programming", you can use awk,Or only using the shell(bash/ksh)or in perl (for completeness...):Refer this link for linux command linux\nhttp://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/grep1.htmlfor displaying line no ,line of code and file use this command in your terminal or cmd, GitBash(Powered by terminal)
