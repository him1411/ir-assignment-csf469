I have a local test/development server (http, of course), listening to port 8000,I\'m working on Linux, so to test the page on IE6/7/8 etc I run a virtual machine using virtual box; I also need to see how it look on firefox in a windows environment (fonts for instance are different).In my real machine, I open the website simply using the URL http://localhost:8000, how do I address this localhost from the virtual machine?Right now my workaround is to use the IP address. Any better ideas?Googling turned this up: http://data.agaric.com/localhost-from-virtualbox-xp-install-ubuntuIt suggests using IP: http://10.0.2.2, and it worked for me.So, I edited the hosts file, C:\\windows\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts,  and added this entry:If you\'re testing on IE8, remember to put http:// in the address bar. Just putting the ip directly will not work.For example:I\'m running Virtual Box on macOS (previously OS X), using Virtual Box to test IE on Windows, etc.Go to IE in Virtual Box and access localhost via http://10.0.2.2 for localhost, or http://10.0.2.2:3000 for localhost:3000. I kept Network settings as NAT, no need for bridge as suggested above in my case. There is no need to edit any config files.To enable this on OSX I had to do the following:You can refer to it by localhost and access other localhosted sites by adding their references to the hosts file (C:\\windows\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts) like the following:You most likely have your virtual machine\xe2\x80\x99s networking set to NAT.  If you set your networking to Bridged you should be able to access your host machine by its hostname.  For example, if your hostname is \xe2\x80\x9cjsmith-Precision-7510\xe2\x80\x9d and you want to open http://localhost:3000/, you will be able to view that page at http://jsmith-Precision-7510:3000/.To find your hostname, open a terminal/console and then run the command hostname.  Your hostname will be outputted on the next line.See the VirtualBox documentation for instructions on how to set your networking setttings to Bridged.I found that 10.0.2.2:<port> works, but only if Promiscuous Mode is set correctly.  After installing my VM, I went to Settings > Network > Adapter 1.NAT is set by default, and the Promiscuous Mode dropdown is disabled.  I switched from NAT to Bridged Adapter, which enabled the Promiscuous Mode dropdown, and then changed the value from "Deny" to "Allow VMs".  I then switched back to NAT, which disabled Promiscuous Mode again, but retained the new value.After only this change, I was able to launch my VM and see my host machines\nlocalhost:<port> on my VM at 10.0.2.2:<port>.If you have adapter attached to NAT, nowadays it\'s better and more elegant solution to set port forwarding to local ports.Settings > Network > Adapter > Advanced > Port forwardingJust insert new rule and set Host port and Guest port to 80 (for http) or 22 (for ssh), and so on.Then you can access that machine by entering just http://localhostYou may also want to switch NAT to transparent mode.You need to edit your hosts file on your Windows Virtual machine the same way you do for your local host machine:C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hostsAnd link your virtual hosts to 10.0.2.2, If you are just using localhost then replace127.0.0.1 localhost with 10.0.2.2 localhostFor example:This tells your virtual machine to point to your local machine for those domain names.I had to go into virtualbox and change my network settings to \'NAT\'. After that, I was able to hit localhost running on my host machine from my emulator on virtualbox though http://10.0.2.2:3000MacOSIf you want to set up a windows environment with Virtualbox on a mac,\njust use the default NAT settings on the adapter,\nand in your windows VM, go to hosts file and add the following:Differently from the answers above, it\'s important to include both lines, otherwise it won\'t work.I solved by adding a port forwarding in Virtualbox settings under network.\nHost IP set 127.0.0.1 port : 8080 \nGuest ip : Give any IP for the website ( say 10.0.2.5) port : 8080\nNow from guest machine access http://10.0.2.5:8080 using IEA combination of a few things eventually got things working on my end. \nRunning a flask server on macosx.In my windows VM I edited the hosts file:  Shutdown VM and on my Mac in VirtualBox:Then I went to Adapter 2I started my server on my mac, running on 127.0.0.1:5000 and this was now accessible on my vm at http://10.0.2.2:5000 Man what a nightmare to test on IE on mac. How is there not a simpler way?In virtual Box as said upper, you can add this line hosts filebut to save it, if you don\'t have administrators right in your VM just move hosts file to desktop, then edit it to add the line 10.0....outer, save the file, and move to its original place.check if you can hit your parent machine with:\nipconfig  (get your ip address)ping <ip> or telnet <ip> <port>If you cannot get to the port, try adding a new inbound rule in your parent firewall allowing local ports.I was then able to access http://<ip>:<port>In Virtual BoxNow the tricky bit is your localhost, if you are running from Node.js set the IP address to 0.0.0.0, then lookup your own IP address, for example cmd:ipconfig --> 10.0.1.3 Type that address in with the port number. And it will work. actually user477494\'s answer is in principle correct. I\'ve applied the same logic in other environments (osx host - virtual XP) and that does the trick. I did have to cycle the host LAMP stack to get the IP address and apache port to resolve, but once I\'d figured that out, I was laughing. On Windows with a virtual Windows 7 the only thing that worked for me was using NAT and port-forwarding (couldn\'t get bridged connection running). I found a tutorial here: http://www.howtogeek.com/122641/how-to-forward-ports-to-a-virtual-machine-and-use-it-as-a-server/ (scroll down to the part with "Forwarding Ports to a Virtual Machine").With this changes I could reach the xampp website with "http://192.168.xx.x:8888/mywebsite" in internet explorer 10 on my virtual machine. I found the IP in XAMPP Control Panel > Netstat ("System").If you use Virtual Box you can connect Mac OSX (and I think Linux) to your virtual windows machine using one line of code --> I suggest stopping the box before running this in terminal.VBoxManage modifyvm "YOUR VM NAME" --natdnshostresolver1 onI will note that this is from the Dinghy docs, which I am running, but its a virtual box command so it shouldn\'t actually care what you use as long as its Virtual BoxBefore all, make sure that you allow http and https to pass in firewall settings on machine you want to access.\nAfter that, you can use answers aforementioned. Get the IP for the machine running Apache (inet addr: in ifconfig) and enter that in the virtual box browser address bar.
