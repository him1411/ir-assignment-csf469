It\'s there a way to configure the setInterval method of javascript to execute the method immediately and then executes with the timerIt\'s simplest to just call the function yourself directly the first time:However there are good reasons to avoid setInterval - in particular in some circumstances a whole load of setInterval events can arrive immediately after each other without any delay.  Another reason is that if you want to stop the loop you have to explicitly call clearInterval which means you have to remember the handle returned from the original setInterval call.So an alternative method is to have foo trigger itself for subsequent calls using setTimeout instead:This guarantees that there is at least an interval of delay between calls.  It also makes it easier to cancel the loop if required - you just don\'t call setTimeout when your loop termination condition is reached.Better yet, you can wrap that all up in an immediately invoked function expression which creates the function, which then calls itself again as above, and automatically starts the loop:which defines the function and starts the cycle all in one go.I\'m not sure if I\'m understanding you correctly, but you could easily do something like this:There\'s obviously any number of ways of doing this, but that\'s the most concise way I can think of.Here\'s a wrapper to pretty-fy it if you need it:Set the third argument of setInterval to true and it\'ll run for the first time immediately after calling setInterval:Or omit the third argument and it will retain its original behaviour:Some browsers support additional arguments for setInterval which this wrapper doesn\'t take into account; I think these are rarely used, but keep that in mind if you do need them.You could wrap setInterval() in a function that provides that behavior:...then use it like this:I stumbled upon this question due to the same problem but none of the answers helps if you need to behave exactly like setInterval() but with the only difference that the function is called immediately at the beginning.Here is my solution to this problem:The advantage of this solution:Example:To be cheeky, if you really need to use setInterval then you could also replace the original setInterval. Hence, no change of  code required when adding this before your existing code:Still, all advantages as listed above apply here but no substitution is necessary.If you extract the code you are passing to setInterval into a function, you can call the function directly immediately after calling setInterval. This achieves the same effect.To solve this problem , I run the function a first time after the page has loaded.Use:With UI effects, compose anim into the poll to further reduce processing overhead:I will suggest calling the functions in the following sequenceYou can also pass the _timer to the foo, if you want to clearInterval(_timer) on a certain conditionThere\'s a problem with immediate asynchronous call of your function, because standard setTimeout/setInterval has a minimal timeout about several milliseconds even if you directly set it to 0. It caused by a browser specific work.An example of code with a REAL zero delay wich works in Chrome, Safari, OperaYou can find more information hereAnd after the first manual call you can create an interval with your function.actually the quickest is to dothis will call myfunction, and then will do it agaian every 45 seconds which is different than doingwhich won\'t call it, but schedule it only
