Is there any way of taking a screenshot of a website in PHP, then saving it to a file?LAST EDIT: after 7 years im still getting upvote fot this answer, but I guess this one is now much more accurate.Sure you can, but you\'ll need to render the page with something.\nIf you really want to only use php, i suggest you HTMLTOPS, wich render the page and output it in a ps file (ghostscript), then, convert it in a .jpg, .png, .pdf.. can be little slower with complex pages (and dont support all the CSS).Else, you can use wkhtmltopdf to output a html page in pdf, jpg, whaterver..\nAccept CSS2.0, use the webkit (safari\'s wrapper) to render the page.. so should be fine.\nYou have to install it on your server, as well..UPDATE Now, with new HTML5 and JS feature, is also possible to render the page into a canvas object using Javascript. Here a nice library to do that: Html2Canvas and here is an implementation by the same author to get a feedback like G+.\nOnce you have rendered the dom into the canvas, you can then send to the server via ajax and save it as a jpg.EDIT: You can use the imagemagick tool for transforming pdf to png. My version of wkhtmltopdf does not support images. E.g. convert html.pdf -append html.png.EDIT: This small shell script gives a simple / but working usage example on linux with php5-cli and the tools mentioned above. EDIT: i noticed now that the wkhtmltopdf team is working on another project: wkhtmltoimage, that gives you the jpg directlySince PHP 5.2.2 it is possible, to capture a website with PHP solely!imagegrabscreen \xe2\x80\x94 Captures the whole screenimagegrabwindow - Grabs a window or its client area using a windows handle (HWND property in COM instance) Edit: Note, these functions are available on Windows systems ONLY!If you don\'t want to use any third party tools, I have come across to simple solution that is using Google Page Insight api.Just need to call it\'s api with params screenshot=true.For mobile site view pass &strategy=mobile in params,DEMO.You can use simple headless browser like PhantomJS to grab the page. Also you can use PhantomJS with PHP.Check out this little php script that do this. Take a look here https://github.com/microweber/screenAnd here is the API- http://screen.microweber.com/shot.php?url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/757675/website-screenshots-using-phpThis ought to be good for you:http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/Make sure you download the wkhtmltoimage distribution!It\'s in Python, but going over the documentation and code you can see exactly how this is done. If you can run python, then it\'s a ready-made solution for you:http://browsershots.org/ Note that everything can run on one machine for one platform, or one machine with virtual machines running the other platforms.Free, open source, scroll to bottom of page for links to documentation, source code, and other information.Yes. You will need some things tho:See khtmld(aemon) on *nx.\nSee Url2Jpg for Windows but since it is dotNet app you should also chek Url2BmpBoth are console tools that u can utilise from your web app to get the screenshot.There are also web services that offer it. Check this out for example.Edit:This link is useful to.Yes it is. If you only need image of URL try thisPass the url as argument and you\'ll get the image for more details check this link http://zenithwebtechnologies.com.au/auto-thumbnail-generation-from-url.htmlcutycapt saves webpages to most image formats(jpg,png..) download it from your synaptic, it works much better than wkhtmltopdfI always use microweber screen to capture screenshot of any webpage. Here we can find a well written tutorial. This is easier and should not take more than 3 minutes to learn.Well, PhantomJS is a browser that can be easily put on a server and integrate it to php. You can find the code in WDudes. They have included lot more features like specifying the image size, cache, download as a file or display in img src etc. URL ParametersWidth and Height: screenshot.php?url=google.com&w=1000&h=800With cropping:\nscreenshot.php?url=google.com&w=1000&h=800&clipw=800&cliph=600Disable cache and load fresh screesnhot:\nscreenshot.php?url=google.com&cache=0To download the image: screenshot.php?url=google.com&download=trueYou can see the tutorial here: Capture Screenshot of a Website using PHP without APII\'m on Windows so I was able to use the imagegrabwindow function after reading the tip on here from stephan.  I added in cropping (to get rid of the Browser header, scroll bars, etc.) and resizing to get a final image.  Here\'s my code.  Hope that helps someone.I set up finally using microweber/screen as proposed by @boksiora.\nInitially when trying the mentioned link here what I got:I\'m on Linux. So if you want to run it, you may adjust my step follow to your environment.\nHere are the step I did on my shell on DOCUMENT_ROOT folder:Point your browser to screen/demo/shot.php?url=google.com. When you see the screenshot, you are done. Discussion for more advance setting is available here and here.There are many open source projects that can generate screenshots. For example PhantomJS, webkit2png etcThe big problem with these projects is that they are based on older browser technology and have problems rendering many sites, especially sites that use webfonts, flexbox, svg and various other additions to the HTML5 and CSS spec over the last couple of months/years. I\'ve tried a few of the third party services, and most are based on PhantomJS, meaning they also produce poor quality screenshots. The best third party service for generating website screenshots is urlbox.io. It is a paid service, although there is a free 7-day trial to test it out without committing to any paid plan.Here is a link to the documentation, and below are simple steps to get it working in PHP with composer. For e.g. here\'s a full height screenshot of this very page:https://api.urlbox.io/v1/ca482d7e-9417-4569-90fe-80f7c5e1c781/8f1666d1f4195b1cb84ffa5f992ee18992a2b35e/png?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstackoverflow.com%2Fquestions%2F757675%2Fwebsite-screenshots-using-php%2F43652083%2343652083&full_page=truewebkit2html works on Mac OS X and Linux, is quite simple to install and to use. See this tutorial.For Windows, you can go with CutyCapt, which has similar functionality.I used bluga.  The api allows you to take 100 snapshots a month without paying, but sometimes it uses more than 1 credit for a single page.  I just finished upgrading a drupal module, Bluga WebThumbs to drupal 7 which allows you to print a thumbnail in a template or input filter.  The main advantage to using this api is that it allows you to specify browser dimensions in case you use adaptive css, so I am using it to get renderings for the mobile and tablet layout as well as the regular one.There are api clients for the following languages:PHP,\nPython,\nRuby,\nJava,\n.Net C#,\nPerl\nand Bash (the shell script looks like it requires perl)It all depends on how you wish to take the screenshot.You could do this via PHP, using a webservice to get the image for yougrabz.it has a webservice to do just this, here\'s an article showing a simple example of using the service.http://www.phpbuilder.com/articles/news-reviews/miscellaneous/capture-screenshots-in-php-with-grabzit-120524022959.htmlNot directly. Software such as Selenium have features like this and can be controlled by PHP but have other dependencys (such as running their java-based server on the computer with the browser you want to screenshot)I used page2images. It is developed base on the cutycapt which is really fast and stable. If you do not want to spend too much time on the performance and configuration, you should use it. If you go to their website, you can find more details and sample PHP code.you can use cutycapt .kwhtml is deprecated and show page like old browser.You can use https://grabz.it solution. It\'s got a PHP API which is very flexible and can be called in different ways such as from a cronjob or a PHP web page. In order to implement it you will need to first get an app key and secret and download the (free) SDK. And a example for implementation, first of all initialization:And screenshoting example:Next is the saving.You can use one of the two save methods, Save if publicly accessible callback handle available and SaveTo if not. Check the documentation for details.
