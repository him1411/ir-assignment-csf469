If I have a scope with a lambda and it takes an argument, depending on the value of the argument, I might know that there will not be any matches, but I still want to return a relation, not an empty array:What I really want is a "none" method, the opposite of "all", that returns a relation that can still be chained, but results in the query being short-circuited.There is a now a "correct" mechanism in Rails 4:A more portable solution that doesn\'t require an "id" column and doesn\'t assume there won\'t be a row with an id of 0:I\'m still looking for a more "correct" way.You can add a scope called "none":That will give you an empty ActiveRecord::RelationYou could also add it to ActiveRecord::Base in an initializer (if you want):Plenty of ways to get something like this, but certainly not the best thing to keep in a code base.  I have used the scope :none when refactoring and finding that I need to guarantee an empty ActiveRecord::Relation for a short time.In Rails 4, a chainable ActiveRecord::NullRelation will be returned from calls like Post.none.Neither it, nor chained methods, will generate queries to the database.According to the comments:The returned ActiveRecord::NullRelation inherits from\n  Relation and implements the Null Object pattern. It is an object with\n  defined null behavior and always returns an empty array of records\n  without quering the database.See the source code.Is a dangerous solution because your scope might be chained upon.User.none.firstwill return the first user. It\'s safer to useI think I prefer the way this looks to the other options:Leading to something like this:Use scoped:But, you can also simplify your code with:If you want an empty result, use this (remove the if condition):There are also variants, but all of these are making request to dbIt is possible and so that\'s:http://apidock.com/rails/v4.0.2/ActiveRecord/QueryMethods/noneCorrect me if I\'m wrong.
