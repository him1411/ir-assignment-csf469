What is wrong with the code below?Maybe it would be simpler to just compare date and not time. I am not sure how to do this either, and I searched, but I couldn\'t find my exact problem.BTW, when I display the two dates in an alert, they show as exactly the same.My code:Is there a simpler way to compare dates and not including the time?I\'m still learning JavaScript, and the only way that I\'ve found which works for me to compare two dates without the time is to use the setHours method of the Date object and set the hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds to zero. Then compare the two dates.For example,date2 will be set with hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds to zero, but date1 will have them set to the time that date1 was created. To get rid of the hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds on date1 do the following:Now you can compare the two dates as DATES only without worrying about time elements.How about this? It allows you to compare the date part of the date like this without affecting the value of your variable:If you have the option of including a third party library, it\'s definitely worth taking a look at Moment.js. It makes working with Date and DateTime much, much easier.For example, seeing if one Date comes after another Date but excluding their times, you would do something like this:The second parameter you pass into isAfter is the precision to do the comparison and can be any of year, month, week, day, hour, minute or second.This might be a little cleaner version, also note that you should always use a radix when using parseInt.Checkout the MDC parseInt page for more information about the radix.JSLint is a great tool for catching things like a missing radix and many other things that can cause obscure and hard to debug errors.  It forces you to use better coding standards so you avoid future headaches. I use it on every JavaScript project I code.The javascript date object makes this unnecessarily difficult, so it\'s unlikely to be done well. The accepted answer to this question falls into the trap.A javascript date has no notion of timezone. It\'s a moment in time (ticks since the epoch) with handy functions for translating to and from strings in the "local" timezone. If you want to work with dates using date objects, you want your dates to represent UTC midnight at the start of the date in question. This is a common and necessary convention that lets you work with dates regardless of the season or timezone of their creation. So you need to be very vigilant to manage the notion of timezone, particularly when you create your midnight UTC Date object.  Most of the time, you will want your date to reflect the timezone of the user. Click if today is your birthday. Users in NZ and US click at the same time and get different dates. In that case, do this...Sometimes, international comparability trumps local accuracy. In that case, do this...Having taken care to manage timezone when you create, you now need to be sure to keep timezone out when you convert back to a string representation. So you can safely use...And totally avoid everything else, especially...So to answer your question, 7 years too late...See it running...The date.js library is handy for these things. It makes all JS date-related scriping a lot easier.As I don\'t see here similar approach, and I\'m not enjoying setting h/m/s/ms to 0, as it can cause problems with accurate transition to local time zone with changed date object (I presume so), let me introduce here this, written few moments ago, lil function:+: Easy to use, makes a basic comparison operations done (comparing day, month and year without time.)\n-: It seems that this is a complete opposite of "out of the box" thinking.Usage:datecompare(date1, \'===\', date2) for equality check,\ndatecompare(date1, \'>\', date2) for greater check,\n!datecompare(date1, \'>\', date2) for less or equal check   Also, obviously, you can switch date1 and date2 in places to achieve any other simple comparison.This is the way I do it:Simply compare using .toDateString like below:This will return you date part only and not time or timezone, like this:"Fri Feb 03 2017"Hence both date can be compared in this format likewise without time part of it.Make sure you construct userDate with a 4 digit year as setFullYear(10, ...) !== setFullYear(2010, ...).After reading this question quite same time after it is posted I have decided to post another solution, as I didn\'t find it that quite satisfactory, at least to my needs:I have used something like this:In that way I could have used the dates in the format I wanted for processing afterwards. But this was only for my need, but I have decided to post it anyway, maybe it will help someoneYou can use some arithmetic with the total of ms. I like this because no updates to the original dates are made and perfom faster than string split and compare.Hope this help!
