I have few methods that returns different Generic Lists. Exists in .net any class static method or whatever to convert any list into a datatable? The only thing that i can imagine is use Reflection to do this.IF i have this:(This next code doesn\'t work of course, but i would like to have the possibility of:Here\'s a nice 2013 update using FastMember from NuGet:This uses the FastMember\'s meta-programming API for maximum performance. If you want to restrict it to particular members (or enforce the order), then you can do that too:Editor\'s Dis/claimer: FastMember is a Marc Gravell project. Its gold and  full-on flys!Yes, this is pretty much the exact opposite of this one; reflection would suffice - or if you need quicker, HyperDescriptor in 2.0, or maybe Expression in 3.5. Actually, HyperDescriptor should be more than adequate.For example:Now with one line you can make this many many times faster than reflection (by enabling HyperDescriptor for the object-type T).edit re performance query; here\'s a test rig with results:I suspect that the bottleneck has shifted from member-access to DataTable performance... I doubt you\'ll improve much on that...code:I had to modify Mark Gravell\'s sample code to handle nullable types and null values.  I have included a working version below.  Thanks Mark.This is a simple mix of the solutions.\nIt work with Nullable types.A small change to Mark\'s answer to make it work with value types like List<string> to data table:It\'s also possible through XmlSerialization.\nThe idea is - serialize to XML and then readXml method of DataSet.I use this code (from an answer in SO, forgot where)so then it\'s as simple as:Not sure how it stands against all the other answers of this post, but it\'s also a possibility.This link on MSDN is worth a visit: How to: Implement CopyToDataTable<T> Where the Generic Type T Is Not a DataRowThis adds an extension method that lets you do this:I\'ve written a small library myself to accomplish this task. It uses reflection only for the first time an object type is to be translated to a datatable. It emits a method that will do all the work translating an object type.Its blazing fast. You can find it here:\nModelShredder on GoogleCodetry this Marc Gravell\'s answer but in VB.NETI also had to come up with an alternate solution, as none of the options listed here worked in my case. I was using an IEnumerable which returned an IEnumerable and the properties couldn\'t be enumerated. This did the trick:I realize that this has been closed for a while; however, I had a solution to this specific problem but needed a slight twist: the columns and data table needed to be predefined / already instantiated.  Then I needed to simply insert the types into the data table.So here\'s an example of what I did:This is the simple Console Application to convert List to Datatable.Se prob\xc3\xb3 el m\xc3\xa9todo para que acepte campos con null.Another approach is the above:
