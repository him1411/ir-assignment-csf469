Is there any way to disable a link using CSS?I have a class called current-page and want links with this class to be disabled so that no action occurs when they are clicked.The answer is already in the comments of the question. For more visibility, I am copying this solution here:Example: http://jsfiddle.net/7EQJpFor browser support, please see: http://caniuse.com/#search=pointer-events*, if you need to support IE there is a workaround, see this answer.Warning: The use of pointer-events in CSS for non-SVG elements is experimental. The feature used to be part of the CSS3 UI draft specification but, due to many open issues, has been postponed to CSS4.* CSS can only be used to change the style of something. The best you could probably do with pure CSS is to hide the link altogether.What you really need is some javascript. Here\'s how you\'d do what you want using the jQuery library.CSS can\'t do that.  CSS is for presentation only.  Your options are:You can set href attribute to javascript:void(0)Only way you could do this without CSS would be to set a CSS on a wrapping div that made your a disappear and something else take it\'s place.EG:With a CSS likeTo actually turn off the A you\'ll have to replace it\'s click event or href, as described by others.PS: Just to clarify I\'d consider this a fairly untidy solution, and for SEO it\'s not the best either, but I believe it\'s the best with purely CSS.If you want to stick to just HTML/CSS on a form, another option is to use a button. Style it and set the disabled attribute.E.g.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/cFTxH/1/Try this:I searched over internet and found no better than this.\nBasically to disable button click functionality, just add CSS style using jQuery like so:Then to enable it again do thisChecked on Firefox and IE 11, it worked.The pointer-events property allows for control over how HTML elements\n  respond to mouse/touch events \xe2\x80\x93 including CSS hover/active states,\n  click/tap events in Javascript, and whether or not the cursor is\n  visible.That\'s not the only way you disable a Link, but a good CSS way which work in IE10+ and all new browsers:Demo here\nTry this oneThanks to everyone that posted solutions, I combined multiple approaches to provide some more advanced disabled functionality.  Here is a gist, and the code is below.Here is the coffescript class:You can also size another element so that it covers the links (using the right z-index): That will "eat" the clicks. (We discovered this by accident because we had an issue with suddenly inactive links due to "responsive" design causing a H2 to cover them when the browser window was mobile-sized.)you can use this css:
