The following code compiles in Swift 1.2:What is the difference between a static function and a class function? Which one should I use, and when?If I try to define another variable class var myVar2 = "", it says:Class stored properties not yet supported in classes; did you mean \'static\'?When this feature is supported, what will the difference be between a static variable and a class variable (i.e. when both are defined in a class)? Which one should I use, and when?(Xcode 6.3)static and class both associate a method with a class, rather than an instance of a class. The difference is that subclasses can override class methods; they cannot override static methods.class properties will theoretically function in the same way (subclasses can override them), but they\'re not possible in Swift yet.I tried mipadi\'s answer and comments on playground. And thought of sharing it. Here you go. I think mipadi\'s answer should be mark as accepted.Regarding to OOP, the answer is too simple:The subclasses can override class methods, but cannot override static methods.In addition to your post, if you want to declare a class variable (like you did class var myVar2 = ""), you should do it as follow:I got this confusion in one of my project as well and found this post, very helpful. Tried the same in my playground and here is the summary. Hope this helps someone with stored properties and functions of type static, final,class, overriding class vars etc.And here is the testing samples:There\'s one more difference. class can be used to define type properties of computed type only. If you need a stored type property use static instead."You define type properties with the static keyword. For computed type properties for class types, you can use the class keyword instead to allow subclasses to override the superclass\xe2\x80\x99s implementation."Testing in Swift 4 shows performance difference in simulator. I made a class with "class func" and struct with "static func" and ran them in test. static func is:However, running the same code on iPhone 7 under iOS 10.3 shows exactly the same performance. Here is sample project in Swift 4 for Xcode 9 if you like to test yourself \nhttps://github.com/protyagov/StructVsClassPerformance
