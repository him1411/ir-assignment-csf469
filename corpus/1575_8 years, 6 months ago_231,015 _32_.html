I have a Git repository and I\'d like to see how some file looked a few months ago. I found the revision at that date, it\'s: 27cf8e84bb88e24ae4b4b3df2b77aab91a3735d8. I need to see what did one file look like and also save that to a file.I managed to see the file using gitk, but it doesn\'t have an option to save it. I tried with command line tools, the closest I got was:However, this command shows a diff and not the file contents. I know I can later use something like PAGER=cat and redirect output to a file, but I don\'t know how to get to the actual file content.Basically, I\'m looking for something like svn cat.To complete your own answer, the syntax is indeedThe command takes the usual style of revision, meaning you can use any of the following:Tip It\'s important to remember that when using "git show", always specify a path from the root of the repository, not your current directory position. (Although Mike Morearty mentions that, at least with git 1.7.5.4, you can specify a relative path by putting "./" at the beginning of the path -- for example:)Before git1.5.x, that was done with some plumbing:git ls-tree <rev>\n  show a list of one or more \'blob\' objects within a commitgit cat-file blob <file-SHA1>\n  cat a file as it has been committed within a specific revision (similar to svn\n  cat).\n  use git ls-tree to retrieve the value of a given file-sha1 git-ls-tree lists the object ID for $file in revision $REV, this is cut out of the output and used as an argument to git-cat-file, which should really be called git-cat-object, and simply dumps that object to stdout.Note: since Git 2.11 (Q4 2016), you can apply a content filter to the git cat-file output!See commit 3214594, commit 7bcf341 (09 Sep 2016), commit 7bcf341 (09 Sep 2016), and commit b9e62f6, commit 16dcc29 (24 Aug 2016) by Johannes Schindelin (dscho).\n(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit 7889ed2, 21 Sep 2016) Even though "git hash-objects", which is a tool to take an on-filesystem data stream and put it into the Git object store, allowed to perform the "outside-world-to-Git" conversions (e.g. end-of-line conversions and application of the clean-filter), and it had the feature on by default from very early days, its reverse operation "git cat-file", which takes an object from the Git object store and externalize for the consumption by the outside world, lacked an equivalent mechanism to run the "Git-to-outside-world"If you wish to replace/overwrite the content of a file in your current branch with the content of the file from a previous commit or a different branch, you can do so with these commands:orYou will then have to commit those changes in order for them to be effective in the current branch.You need to provide full path to the file:The easiest way is to write:WHERE:EXAMPLE:This will save my_file.txt from revision b0d78b4 as a new file with name my_file.txt.OLDTested with GIT 2.4.5If you want to retrieve deleted file you can use HASH~1 (one commit before specified HASH).EXAMPLE:And to nicely dump it into a file (in windows at least) - git Bash:the " quotes are needed so it preserves newlinesIn Windows, with Git Bash:This will help you get all deleted files between commits without specifying the path, useful if there are a lot of files deleted.Get the file from a previous commit through checking-out previous commit and copying file.
