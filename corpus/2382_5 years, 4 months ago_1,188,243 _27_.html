This question already has an answer here:I am using something similar to the following code: I expected this to make the background have an opacity of 0.4 and the text to have 100% opacity. Instead they both have an opacity of 0.4. Children inherit opacity. It\'d be weird and inconvenient if they didn\'t. You can use a translucent png for your background image, or use an RGBa (a for alpha) color for your background color.Example, 50% faded black background:You can use CSS 3 :before to have a semi-transparent background and you can do this with just one container. Use something like thisThen apply some CSSSample: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/avdsiNote: You might need to adjust the z-index values. The following methods can be used to solve your problemCSS Aplha Transparency Method (doesn\'t work in IE 8)Use a Transparent png image according to your choice as background.Use the following css code snippet to create a cross-browser alpha-transparent background.

This is assuming you are required to have a semi-transparent image btw, and not a color (which you should just use rgba for). Also assumed is  that you can\'t just alter the opacity of the image beforehand in photoshop.This is because the inner div has 100% of the opacity of the div it is nested in (which has 40% opacity).In order to circumvent it there are a few things you could do.you could create two separate divs like so:set your desired css opacity and other properties for hte background and utilize the z-index property (z-index) to style and position the bContent div. With this you can place the div overtope of the background div without having it\'s opacity mucked with.Another option is to RGBa. This will allow you to nest your divs and still achieve div specific opacity.The last option is to simply make a semi transparent .png image of the color you want in your desired image editor of choice, set the background-image property to the url of the image and then you won\'t have to worry about mucking about with the css and losing the capability and organization of a nested div structure.You can use sass transparentize,\ni found it to be the most useful and plain to use.See more: http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html#transparentize-instance_methodJust make sure to put width and height for the foreground the same with the background, or try to have top, bottom, left and right properties.
