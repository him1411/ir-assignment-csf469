I\'d like to capture the output of var_dump to a string.The PHP docs say;As with anything that outputs its result directly to the browser, the output-control functions can be used to capture the output of this function, and save it in a string (for example).Can someone give me an example of how that might work?print_r() isn\'t a valid possibility because it\'s not going to give me the information that I need.Use output buffering:You may want to check out var_export \xe2\x80\x94 while it doesn\'t provide the same output as var_dump it does provide a second $return parameter which will cause it to return its output rather than print it:I prefer this one-liner to using ob_start and ob_get_clean().  I also find that the output is a little easier to read, since it\'s just PHP code.The difference between var_dump and var_export is that var_export returns a "parsable string representation of a variable" while var_dump simply dumps information about a variable.  What this means in practice is that var_export gives you valid PHP code (but may not give you quite as much information about the variable, especially if you\'re working with resources).If you\'re trying to dump a variable with circular references, calling var_export will result in a PHP warning:Results in: Both var_dump and print_r, on the other hand, will output the string *RECURSION* when encountering circular references.You could also do this:You may also try to use serialize() function, sometimes it very useful for debuging puprposes.Also echo json_encode($dataobject); might be helpfulIf you want to have a look at a variables contents during runtime, consider using a real debugger like XDebug. That way you don\'t need to mess up your source code and you can use a debugger even while normal users visit your application. They won\'t notice.I\'m aware that this question is old, but no one mentioned this point.From the PHP manual:This function displays structured information about one or more expressions that includes its type and value.So, here is the real return version of PHP\'s var_dump(), which actually accepts a variable-length argument list.Cheers.here is the complete solution as function.From http://htmlexplorer.com/2015/01/assign-output-var_dump-print_r-php-variable.html:var_dump and print_r functions can only output directly to browser. So the output of these functions can only retrieved by using output control functions of php. Below method may be useful to save the output.ob_get_clean() can only clear last data entered to internal buffer. So\nob_get_contents method will be useful if you have multiple entries.From the same source as above:
