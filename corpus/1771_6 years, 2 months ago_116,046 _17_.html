I have a Git repository with n commits.I have a file that I need, and that used to be in the repository, and that I suddenly look for and think "Oh! Where\'d that file go?"Is there a (series of) Git command(s) that will tell me that "file really_needed.txt was deleted at commit n-13"?In other words, without looking at every individual commit, and knowing that my Git repo has every change of every file, can I quickly find the last commit that HAS that file, so I can get it back?git log -- [file path] shows the changes of a file, work even if the file was deleted.See Which commit deleted a filewill show you all commits in your repo\'s history, including merge commits, that touched your_file. The last (top) one is the one that deleted the file.The --full-history flag here is important. Without it, Git performs "history simplification" when you ask it for the log of a file. The docs are light on details about exactly how this works and I lack the grit and courage required to try and figure it out from the source code, but the git-log docs have this much to say:Simplifies the history to the simplest history explaining the final state of the tree. Simplest because it prunes some side branches if the end result is the same (i.e. merging branches with the same content)This is obviously concerning when the file whose history we want is deleted, since the simplest history explaining the final state of a deleted file is no history. Is there a risk that git log without --full-history will simply claim that the file was never created? Unfortunately, yes. Here\'s a demonstration:Notice how git log -- bar in the terminal dump above resulted in literally no output; Git is "simplifying" history down into a fiction where bar never existed. git log --full-history -- bar, on the other hand, gives us the commit that created bar and the commit that deleted it.To be clear: this issue isn\'t merely theoretical. I only looked into the docs and discovered the --full-history flag because git log -- some_file was failing for me in a real repository where I was trying to track a deleted file down. History simplification might sometimes be helpful when you\'re trying to understand how a currently-existing file came to be in its current state, but when trying to track down a file deletion it\'s more likely to screw you over by hiding the commit you care about. Always use the --full-history flag for this use case.Git log but you need to prefix the path with --Eg:I\'ve just added a solution here (is there a way in git to list all deleted files in the repository?) for finding the commits of deleted files by using a regexp:This returns everything deleted within a directory named some_dir (cascading). Any sed regexp there where \\/some_dir\\/ is will do.OSX (thanks to @triplee and @keif)
