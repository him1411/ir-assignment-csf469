I\'d like to set a property of an object through Reflection, with a value of type string.\nSo, for instance, suppose I have a Ship class, with a property of Latitude, which is a double.Here\'s what I\'d like to do:As is, this throws an ArgumentException:Object of type \'System.String\' cannot be converted to type \'System.Double\'.How can I convert value to the proper type, based on propertyInfo?You can use Convert.ChangeType() - It allows you to use runtime information on any IConvertible type to change representation formats. Not all conversions are possible, though, and you may need to write special case logic if you want to support conversions from types that are not IConvertible.The corresponding code (without exception handling or special case logic) would be:As several others have said, you want to use Convert.ChangeType:In fact, I recommend you look at the entire Convert Class.This class, and many other useful classes are part of the System Namespace. I find it useful to scan that namespace every year or so to see what features I\'ve missed. Give it a try!I notice a lot of people are recommending Convert.ChangeType - This does work for some cases however as soon as you start involving nullable types you will start receiving InvalidCastExceptions:http://weblogs.asp.net/pjohnson/archive/2006/02/07/Convert.ChangeType-doesn_2700_t-handle-nullables.aspxA wrapper was written a few years ago to handle this but that isn\'t perfect either.http://weblogs.asp.net/pjohnson/archive/2006/02/07/Convert.ChangeType-doesn_2700_t-handle-nullables.aspxYou can use a type converter (no error checking):In terms of organizing the code, you could create a kind-of mixin that would result in code like this:This would be achieved with this code:MPropertyAsStringSettable can be reused for many different classes.You can also create your own custom type converters to attach to your properties or classes:You\'re probably looking for the Convert.ChangeType method. For example:Using Convert.ChangeType and getting the type to convert from the PropertyInfo.PropertyType.Or you could try:If you are writing Metro app, you should use other code:Note:instead ofI tried the answer from LBushkin and it worked great, but it won\'t work for null values and nullable fields. So I\'ve changed it to this:Are you looking to play around with Reflection or are you looking to build a production piece of software?  I would question why you\'re using reflection to set a property.
