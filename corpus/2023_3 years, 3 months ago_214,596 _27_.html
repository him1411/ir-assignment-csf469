Is there a function that I can use to iterate over an array and have both index and element, like python\'s enumerate?Yes. As of Swift 3.0, if you need the index for each element along with its value, you can use the enumerated() method to iterate over the array. It returns a tuple composed of the index and the value for each item in the array. For example:Before Swift 3.0 and after Swift 2.0, the function was called enumerate():Prior to Swift 2.0, enumerate was a global function.Starting with Swift 2, the enumerate function needs to be called on the collection like so:Swift 3 provides a method called enumerated() for Array. enumerated() has the following declaration:Returns a sequence of pairs (n, x), where n represents a consecutive integer starting at zero, and x represents an element of the sequence.In the simplest cases, you may use enumerated() with a for loop.For example:Note however that you\'re not limited to use enumerated() with a for loop.In fact, if you plan to use enumerated() with a for loop for something similar to the following code, you\'re doing it wrong:The correct way to do this is:As an alternative, you may also use enumerated() with map:Moreover, although it has some limitations, forEach can be a good replacement to a for loop:By using enumerated() and makeIterator(), you can even iterate manually on your Array.For example:I found this answer while looking for a way to do that with a Dictionary, and it turns out it\'s quite easy to adapt it, just pass a tuple for the element.However, I most often use enumerate in combination with map or filter. For example with operating on a couple of arrays.In this array I wanted to filter odd or even indexed elements and convert them from Ints to Doubles. So enumerate() gets you index and the element, then filter checks the index, and finally to get rid of the resulting tuple I map it to just the element.This is the Formula of loop of Enumeration:for more detail you can check Here.Starting with Swift 3, it is Using .enumerate() works, but it does not provide the true index of the element; it only provides an Int beginning with 0 and incrementing by 1 for each successive element. This is usually irrelevant, but there is the potential for unexpected behavior when used with the ArraySlice type. Take the following code:It\'s a somewhat contrived example, and it\'s not a common issue in practice but still I think it\'s worth knowing this can happen.Xcode 8 and Swift 3: \nArray can be enumerated using tempArray.enumerate()Example:console:
