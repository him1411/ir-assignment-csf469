How do you start a thread with parameters in C#?Yep : One of the 2 overloads of the Thread constructor takse a ParameterizedThreadStart delegate which allows you to pass a single parameter to the start method.  Unfortunately though it only allows for a single parameter and it does so in an unsafe way because it passes it as object.  I find it\'s much easier to use a lambda expression to capture the relevant parameters and pass them in a strongly typed fashion.  Try the followingYou can use lambda expressions this is so far the best answer i could find, it\'s fast and easy.The parameter type must be an object.EDIT:While this answer isn\'t incorrect I do recommend against this approach. Using a lambda expression is much easier to read and doesn\'t require type casting. See here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/1195915/52551Simple way using lambda like so..OR you could even delegate using ThreadStart like so...Use ParameterizedThreadStart.Use ParametrizedThreadStart.I was having issue in the passed parameter.\nI passed integer from a for loop to the function and displayed it , but it always gave out different results. like (1,2,2,3) (1,2,3,3) (1,1,2,3) etc with  ParametrizedThreadStart delegate.this simple code worked as a charm You could use a ParametrizedThreadStart delegate:The ParameterizedThreadStart takes one parameter. You can use that to send one parameter, or a custom class containing several properties.Another method is to put the method that you want to start as an instance member in a class along with properties for the parameters that you want to set. Create an instance of the class, set the properties and start the thread specifying the instance and the method, and the method can access the properties.You can use the BackgroundWorker RunWorkerAsync method and pass in your value.
