If I try to update my subversion repo, it says I must run cleanup. If I run cleanup, it says a file is missing. (I deleted a MASSIVE directory of files that failed to commit this morning from my home pc, but then I commit the same set of files from work, and now my home repo is bust). So, cleanup says:Cleanup failed to process blablabla Can\'t set file blablabla read-write: The system cannot find the file specified.If I update it says:Command: Update      Error: Previous operation has not finished; \n  run \'cleanup\' if it was  interrupted      Error: Please execute the\n  \'Cleanup\' command.      Completed!:How do I get this unstuck?I\'ve been in similar situations. Have you tried running cleanup from the root of your workspace? I know sometimes a cleanup from a child directory (where the problem lies) doesn\'t work, and cleanup from the root of the workspace does.If that still fails, since you had deleted a child dir somewhere. Try deleting 1 level higher from the child dir as well (assuming that is not the root), and re-trying update and cleanup. If cleanup attempts aren\'t succeeding at any level then the answer is unfortunately checkout a new working copy. There is often no need for a new checkout or copying.I have just solved a similar issue relating to the error "previous operation has not finished" with help from this (Link)It seems that svn sometimes gets stuck while processing commands/operations.\nAll of these operations are stored in the database file wc.db in the .svn folder.By downloading SQLite to my checkout directory and runningyou can get a list of all pending operations. These operations are the ones the error is referring to as "not finished".By running all of the old operations are deleted from the work queue and the error disapears.\nNo need for a new checkout or anythingRunning console svn cleanup has solved the same problem for me.I just had a similar issue.  Running Process Explorer showed that another program (Notepad++) had a file handle to a folder that SVN had tried to delete.  When I closed Notepad++, "Clean Up" was able to run successfully.I was facing this problem after adding a jar which is already in the SVN and I added the new Version of it with the same name.In Eclipse I tried this Using above steps I am able to Synchronize.Trying to run cleanup while your files are open gave me problems. as soon as I closed my application (Visual studio) I ran clean up and it was successfulI got the same problem, in my case I was using svn tortoise with the application I mean. Using the cmd shell of windows in root mode I applied svn cleanup and then svn update.... Then you can comeback to the application mode aand it will work perfectly!I tried removing the .svn folder to other location and placed it back in the same root folder.  After when I tried to update the SVN, it got updated.  I don\'t know how exactly it worked.  I had the same problem, and somehow found that I had a hidden .svn file at the c:\\  level.  Once I deleted this hidden folder (.svn), everything worked okay.  I must have unintentionally created a working directory at the root drive.In my case I had gulp-watch running that caused the problems. After stopping it I could execute Cleanup command.delete the svn from the main folder and replace it from another viable copy you have from elsewere.and then update. svn folder will be normally a hidden folder. So, please make sure, to unhide the folder before doing the above steps.Workaround that worked for me:Done, but I cannot explain why this happens.\nIf you don\'t remove the files, the cleanup command say that he can\'t read/write those files.I had the same issue, what worked for me:I had an error such as "Can\'t change perms of file \'/Users/Code/UnitTest.cpp\': No such file or directory". The subversion is confused about a file that is no longer there. I simply did something like "echo ABCD >> /Users/Code/UnitTest.cpp" to create a copy of the file, then cleanup. It worked.In my case, the error appeared when trying to commit from within an IDE. When I executed the commit of the same directories with TortoiseSVN in the explorer, the operation succeeded.That has happened for me when using externals and one of them was corrupt. I had to go to that folder and perform a cleanup. Then the cleanup worked for the entire working copy. Example: Using external ^/widgets/foo  common/foo-widget, first perform cleanup on folder common/foo-widget.I initially got this problem trying to check in with TortoiseSVN.  Initially, both, TortoiseSVN clean up and console svn cleanup both failed with similar messages as the original poster.But my solution, (found out accidentally) was just to wait a few minutes.  I am thinking TSVNCache was holding on to some of those files at the time of check in.follow below steps.1) Go to the directory where you are not able to successfully clean up via svn.(Root folder or child folder).2) Select .svn folder in the directory, cut that folder and paste it in the separate drive or separate location (out of svn directory)3) Now, go back to the directory - right click and select TortoiseSVN -->Repo-browser4) Checkout the folder(it will not perform fresh checkout).5) All your items will be versioned again, and it will repair the internal issue of svn, and problem should be solved.In my case a background Java Virtual Machine instance was running, killing which cleanup was successful.hi guys in my cases after i close Visual Studio and retry to CleanUp it work\nhave good timeI had taken .svn folder from my fellow developer and replaced my .svn folder with this. It worked for me. Don\'t know what may be other consequences!Please Follow this link.\nIt\'s Resolve your issue completely.Go to the main directory right click -> Tortoise SVN -> Clean Uphttps://tortoisesvn.net/docs/nightly/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-dug-cleanup.html
