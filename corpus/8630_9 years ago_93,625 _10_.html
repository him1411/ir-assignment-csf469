Is there a one line function call that quits the program and displays a message? I know in Perl it\'s as simple as:I\'m tired of typing this:The abort function does this. For example:Note: the abort message will be written to STDERR as opposed to puts which will write to STDOUT.If you want to denote an actual error in your code, you could raise a RuntimeError exception:This will print a stacktrace, the type of the exception being raised and the message that you provided. Depending on your users, a stacktrace might be too scary, and the actual message might get lost in the noise. On the other hand, if you die because of an actual error, a stacktrace will give you additional information for debugging.I\'ve never heard of such a function, but it would be trivial enough to implement...Then, if this is defined in some .rb file that you include in all your scripts, you are golden.... just because it\'s not built in doesn\'t mean you can\'t do it yourself ;-)I got here searching for a way to execute some code whenever the program ends.\nFound this:Called multiple times will register multiple handlers.
