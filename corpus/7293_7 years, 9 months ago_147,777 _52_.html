In terms of artificial intelligence and machine learning.\nCan you provide a basic, easy explanation with an example? Since you ask this very basic question, it looks like it\'s worth specifying what Machine Learning itself is.Machine Learning is a class of algorithms which is data-driven, i.e. unlike "normal" algorithms it is the data that "tells" what the "good answer" is. Example: a hypothetical non-machine learning algorithm for face detection in images would try to define what a face is (round skin-like-colored disk, with dark area where you expect the eyes etc). A machine learning algorithm would not have such coded definition, but would "learn-by-examples": you\'ll show several images of faces and not-faces and a good algorithm will eventually learn and be able to predict whether or not an unseen image is a face.This particular example of face detection is supervised, which means that your examples must be labeled, or explicitly say which ones are faces and which ones aren\'t.In an unsupervised algorithm your examples are not labeled, i.e. you don\'t say anything. Of course, in such a case the algorithm itself cannot "invent" what a face is, but it can try to cluster the data into different groups, e.g. it can distinguish that faces are very different from landscapes, which are very different from horses.Since another answer mentions it (though, in an incorrect way): there are "intermediate" forms of supervision, i.e. semi-supervised and active learning. Technically, these are supervised methods in which there is some "smart" way to avoid a large number of labeled examples. In active learning, the algorithm itself decides which thing you should label (e.g. it can be pretty sure about a landscape and a horse, but it might ask you to confirm if a gorilla is indeed the picture of a face). In semi-supervised learning, there are two different algorithms which start with the labeled examples, and then "tell" each other the way they think about some large number of unlabeled data. From this "discussion" they learn.Supervised learning is when the data you feed your algorithm is "tagged" to help your logic make decisions.Example: Bayes spam filtering, where you have to flag an item as spam to refine the results.Unsupervised learning are types of algorithms that try to find correlations without any external inputs other than the raw data.Example: datamining clustering algorithms.Applications in which the training data comprises examples of the input vectors along with their corresponding target vectors are known as supervised learning problems.In other pattern recognition problems, the training data consists of a set of input vectors x without any corresponding target values. The goal in such unsupervised learning problems may be to discover groups of similar examples within the data, where it is called clusteringPattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Bishop, 2006)In supervised learning, scheme is being provided with actual outcome.So outcome is called class of the example. But in unsupervised learning, class of an example is not known.So unsupervised learning is that of trying to find hidden structure in unlabeled(unknown class) data set. Approaches to unsupervised learning include:Clustering(K-mean,hierarchical clustering)Association Rule LearningApproaches to supervised learning include:Classification(1R, Naive Bayes, Decision tree learning algorithm such\nas ID3 CART and so on)Numeric Value PredictionFor instance, very often training a neural network is supervised learning: you\'re telling the network to which class corresponds the feature vector you\'re feeding.Clustering is unsupervised learning: you let the algorithm decide how to group samples into classes that share common properties.Another example of unsupervised learning is Kohonen\'s self organizing maps.If you need to know the meaning of them so simply,I can tell you an example:\nas an example: you need to recognize which vehicle is car and which one is motorcycle?\nin supervised learning your input data should have label.It means that first you should assign that the vehicle which has 2 wheels and size is small is motorcycle.(In this case we give the information directly).\nBut in unsupervised learning, you don\'t label the inputs.you give some different inputs to machine and the machine cluster them by their similar features.  Short answer:Machine learning can be divided into two learning algorithms:Supervised Learning: You give variously labelled example data as input, along with the correct answers. This algorithm will learn from it, and start predicting correct results based on the inputs thereafter. Example: Email Spam filter Unsupervised Learning: You just give data and don\'t tell anything - like labels or correct answers. Algorithm automatically analyses patterns in the data. Example: Google NewsMachine learning: \nIt explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data.Such algorithms operate by building a model from example inputs in order to make data-driven predictions or decisions expressed as outputs,rather than following strictly static program instructions.Supervised learning: \nIt  is the machine learning task of inferring a function from labeled training data.The training data consist of a set of training examples. In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples.The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a "teacher", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.Specifically, a supervised learning algorithm takes a known set of input data and known responses to the data (output), and trains a model to generate reasonable predictions for the response to new data.Unsupervised learning: \nIt is learning without a teacher. One basic\nthing that you might want to do with data is to visualize it. It is the machine learning task of inferring a function to describe hidden structure from unlabeled data. Since the examples given to the learner are unlabeled, there is no error or reward signal to evaluate a potential solution. This distinguishes unsupervised learning from supervised learning. Unsupervised learning uses procedures that attempt to find natural partitions\nof patterns. With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results, i.e., there is no teacher to correct you.Under the Unsupervised learning methods no labeled examples are provided and there is no notion of the output during the learning process. As a result, it is up to the learning scheme/model to find patterns or discover the groups of the input dataYou should use unsupervised learning methods when you need a large\n  amount of data to train your models, and the willingness and ability\n  to experiment and explore, and of course a challenge that isn\xe2\x80\x99t well\n  solved via more-established methods.With unsupervised learning it is\n  possible to learn larger and more complex models than with supervised\n  learning.Here is a good example on it.I have always found the distinction between unsupervised and supervised learning to be arbitrary and a little confusing. There is no real distinction between the two cases, instead there is a range of situations in which an algorithm can have more or less \'supervision\'. The existence of semi-supervised learning is an obvious examples where the line is blurred.I tend to think of supervision as giving feedback to the algorithm about what solutions should be preferred. For a traditional supervised setting, such as spam detection, you tell the algorithm "don\'t make any mistakes on the training set"; for a traditional unsupervised setting, such as clustering, you tell the algorithm "points that are close to each other should be in the same cluster". It just so happens that, the first form of feedback is a lot more specific than the  latter.In short, when someone says \'supervised\', think classification, when they say \'unsupervised\' think clustering and try not to worry too much about it beyond that.Supervised learning, given the data with an answer.Given email labeled as spam/not spam, learn a spam filter.Given a dataset of patients diagnosed as either having diabetes or not, learn to classify new patients as having diabetes or not.Unsupervised learning, given the data without an answer, let the pc to group things.Given a set of news articles found on the web, group the into set of articles about the same story.Given a database of custom data, automatically discover market segments and group customers into different market segments.ReferenceSupervised Learning: \nIt is a machine learning task of inferring a function from labeled training data.Unsupervised Learning:\nIt is a machine learning task of inferring a function to describe hidden structure from "unlabeled" data (a classification or categorization is not included in the observations). In Supervised Learning we know what the input and output should be. For example , given a set of cars. We have to find out which ones red and which ones blue. Whereas, Unsupervised learning is where we have to find out the answer with a very little or without any idea about how the output should be. For example, a learner might be able to build a model that detects when people are smiling based on correlation of facial patterns and words such as "what are you smiling about?". Supervised learning can label a new item into one of the trained labels based on learning during training. You need to provide large numbers of training data set, validation data set and test data set. If you provide say pixel image vectors of digits along with training data with labels, then it can identify the numbers.  Unsupervised learning does not require training data-sets. In unsupervised learning it can group items into different clusters based on the difference in the input vectors. If you provide pixel image vectors of digits and ask it to classify into 10 categories, it may do that. But it does know how to labels it as you have not provided training labels.
