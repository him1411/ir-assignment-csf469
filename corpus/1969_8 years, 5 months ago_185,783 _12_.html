What is the syntax for specifying a primary key on more than 1 column in SQLITE ? According to the documentation, it\'sYes. But remember that such primary key allow NULL values in both columns multiple times.Create a table as such:Now this works without any warning:Basic :If your columns are foreign keys of other tables (common case) :Primary key fields should be declared as not null (this is non standard as the definition\nof a primary key is that it must be unique and not null). But below is a good practice for\nall multi-column primary keys in any DBMS.Since version 3.8.2 of SQLite, an alternative to explicit NOT NULL specifications is the "WITHOUT ROWID" specification: [1]"WITHOUT ROWID" tables have potential efficiency advantages, so a less verbose alternative to consider is:For example, at the sqlite3 prompt:\n\n  sqlite> insert into t values(1,null,3);\n  Error: NOT NULL constraint failed: t.c2\nIn another way, you can also make the two column primary key unique and the auto-increment key primary.
