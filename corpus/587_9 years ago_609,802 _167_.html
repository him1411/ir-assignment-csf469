Our investigations have shown us that not all browsers respect the http cache directives in a uniform manner.For security reasons we do not want certain pages in our application to be cached, ever, by the web browser. This must work for at least the following browsers:Our requirement came from a security test. After logging out from our website you could press the back button and view cached pages.The correct minimum set of headers that works across all mentioned clients (and proxies):The Cache-Control is per the HTTP 1.1 spec for clients and proxies (and implicitly required by some clients next to Expires). The Pragma is per the HTTP 1.0 spec for prehistoric clients. The Expires is per the HTTP 1.0 and 1.1 spec for clients and proxies. In HTTP 1.1, the Cache-Control takes precedence over Expires, so it\'s after all for HTTP 1.0 proxies only.If you don\'t care about IE6 and its broken caching when serving pages over HTTPS with only no-store, then you could omit Cache-Control: no-cache.If you don\'t care about IE6 nor HTTP 1.0 clients (HTTP 1.1 was introduced 1997), then you could omit Pragma.If you don\'t care about HTTP 1.0 proxies either, then you could omit Expires.On the other hand, if the server auto-includes a valid Date header, then you could theoretically omit Cache-Control too and rely on Expires only.But that may fail if e.g. the enduser manipulates the operating system date and the client software is relying on it.Other Cache-Control parameters such as max-age are irrelevant if the abovementioned Cache-Control parameters are specified. The Last-Modified header as included in most other answers here is only interesting if you actually want to cache the request, so you don\'t need to specify it at all.Using PHP:Using Java Servlet, or Node.js:Using ASP.NET-MVCUsing ASP.NET:Using ASP:Using Ruby on Rails, or Python on Flask:Using Google Go:Using Apache .htaccess file:Using HTML4:Using Python/Pyramid:Important to know is that when a HTML page is served over a HTTP connection, and a header is present in both the HTTP response headers and the HTML <meta http-equiv> tags, then the one specified in the HTTP response header will get precedence over the HTML meta tag. The HTML meta tag will only be used when the page is viewed from local disk file system via a file:// URL. See also W3 HTML spec chapter 5.2.2. Take care with this when you don\'t specify them programmatically, because the webserver can namely include some default values. Generally, you\'d better just not specify the HTML meta tags to avoid confusion by starters, and rely on hard HTTP response headers. Moreover, specifically those <meta http-equiv> tags are invalid in HTML5. Only the http-equiv values listed in HTML5 specification are allowed.To verify the one and other, you can see/debug them in HTTP traffic monitor of webbrowser\'s developer toolset. You can get there by pressing F12 in Chrome/Firefox23+/IE9+, and then opening the "Network" or "Net" tab panel, and then clicking the HTTP request of interest to uncover all detail about the HTTP request and response. The below screenshot is from Chrome:First of all, this question and answer is targeted on "web pages" (HTML pages), not "file downloads" (PDF, zip, Excel, etc). You\'d better have them cached and make use of some file version identifier somewhere in URI path or querystring to force a redownload on a changed file. When applying those no-cache headers on file downloads anyway, then beware of the IE7/8 bug when serving a file download over HTTPS instead of HTTP. For detail, see IE cannot download foo.jsf. IE was not able to open this internet site. The requested site is either unavailable or cannot be found.(hey, everyone: please don\'t just mindlessly copy&paste all headers you can find)First of all, Back button history is not a cache:The freshness model (Section 4.2) does not necessarily apply to history mechanisms. That is, a history mechanism can display a previous representation even if it has expired.In the old HTTP spec the wording was even stronger, explicitly telling browsers to disregard cache directives for back button history.Back is supposed to go back in time (to the time when the user was logged in). It does not navigate forward to a previously opened URL.However, in practice, the cache can influence the back button, in very specific circumstances:You never need any of:If you want, you could add:Bonus: The new HTTP caching RFC.As porneL stated, what you want is not to deactivate the cache, but to deactivate the history buffer. Different browsers have their own subtle ways to disable the history buffer.In Chrome (v28.0.1500.95 m) we can do this only by Cache-Control: no-store.In FireFox (v23.0.1) any one of these will work:Cache-Control: no-storeCache-Control: no-cache (https only)Pragma: no-cache (https only)Vary: * (https only)In Opera (v12.15) we only can do this by Cache-Control: must-revalidate (https only).In Safari (v5.1.7, 7534.57.2) any one of these will work:Cache-Control: no-store\n<body onunload=""> in htmlCache-Control: no-store (https only)In IE8 (v8.0.6001.18702IC) any one of these will work:Cache-Control: must-revalidate, max-age=0Cache-Control: no-cacheCache-Control: no-storeCache-Control: must-revalidate\nExpires: 0Cache-Control: must-revalidate\nExpires: Sat, 12 Oct 1991 05:00:00 GMTPragma: no-cache (https only)Vary: * (https only)Combining the above gives us this solution which works for Chrome 28, FireFox 23, IE8, Safari 5.1.7, and Opera 12.15: Cache-Control: no-store, must-revalidate (https only)Note that https is needed because Opera wouldn\'t deactivate history buffer for plain http pages. If you really can\'t get https and you are prepared to ignore Opera, the best you can do is this:Below shows the raw logs of my tests:HTTP:Cache-Control: private, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate,

In particular, I noticed that none of them would stop IE8 from using a cached version of the page when you accessed it by hitting the back button.After much research and testing, I found that the only two headers I really needed were:Cache-Control: no-store\n  Vary: *For an explanation of the Vary header, check out http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html#sec13.6On IE6-8, FF1.5-3.5, Chrome 2-3, Safari 4, and Opera 9-10, these headers caused the page to be requested from the server when you click on a link to the page, or put the URL directly in the address bar.  That covers about 99% of all browsers in use as of Jan \'10.On IE6, and Opera 9-10, hitting the back button still caused the cached version to be loaded.  On all other browsers I tested, they did fetch a fresh version from the server.  So far, I haven\'t found any set of headers that will cause those browsers to not return cached versions of pages when you hit the back button.Update:  After writing this answer, I realized that our web server is identifying itself as an HTTP 1.0 server.  The headers I\'ve listed are the correct ones in order for responses from an HTTP 1.0 server to not be cached by browsers.  For an HTTP 1.1 server, look at BalusC\'s answer.  After a bit of research we came up with the following list of headers that seemed to cover most browsers:In ASP.NET we added these using the following snippet:Found from: http://forums.asp.net/t/1013531.aspxI found the web.config route useful (tried to add it to the answer but doesn\'t seem to have been accepted so posting here)And here is the express / node.js way of doing the same:The use of the pragma header in the response is a wives tale. RFC2616 only defines it as a request headerhttp://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/#PRAGMADISCLAIMER:  I strongly suggest reading @BalusC\'s answer.  After reading the following caching tutorial: http://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/ (I recommend you read it, too), I believe it to be correct.  However, for historical reasons (and because I have tested it myself), I will include my original answer below:I tried the \'accepted\' answer for PHP, which did not work for me.  Then I did a little research, found a slight variant, tested it, and it worked.  Here it is:That should work.  The problem was that when setting the same part of the header twice, if the false is not sent as the second argument to the header function, header function will simply overwrite the previous header() call.  So, when setting the Cache-Control, for example if one does not want to put all the arguments in one header() function call, he must do something like this:See more complete documentation here.There\'s a bug in IE6Content with "Content-Encoding: gzip" is always cached even if you use "Cache-Control: no-cache".http://support.microsoft.com/kb/321722You can disable gzip compression for IE6 users (check the user agent for "MSIE 6")The RFC for HTTP 1.1 says the proper method is to add an HTTP Header for:Cache-Control: no-cacheOlder browsers may ignore this if they are not properly compliant to HTTP 1.1. For those you can try the header:Pragma: no-cacheThis is also supposed to work for HTTP 1.1 browsers.These directives does not mitigate any security risk. They are really intended to force UA\'s to refresh volatile information, not keep UA\'s from being retaining information. See this similar question. At the very least, there is no guarantee that any routers, proxies, etc. will not ignore the caching directives as well.On a more positive note, policies regarding physical access to computers, software installation, and the like will put you miles ahead of most firms in terms of security. If the consumers of this information are members of the public, the only thing you can really do is help them understand that once the information hits their machine, that machine is their responsibility, not yours.The PHP documentation for the header function has a rather complete example (contributed by a third party):If you\'re facing download problems with IE6-IE8 over SSL and cache:no-cache header (and similar values) with MS Office files you can use cache:private,no-store header and return file on POST request. It works.  in my case i fix the problem in chrome with thiswhere i need to clear the content of a previus form data when the users click button back for security reasonsI\'ve had best and most consistent results across all browsers by setting \n    Pragma: no-cacheSetting the modified http header to some date in 1995 usually does the trick.Here\'s an example:The headers in the answer provided by BalusC does not prevent Safari 5 (and possibly older versions as well) from displaying content from the browser cache when using the browser\'s back button. A way to prevent this is to add an empty onunload event handler attribute to the body tag:This hack apparently breaks the back-forward cache in Safari: Is there a cross-browser onload event when clicking the back button?The accepted answer does not appear to work for IIS7+, going by the large number of questions about cache headers not being sent in II7:And so onThe accepted answer is correct in which headers must be set, but not in how they must be set.  This way works with IIS7:The first line sets Cache-control to no-cache, and the second line adds the other attributes no-store, must-revalidateFor ASP.NET Core, create a simple middleware class:then register it with Startup.csMake sure you add this somewhere afterIn addition to the headers consider serving your page via https.  Many browsers will not cache https by default.To complete BalusC -> ANSWER\nIf you are using perl you can use CGI to add HTTP headers.Using Perl:Using apache httpd.conf\n\nNote: When I tried to use the html META, browsers ignored them and cached the page.I just want to point out that if someone wants to prevent caching ONLY dynamic content, adding those additional headers should be made programmatically.I edited configuration file of my project to append no-cache headers, but that also disabled caching static content, which isn\'t usually desirable.\nModifying response headers in code assures that images and style files will be cached.This is quite obvious, yet still worth mentioning.And another caution. Be careful using ClearHeaders method from HttpResponse class. It may give you some bruises if you use it recklessly. Like it gave me. After redirecting on ActionFilterAttribute event the consequences of clearing all headers are losing all session data and data in TempData storage. It\'s safer to redirect from an Action or don\'t clear headers when redirection is taking place.On second thought I discourage all to use ClearHeaders method. It\'s better to remove headers separately. And to set Cache-Control header properly I\'m using this code:See this link to a Case Study on Caching:http://securityevaluators.com/knowledge/case_studies/caching/Summary, according to the article, only \'Cache-Control: no-store\' works on Chrome, Firefox and IE.  IE accepts other controls, but Chrome and Firefox do not.  The link is a good read complete with the history of caching and documenting proof of concept.I had no luck with <head><meta> elements. Adding HTTP cache related parameters directly (outside of the HTML doc) does indeed work for me.Sample code in Python using web.py web.header calls follows. I purposefully redacted my personal irrelevant utility code.Also, just for good measure, make sure you reset the ExpiresDefault in your .htaccess file if you\'re using that to enable caching.Afterwards, you can use ExpiresByType to set specific values for the files you want to cache:This may also come in handy if your dynamic files e.g. php, etc. are being cached by the browser, and you can\'t figure out why. Check ExpiresDefault.
