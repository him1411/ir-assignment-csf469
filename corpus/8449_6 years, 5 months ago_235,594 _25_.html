What are all the common ways to read a file in Ruby?For instance, here is one method:I know Ruby is extremely flexible. What are the benefits/drawbacks of each approach?It is also possible to explicitly close file after as above (pass a block to open closes it for you):The easiest way if the file isn\'t too long is:Indeed, IO.read or File.read automatically close the file, so there is no need to use File.open with a block.Be wary of "slurping" files. That\'s when you read the entire file into memory at once. The problem is that it doesn\'t scale well. You could be developing code with a reasonably sized file, then put it into production and suddenly find you\'re trying to read files measuring in gigabytes, and your host is freezing up as it tries to read and allocate memory. Line-by-line I/O is very fast, and almost always as effective as slurping. It\'s surprisingly fast actually.I like to use:orFile inherits from IO, and foreach is in IO, so you can use either.I have some benchmarks showing the impact of trying to read big files via read vs. line-by-line I/O at "Why is "slurping" a file not a good practice?".You can read the file all at once:When the file is large, or may be large, it is usually better to process it line-by-line:Sometimes you want access to the file handle though or control the reads yourself:In case of binary files, you may specify a nil-separator and a block size, like so:Finally you can do it without a block, for example when processing multiple files simultaneously. In that case the file must be explicitly closed (improved as per comment of @antinome):References: File API and the IO API.One simple method is to use readlines:Each line in the input file will be an entry in the array.  The method handles opening and closing the file for you.I usually do this:This will give you the whole text as a string object. It works only under Ruby 1.9.http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/IO.html#method-c-readreturn last n lines from your_file.log or .txt
