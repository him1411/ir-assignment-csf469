In Java 8 methods can be created as Lambda expressions and can be passed by reference (with a little work under the hood). There are plenty of examples online with lambdas being created and used with methods, but no examples of how to make a method taking a lambda as a parameter. What is the syntax for that?Lambdas are purely a call-site construct: the recipient of the lambda does not need to know that a Lambda is involved, instead it accepts an Interface with the appropriate method.In other words, you define or use a functional interface (i.e. an interface with a single method) that accepts and returns exactly what you want.For this Java 8 comes with a set of commonly-used interface types in java.util.function (thanks to Maurice Naftalin for the hint about the JavaDoc).For this specific use case there\'s java.util.function.IntBinaryOperator with a single int applyAsInt(int left, int right) method, so you could write your method like this:But you can just as well define your own interface and use it like this:Using your own interface has the advantage that you can have names that more clearly indicate the intent.To use Lambda expression you need to either create your own functional interface or use Java functional interface for operation that require two integer and return as value. IntBinaryOperatorUsing user defined functional interfaceUsing Java functional interfaceOther example I have created is hereFor functions that do not have more than 2 parameters, you can pass them without defining your own interface. For example,In BiFunction<Integer, String, List<String>>, Integer and String are its parameters, and List<String> is its return type. For a function with only one parameter, you can use Function<T, R>, where T is its parameter type, and R is its return value type.  Refer to this page for all the interfaces that are already made available by Java.   There\'s a public Web-accessible version of the Lambda-enabled Java 8 JavaDocs, linked from http://lambdafaq.org/lambda-resources.  (This should obviously be a comment on Joachim Sauer\'s answer, but I can\'t get into my SO account with the reputation points I need to add a comment.)  The lambdafaq site (I maintain it) answers this and a lot of other Java-lambda questions.Lambda expression can be passed as a argument.To pass a lambda expression as an argument the type of the parameter (which receives the lambda expression as an argument) must be of functional interface type.If there is a functional interface - And there is a filter method which adds the int in the list only if it is greater than 5. Note here that filter method has funtional interface IMyFunc as one of the parameter. In that case lambda expression can be passed as an argument for the method parameter.There is flexibility in using lambda as parameter. It enables functional programming in java. The basic syntax is param -> method_bodyFollowing is a way, you can define a method taking functional interface (lambda is used) as parameter.\na. if you wish to define a method declared inside a functional interface, \nsay, the functional interface is given as an argument/parameter to a method called from main()FInterface fi = (x) -> { return 0; };funcUsesAnonymousOrLambda(fi);Here above it can be seen, how a lambda expression can be replaced with an interface.Above explains a particular usage of lambda expression, there are more.\nref\nJava 8 lambda within a lambda can't modify variable from outer lambda
