I tried to use ng-model on input tag with type file:But after selecting a file, in controller, $scope.vm.uploadme is still undefined.How do I get the selected file in my controller?I created a workaround with directive:And the input tag becomes:Or if just the file definition is needed:I use this directive:and invoke it like this:The property (editItem.editItem._attachments_uri.image) will be populated with the contents of the file you select as a data-uri (!).Please do note that this script will not upload anything. It will only populate your model with the contents of your file encoded ad a data-uri (base64).Check out a working demo here:\nhttp://plnkr.co/CMiHKv2BEidM9SShm9VvThis is an addendum to @endy-tjahjono\'s solution. I ended up not being able to get the value of uploadme from the scope. Even though uploadme in the HTML was visibly updated by the directive, I could still not access its value by $scope.uploadme. I was able to set its value from the scope, though. Mysterious, right..?As it turned out, a child scope was created by the directive, and the child scope had its own uploadme. The solution was to use an object rather than a primitive to hold the value of uploadme.In the controller I have: and in the HTML:There are no changes to the directive. Now, it all works like expected. I can grab the value of uploadme.src from my controller using $scope.uploadme.Hi guys i create a directive and registered on bower.this lib will help you modeling input file, not only return file data but also file dataurl or base 64.https://github.com/mistralworks/ng-file-model/Hope will help youThis is a slightly modified version that lets you specify the name of the attribute in the scope, just as you would do with ng-model, usage: Directive:This directive enables <input type=file> to automatically work with the ng-change and ng-form directives.For multiple files input using lodash or underscore:I had to do same on multiple input, so i updated @Endy Tjahjono method.\nIt returns an array containing all readed files.I had to modify Endy\'s directive so that I can get Last Modified, lastModifiedDate, name, size, type, and data as well as be able to get an array of files. For those of you that needed these extra features, here you go.UPDATE:\nI found a bug where if you select the file(s) and then go to select again but cancel instead, the files are never deselected like it appears. So I updated my code to fix that.
