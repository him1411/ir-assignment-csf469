Output:I assume this unexpected result is from printing the unsigned long long int. How do you printf() an unsigned long long int?Use the ll (el-el) long-long modifier with the u (unsigned) conversion. (Works in windows, GNU).You may want to try using the inttypes.h library that gives you types such as\nint32_t, int64_t, uint64_t etc.\nYou can then use its macros such as:This is "guaranteed" to not give you the same trouble as long, unsigned long long etc, since you don\'t have to guess how many bits are in each data type.For long long (or __int64) using MSVS, you should use %I64d:That is because %llu doesn\'t work properly under Windows and %d can\'t handle 64 bit integers. I suggest using PRIu64 instead and you\'ll find it\'s portable to Linux as well.Try this instead:Output%d--> for int%ld--> for long int%lld--> for long long int%llu--> for unsigned long long intCompile it as x64 with VS2005:%llu works well.In Linux it is %llu and in Windows it is %I64uAlthough I have found it doesn\'t work in Windows 2000, there seems to be a bug there!Non-standard things are always strange :)for the long long portion\nunder GNU it\'s L, ll or qand under windows I believe it\'s ll onlyHex:Output:In addition to what people wrote years ago:main.c:30:3: warning: unknown conversion type character \'l\' in format [-Wformat=]printf("%llu\\n", k);Then your version of mingw does not default to c99. Add this compiler flag: -std=c99.Well, one way is to compile it as x64 with VS2008This runs as you would expect:For 32 bit code, we need to use the correct __int64 format specifier %I64u. So it becomes. This code works for both 32 and 64 bit VS compiler.
