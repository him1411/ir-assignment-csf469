In R, how do you test a vector to see if it contains a given element?Both the match() (returns the first appearance) and %in% (returns a Boolean) functions are designed for this.is.element() makes for more readable code, and is identical to %in%The any() function makes for readable codeYou can use the %in% operator:Also to find the position of the element "which" can be used asand to find the elements which are not contained in the target vector, one may do this:I really like grep() and grepl() for this purpose.grep() returns a vector of integers, which indicate where matches are.grepl() returns a logical vector, with "TRUE" at the location of matches.These functions are case-sensitive.I will group the options based on output. Assume the following vector for all the examples.For checking presence:%in%any()is.element()For finding first occurance:match()For finding all occurances as vector of indices:which()For finding all occurances as logical vector:==Edit:\nRemoving grep() and grepl() from the list for reason mentioned in comments
