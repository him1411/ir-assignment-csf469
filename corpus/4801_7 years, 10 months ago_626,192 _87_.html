How to create an empty file at the DOS/Windows command-line?I tried:but it always displays that a file was copied.Is there any other method in the standard cmd?It should be a method that does not require the touch command from Cygwin or any other nonstandard commands.\nThe command needs to run from a script so keystrokes cannot be used.Without redirection, Luc Vu or Erik Konstantopoulos point out to:"How to create empty text file from a batch file?" (2008) also points to:Nomad mentions an original one:In the same spirit, Samuel suggests in the comments:the shortest one I use is basically the one by Nomad: It does give an error: But this error is on stderr. And > only redirects stdout, where nothing have been produced.\nHence the creation of an empty file. The error message can be disregarded here.(Original answer, November 2009)(echo "" would actually put "" in the file! And echo without the \'.\' would put "Command ECHO activated" in the file...)Note: the resulting file is not empty but includes a return line sequence: 2 bytes.This discussion points to a true batch solution for a real empty file:The "<nul" pipes a nul response to the set/p command, which will cause the\n  variable used to remain unchanged. As usual with set/p, the string to the\n  right of the equal sign is displayed as a prompt with no CRLF. Since here the "string to the right of the equal sign" is empty... the result is an empty file.The difference with cd. > filename (which is mentioned in Patrick Cuff\'s answer and does also produce a 0-byte-length file) is that this "bit of redirection" (the <nul... trick) can be used to echo lines without any CR:The dir command should indicate the file size as 12 bytes: "hello world!". Try this:this will definitely create an empty file.If you really want a totally empty file, without any output to stdout, you can cheat a little:Just redirect stdout to nul, and the output from copy disappears.Here\'s another way:Reading comments on my post, I have to admit I didn\'t read the question right.On the Windows command-line, one way would be to use fsutil:An example: Below is for *nix command-line.This command changes your modified date of a file or creates it if file is not found.Open file  : New file : Edit  content: CopyRename Delete file : I believe this works on Windows/DOS, but my last hands-on experience with either is quite a while ago. I do know for a fact that it works on basically any POSIX compliant OS.this is the cleanest way I know.You can write your own touch.copy con SomeFile.txt EnterCtrl-Z EnterTry this :abc > myFile.txt\nFirst, it will create a file with name myFile.txt in present working directory (in command prompt). Then it will run the command abc which is not a valid command. In this way, you have gotten a new empty file with the name myFile.txt.Yet another method that creates a zero byte file:You could also use:The debug output for echo. will almost definitely be empty.type nul>filename will create a new empty file.UPDATE: Also copy nul filename works without redirecting (more obvious solution).I read many threads but it is not the shortest way.Please use command:>copy /b NUL  empty_file.txtToday I\'ve discovered a new one :)This will change the command line window title, but will also create a empty file.This worked for me,Here\'s another way I found today, got ideas from other answers but it workedEg.This would show an error message in the command prompt that ,xyz is not as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.But the weird thing I found was the file is being created in the directory even if the command is not a standard windows command.All!Yet another way:copy nul 2>empty_file.txtBest regards.Just I have tried in windowsthen Press Enter Key then Press Ctrl+Z EnterAnd its worked for me.  For Ubuntu usually I am creating a file using VI commandIt will open the file then press ESC key  then type :wp then press enter key. It will create a new file with empty data.First create your file so that it exists:Then overwrite the created file with an empty version using the copy command:echo. suppress the "Command ECHO activated"|set /p= prevent newline (and file is now 0 byte)you can use this command will create the file and open it for you in notepadyou can use notepad alsoit will ask you to create a new file if it doesn\'t exist. tested on windows 7.I made a command for this purpose called "touch" or "newfile".Syntax:\nFor touch touch %file name and path%\nFor newfile newfile %file name and path%You can download it here: wcbxmc.cf/misc/NewFile.zip\n1. Unzip it\n2. Run the "[[[[[ Install Commands ]]]]]" file as admin\n3. Open cmd and try the commandsRun CMD in admistrator mode and type this:or you type thisHere is yet another way:The slash / is mandatory; without it the redirection part was commented out by rem.echo > file.txtWorks on unix and dosSimply you can type:Very important NOTE: \nYou can use this command only on cmder or Mac OS.
