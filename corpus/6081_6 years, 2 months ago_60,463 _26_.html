In Bash, what are the differences between single quotes (\'\') and double quotes ("")?Single quotes won\'t interpolate anything, but double quotes will (for example variables, backticks, certain \\ escapes, etc...)The Bash manual has this to say:3.1.2.2 Single QuotesEnclosing characters in single quotes (\') preserves the literal value of each character within the quotes. A single quote may not occur between single quotes, even when preceded by a backslash. 3.1.2.3 Double QuotesEnclosing characters in double quotes (") preserves the literal value of all characters within the quotes, with the exception of $, `, \\, and, when history expansion is enabled, !. The characters $ and ` retain their special meaning within double quotes (see Shell Expansions). The backslash retains its special meaning only when followed by one of the following characters: $, `, ", \\, or newline. Within double quotes, backslashes that are followed by one of these characters are removed. Backslashes preceding characters without a special meaning are left unmodified. A double quote may be quoted within double quotes by preceding it with a backslash. If enabled, history expansion will be performed unless an ! appearing in double quotes is escaped using a backslash. The backslash preceding the ! is not removed.The special parameters * and @ have special meaning when in double quotes (see Shell Parameter Expansion). If you\'re referring to what happens when you echo something, the single quotes will literally echo what you have between them, while the double quotes will evaluate variables between them and output the value of the variable.For example, thiswill give this:The accepted answer is great. I am making a table that helps in quick comprehension of the topic.  The explanation involves a simple variable a as well as an indexed array arr.If we setand then echo the expression in the second column, we would get the result / behavior shown in the third column.  The fourth column explains the behavior.See also:test="This is double quote"echo $testOutput> This is double quotetest1=\'This Is single quote\'echo $test1Output> This is single quotetest="This is double quote"echo "$test"echo \'$test\'Output> This is double quoteoutput> $test
