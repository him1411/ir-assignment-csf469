I created some custom elements, and I want to programmatically place them to the upper right corner (n pixels from the top edge and m pixels from the right edge). Therefore I need to get the screen width and screen height and then set position:How do I get screenWidth and screenHeight in the main Activity?If you want the display dimensions in pixels you can use getSize:If you\'re not in an Activity you can get the default Display via WINDOW_SERVICE:Before getSize was introduced (in API level 13), you could use the getWidth and getHeight methods that are now deprecated:For the use case you\'re describing however, a margin/padding in the layout seems more appropriate.22 October 2015Another ways is: DisplayMetricsA structure describing general information about a display, such as its size, density, and font scaling. To access the DisplayMetrics members, initialize an object like this:We can use widthPixels to get information for: "The absolute width of the display in pixels."Example:One way is:It is deprecated, and you should try the following code instead. The first two lines of code gives you the DisplayMetrics objecs. This objects contains the fields like heightPixels,widthPixels.It may not answer your question, but it could be useful to know (I was looking for it myself when I came to this question) that if you need a View\'s dimension but your code is being executed when its layout has not been laid out yet (for example in onCreate() ) you can setup a ViewTreeObserver.OnGlobalLayoutListener with View.getViewTreeObserver().addOnGlobalLayoutListener() and put the relevant code that needs the view\'s dimension there. The listener\'s callback will be called when the layout will have been laid out.(2012 answer, may be out of date) If you want to support pre Honeycomb, you will need to put in backward compatibility prior to API 13. Something like:Of course the deprecated methods will eventually be taken out of the the most recent SDKs, but while we still rely on most of our users having Android 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, this is what we are left with.I have tried all possible "solutions" unsuccessfully and I noticed that Elliott Hughes\' "Dalvik Explorer" app always shows correct dimension on any Android device/OS version. I ended up looking at his open source project that can be found here: https://code.google.com/p/enh/Here\'s all the relevant code:EDIT: slightly improved version (avoid firing exceptions on non-supported OS version):For accessing the height of the status bar for Android devices, we prefer a programmatic way to get it:The variable result gives the height in the pixel.For more information about height of Title bar, Navigation bar and Content View, kindly look on Android Device Screen Sizes.Simplest way:   First get view (eg. by findViewById()) and then you can use getWidth() on the view itself.I have two functions, one for sending the context and the other getting height and width in pixels:andFor dynamically scaling using XML there is an attribute called "android:layout_weight" The below example, modified from synic\'s response on this thread, shows a button that takes up 75% of the screen (weight = .25) and a text view taking up the remaining 25% of the screen (weight = .75).This is the code I use for the task:Seems clean enough and yet, takes care of the deprecation.Isn\'t this a much better solution? DisplayMetrics comes with everything you need and works from API 1.You can also get the actual display (including screen decors, such as Status Bar or software navigation bar) using getRealMetrics, but this works on 17+ only.Am I missing something?Just adding to Francesco\'s answer. The other observer that is more apt, if you want to find out the location in window or location in screen is\nViewTreeObserver.OnPreDrawListener()This also can be used to find other attributes of a view that is mostly unknown at onCreate() time e.g. the scrolled position, the scaled position.Find width and height of the screen:Using this, we can get the latest and above SDK 13.Using the following code in Activity.Need to say, that if you are not in Activity, but in View (or have variable of View type in your scope), there is not need to use WINDOW_SERVICE. Then you can use at least two ways.First:Second:All this methods we call here is not deprecated.I found this did the trick.This is not an answer for the OP, as he wanted the display dimensions in real pixels. I wanted the dimensions in "device-independent-pixels", and putting together answers from here https://stackoverflow.com/a/17880012/253938 and here https://stackoverflow.com/a/6656774/253938 I came up with this:There is a non-deprecated way to do this using DisplayMetrics (API 1), that avoids the try/catch messiness:I would wrap the getSize code like this:First load the XML file and then write this code:Show width and height according your screen resolution.Follow the methods below:There are times when you need to know the precise dimensions of the available space for a layout when in an activity\'s onCreate.\nAfter some thought I worked out this way of doing it.If for some reason you don\'t want to add another activity to the Android manifest, you can do it this way:If you don\'t want the overhead of WindowManagers, Points, or Displays, you can grab the height and width attributes of the topmost View item in your XML, provided its height and width are set to match_parent. (This is true so long as your layout takes up the entire screen.)For example, if your XML starts with something like this:Then findViewById(R.id.entireLayout).getWidth() will return the screen\'s width and findViewById(R.id.entireLayout).getHeight() will return the screen\'s height.For who is searching for usable screen dimension without Status Bar and Action Bar (also thanks to Swapnil\'s answer):I have a splash screen activity with a LinearLayout as a root view that has match_parent for its width & height. This is the code in the onCreate() method of that activity. I use these measures in all other activities of the app.Here are the implementations for the methods you see get called above:This results in the height and width of the usable display, excluding any type of bars (status bar, navigation bar), for all API versions and different types of devices (phones and tablets).Simple function compatible with lower versions as well.To use:Above answer won\'t work if the Display class will not work then you can get the width and height by below method.
