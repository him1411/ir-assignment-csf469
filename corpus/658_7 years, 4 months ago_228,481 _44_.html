I have deleted a file or some code in a file sometime in the past. Can I grep in the content (not in the commit messages)?A very poor solution is to grep the log:However this doesn\'t return the commit hash straight away. I played around with git grep to no avail.To search for commit content (i.e., actual lines of source, as opposed to commit messages and the like), what you need to do is:Updates: git rev-list --all | xargs git grep expression will work if you run into an "Argument list too long" errorIf you want to limit the search to some subtree (for instance "lib/util") you will need to pass that to the rev-list subcommand and grep as well:This will grep through all your commit text for regexp.The reason for passing the path in both commands is because rev-list will return the revisions list where all the changes to lib/util happened, but also you need to pass to grep so that it will only search on lib/util.Just imagine the following scenario: grep might find the same <regexp> on other files which are contained in the same revision returned by rev-list (even if there was no change to that file on that revision).Here are some other useful ways of searching your source:Search working tree for text matching regular expression regexp:Search working tree for lines of text matching regular expression regexp1 or regexp2:Search working tree for lines of text matching regular expression regexp1 and regexp2, reporting file paths only:Search working tree for files that have lines of text matching regular expression regexp1 and lines of text matching regular expression regexp2:Search all revisions for text matching regular expression regexp:Search all revisions between rev1 and rev2 for text matching regular expression regexp:You should use the pickaxe (-S) option of git logTo search for Foo:See Git history - find lost line by keyword for more.As Jakub Nar\xc4\x99bski comments:this looks for differences that introduce or remove an instance of <string>.\nIt usually means "revisions where you added or removed line with \'Foo\'".the --pickaxe-regex option allows you to use extended POSIX regex instead of searching for a string.My favorite way to do it is with git log\'s -G option (added in version 1.7.4).There is a subtle difference between the way the -G and -S options determine if a commit matches:Take this commit as an example:Because the number of times "hello" appears in the file is the same before and after this commit, it will not match using -Shello. However, since there was a change to a line matching hello, the commit will be shown using -Ghello.If you want to browse code changes (see what actually has been changed with the given word in the whole history) go for patch mode - I found a very useful combination of doing:I took @Jeet\'s answer and adpated it to Windows (thanks to this answer):Note that for me, for some reason, the actual commit that deleted this regex did not appear in the output of the command, but rather one commit prior to it.Search in any revision, any files:Search only in some given files, for example xml files:The result lines should look like this:\n6988bec26b1503d45eb0b2e8a4364afb87dde7af:bla.xml: text of the line it found...You can then get more information like author, date, diff using git show:For anyone else trying to do this in SourceTree, there is no direct command in the UI for it (as of version 1.6.21.0). However you can use the commands specified in the accepted answer by opening Terminal window (button available in the main toolbar) and copy/pasting them therein.Note: SourceTree\'s Search view can partially do text searching for you. Press Ctrl + 3 to go to Search view (or click Search tab available at the bottom). From far right, set Search type to File Changes and then type the string you want to search. This method has the following limitations compared to the above command:git log can be a more effective way of searching for text across all branches, especially if there are many matches, and you want to see more recent (relevant) changes first.These log commands list commits that add or remove the given search string/regex, (generally) more recent first. The -p option causes the relevant diff to be shown where the pattern was added or removed, so you can see it in context.Having found a relevant commit that adds the text you were looking for (eg. 8beeff00d), find the branches that contain the commit:So are you trying to grep through older versions of the code looking to see where something last exists?If I were doing this, I would probably use git bisect.  Using bisect, you can specify a known good version, a known bad version, and a simple script that does a check to see if the version is good or bad (in this case a grep to see if the code you are looking for is present).  Running this will find when the code was removed.@Jeet\'s answer works in PowerShell.The following displays all files, in any commit, that contain a password.In my case I needed to search a Short Commit and the listed solutions were unfortunately not working.I managed to do it with: (replace the REGEX token)
