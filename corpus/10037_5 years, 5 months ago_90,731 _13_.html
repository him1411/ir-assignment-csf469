Is it possible to configure ssh to know what my username should be?\nBy default it uses the current user-name, which is not correct in my case.I\'m on a loaner laptop, and my username is loaner, but I want to tell ssh that my username is buck.Bonus points: my username at home is bgolemon. If I could configure username per-host that would be even better.Create a file called config inside ~/.ssh inside the file\nyou can add:or addThe second example will set a username and is Hostname specific while the first example sets a username only. And when you use the second one you don\'t need to use ssh example.net, ssh example will be enough.If you only want to ssh a few times, such as on a borrowed or shared computer, try: orman ssh_config saysUser    Specifies the user to log in as.  This can be useful when a\n  different user name is used on different machines.  This saves the\n               trouble of having to remember to give the user name on the command line.There is a ruby gem that interfaces your ssh config file which is called sshez.All you have to do is sshez <alias> username@example.com -p <port-number> then you can connect using ssh <alias>. It is also useful since you can list your aliases using sshez list and easily remove them using sshez remove alias
