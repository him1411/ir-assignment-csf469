I have a simple class written in Android Studio:and from this I get the following compile time error:Cannot resolve symbol HttpClientIsn\'t HttpClient included in the Android Studio SDK? Even if it is not, I added it to my Gradle build like this:With or without the last compile line, the error is the same. What am I missing?HttpClient is not supported any more in sdk 23. You have to use URLConnection or downgrade to sdk 22 (compile \'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:22.2.0\')If you need sdk 23, add this to your gradle:You also may try to download and include HttpClient jar directly into your project or use OkHttp insteadHttpClient was deprecated in API Level 22 and removed in API Level 23. You can still use it in API Level 23 and onwards if you must, however it is best to move to supported methods to handle HTTP. So, if you\'re compiling with 23, add this in your build.gradle:TejaDroid\'s answer in below link helped me .  Can't import org.apache.http.HttpResponse in Android StudioTo use Apache HTTP for SDK Level 23:Top level build.gradle - /build.gradleNotification from Android studio about gradle update:Module specific build.gradle - /app/build.gradleTry this\nworked for me\nAdd this dependency to your build.gradle File1- download Apache jar files (as of this answer) 4.5.zip file from:\nhttps://hc.apache.org/downloads.cgi?Preferred=http%3A%2F%2Fapache.arvixe.com%2F2- open the zip copy the jar files into your libs folder. You can find it if you go to the top of your project where it says "Android" you\'ll find a list when u click it. So, Android -> Project -> app -> libs,Then put jars there.3- In build.grale (Mudule: app) addin4- In the java class add these imports:HttpClient is not supported any more in sdk 23. Android 6.0 (API Level 23) release removes support for the Apache HTTP client.\nYou have to use and also add below code snippet in your dependency : //http final solution for web-service (including file uploading)It will also help you while you use Use MultipartEntity for File upload.in API 22 they become deprecated and in API 23 they removed them completely, a simple workaround if you don\'t need all the fancy stuff from the new additions is to simply use the .jar files from apache that were integrated before API 22, but as separated .jar files:ApacheHttp Client is removed in v23 sdk. You can use HttpURLConnection  or third party Http Client like OkHttp.ref : https://developer.android.com/preview/behavior-changes.html#behavior-apache-http-clientAndroid 6.0 (API Level 23) release removes support for the Apache HTTP client. Hence you can not use this library directly in API 23. But there is a way to use it. Add useLibrary \xe2\x80\x98org.apache.http.legacy\xe2\x80\x99 in your build.gradle file as below-If this does not work you may apply the following hack-\xe2\x80\x93 Copy org.apache.http.legacy.jar which is in /platforms/android-23/optional path of your Android SDK directory to your project\xe2\x80\x99s app/libs folder.\xe2\x80\x93 Now Add compile files(\xe2\x80\x98libs/org.apache.http.legacy.jar\xe2\x80\x99) inside dependencies{} section of build.gradle file.You can simply add this to Gradle dependencies:Simply use this :-HttpClient is not supported in sdk 23 and 23+.If you need to use into sdk 23, add below code to your gradle:Its working for me. Hope useful for you.Which API target do you have within your project?AndroidHttpClientis only for API Level 8 <.\nand please have a look on hereenjoy your code:)If you need sdk 23, add this to your gradle:Another way is if you have httpclient.jar file then you can do\n  this :Paste your .jar file in "libs folder" in your project. Then in gradle add this line in your build.gradle(Module:app)You have to add just one lineinto build.gradle(Module: app), for exampleAdd these two lines under dependenciesthen under the androidAs mentioned before, org.apache.http.client.HttpClient is not supported any more in:SDK (API level) #23. You have to use java.net.HttpURLConnection.If you want to make your code (and life) easier when using HttpURLConnection, here is a Wrapper of this class that will let you do simple operations with GET, POST and PUT using JSON, like for example, doing a HTTP PUT.Feel free to use it.Error:(30, 0) Gradle DSL method not found: \'classpath()\'\nPossible causes:I think depending on which Android Studio version you have, it\'s important you update your android studio as well, i was becoming frustrated too following everyone\'s advice but no luck, until i had to upgrade my android version from 1.3 to 1.5, the errors disappeared like magic.
