I\'ve recently started using c# moving over from Java. I can\'t seem to find how to get a list item by index. In java to get the first item of the list it would be:What is the equivalent in c#?Assuming list\'s type has an indexer defined.You can use the ElementAt extension method on the list.For example://Get the first item from the list//Do something with firstItemVisual Basic, C#, and C++ all have syntax for accessing the Item property without using its name. Instead, the variable containing the List is used as if it were an array.See for instance:\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0ebtbkkc(v=vs.110).aspxOld question, but I see that this thread was fairly recently active, so I\'ll go ahead and throw in my two cents:   Pretty much exactly what Mitch said. Assuming proper indexing, you can just go ahead and use square bracket notation as if you were accessing an array. In addition to using the numeric index, though, if your members have specific names, you can often do kind of a simultaneous search/access by typing something like:The more you know, right?
