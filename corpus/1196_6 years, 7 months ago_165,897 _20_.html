I have an existing Rails app on GitHub and deployed on Heroku. I\'m trying to set up a new development machine and have cloned the project from my GitHub repository. However, I\'m confused as to how to link this folder up to Heroku. Originally, I used the heroku create command, but obviously I don\'t want to do that this time since it will create another Heroku instance.Heroku links your projects based on the heroku git remote (and a few other options, see the update below). To add your Heroku remote as a remote in your current repository, use the following command:where project is the name of your Heroku project (the same as the project.heroku.com subdomain). Once you\'ve done so, you can use the heroku xxxx commands (assuming you have the Heroku Toolbelt installed), and can push to Heroku as usual via git push heroku master. As a shortcut, if you\'re using the command line tool, you can type:where, again, project is the name of your Heroku project (thanks, Colonel Panic). You can name the Git remote anything you want by passing -r remote_name.[Update]As mentioned by Ben in the comments, the remote doesn\'t need to be named heroku for the gem commands to work. I checked the source, and it appears it works like this:The Heroku CLI has an easy shortcut for this. For an app named \'falling-wind-1624\':See https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git#creating-a-heroku-remoteDon\'t forget, if you are also on a machine where you haven\'t set up heroku beforeOr you won\'t be able to push or pull to the repo.Use heroku\'s forkUse the new "heroku fork" command! It will copy all the environment and you have to update the github repo after! Clone it local Make a new repo on github and add itPush on githubYou should probable start ssh-agent and add your keys.
