I am a bit confused between these 2 selectors.  Does the descendent selector:select all p within a div whether or not it\'s an immediate descedent?  So if the p is inside another div it will still be selected?Then the child selector:Whats the difference?  Does a child mean immediate child?  Eg.vswill both be selected, or not?Just think of what the words "child" and "descendant" mean in English:Yes, you are correct. div p will match the following example, but div > p will not.The first one is called descendant selector and the second one is called child selector.Bascailly, "a b" selects all b\'s inside a, while "a>b" selects b\'s what are only children to the a, it will not select b what is child of b what is child of a.This example illustrates the difference:Background color of abc and def will be green, but ghi will have red background color.IMPORTANT: If you change order of the rules to:All letters will have red background, because descendant selector selects child\'s too.Be aware that the child selector is not supported in Internet Explorer 6.\n(If you use the selector in a jQuery/Prototype/YUI etc selector rather than in a style sheet it still works though)Selects all \'p\' elements where the parent is a \'div\' elementIt means immediate children\nSelects all \'p\' elements where the parent is a \'div\' elementIn theory: \nChild => an immediate descendant of an ancestor (e.g. Joe and his father)Descendant => any element that is descended from a particular ancestor (e.g. Joe and his great-great-grand-father)In practice: try this HTML:with this CSS:http://jsfiddle.net/X343c/1/CSS selection and applying style to a particular element can be done through traversing through the dom element\n[ExampleExample
