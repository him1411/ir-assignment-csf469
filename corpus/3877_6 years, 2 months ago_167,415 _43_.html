I have come across a number of mentions of MultiMarkdown\'s support for internal links / named anchors but I am unable to find a single example of how to actually do it. So, what is the syntax for denoting the named anchor, and what is the syntax for linking to it the same as linking to any other URLs (only using #foo instead of http://....)? In standard Markdown, place an anchor <a name="abcd"></a> where you want to link to and refer to it on the same page by [link text](#abcd).(This uses name= and not id=, for reasons explained in this answer.)Remote references can use [link text](http://...#abcd) of course.This works like a dream, provided you have control over the source and target texts. The anchor can even appear in a heading, thus:produces:and we can even link to it so:(On SO, the link doesn\'t work because the anchor is stripped.)If you have headers in the markdown files, you can directly link them in the file.Markdown Header -## The Headerthis will generate an implicit id #the-header (replace internal spaces with hyphens and make lowercase).To navigate to this id, you can create the link like this: [Link to Header](#the-header)This is equivalent to:<a href="/current_url#the-header">Link to Header</a>Please note the reference\'s name is a lower-case #header.Taken from the Multimarkdown Users Guide (thanks to @MultiMarkdown on Twitter for pointing it out)[Some Text][]will link to a header named \xe2\x80\x9cSome Text\xe2\x80\x9d\ne.g.  An optional label of your choosing to help disambiguate cases where multiple headers have the same title:This allows you to use [MultiMarkdownOverview] to refer to this section specifically, and not another section named Overview. This works with atx- or settext-style headers.If you have already defined an anchor using the same id that is used by a header, then the defined anchor takes precedence.In addition to headers within the document, you can provide labels for images and tables which can then be used for cross-references as well.I test Github Flavored Markdown for a while and summary 4 rules:Say,## 1.1 Hello WorldWrite this way,[Link](#11-hello-world)Done.The best way to create internal links (related with sections) is create list but instead of link, put #section or #section-title if the header includes spaces.---- MARKDOWN ---------------------------- LIST PREVIEW ---------------------------- HTML ------------------------It doesn\'t matter whether it\'s h1, h2, h3, etc. header, you always refer to it using just one #.\nAll references in section list should be converted to lowercase text as it is shown in the example above.  Link to section should be lowercase. In other way it won\'t work.\nThis technique works very well for all Markdown variants, also MultiMarkdown.  Currently I\'m using the Pandoc to convert documents format. It\'s much better than MultiMarkdown.\nTest Pandoc hereHere is my solution (derived from SaraubhM\'s answer)**Jump To**: [Hotkeys & Markers](#hotkeys-markers) / [Radii](#radii) / [Route Wizard 2.0](#route-wizard-2-0)Which gives you:Jump To: Hotkeys & Markers / Radii / Route Wizard 2.0Note the changes from  and . to - and also the loss of the & in the links.If you are looking to link to internal headers in a .MD file in GitHub - then just hover over the individual header and click the link symbol that appears to the left of the header.  That is literally the link you need to use to link to that specific header within the document.
