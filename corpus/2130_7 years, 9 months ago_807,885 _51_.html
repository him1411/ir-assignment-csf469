I would like to place a "please wait, loading" spinning circle animation on my site. How should I accomplish this using jQuery?You could do this various different ways. It could be a subtle as a small status on the page saying "Loading...", or as loud as an entire element graying out the page while the new data is loading. The approach I\'m taking below will show you how to accomplish both methods.Let\'s start by getting us a nice "loading" animation from http://ajaxload.info \nI\'ll be using  Let\'s create an element that we can show/hide anytime we\'re making an ajax request:Next let\'s give it some flair:Alright, on to the jQuery. This next part is actually really simple:That\'s it! We\'re attaching some events to the body element anytime the ajaxStart or ajaxStop events are fired. When an ajax event starts, we add the "loading" class to the body. and when events are done, we remove the "loading" class from the body.See it in action: http://jsfiddle.net/VpDUG/4952/As far as the actual loading image, check out this site for a bunch of options.As far as displaying a DIV with this image when a request begins, you have a few choices:A) Manually show and hide the image:B) Use ajaxStart and ajaxComplete:Using this the element will show/hide for any request. Could be good or bad, depending on the need.C) Use individual callbacks for a particular request:Along with what Jonathan and Samir suggested (both excellent answers btw!), jQuery has some built in events that it\'ll fire for you when making an ajax request.There\'s the ajaxStart eventShow a loading message whenever an AJAX request starts (and none is already active)....and it\'s brother, the ajaxStop eventAttach a function to be executed whenever all AJAX requests have ended. This is an Ajax Event.Together, they make a fine way to show a progress message when any ajax activity is happening anywhere on the page.HTML:Script:You can grab an animated GIF of a spinning circle from Ajaxload - stick that somewhere in your website file heirarchy. Then you just need to add an HTML element with the correct code, and remove it when you\'re done. This is fairly simple:You then just need to use these methods in your AJAX call:This has a few caveats: first of all, if you have two or more places the loading image can be shown, you\'re going to need to kep track of how many calls are running at once somehow, and only hide when they\'re all done. This can be done using a simple counter, which should work for almost all cases.Secondly, this will only hide the loading image on a successful AJAX call. To handle the error states, you\'ll need to look into $.ajax, which is more complex than $.load, $.get and the like, but a lot more flexible too.Jonathon\'s excellent solution breaks in IE8 (the animation does not show at all). To fix this, change the CSS to:jQuery provides event hooks for when AJAX requests start and end. You can hook into these to show your loader.For example, create the following div:Set it to display: none in your stylesheets. You can style it whatever way you want to. You can generate a nice loading image at Ajaxload.info, if you want to.Then, you can use something like the following to make it be shown automatically when sending Ajax requests:Simply add this Javascript block to the end of your page before closing your body tag or wherever you see fit.Now, whenever you send Ajax requests, the #spinner div will be shown. When the request is complete, it\'ll be hidden again.If you are using Turbolinks With Rails this is my solution:This is the CoffeeScriptThis is the SASS CSS based on the first excellent answer from Jonathan SampsonLike Mark H said the blockUI is the way.Ex.:Obs.: I got the ajax-loader.gif on http://www.ajaxload.info/note that when using asp.net mvc, with "using (Ajax.BeginForm(..." setting the "ajaxStart" will not work.use the ajaxotions to overcome this issue:This would make the buttons disappear, then an animation of "loading" would appear in their place and finally just display a success message.With all due respect to other posts, you have here a very simple solution, using CSS3 and jQuery, without using any further external resources nor files.Most of the solutions I have seen either expects us to design a loading overlay, keep it hidden and then unhide it when required, or, show a gif or image etc.I wanted to develop robust a plugin where with a simply jQuery call I can display the loading screen and tear it down when the task is completed.Below is the code. It depends on Font awesome and jQuery:Just put the above in a js file and include it throughout the project.Invocation:I use CSS3 for animation
