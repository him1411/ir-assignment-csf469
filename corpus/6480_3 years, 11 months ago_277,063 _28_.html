I have a footerController and codeScannerController with different views.When I click on a <li> in footer.html I should get this event in codeScannerController.I think it can be realised with $on and $broadcast, but I don\'t know how and can\'t find examples anywhere.If you want to $broadcast use the $rootScope:And then to receive, use the $scope of your controller:If you want you can pass arguments when you $broadcast:And then receive them:Documentation for this inside the Scope docs.First, a short description of $on(), $broadcast() and $emit():Based on the following HTML (see full example here):The fired events will traverse the $scopes as follows:JavaScript to trigger events (again, you can see a working example here):One thing you should know is $ prefix refers to an Angular Method, $$ prefixes refers to angular methods that you should avoid using.below is an example template and its controllers, we\'ll explore how $broadcast/$on can help us achieve what we want.The controllers areMy question to you is how do you pass the name to the second controller when a user clicks register?  You may come up with multiple solutions but the one we\'re going to use is using $broadcast and $on.$broadcast vs $emitWhich should we use?  $broadcast will channel down to all the children dom elements and $emit will channel the opposite direction to all the ancestor dom elements.  The best way to avoid deciding between $emit or $broadcast is to channel from the $rootScope and use $broadcast to all its children.  Which makes our case much easier since our dom elements are siblings.Adding $rootScope and lets $broadcastNote we added $rootScope and now we\'re using $broadcast(broadcastName, arguments).  For broadcastName, we want to give it a unique name so we can catch that name in our secondCtrl.  I\'ve chosen BOOM! just for fun.  The second arguments \'arguments\' allows us to pass values to the listeners.Receiving our broadcastIn our second controller, we need to set up code to listen to our broadcastIt\'s really that simple. Live ExampleOther ways to achieve similar resultsTry to avoid using this suite of methods as it is neither efficient nor easy to maintain but it\'s a simple way to fix issues you might have.  You can usually do the same thing by using a service or by simplifying your controllers.  We won\'t discuss this in detail but I thought I\'d just mention it for completeness.Lastly, keep in mind a really useful broadcast to listen to is \'$destroy\' again you can see the $ means it\'s a method or object created by the vendor codes.  Anyways $destroy is broadcasted when a controller gets destroyed, you may want to listen to this to know when your controller is removed.
