I want to apply a change so That I can use Server GC settings for my C# 3.5 app - I can do that by editing the machine.config file.The only problem is I do not know where that is.How can I find the path of this file in a repeatable way across a number of different machines32-bit64-bit[version] should be equal to v1.0.3705, v1.1.4322, v2.0.50727 or v4.0.30319.v3.0 and v3.5 just contain additional assemblies to v2.0.50727 so there should be no config\\machine.config. v4.5.x and v4.6.x are stored inside v4.0.30319.You can run this in powershell: Which outputs this for .net 4: Note however that this might change depending on whether .net is running as 32 or 64 bit which will result in \\Framework\\ or \\Framework64\\ respectively.In order to be absolutely sure, slap a Label on an ASP.NET page and run this code:I believe this will leave no doubt!It semi-depends though... mine is:C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\CONFIGandC:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v2.0.50727\\CONFIGC:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\CONFIGIn your asp.net app use this You can run this in powershell:\ncopy & paste in power shell\n[System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeEnvironment]::SystemConfigurationFilemine output is:\nC:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50527\\config\\machine.config
