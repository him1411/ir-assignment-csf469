I\'ve looked into and considered many JavaScript unit tests and testing tools, but have been unable to find a suitable option to remain fully TDD compliant. So, is there a JavaScript unit test tool that is fully TDD compliant?Karma is a JavaScript test-runner built with Node.js and meant for unit testing.The Protractor is for end-to-end testing and uses Selenium Web Driver to drive tests.Both have been made by the Angular team. You can use any assertion-library you want with either.Screencast: Karma Getting startedrelated:pros:Cons:A JavaScript test-runner built with Node.js. Very modular and flexible. It comes with its own assertion library, but you can add your own if you like. The assertions library is decoupled, so you can also use it with other test-runners. Instead of using assert(!...) or expect(...).not..., it uses refute(...) which is a nice twist imho.A browser JavaScript testing toolkit. It does browser testing with browser automation (think JsTestDriver), qunit style static HTML page testing, testing in headless browsers (phantomjs, jsdom, ...), and more. Take a look at the overview!A Node.js testing toolkit. You get the same test case library, assertion library, etc. This is also great for hybrid browser and Node.js code. Write your test case with Buster.JS and run it both in Node.js and in a real browser.Screencast: Buster.js Getting started (2:45)pros:Cons:* TestSwarm is also a Continuous Integration server, while you need a separate CI server for Buster.js. It does, however, output xUnit XML reports, so it should be easy to integrate with Hudson, Bamboo or other CI servers.https://github.com/jquery/testswarmTestSwarm is officially no longer under active development as stated on their GitHub webpage. They recommend Karma, browserstack-runner, or Intern.The website www.browserswarm.com is dead and there are no recent search results for BrowserSwarm. It appears to have died. BrowserSwarm is a project from appendTo, Sauce Labs and the Internet Explorer team. It is essentially a hosted forked version of TestSwarm. In addition to all the advantages to TestSwarm, BrowserSwarm already has all the browsers connected to the swarm and ready to test your code, therefore not requiring you to add clients yourself or maintaining installations of browsers. Time is also saved from the hassle of setting up and configuring TestSwarm.This is a client-side test-runner that might interest developers familiar with Ruby or Ruby on Rails. The syntax is based on RSpec that\'s used for testing in Rails projects.Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing your JavaScript code. It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a DOM.If you have experience with this test-runner, please contribute with more info :)Project home: http://jasmine.github.io/QUnit focuses on testing JavaScript in the browser while providing as much convenience to the developer as possible. Blurb from the site:QUnit is a powerful, easy-to-use JavaScript unit test suite. It\'s used by the jQuery, jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile projects and is capable of testing any generic JavaScript codeQUnit shares some history with TestSwarm (above):QUnit was originally developed by John Resig as part of jQuery. In 2008 it got its own home, name and API documentation, allowing others to use it for their unit testing as well. At the time it still depended on jQuery. A rewrite in 2009 fixed that, now QUnit runs completely standalone.\n  QUnit\'s assertion methods follow the CommonJS Unit Testing specification, which was to some degree influenced by QUnit.Project home: http://qunitjs.com/Another great tool is sinon.js by Christian Johansen, the author of Test-Driven JavaScript Development. Best described by himself:Standalone test spies, stubs and mocks\n  for JavaScript. No dependencies works\n  with any unit testing framework.The Intern Web site provides a direct feature comparison to the other testing frameworks on this list. It offers more features out of the box than any other JavaScript-based testing system.I\'m totally unqualified to comment on mocha.js\'s features, strengths, and weaknesses,\nbut it was just recommended to me by someone I trust in the JS community.List of features, as reported by its web site:Yolpo is a tool to visualize the execution of javascript. Javascript API developers are encouraged to write their use cases to show and tell their api. Such use cases forms the basis of regression tests.Futuristic test runner with built-in support for ES2015. Even though JavaScript is single-threaded, IO in Node.js can happen in parallel due to its async nature. AVA takes advantage of this and runs your tests concurrently, which is especially beneficial for IO heavy tests. In addition, test files are run in parallel as separate processes, giving you even better performance and an isolated environment for each test file.Take a look at the Dojo Object Harness (DOH) unit test framework which is pretty much framework independent harness for JavaScript unit testing and doesn\'t have any Dojo dependencies. There is a very good description of it at Unit testing Web 2.0 applications using the Dojo Objective Harness.If you want to automate the UI testing (a sore point of many developers) â€” check out doh.robot (temporary down. update: other link http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/util/dohrobot.html ) and dijit.robotx (temporary down). The latter is designed for an acceptance testing.\nUpdate: Referenced articles explain how to use them, how to emulate a user interacting with your UI using mouse and/or keyboard, and how to record a testing session, so you can "play" it later automatically.I created an open source project called Chutzpah which is a test runner for JavaScript unit tests. Chutzpah enables you to run JavaScript unit tests from the command line and from inside of Visual Studio. It also supports running in the TeamCity continuous integration server.The JavaScript section of the Wikipedia entry, List of Unit Testing Frameworks, provides a list of available choices.  It indicates whether they work client-side, server-side, or both.There is also BusterJS from Christian Johansen, the author of Test Driven Javascript Development and the Sinon framework. From the site:Buster.JS is a new JavaScript testing framework. It does browser testing by automating test runs in actual browsers (think JsTestDriver), as well as Node.js testing.JavaScript testing framework released by Google:\nhttps://github.com/google/gjstestThere are currently no binaries for WindowsWe are now using Qunit with Pavlov and JSTestDriver all together. This approach works well for us.  QUnit Pavlov, sourcejsTestDriver, sourceYou have "runs on actual browser" as a pro, but in my experience that is a con because it is slow. But what makes it valuable is the lack of sufficient JS emulation from the non-browser alternatives. It could be that if your JS is complex enough that only an in browser test will suffice, but there are a couple more options to consider:HtmlUnit: "It has fairly good JavaScript support (which is constantly improving) and is able to work even with quite complex AJAX libraries, simulating either Firefox or Internet Explorer depending on the configuration you want to use."  If its emulation is good enough for your use then it will be much faster than driving a browser.But maybe HtmlUnit has good enough JS support but you don\'t like Java?  Then maybe:Celerity: Watir API running on JRuby backed by HtmlUnit.or similarlySchnell: another JRuby wrapper of HtmlUnit.Of course if HtmlUnit isn\'t good enough and you have to drive a browser then you might consider Watir to drive your JS.YUI has a testing framework as well.  This video from Yahoo! Theater is a nice introduction, although there are a lot of basics about TDD up front.This framework is generic and can be run against any JavaScript or JS library.You might also be interested in the unit testing framework that is part of qooxdoo, an open source RIA framework similar to Dojo, ExtJS, etc. but with quite a comprehensive tool chain.Try the online version of the testrunner. Hint: hit the gray arrow at the top left (should be made more obvious). It\'s a "play" button that runs the selected tests.To find out more about the JS classes that let you define your unit tests, see the online API viewer.For automated UI testing (based on Selenium RC), check out the Simulator project.You should have a look at env.js. See my blog for an example how to write unit tests with env.js.We added JUnit integration to our Java to Javascript code generator ST-JS (http://st-js.org). The framework generates to corresponding Javascript for both the tested code and the unit tests and sends the code to different browsers. There is no need for a separate server as the unit test runner opens the needed http port (and closes it once the tests finished). The framework manipulates the Java stacktrace so that the failed asserts are correctly displayed by the JUnit Eclipse plugin. Here is a simple example with jQuery and Mockjax:MochiKit has a testing framework called SimpleTest that seems to have caught on. \nHere\'s a blog post from the original author.
