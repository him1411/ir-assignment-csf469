I have the following migration file db\\migrate\\20100905201547_create_blocks.rbHow can I specifically rollback that migration file? Is a way to do this, if the migration you want to rollback is the last one applied. You can substitute 1 for however many migrations you want to go back.For example:Will also rollback all the migration that happened later (4, 3, 2 and also 1).As suggested in comments:In order to rollback a specific migration use:will roll back the specific file. To find the version of all migrations, you can use this command:Or, simply the prefix of the migration\'s file name is the version you need to rollback.See the Ruby on Rails guide entry on migrations.To rollback the last migration you can do:If you want to rollback a specific migration with a version you should do:For e.g. if the version is 20141201122027, you will do:to rollback that specific migration.rake db:migrate:down VERSION=your_migrations\'s_version_number_hereThe version is the numerical prefix on the migration\'s file nameHow to find version:Your migration files are stored in your rails_root/db/migrate directory. Find appropriate file up to which you want to rollback and copy the prefix number.for examplefile name: 20140208031131_create_roles.rb\nthen the version is 20140208031131you can rollback your migration by using rake db:rollback with different options.But, According to your requirement syntax has changed.If you want to rollback last migration, then you can use it.orIf you want rollback number of migration in one time, then you simply pass argumentwhere n is number of migration for rollback from latest migration.If you want rollback a specific migration, then you should pass version of migration in next syntax.where xxxxx is version number of migration.To rollback the last migration you can do:If you want to rollback a specific migration with a version you should do:If the migration file you want to rollback was called db/migrate/20141201122027_create_some_table.rb, then the VERSION for that migration is 20141201122027, which is the timestamp of when that migration was created, and the command to roll back that migration would be:If it is a reversible migration and the last one which has been executed, then run rake db:rollback. And you can always use version.\ne.gthe migration file is 20140716084539_create_customer_stats.rb,so the rollback command will be,\nrake db:migrate:down VERSION=20140716084539Migrations change the state of the database using the commandWe can undo a single migration step usingTo go all the way back to the beginning, we can useAs you might guess, substituting any other number for 0 migrates to that version number, where the version numbers come from listing the migrations sequentiallyFrom Rails GuideYou can use Active Record\'s ability to rollback migrations using the revert method:The revert method also accepts a block of instructions to reverse. This could be useful to revert selected parts of previous migrations. For example, let\'s imagine that CreateBlock is committed and it is later decided it would be best to use Active Record validations, in place of the CHECK constraint, to verify the zipcode.The same migration could also have been written without using revert but this would have involved a few more steps: reversing the order of create_table and reversible, replacing create_table by drop_table, and finally replacing up by down and vice-versa. This is all taken care of by revert.Well in rails 5 it\'s quite easy \nrake db:migrate:status \nor \nrails db:migrate:status It was modified to handle both the same way \nThen just pick which Version you want to roll back \nand then run \nrake db:migrate VERSION=2013424230423 Make sure VERSION is all capital letters If you have a problem with any step of the migration or stuck in the middle simply go to the migration file and comment out the lines that were already migrated. Hope that helps Rolling back last migration:Rolling back last n number of migrationsRolling back a specific migration If you want to rollback and migrate you can run:That\'s the same as:
