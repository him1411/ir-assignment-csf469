I\'m trying to insert some text data into a table in SQL Server 9.The text includes a single quote.How do I escape that?I tried using two single quotes, but it threw me some errors.eg. insert into my_table values(\'hi, my name\'\'s tim.\');Single quotes are escaped by doubling them up, just as you\'ve shown us in your example. The following SQL illustrates this functionality. I tested it on SQL Server 2008:If escaping your single quote with another single quote isn\'t working for you (like it didn\'t for one of my recent REPLACE() queries), you can use SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER OFF before your query, then SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON after your query.For exampleHow about:The doubling up of the quote should have worked, so it\'s peculiar that it didn\'t work for you; however, an alternative is using double quote characters, instead of single ones, around the string.  I.e.,insert into my_table values("hi, my name\'s tim.");Also another thing to be careful of is whether or not it is really stored as a classic ASCII \' (ASCII 27) or Unicode 2019 (which looks similar, but not the same). This isn\'t a big deal on inserts, but it can mean the world on selects and updates.  If it\'s the unicode value then escaping the \' in a WHERE clause (e.g where blah = \'Workers\'\'s Comp\') will return like the value you are searching for isn\'t there if the \' in "Worker\'s Comp" is actually the unicode value.If your client application supports free-key, as well as copy and paste based input, it could be Unicode in some rows, and ASCII in others!\nA simple way to confirm this is by doing some kind of open ended query that will bring back the value you are searching for, and then copy and paste that into notepad++ or some other unicode supporting editor. The differing appearance between the ascii value and the unicode one should be obvious to the eyes, but if you lean towards the anal, it will show up as 27 (ascii) or 92 (unicode) in a hex editor.This should work2 ways to work around this:for \' you can simply double it in the string, e.g. \nselect \'I\'\'m happpy\' -- will get: I\'m happyFor any charactor you are not sure of: in sql server you can get any char\'s unicode by select unicode(\':\')So this case you can also select \'I\'+nchar(39)+\'m happpy\'I\'m agree with Cory Larson. When I\'m using SQL Server 2005 I use the single quote to escape the single quote. It sounds weird, but it works for me. Try with that.Reference: SQL Server 2005 escaping quotes
