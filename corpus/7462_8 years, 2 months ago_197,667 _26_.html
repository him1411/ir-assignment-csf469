Where are the files for a PostgreSQL database stored?To see where the data directory is, use this query.To see all the run-time parameters, useYou can create tablespaces to store database objects in other parts of the filesystem. To see tablespaces, which might not be in that data directory, use this query.On Windows7 all the databases are referred by a number in the file named pg_database under C:\\Program Files (x86)\\PostgreSQL\\8.2\\data\\global. Then you should search for the folder name by that number under C:\\Program Files (x86)\\PostgreSQL\\8.2\\data\\base. That is the content of the database.Open pgAdmin and go to Properties for specific database. Find OID and then open directoryThere should be your DB files.As suggested in "PostgreSQL database default location on Linux", under Linux you can find out using the following command:Under Linux it\'s here: /var/lib/postgresql/8.x/You can change it with initdb -D "c:/mydb/"On Mac: /Library/PostgreSQL/9.0/data/baseThe directory can\'t be entered, but you can look at the content via: sudo du -hc dataThe location of specific tables/indexes can be adjusted by TABLESPACEs:Postgres stores data in files in its data directory. Follow the steps below to go to a database and its files:The database corresponding to a postgresql table file is a directory. The location of the entire data directory can be obtained by running SHOW data_directory. \nin a UNIX like OS (eg: Mac) /Library/PostgreSQL/9.4/data\nGo inside the base folder in the data directory which has all the database folders: /Library/PostgreSQL/9.4/data/baseFind the database folder name by running (Gives an integer. This is the database folder name):Find the table file name by running (Gives an integer. This is the file name):This is a binary file. File details such as size and creation date time can be obtained as usual.

The data for a particular database is under (for example) C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\8.1\\data\\base\\100929, where I guess 100929 is the database number.I\'d bet you\'re asking this question because you\'ve tried pg_ctl start and received the following error:pg_ctl: no database directory specified and environment variable PGDATA unsetIn other words, you\'re looking for the directory to put after -D in your pg_ctl start command.In this case, the directory you\'re looking for contains these files.You can locate it by locating any of the files and directories above using the search provided with your OS.For example in my case (a HomeBrew install on Mac OS X), these files are located in /usr/local/var/postgres. To start the server I type:... and it works.
