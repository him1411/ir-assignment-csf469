With the WebForms view engine, I\'ll commonly use the ternary operator for very simple conditionals, especially within HTML attributes. For example:The above code will give the <a> tag a class of auth or anon depending on whether the user is authenticated.What is the equivalent syntax with the Razor view engine? Because Razor requires HTML tags to "know" when to jump in and out of code and markup, I\'m currently stuck with the following:This is, to put it mildly, terrible. I would love to do something like this, but am struggling to understand how in Razor:--Update:In the meantime, I\'ve created this HtmlHelper:which can be called like this from Razor:Still, I am hoping there\'s a way to use the ternary operator without falling back to wrapping it in an extension method.You should be able to use the @() expression syntax:I don\'t have Razor installed, though, so I could be wrong.The important concept is that you are evaluating an expression in your Razor code.  The best way to do this (if, for example, you are in a foreach loop) is using a generic method.  The syntax for calling a generic method in Razor is:In this case, the expression is:Therefore, the solution is:This code can be used anywhere in Razor, not just for an html attribute.See @Kyralessa \'s comment for C# Razor Syntax Quick Reference (Phil Haack\'s blog).A simpler version, for easy eyes!For those of you who use ASP.net with VB razor the ternary operator is also possible.It must be, as well, inside a razor expression: and the ternary operator works as follows:The same code example shown here with VB razor looks like this: Note: when writing a TextExpression remember that Boolean symbols are not the same between C# and VB. in my problem I want the text of anchor <a>text</a> inside my view to be based on some value\nand that text is retrieved form App string Resourcesso, this @() is the solution if the text is not from App string Resources use thisYou can also use this method:Try this ..\nGood luck\nThanks.
