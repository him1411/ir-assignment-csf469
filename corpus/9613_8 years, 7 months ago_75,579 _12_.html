I would like to check whether an object (e.g. someObject) is assignable (cast-able) to a variable of another type (e.g. SpecifiedType). In Java, I can write:A related question is finding whether the runtime type of an object is equal to a another type. In Java, I can write:How can this be done in Objective-C?Try [myObject class] for returning the class of an object.You can make exact comparisons with:but not by using directly MyClass identifier.Similarily, you can find if the object is of a subclass of your class with: as suggested by Jon Skeet and zoul.From Wikipedia:In Objective-C, for example, both the\n  generic Object and NSObject (in\n  Cocoa/OpenStep) provide the method\n  isMemberOfClass: which returns true if\n  the argument to the method is an\n  instance of the specified class. The\n  method isKindOfClass: analogously\n  returns true if the argument inherits\n  from the specified class.isKindOfClass: would be closest to instanceof, by the sounds of it.See the isKindOfClass: method in the NSObject documentation. (The usual word of warning for such question is that checking the object class is often a sign of doing something wrong.)
