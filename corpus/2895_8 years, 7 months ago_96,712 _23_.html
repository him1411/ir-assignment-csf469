Does anyone have a T_PAAMAYIM_NEKUDOTAYIM?It\xe2\x80\x99s the double colon operator :: (see list of parser tokens).Google works wonders. It\'s Hebrew for "double colon".It\xe2\x80\x99s a name for the :: operator in PHP. It literally means "double colon". For some reason they named it in Hebrew. Check your code syntax, and put a :: where appropriate :-)From Wikipedia:In PHP, the scope resolution operator is also called Paamayim\n  Nekudotayim (Hebrew: \xd7\xa4\xd7\xa2\xd7\x9e\xd7\x99\xd7\x99\xd7\x9d \xd7\xa0\xd7\xa7\xd7\x95\xd7\x93\xd7\xaa\xd7\x99\xd7\x99\xd7\x9d\xe2\x80\x8e), which means \xe2\x80\x9cdouble colon\xe2\x80\x9d in\n  Hebrew.The name "Paamayim Nekudotayim" was introduced in the\n  Israeli-developed Zend Engine 0.5 used in PHP 3. Although it has been\n  confusing to many developers who do not speak Hebrew, it is still\n  being used in PHP 5, as in this sample error message:$ php -r :: Parse error: syntax error, unexpected\n  T_PAAMAYIM_NEKUDOTAYIMAs of PHP 5.4, error messages concerning the scope resolution operator\n  still include this name, but have clarified its meaning somewhat:$ php -r :: Parse error: syntax error, unexpected \'::\'\n  (T_PAAMAYIM_NEKUDOTAYIM)From the official PHP documentation:The Scope Resolution Operator (also called Paamayim Nekudotayim) or in\n  simpler terms, the double colon, is a token that allows access to\n  static, constant, and overridden properties or methods of a class.When referencing these items from outside the class definition, use\n  the name of the class.As of PHP 5.3.0, it\'s possible to reference the class using a\n  variable. The variable\'s value can not be a keyword (e.g. self, parent\n  and static).Paamayim Nekudotayim would, at first, seem like a strange choice for\n  naming a double-colon. However, while writing the Zend Engine 0.5\n  (which powers PHP 3), that\'s what the Zend team decided to call it. It\n  actually does mean double-colon - in Hebrew!This is also coming when you apply a constant in PHP to the empty() function:That was my case. I solved it by using this:For me this happened within a class function. In PHP 5.3 and above $this::$defaults worked fine; when I swapped the code into a server that for whatever reason had a lower version number it threw this error.The solution, in my case, was to use the keyword self instead of $this:self::$defaults works just fine.This is how I got it. I was trying out the limits of expressions in double quotes. So this is the code:
