Whenever I try to run my app in Xcode 6 Beta 4 I am getting the error:This error appears no matter what simulator or device I target.I have tried:Has anyone else run into this problem and found a solution?I use Xcode6 GM. I encountered the same problem. What I did was to go to Build Settings -> Build Options. Then I changed the value of the "Compiler for C/C++/Objective-C" to Default Compiler.In Xcode do the followingWindow --> Organiser --> Projects --> The app with the issue --> delete button in Derived Data.I then cleaned the project and voilaworksThe other solutions only fixed it for my on simulator, not device.For me this problem occurred (in Xcode 6) when I would try to change the main info.plist properties whilst trying to change my app name. In info.plist I had changed Executable File name to something other than the default ${EXECUTABLE_NAME}...I had mistaken this field for the field that changes the name of the app under the icon on the springboard. I\'ve fixed it by cleaning a build folder. Just went to \'Product\' menu and Option+Click \'Clean\'. After that a problem was resolved.For me, a simple Product -> Clean worked greatThere was a problem with the Info.plist of the project. I created a new project with the same name in Xcode 6 beta 4 and then replaced the real project\'s Info.plist with the new one. The project then built and ran fine.Look at the diff, it appears like the plist might have somehow gotten mixed up with a playground\'s plist. The bundle identifier was "com.apple.dt.playground.iOS-18300-13" and the executable and bundle names were "iOS" along with some other oddities.This is the full diff in case anyone needs it for reference:Go To Build Settings from your project target then go to Build Options, Then change the value of the "Compiler for C/C++/Objective-C" to Default Compiler. I\'m using Xcode 6 beta 4 and it worked for me too. Please check if you have changed Executable file => $(EXECUTABLE_NAME) to any other name. If you have changed this name then it shows this error. Please replace it with $(EXECUTABLE_NAME).Product -> Clean (command shift K) fixed it for meI\'ve had same this error in Xcode 8.2. The reason I found out for me, another Info.plist is added in my project while adding library (manually copy).So that Xcode is getting confused for selecting correct Info.plist. I just removed that Info.plist from the added library. Then it is working fine without any permission alert.   I had similar issue (xCode 6.2) for sample code downloaded. I tried to set Executable Name to Default in Info.plist but this didn\'t worked. Instead change Compiler for C/C++/Objective-C to Default compiler (Apple LLVM 6.0) instead of Unsupported Compiler(com.apple.compilers.llvmgcc42) for project.Try "cmd+shift+k" to clean the project and rebuild. At least it worked for me1) Go Firstly  Build Options.2) Then changed the value of the "Compiler for C/C++/Objective-C" to Default Compiler.clean and working :-)Sometimes opening old project in new version Xcode will get this message.Go to Issue navigator and follow the warning hint \'Upate to reconmmented settings\'.Boom, magic!I found that changing my compiler to LLVM 6.0 in the Build Options was enough for me (xcode 6.1)My goodness!! I spent hours to resolve this issue.On XCode 7.3 I was having project with no issues.Mistake I didI just Added physical folders and moved my files into them, problem started.I tried everythingnothing worked :(How I resolvedI was about create new project and then I just deleted those physical\n  folders I added, clean build and YESS!!It works!!I got same error on my Xcode 6.1.1 for a project downloaded from gitHub which was committed 4 years ago.\nFor me, setting Architectures to the default value Standard architectures(armv7,arm64) and Compiler for C/C++/Objective-C to Default Compiler in Building Settings worked.I\'ve had this error with a number of my older projects that I am getting out of the cupboard to update. It seems that using Xcode 6 with older code seems to bring this about for some reason. I have fixed this in all projects that I have done this with by:I recently meet the same problem for running an old project (initially created in Xcode 4.x) in Xcode 6.0.1.I fixed the problem by changing the Architectures in Building Settings to the default value, which is "Standard architectures(armv7,arm64)". Hope this could help anyone who got similar problems :)Well in my case, I just rename the Bundle Name and Executable file values in info.plist same as project name. It worked for me.I tried all of the listed answers and none of them was useful. The problem was due to existence of an another plist file linked from a submodule via cocoapods. Luckily this was my own module, so I just deleted this plist from the submodule project and reinstalled pods.Later on I understood that the key of the problem was in the name of that second plist: simply info.plist. You may rename the file and relink it via a sources section of a submoduleThat second plist file had a unique name, so Xcode was not supposed to become frustrated. Even my target settings pointed on a main plist, not on a info.plist. Looks like Xcode takes special consideraions about that nameThe bug reproduced in Xcode 6.4 and Xcode 7.0I had this similar problem. Somehow my value for the key Executable File got mixed up. Just change it back to  ${EXECUTABLE_NAME} (Under your project > Info). Worked for me!with X-code 6.3.2 [Build Settings] Options. \n[All]-[Build Options]-[Compiler for C/C++/Objective-C]-[Default compiler (Apple LLVM 6.1)]Then rebuild the project, and it runs ok.Don\'t know if the problem is related but maybe it can be a solution for anyone pulling the hairs like me. In my case, I have a project with a lot of targets. Each target is a customisation of that base project which is a Cocoa Touch Static Library and the targets, Applications. Even if the main file is added into the library compilation, but not in each target, that error message appears. So what I did? Manually added the main file to each target in the Compile Sources section and bingo, all fine.In my case main.m containing the main(...) function was not contained in the list of "Compile Sources" in "Build Phases". To check if this is the case, enter into Build Phases and look, if your main.m appears in the "Compile Sources" list.What solved it for me was setting Build Active Architecture Only from No to Yes.In my case it helped just to close Xcode, repaired the permissions with the Disk Utility. Only after a reboot it worked like a charm.I\'m using Xcode 6 GM. I encountered the same issue. \nWhat I did was to go to Build Settings -> Build Options (you can search "compiler"),\nand then changed the option of the "Compiler for C/C++/Objective-C" to Default Compiler.As i have also faced this issue today morning and none of the answers helped me out particularly in my case. And after trying for hours  i figured out the issue.Actually while working in storyboard by mistake, i just renamed my "Main.storyboard" to ".storyboard" and changing it back to "Main.storyboard" solved my issue.SOLUTION(As per my issue): May be you have renamed any file due to which xcode couldn\'t load it and raised an issue.\nFor example: as mentioned above the case of changing "Executable File" name\nPossible Issue area: May be the last few files you were working in.I changed name to new name then I returned the old name to my project and it helped me.
