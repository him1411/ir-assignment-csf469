Duplicates are not allowed but due to a problem with how the rows were created I know there are some duplicates in this table.\nI need to eliminate the extra rows from the perspective of the key columns. Some other columns may have slightly different data but I do not care about that. I still need to keep one of these rows however. SELECT DISTINCT won\'t work because it operates on all columns and I need to suppress duplicates based on the key columns.How can I delete the extra rows but still keep one efficiently?You didn\'t say what version you were using, but in SQL 2005 and above, you can use a common table expression with the OVER Clause.  It goes a little something like this:Play around with it and see what you get.(Edit: In an attempt to be helpful, someone edited the ORDER BY clause within the CTE. To be clear, you can order by anything you want here, it needn\'t be one of the columns returned by the cte. In fact, a common use-case here is that "foo, bar" are the group identifier and "baz" is some sort of time stamp. In order to keep the latest, you\'d do ORDER BY baz desc)Example query:Here fields are column on which you want to group the duplicate rows.Here\'s my twist on it, with a runnable example. Note this will only work in the situation where Id is unique, and you have duplicate values in other columns.And the results:Not sure why that\'s what I thought of first... definitely not the simplest way to go but it works.
