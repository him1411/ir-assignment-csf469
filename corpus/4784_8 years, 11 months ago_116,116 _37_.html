I am getting this warning: "Missing XML comment for publicly visible type or member".How to solve this?5 options:Add XML comments to the publicly visible types and members of course :)You need these <summary> type comments on all members - these also show up in the intellisense popup menu.The reason you get this warning is because you\'ve set your project to output documentation xml file (in the project settings). This is useful for class libraries (.dll assemblies) which means users of your .dll are getting intellisense documentation for your API right there in visual studio.I recommend you get yourself a copy of the GhostDoc Visual Studio AddIn.. Makes documenting much easier.Suppress Warnings for XML comments(not my work, but I found it useful so I\'ve included the article & link)http://bernhardelbl.wordpress.com/2009/02/23/suppress-warnings-for-xml-comments/Here i will show you, how you can suppress warnings for XML comments after a Visual Studio build.BackgroundIf you have checked the "XML documentation file" mark in the Visual Studio project settings, a XML file containing all XML comments is created. Additionally you will get a lot of warnings also in designer generated files, because of the missing or wrong XML comments. While sometimes warnings helps us to improve and stabilize our code, getting hundreds of XML comment warnings is just a pain.\nWarningsMissing XML comment for publicly visible type or member \xe2\x80\xa6\nXML comment on \xe2\x80\xa6 has a param tag for \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99, but there is no parameter by that name\nParameter \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99 has no matching param tag in the XML comment for \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99 (but other parameters do)\nSolutionYou can suppress every warning in Visual Studio.Right-click the Visual Studio project / Properties / Build TabInsert the following warning numbers in the "Suppress warnings": 1591,1572,1571,1573,1587,1570Insert an XML comment. ;-)This may appear like a joke at the first glance, but it may actually be useful. For me it turned out to be helpful to think about what methods do even for private methods (unless really trivial, of course).This is because an XML documentation file has been specified in your Project Properties and Your Method/Class is public and lack documentation.\nYou can either :Right Click on your Project -> Properties -> \'Build\' tab -> uncheck XML Documentation File.Summary of XML documentation goes like this:I know this is a really old thread, but it\'s the first response on google so I thought I\'d add this bit of information:\n\nThis behavior only occurs when the warning level is set to 4 under "Project Properties" -> "Build". Unless you really need that much information you can set it to 3 and you\'ll get rid of these warnings. Of course, changing the warning level affects more than just comments, so please refer to the documentation if you\'re unsure what you\'ll be missing:\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/thxezb7y.aspxI wanted to add something to the answers listed here:As Isak pointed out, the XML documentation is useful for Class Libraries, as it provides intellisense to any consumer within Visual Studio.  Therefore, an easy and correct solution is to simply turn off documentation for any top-level project (such as UI, etc), which is not going to be implemented outside of its own project.Additionally I wanted to point out that the warning only expresses on publicly visible members.  So, if you setup your class library to only expose what it needs to, you can get by without documenting private and internal members.Setting the warning level to 2 suppresses this messages. Don\'t know if it\'s the best solution as it also suppresses useful warnings.File > Edit > View Project (click)Bottom of the drop down bow (click on Open/Current work > Properties),\nopened project properties page at "Build" under "Output". "Uncheck" XML Documentation checkbox.Rebuild and no warnings.In your solution, once you check the option to generate XML Document file, it start checking your public members for having the XMLDoc, if they don\'t you receive a warning per each element.\nif you don\'t really want to release your DLL, and also you don\'t need documentations then, go to your solution, build section, and turn it off, else you need it, so fill them, and if there are unimportant properties and fields, just surpass them with pre-compiler instruction\n#pragma warning disable 1591\nyou can also restore the warning :\n#pragma warning restore 1591You need to add /// Comment for the member for which warning is displayed.see below code It displays warning \nMissing XML comment for publicly visible type or member \'.EventLogger()\'I added comment for the member and warning gone.I got that message after attached an attribute to a methodBut the correct way was this:
