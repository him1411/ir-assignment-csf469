This question already has an answer here:I\'m currently trying out Genymotion and boy, it\'s so much faster than the ADT emulator.But I need to install Google Play to download some apps into it. How do I do this?# How To Add Google Apps and ARM Support to Genymotion v2.0+ #Note(Feb 2nd): Contrary to previous reports, it\'s been discovered that Android 4.4 does in fact work with ARM translation, although it is buggy. Follow the steps the same as before, just make sure you download the 4.4 GApps.UPDATE-v1.1: I\'ve gotten more up-to-date builds of libhoudini and have updated the ZIP file. This fixes a lot of app crashes and hangs. Just flash the new one, and it should work.This guide is for getting back both ARM translation/support (this is what causes the "INSTALL_FAILED_CPU_ABI_INCOMPATIBLE" errors) and Google Play apps in your Genymotion VM.I\'ve tested this on Genymotion v2.0.1-v2.1 using Android 4.3 and 4.4 images. Feel free to skip the GApps steps if you only want the ARM support. It\'ll work perfectly fine by itself.Old Zips: v1.0. Don\'t download these as they will not solve your issues. It is left for archival and experimental purposes. Since the previous answer no longer applies for new devices created with Genymotion 2.0, here is a new solution.Install Google Play on Genymotion 2.0The reason it no longer applies is because Genymotion no longer includes Google Apps in the virtual device image. According to Genymotion they are working with Google, but in the meantime this is a good workaround.EDIT 2After three months we can say: no more official Google Apps in Genymotion and CyanogenMod-like method is only way to get Google Apps. However, you can still use the previous project of the Genymotion team: AndroVM (download mirror).EDITGoogle apps will be removed from Genymotion in November. You can find more information on the Genymotion Google Plus page.Choose virtual device with Google Apps:Done:4.4 Kitkat\n5.0 Lollipop\n5.1 Lollipop\n6.0 Marshmallow\n7.0 Nougat\n7.1 Nougat (webview patch)\nNote :- The above process can be automated if you install OpenGapps apk in your device.

However, if you\n  really need them, you can use the packages provided by OpenGapps.\n  Simply follow these steps:I could flash the ARM translation but not the gapps, using https://stackoverflow.com/a/20013322/98057.
