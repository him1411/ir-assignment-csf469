I began making changes to my codebase, not realizing I was on an old topic branch. To transfer them, I wanted to stash them and then apply them to a new branch off of master. I used git stash pop to transfer work-in-progress changes to this new branch, forgetting that I hadn\'t pulled new changes into master before creating the new branch. This resulted in a bunch of merge conflicts and loss of a clean stash of my changes (since I used pop).Once I recreate the new branch correctly, how I can I recover my stashed changes to apply them properly? As it turns out, Git is smart enough not to drop a stash if it doesn\'t apply cleanly. I was able to get to the desired state with the following steps:Luckily git stash pop does not change the stash in the case of a conflict!So nothing, to worry about, just clean up your code and try it again.Say your codebase was clean before, you could go back to that state with: git checkout -f\nThen do the stuff you forgot, e.g. git merge missing-branch\nAfter that just fire git stash pop again and you get the same stash, that conflicted before.
