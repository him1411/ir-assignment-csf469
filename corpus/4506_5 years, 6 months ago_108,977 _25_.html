The following use of super() raises a TypeError: why?There is a similar question on StackOverflow: Python super() raises TypeError, where the error is explained by the fact that the user class is not a new-style class.  However, the class above is a new-style class, as it inherits from object:What am I missing? How can I use super(), here?Using HTMLParser.__init__(self) instead of super(TextParser, self).__init__() would work, but I would like to understand the TypeError.PS: Joachim pointed out that being a new-style-class instance is not equivalent to being an object. I read the opposite many times, hence my confusion (example of new-style class instance test based on object instance test: https://stackoverflow.com/revisions/2655651/3).Alright, it\'s the usual "super() cannot be used with an old-style class".However, the important point is that the correct test for "is this a new-style instance (i.e. object)?" isand not (as in the question):For classes, the correct "is this a new-style class" test is:The crucial point is that with old-style classes, the class of an instance and its type are distinct. Here, OldStyle().__class__ is OldStyle, which does not inherit from object, while type(OldStyle()) is the instance type, which does inherit from object.  Basically, an old-style class just creates objects of type instance (whereas a new-style class creates objects whose type is the class itself). This is probably why the instance OldStyle() is an object: its type() inherits from object (the fact that  its class does not inherit from object does not count: old-style classes merely construct new objects of type instance). Partial reference: https://stackoverflow.com/a/9699961/42973.PS: The difference between a new-style class and an old-style one can also be seen with:(old-style classes are not types, so they cannot be the type of their instances).super() can be used only in the new-style classes, which means the root class needs to inherit from the \'object\' class.For example, the top class need to be like this:notSo, the solution is that call the parent\'s init method directly, like this way:You can also use class TextParser(HTMLParser, object):. This makes TextParser a new-style class, and super() can be used.If you look at the inheritance tree (in version 2.6), HTMLParser inherits from SGMLParser which inherits from ParserBase which doesn\'t inherits from object. I.e. HTMLParser is an old-style class.About your checking with isinstance, I did a quick test in ipython:Even if a class is old-style class, it\'s still an instance of object.The problem is that super needs an object as a ancestor:On closer examination one finds:But:So the solution to your problem would be to inherit from object as well as from HTMLParser.\nBut make sure object comes last in the classes MRO:the correct way to do will be as following in the old-style classes which doesn\'t inherit from \'object\'
