On a form I\'m working on, Chrome is auto-filling the email and password fields. This is fine, however, Chrome changes the background colour to a pale yellow colour.The design I\'m working on is using light text on a dark background, so this really messes up the look of the form - I have stark yellow boxes and near-invisible white text. Once the field is focused, the fields return to normal.Is it possible to stop Chrome changing the colour of these fields?I know it\'s stupid, but I think it works!Additionally, you can use this to change the text color:Advice: Don\'t use an excessive blur radius in the hundreds or thousands. This has no benefit and might put processor load on weaker mobile devices. (Also true for actual, outside shadows). For a normal input box of 20px height, 30px \xe2\x80\x98blur radius\xe2\x80\x99 will perfectly cover it.I have a better solution.Setting the background to another color like below didn\'t solve the problem for me because I needed a transparent input fieldSo I tried some other things and I came up with this:The previous solutions of adding a box-shadow works well for people who need a solid colour background. The other solution of adding a transition works, but having to set a duration/delay will mean that at some point it may show again.My solution is to use keyframes instead, that way it will always show the colours of your choosing.This has been as designed since this coloring behavior has been from WebKit. It allows the user to understand the data has been prefilled. Bug 1334You could turn off autocomplete by doing (or on the specific form control:Or you can change the colour of the autofill by doing:Note, there is a bug being tracked for this to work again: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=46543This is a WebKit behavior.This is my solution, I used transition and transition delay therefore I can have a transparent background on my input fields. A possible workaround for the moment is to set a "strong" inside shadow:try this for hide autofill styleAll of the above answers worked but did have their faults. The below code is an amalgamation of two of the above answers that works flawlessly with no blinking.SASSAfter 2 hours of searching it seems google still overrides the yellow color somehow but i for the fix for it. That\'s right. it will work for hover, focus etc as well. all you have to do is add !important to it.this will completely remove yellow from input fields If you want to keep the autocomplete functionality intact you can use a bit of jQuery to remove Chrome\'s styling. I wrote a short post about it here:\nhttp://www.benjaminmiles.com/2010/11/22/fixing-google-chromes-yellow-autocomplete-styles-with-jquery/In addition to this:You might also want to addOther wise, when you click on the input, the yellow color will come back. \nFor the focus, if you are using bootstrap, the second part is for the border highlighting  0 0 8px rgba(82, 168, 236, 0.6); Such that it will just look like any bootstrap input.I had an issue where I couldn\'t use box-shadow because I needed the input field to be transparent. It\'s a bit of a hack but pure CSS. Set the transition to a very long amount of time. I have developed another solution using JavaScript without JQuery. If you find this useful or decide to re-post my solution, I only ask that you include my name. Enjoy. \xe2\x80\x93 Daniel FairweatherThis code is based on the fact that Google Chrome removes the Webkit style as soon as additional text is entered. Simply changing the input field value does not suffice, Chrome wants an event. By focusing on each input field (text, password), we can send a keyboard event (the letter \'a\') and then set the text value to it\'s previous state (the auto-filled text). Keep in mind that this code will run in every browser and will check every input field within the webpage, adjust it accordingly to your needs.For those who are using Compass:Try this:\n  Same as @Nathan-white answer above with minor tweaks.I\'ve got a solution if you want to prevent the autofill from google chrome but its a little bit "machete" , just remove the class that google chrome adds to those inputs fields and set the value to "" if you dont need to show store data after load.The solution of Daniel Fairweather (Removing input background colour for Chrome autocomplete?) (I would love to upvote his solution, but still need 15 rep) works really good. There is a really huge difference with most upvoted solution : you can keep background images ! But a little modification (just Chrome check)And you need to keep in mind, it ONLY works on visible fields ! So you if you are using $.show() for your form, you need to run this code After show() eventMy full solution (I have a show/hide buttons for login form ): Sorry again, I would prefer it to be a comment. If you want, I can put a link to the site where I used it.Thanks Benjamin! The Mootools solution is a little more tricky, as I can\'t get fields by using  $(\'input:-webkit-autofill\'), So what I\'ve used is the following:I give up!Since there is no way to change the color of the input with autocomplete I decide to disable all of them with jQuery for webkit browsers. Like this:None of the solutions worked for me, the inset shadow won\'t work for me because the inputs have a translucent background overlaid over the page background.So I asked myself, "How does Chrome determine what should be autofilled on a given page?""Does it look for input ids, input names? Form ids? Form action?"Through my experimentation with the username and the password inputs, there were only two ways I found that would cause Chrome to not be able to find the fields that should be autofilled:1) Put the password input ahead of the text input. 2) Give them the same name and id ... or no name and id at all.After the page loads, with javascript you can either dynamically change the order of the inputs on the page, or dynamically give them their name and id ...And Chrome doesn\'t know what hit it ... autocomplete is broken!Crazy hack, I know. But it\'s working for me.Chrome 34.0.1847.116, OSX 10.7.5I know the asker wanted to change only the input field, but use this to to set defaults on all common field types.Unfortunately strictly none of the above solutions worked for me in 2016 (a couple years after the question)So here\'s the aggressive solution I use:Basically, it deletes the tag while saving the value, and recreates it, then puts back the value.This guy has a great solution using JS and works perfectly.As mentioned before, inset -webkit-box-shadow for me works best.Also code snippet to change text color:Simple, just add,to the password field.This is complex solution for this task.use this and check your problem issue is resolved ha sorry wrong place, but for HTML 5 search bars a Pure Css solution, I don\'t know if its very good standards practice but you can change the webkit appearance of the search to a button then just style it how you want.It might be a little late but for future referent there is a CSS ONLY solution as Olly Hodgons shows here \nhttp://lostmonocle.com/post/1479126030/fixing-the-chrome-autocomplete-background-colourAll you have to do is to add a further selector to overwrite the default input fields setting \nSo use instead of Somthing like or which seems to work fine with me.
