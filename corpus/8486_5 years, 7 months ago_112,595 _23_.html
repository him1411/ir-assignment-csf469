How do you split a window/view in Eclipse IDE? I want to edit code while viewing the different code in the same file.If there is a trick to open the same file twice, this might do, but I would rather just split the one current view instead of having two of the same which might get confusing.Starting with Eclipse Luna 4.4 M4, as mentioned by Lars Vogel in "Split editor implemented in Eclipse M4 Luna", this is possible with the menu items Window>Editor>Toggle Split Editor.This solves one of the oldest and most upvoted Eclipse bug! Bug 8009:The split editor functionality has been developed in Bug 378298, and will be available as of Eclipse Luna M4. The Note & Newsworthy of Eclipse Luna M4 will contain the announcement.\n  Current shortcut for splitting is:Azerty keyboard:Qwerty US keyboard:You can open a new editor from the Window menu.This will give you your current editor once again.If you right click on one of the tabs, one of the options should be New Editor (for me, it\'s at the bottom). Select that, and then drag the new tab onto the bottom scroll bar of the code editor, which will split the editor panel in two.Side by side editors in single Eclipse window.ADT/Eclipse:Build: v22.3.0-887826I tried the above solutions in Eclipse Luna 4.4.1 but couldn\'t open two (or multiple editor windows for different files side by side).
