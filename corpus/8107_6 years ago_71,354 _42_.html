I know ctrl+shift+backspace is used to go to the last edit location.But I want to jump to the location where I was previously but not necessarily edited anything.For example if I jumped to a declaration using ctrl+B then I want to go back to where I was before jumping.Ctrl + Alt + LeftorCtrl + E (Recent Files pop-up).Also check: \nCtrl + Shift + E (Recent Edited Files pop-up).For Mac users, replace Ctrl with commandUpdate In v12.0 it\'s Alt + shift +left\n  instead of Alt + Ctrl  + left Update 2 In v14.1 (and possibly earlier) it\'s ctrl + [Update 3 IntelliJ Idea 2016.3 Ctrl + Alt  + leftThe underlying problem is Ctrl+Alt+Left and Right are used by window managers to switch workspace and/or OEM utilities to change the screen orientation.You can change the assignments using \nFile / Settings / Keymap then Main Menu / Navigate find  Back and Forward and right click to Add Keyboard Shortcut to set an alternative key chord.Alt Graph+Left and Alt Graph+Right works well for me (IDEA 13.1.4 on Ubuntu under IceWM).CMD + [  -> Go PreviousCMD + ] -> Go Next==========For OSX, cmd + [ and ] are the best choices to go back & forth, Since they are found so near to fingers, avoiding you wrist twisting a bit, one keypress lesser, ideal for users in vim mode. As the OP requested, this works well with cmd + B which facilitates jumping inside/to the method/variable definition and comes back immediately using cmd + [. Give a try. For Ubuntu, Ctrl + Alt + Left and Ctrl + Alt + Right work fine.By default these keys are assigned for Ubuntu\'s workspace navigation. You need to disable that by going to : System Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts Tab > Navigation and disable Switch to workspace left and Switch to workspace right by pressing Backspace.Or you can choose to change shortcuts in Intellij itself:Q & A is built into Intellij ... CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + A x 2  TYPE caretFor version 14. On mac, it is \xe2\x8c\xa5(alt) + \xe2\x8c\x98 + \xe2\x86\x90OSX and Android Studio version:CMD+ [ and CMD+ ]to move to the previous carret location.Like @itsneo said, I personally find cmd + [ and ] the most convenient ones on a mac. But I can understand if you come from Linux side of things. Then you can use cmd + alt + left or right.In IntellJ 2017.2,Ctrl+[ and Ctrl+] navigate between previous locations in the current file.Ctrl+Alt+← and Ctrl+Alt+→ navigate between previous locations in all files.Navigate back/forwardCtrl\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89Alt + Left/Right Many excellent answers so far, and they do answer the question...But, if you don\'t want to have to deal with disabling graphics driver\'s settings, or creating new keyboard mappings, or are developing through a remote session (RDP) or within a VM that intercepts your keystrokes, good-old keyboard navigation still works. Just do Alt-N to bring up the Navigate menu and then hit the B key. Please note that you don\'t hit all keys at the same time. So:Alt-N wait B This is what I use all the time, for exactly the case that the OP asked about.\nAlso, this will probably hold through any IntelliJ updates.If you are on a mac keyboard using with UNIX OS;control + alt + command + left or right should work for sure.
