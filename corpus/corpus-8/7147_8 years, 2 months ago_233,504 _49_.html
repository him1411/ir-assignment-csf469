I have a project that contains a single module, and some dependencies.\nI\'d like to create a jar, in a separate directory, that contains the compiled module. In addition, I\'d like to have the dependencies present beside my module.No matter how I twist IntelliJ\'s "build jar" process, the output of my module appears empty (besides a META-INF file).Here\'s how to build a jar with IntelliJ 10 http://blogs.jetbrains.com/idea/2010/08/quickly-create-jar-artifact/File -> Project Structure -> Project Settings -> Artifacts -> Click green plus sign -> Jar -> From modules with dependencies...The above sets the "skeleton" to where the jar will be saved to. To actually build and save it do the following: Extract to the target JarOKBuild | Build ArtifactI recently had this problem and think these steps are easy to follow if any prior solution or link is missing detail.How to create a .jar using IntelliJ IDEA 14.1.5:For those that benefit from images as I do:File -> Project Structure This is still an issue in 2017, I hope it will help somebody out there!\nI found 2 possibilities to create working jar-s under IntelliJ 2017.21. Creating artifact from IntelliJ:You have to change manifest directory:change java to resourcesThis is how it should look like:Then you choose the dependencies what you want to be packed IN your jar, or NEAR your jar fileTo build your artifact go to build artifacts and choose "rebuild". It will create an "out" folder with your jar file and its dependencies.2. Using maven-assembly-pluginAdd build section to the pom fileThis procedure will create the jar file under the "target" folderIt is probably little bit late, but I managed to solve it this way -> \nopen with winrar and delete ECLIPSEF.RSA and ECLIPSEF.SF in META-INF folder, moreover put "Main-class: main_class_name" (without ".class") in MANIFEST.MF. Make sure that you pressed "Enter" twice after the last line, otherwise it won\'t work.Idea 8.1.3Jar is ok, since there is compiled output in \'output\' directory (project/out/production//)I guess, you have to run \'make\' before building jarfor dependencies just check "show library" and choose what you want.You might want to take a look at Maven (http://maven.apache.org). You can use it either as the main build process for your application, or just to perform certain tasks through the Edit Configurations dialog. The process of creating a JAR of a module within Maven is fairly trivial, if you want it to include all the dependencies in a self-executable JAR that is trivial as well.If you\'ve never used Maven before then you want to read Better Builds With Maven.With Maven you can use this plugin:If you are using third party libraries with your project or if you have problems with creating MANIFEST.MF file properly, there can be conflicts when running JAR files generated using method mentioned above.Instead I suggest you to create an empty JAR and add all other elements to the output root manually. A wonderful blog article for this method can be found here: http://karthicraghupathi.com/2016/07/10/creating-an-executable-jar-in-intellij-idea/ I tried the steps mentioned there and everything worked fine for me! Ant and Maven are widely used.  I prefer Ant, I feel it\'s more lightweight and you the developer are more in control.  Some would suggest that\'s its downside :-)
