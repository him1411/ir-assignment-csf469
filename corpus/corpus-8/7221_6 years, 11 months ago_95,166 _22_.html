Is there a way to do something like thisusing Bash?ternary operator ? : is just short form of if/elseOrCode:If the condition is merely checking if a variable is set, there\'s even a shorter form:will assign to a the value of VAR if VAR is set, otherwise it will assign it the default value 20 -- this can also be a result of an expression.As alex notes in the comment, this approach is technically called "Parameter Expansion".This will avoid executing the part after || by accident when the code between && and || fails.The cond && op1 || op2 expression suggested in other answers has an inherent bug: if op1 has a nonzero exit status, op2 silently becomes the result; the error will also not be catched in -e mode.Note the quotes. The first pair will prevent a syntax error if $b is blank or has whitespace. Others will prevent translation of all whitespace into single spaces.Here is another option where you only have to specify the variable you\'re assigning once, and it  doesn\'t matter whether what your assigning is a string or a number:Just a thought. :)The let command supports most of the basic operators one would need:Naturally, this works only for assigning variables; it cannot execute other commands.The following seems to work for my use cases:and can be used in a script like so:Here are some options:1- Use if then else in one line, it is possible.2- Write a function like this:use inside script like this3- Inspired in the case answer, a more flexible and one line use is:
