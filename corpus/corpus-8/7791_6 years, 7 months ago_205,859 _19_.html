When I look at the buffer after the call to copyPixelsToBuffer the bytes are all 0... The bitmap returned from the camera is immutable... but that shouldn\'t matter since it\'s doing a copy. What could be wrong with this code?Try something like this:Use CompressFormat is too slow...Try use ByteBuffer.\xe2\x80\xbb\xe2\x80\xbb\xe2\x80\xbbBitmap to byte\xe2\x80\xbb\xe2\x80\xbb\xe2\x80\xbb\xe2\x80\xbb\xe2\x80\xbb\xe2\x80\xbbbyte to bitmap\xe2\x80\xbb\xe2\x80\xbb\xe2\x80\xbbDo you need to rewind the buffer, perhaps?Also, this might happen if the stride (in bytes) of the bitmap is greater than the row length in pixels * bytes/pixel. Make the length of bytes b.remaining() instead of size.Your byte array is too small.  Each pixel takes up 4 bytes, not just 1, so multiply your size * 4 so that the array is big enough.Use below functions to encode bitmap into byte[] and vice versaIn order to avoid OutOfMemory error for bigger files, I would solve the task by splitting a bitmap into several parts and merging their parts\' bytes.Ted Hopp is correct, from the API Documentation :"... After this method returns, the current position of the buffer is updated: the position is incremented by the number of elements written in the buffer.\n"and"Reads bytes from the current position into the specified byte array, starting at the specified offset, and increases the position by the number of bytes read."Try this to convert String-Bitmap or Bitmap-StringEasy way:Call this to get the byte[] array of a Bitmap:
