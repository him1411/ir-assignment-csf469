I observed that when i use Logcat with Eclipse with ADT for Android, I get messages from many other applications as well. Is there a way to filter this and show only messages from my own application only.Package names are guaranteed to be unique so you can use the Log function with the tag as your package name and then filter by package name:NOTE: As of Build Tools 21.0.3 this will no longer work as TAGS are restricted to 23 characters or less.Log.<log level>("<your package name>", "message");adb -d logcat <your package name>:<log level> *:S-d denotes an actual device and -e denotes an emulator. If there\'s more than 1 emulator running you can use -s emulator-<emulator number> (eg, -s emulator-5558) Example: adb -d logcat com.example.example:I *:SOr if you are using System.out.print to send messages to the log you can use adb -d logcat System.out:I *:S to show only calls to System.out.You can find all the log levels and more info here: https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/logcat.htmlhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Log.htmlEDIT: Looks like I jumped the gun a little and just realized you were asking about logcat in Eclipse. What I posted above is for using logcat through adb from the command line. I\'m not sure if the same filters transfer over into Eclipse.Use ps/grep/cut to grab the PID, then grep for logcat entries with that PID. Here\'s the command I use:(You could improve the regex further to avoid the theoretical problem of unrelated log lines containing the same number, but it\'s never been an issue for me)This also works when matching multiple processes.Add filterSpecify namesChoose your filter.It\'s been a few years, and thing have changed. And Eclipse is no longer officially supported. So here\'s two more up-to-date approaches:\nIn the Android monitor toolbox, you can filter logcat per debuggable process. Normally, when you develop an application it is a debuggable process. Every once in a while I am having issues with this, and a do the following:Tools -> Android -> Enable ADB Integration. \nIf it was already enabled, then toggle it off, and then back onUnplug and replug your mobile device.There are also options to filter via regex and the debug levelThis is a nice python wrapper on top of adb logcat if you want to use a terminal based solution. The good thing about it is that you can save multiple configurations and simply reuse them. Filtering by tags is quite reliable. You can also filter by package to see logs of one or more apps only, but you start logcat-color right before launching your app.It seems that I can\'t comment to previous answers, so I will post a new one.\nThis is a comment to Tom Mulcahy\'s answer, that shows how the command should change so as to work on most devices, since adb shell ps PID column is variable.NOTE: The command below works for the cases where you have connected many devices. So device id is needed. Otherwise, you can simply omit the brackets \'[\', \']\'1. To find out the column of pid, type:Now memorise the column number for the PID. Numbering starts from 1.2. Then type the following:Simply put the column you memorised in PUT_COLUMN_HERE, e.g. $5Each time you re-run your application, you have to re-run the 2nd command, because the application gets a new PID from the OS.For me this works in mac Terminal\nGot to the folder where you have adb then type below command in terminalHere it will filter all logs of MyTAG and AndroidRuntimeThis has been working for me in git bash:put this to applog.shthen:\napplog.sh com.example.my.packageADT v15 for Eclipse let you specify an application name (which is actually the package value in your androidmanifest.xml).I love being able to filter by app, but the new logcat has a bug with the autoscroll.  When you scroll up a little to look at previous logs, it automatically scrolls back to the bottom in a couple seconds.  It seems scrolling 1/2 way up the log does keep it from jumping back to the bottom, but that\'s often useless.EDIT: I tried specifying an app filter from the command-line -- but no luck.  If someone figures this out OR how to stop the autoscroll, please let me know.If you are using Android Studio you can select the process from which you want to receive logcats. \nHere is the screenshot.I wrote a shell script for filtering logcat by package name, which I think is more reliable than usingIt uses /proc/$pid/cmdline to find out the actual pid, then do a grep on logcathttps://gist.github.com/kevinxucs/7340e1b1dd2239a2b04aUsing Windows command prompt: adb logcat -d | findstr <package>.*This was first mentioned by jj_, but it took me ages to find it in the comments...I\'m not sure there\'s a way to only see system messages regarding your app, but you can filter based on a string.  If you\'re doing a log within the program, you can just include a certain unique keyword, and filter based on that word.Just use the filters inside the logcat. There is a button there that lets you add filters. Just specify the application ID, make sure it is selected afterwards, and you\'re done, easy!Try: Window -> Preferences -> Android -> LogCat. Change field "Show logcat view if ..." the value "VERBOSE". It helped me.If you are using Eclipse, press the green + sign in the logCat window below and put your package name (com.example.yourappname) in the by Application Name box. Also, choose any name comfortable to you in Filter Name box and click ok. You will see only messages related to your application when the filter you just added is chosen from the left pane in the logCat.Give your log a name. I called mine "wawa". In Android Studio, go to Android-> Edit Filter Configurations Then type in the name you gave the logs. In my case, it\'s called "wawa". Here are some examples of the types of filters you can do. You can filter by System.out, System.err, Logs, or package names:\n\nUse -s !You should use your own tag, look at:\n  http://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Log.html Like.  And then when you want to read the log use> That filters out everything that doesn\'t use the same tag.SourceIn addition to Tom Mulcahy\'s answer, if you want to filter by PID on Windows\' console, you can create a little batch file like that:Now is possible to type tag:nameofthetag or app:nameoftheapp to filter without adding new filters to the saved filters barIn intelliJ (and probably in eclipse also) you can filter the logcat output by text webview, so it prints basically everything phonegap is producingI tried to use Tom Mulcahy\'s answer but unfortunately it was not working for applications with multiple processes so I edit it to fit my needs.This is probably the simplest solution. On top of a solution from Tom Mulcahy, you can further simplify it like below:Usage is easy as normal alias. Just type the command in your shell:The alias setup makes it handy. And the regex makes it robust for multi-process apps, assuming you care about the main process only. Of coz you can set more aliases for each process as you please. Or use hegazy\'s solution. :)In addition, if you want to set logging levels, it isYet another variant of Gavriel\'s applog.sh with support of several devices and applications with multiple processes:Usage: applog.sh com.example.my.package [-s <specific device>]This works for me with USB debugging:Connect the device and use: adb shellSimple use the logcat:logcat | grep com.youapp.packagenameThis is obviously a question aimed at usage of Logcat from outside of the developer device, however if you want to display Logcat output on the device (programmatically), you just need this:The *:D at the end filters out every message below Debug log level but you can leave that out.To direct the output to, say, a TextView, see for example here.
