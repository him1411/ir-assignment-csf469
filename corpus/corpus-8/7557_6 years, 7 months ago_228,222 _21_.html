Say I have a file /templates/apple and I want toSo, /templates/apple will be copied to /templates/used AND /templates/inuse\nand then after that I\xe2\x80\x99d like to remove the original.Is cp the best way to do this, followed by rm? Or is there a better way?I want to do it all in one line so I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking it would look something like:Is this the correct syntax?You are using | (pipe) to direct the output of a command into another command. What you are looking for is && operator to execute the next command only if the previous one succeeded:Or To summarize (non-exhaustively) bash\'s command operators/separators:Why not cp to location 1, then mv to location 2. This takes care of "removing" the original.And no, it\'s not the correct syntax. | is used to "pipe" output from one program and turn it into input for the next program. What you want is ;, which seperates multiple commands.If you require that the individual commands MUST complete before the next can be started, then you\'d use && instead:That way, if either of the cp commands fails, the rm will not run.Note that cp A B; rm A is exactly mv A B. It\'ll be faster too, as you don\'t have to actually copy the bytes (assuming the destination is on the same filesystem), just rename the file. So you want cp A B; mv A CTry this..cp /templates/apple /templates/used && cp /templates/apple /templates/inuse && rm /templates/appleUsing pipes seems weird to me. Anyway you should use the logical and bash operator.If the cp commands fail, the rm will not be executed.Or, you can make a more elaborated command line using a for loop and cmp.RenaudVery Simple : Just use && between each commandEDIT: Its working for me.
