I have a text in a textarea and I read it out using the .value attribute.\nNow I would like to remove all linebreaks(the character that is produced when you press enter) from my text now using .replace with a regular expression, but how do I indicate a linebreak in a regex?\nIf that is not possible, is there any other way?This is probably a FAQ.  Anyhow, line breaks (better: newlines) can be one of Carriage Return (CR, \\r, on older Macs), Line Feed (LF, \\n, on Unices incl. Linux) or CR followed by LF (\\r\\n, on WinDOS). (Contrary to another answer, this has nothing to do with character encoding.)Therefore, the most efficient RegExp literal to match all variants isIf you want to match all newlines in a string, use a global match,respectively.  Then proceed with the replace method as suggested in several other answers. (Probably you do not want to remove the newlines, but replace them with other whitespace, for example the space character, so that words remain intact.)How you\'d find a line break varies between operating system encodings. Windows would be \\r\\n but Linux just uses \\n and Apple uses \\r.I found this in javascript line breaksThat should remove all kinds of line breaks.String.trim() removes whitespace from the beginning and end of strings... including newlines.Here\'s an example fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/BLs8u/NOTE! it only trims the beginning and end of the string, not line breaks or whitespace in the middle of the string.If you want to remove all control characters, including CR and LF, you can use this:It will remove all non-printable characters. This are all characters NOT within the ASCII HEX space 0x20-0x7E. Feel free to modify the HEX range as needed.You can use \\n in a regex for newlines, and \\r for carriage returns.Different operating systems use different line endings, with varying mixtures of \\n and \\r. This regex will replace them all.A linebreak in regex is \\n, so your script would beTry this code, works on all platforms:The answer provided by PointedEars is everything most of us need. But by following  Mathias Bynens\'s answer, I went on a Wikipedia trip and found this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline.The following is a drop-in function that implements everything the above Wiki page considers "new line" at the time of this answer.If something doesn\'t fit your case, just remove it. Also, if you\'re looking for performance this might not be it, but for a quick tool that does the job in any case, this should be useful.\nThe simplest solution would be:.replace() with /\\s+/g regexp is changing all groups of white-spaces characters to a single space in the whole string then we .trim() the result to remove all exceeding white-spaces before and after the text.  Are considered as white-spaces characters:\n[ \\f\\n\\r\\t\\v\xe2\x80\x8b\\u00a0\\u1680\xe2\x80\x8b\\u2000\xe2\x80\x8b-\\u200a\\u2028\\u2029\\u202f\\u205f\\u3000\\ufeff]
