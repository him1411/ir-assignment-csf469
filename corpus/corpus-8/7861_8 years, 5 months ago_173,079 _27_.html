I have a batch file that\'s calling the same executable over and over with different parameters.  How do I make it terminate immediately if one of the calls returns an error code of any level?Basically, I want the equivalent of MSBuild\'s ContinueOnError=false.Check the errorlevel in an if statement, and then exit /b (exit the batch file only, not the entire cmd.exe process) for values other than 0.If you want the value of the errorlevel to propagate outside of your batch filebut if this is inside a for it gets a bit tricky. You\'ll need something more like:Edit: You have to check the error after each command. There\'s no global "on error goto" type of construct in cmd.exe/command.com batch. I\'ve also updated my code per CodeMonkey, although I\'ve never encountered a negative errorlevel in any of my batch-hacking on XP or Vista.Add || goto :label to each line, and then define a :label.For example, create this .cmd file:See also question about exiting batch file subroutine.The shortest:If you need, you can set the exit code:And you can also log:One minor update, you should change the checks for "if errorlevel 1" to the following...This is because on XP you can get negative numbers as errors. 0 = no problems, anything else is a problem. And keep in mind the way that DOS handles the "IF ERRORLEVEL" tests.  It will return true if the number you are checking for is that number or higher so if you are looking for specific error numbers you need to start with 255 and work down.No matter how I tried, the errorlevel always stays 0 even when msbuild failed. So I built my workaround:Build Project and save log to Build.logsearch for "0 Error" string in build log, set the result to varget the last character, which indicates how many lines contains the search string if string not found, then error > 0, build failed That solution was inspired by Mechaflash\'s post at How to set commands output as a variable in a batch file and https://ss64.com/nt/syntax-substring.html We cannot always depend on ERRORLEVEL, because many times external programs or batch scripts do not return exit codes.In that case we can use generic checks for failures like this:And if the program outputs something to console, we can check it also.Just use ERRORLEVEL to achieve the outcome that you want. There are two variables in the ERRORLEVELcommand that would determine if a process failed or succeeded, these variable are ERRORLEVEL 0 and ERRORLEVEL 1 (1 for fail, 0 for pass). Here is an example on how this would be used in a Batch File:Here is a link with more info if you need it: Errorlevels
