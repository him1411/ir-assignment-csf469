How do I see the current encoding of a file in Sublime Text 2?This seems like a pretty simple thing to do but searching has not yielded much. Any pointers would be appreciated!Since this thread is a popular result in google search, here is the way to do it for sublime text 3 build 3059+:\nin user preferences, add the line:Another option in case you don\'t wanna use a plugin:Ctrl+` \norView -> Show Consoletype on the console the following command:In case you want to something more intrusive, there\'s a option to create an shortcut that executes the following command:With the EncodingHelper plugin you can view the encoding of the file on the status bar. Also you can convert the encoding of the file and extended another functionalities.For my part, and without any plug-in, simply saving the file either from the File menu or with keyboards shortcutsCTRL + S (Windows, Linux) or CMD + S (Mac OS)briefly displays the current encoding - between parentheses - in the status bar, at the bottom of the editor\'s window. This suggestion works in Sublime Text 2 and 3.Note that the displayed encoding to the right in the status bar of Sublime Text 3, may display the wrong encoding of the file if you have attempted to save the file with an encoding that can\'t represent all the characters in your file. \nIn this case you would have seen an informational dialog and Sublime telling you it\'s falling back to UTF-8. This may not be the case, so be careful. ShowEncoding is another simple plugin that shows you the encoding in the status bar. That\'s all it does, to convert between encodings use the built-in "Save with Encoding" and "Reopen with Encoding" commands.plugin ConverToUTF8 also has the functionality.
