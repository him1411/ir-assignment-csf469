I am setting multiple markers on my map and I can set statically the zoom levels and the center but what I want is, to cover all the markers and zoom as max as possible having all markets visible Available methods are following setZoom(zoom:number)and setCenter(latlng:LatLng)Neither setCenter supports multiple location or Location array input nor setZoom does have any this type of functionalityYou need to use the fitBounds() method.Reference: To extend the given answer with few useful tricks:UPDATE:\nFurther research in the topic show that fitBounds() is a asynchronic\nand it is best to make Zoom manipulation with a listener defined before calling Fit Bounds.\nThanks @Tim, @xr280xr, more examples on the topic : SO:setzoom-after-fitbounds There is this MarkerClusterer client side utility available for google Map as specified here on Google Map developer Articles, here is brief on what\'s it\'s usage:There are many approaches for doing what you asked for:You can read about them on the provided link above.Marker Clusterer uses Grid Based Clustering to cluster all the marker wishing the grid. Grid-based clustering works by dividing the map into squares of a certain size (the size changes at each zoom) and then grouping the markers into each grid square.Before Clustering\nAfter Clustering\nI hope this is what you were looking for & this will solve your problem :)
