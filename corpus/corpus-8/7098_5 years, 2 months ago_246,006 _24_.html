Is there any difference between the above three methods to remove an element from a list?Yes, remove removes the first matching value, not a specific index:del removes a specific index:and pop returns the removed element:Their error modes are different too:Use del to remove an element by index, pop() to remove it by index if you need the returned value, and remove() to delete an element by value.  The latter requires searching the list, and raises ValueError if no such value occurs in the list.When deleting index i from a list of n elements, the computational complexities of these methods areSince no-one else has mentioned it, note that del (unlike pop) allows the removal of a range of indexes because of list slicing:This also allows avoidance of an IndexError if the index is not in the list:pop    : Takes Index & returns Valueremove : Takes value, removes first occurrence and returns nothing delete : Takes index, removes value at that index and returns nothingWhile pop and delete both take indices to remove an element as stated in above comments. A key difference is the time complexity for them. The time complexity for pop() with no index is O(1) but is not the same case for deletion of last element.If your use case is always to delete the last element, it\'s always preferable to use pop() over delete(). For more explanation on time complexities, you can refer to https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/ICS-33/lectures/complexitypython.txt Any operation/function on different data structures is defined for particular actions. Here in your case i.e. removing an element, delete, Pop and remove. (If you consider sets, Add another operation - discard)\nOther confusing case is while adding. Insert/Append. \nFor Demonstration, Let us Implement deque. deque is a hybrid linear data structure, where you can add elements / remove elements from both ends.(Rear and front Ends) In here, see the operations:Operations have to return something. So, pop -  With and without an index. \nIf I don\'t want to return the value:\ndel self.items[0]Delete by value not Index: remove : let us consider the case of sets.Already answered quite well. This one from my end :)You can also use remove to remove a value by index as well.  n would then refer to [1, 5]
