I want to install a file using the windows command line. First I want to build after compiling all the .jar files to create an .apk file for an android application without using Eclipse.Does anyone know how this can be done without the use of eclipse & only by making use of command line.You can use the code below to install application from command linethis apk is installed in the internal memory of current opened emulator.this apk is installed in the sd-card of current opened emulator.You can also install an apk to specific device in connected device list to the adb.Refer also to adb help for other options.You can install an apk to a specific device/emulator by entering the device/emulator identifier before the keyword \'install\' and then the path to the apk. Note that the -s switch, if any, after the \'install\' keyword signifies installing to the sd card. Example:Use the Android Debug Bridge command line tool adb eg: adb install filename.apk.A good reference for adb is HereYou can build on the command line with ant. See this guide.Then, you can install it by using adb on the command line.The simple way to do that is by commandand if you want to target connect device you can add parameter " -d "if you have more than one device/emulator connected you will get this erroradb: error: connect failed: more than one device/emulator\n  - waiting for device - error: more than one device/emulatorto avoid that you can list all devices by below commandyou will get results like belowchose one of these devices and add parameter to adb command as " -s a3b09hh3e " as belowalso as a hint if the path of the apk long and have a spaces, just add it between double quotes  like It is so easy!for example my apk file location is: d:\\myapp.apk1.run cmd2.navigate to "platform-tools" folder(in the sdk folder)3.start your emulator device(let\'s say its name is 5556:MyDevice)4.type this code in the cmd:adb -s emulator-5556 install d:\\myapp.apkwait for a while and it\'s DONE!!
