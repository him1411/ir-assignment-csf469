I am working on a query in Sql Server 2005 where I need to convert a value in DateTime variable into a varchar variable in yyyy-mm-dd format (without time part). How do I do that?With Microsoft Sql Server:Here\'s some test sql for all the styles. Make nvarchar(max) shorter to trim (e.g. nvarchar(10)) . Here\'s the resultTry the following:For a full date time and not just date do:   See this page for convert styles:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms187928.aspx\nOR\nSQL Server CONVERT() FunctionSQL Server 2012 has a new function , FORMAT: \nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee634924.aspxand you can use custom date time format strings: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee634398.aspxThese pages imply it is also available on SQL2008R2, but I don\'t have one handy to test if that\'s the case.Example usage (Australian datetime): be aware that YYYY-MM-DD is ambiguous, depending on your language settings. best to use ISO standard YYYYMMDD, see this blog postEither Cast or Convert:Syntax for CAST:Syntax for CONVERT:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms187928.aspxActually since you asked for a specific format:You can use DATEPART(DATEPART, VARIABLE). For example:-- This gives you the time as 0 in format \'yyyy-mm-dd 00:00:00.000\'With Microsoft SQL Server:Use Syntax for CONVERT:Example:For the style you can find more info here: MSDN - Cast and Convert (Transact-SQL).Try:More on ms sql tipsTry the following:Then you would need to replace the "." with "-".Here is a site that helps\nhttp://www.mssqltips.com/tip.asp?tip=1145I have fixed data length of char(10) as you want a specific string format.The OP mentioned datetime format.  For me, the time part gets in the way.\nI think it\'s a bit cleaner to remove the time portion (by casting datetime to date) before formatting.This is how I do it: CONVERT(NVARCHAR(10), DATE1, 103) )CONVERT, see MSDN documentation.You did not say which database, but with mysql here is an easy way to get a date from a timestamp (and the varchar type conversion should happen automatically):The shortest and the simplest way is :You can convert your date in many formats, the syntaxe is simple to use :In your case, i\'ve just converted and restrict size by nvarchar(10) like this :See more at : http://www.w3schools.com/sql/func_convert.aspAnother solution (if your date is a Datetime) is a simple CAST :Try this SQL:You don\'t say what language but I am assuming C#/.NET because it has a native DateTime data type. In that case just convert it using the ToString method and use a format specifier such as:However, I would caution against using this in a database query or concatenated into a SQL statement. Databases require a specific formatting string to be used. You are better off zeroing out the time part and using the DateTime as a SQL parameter if that is what you are trying to accomplish.
