I\'ve just re-installed XAMPP, and when I try to start my Apache server in the XAMPP Control Panel, I now get the following errors:How do I solve this?Open Skype. Tools -> Options -> Advanced -> Connection. Disable the "Use port 80 and 443 for alternatives for incoming connections"Sign Out and Close all Skype windows. Try restarting your Apache.As I am working in a corporate environment where developers faces firewall issues, none of the other answers resolved my issue.As the port is not used by Skype, but by some other internal applications,\nI followed the below steps to resolve the issue:Step 1 - From the XAMPP Control Panel, under Apache, click the Config button, and select the Apache (httpd.conf).Inside the httpd.conf file, somehow I found a line that says:And change the 80 into any number / port you want. In my scenario I\xe2\x80\x99m using port 8080.Still from the httpd.conf file, I found another line that says:Step 2 -  From the XAMPP Control Panel, under Apache, click the Config button again, but this time select the Apache (httpd-ssl.conf). Inside the httpd-ssl.conf file, find line that saysAnd change the 443 into any number / port you want. I\xe2\x80\x99ll using 4433 as the new port number.Still from the httpd-ssl.conf file, find another line that saysAnd change 443 to 4433.Remember to save the httpd.conf and httpd-ssl.conf files after performing some changes. Then restart the Apache service.One thing you can do is to stop the services on port 80 by issuingin a cmd. You\'ll be asked if you\'re sure you want to stop those services. I found out that I had a few services I wasn\'t using and disabled them.To see who else is using port 80 type in a cmdI\'m assuming you want to run Apache on port 80. If this is the case and you want to keep the conflicting services you will need to associate them to a new port.If the problem is not a busy port you can also try the following: select "show debug information" in the XAMPP config panel. When starting Apache you\'ll be shown something like "Executing "c:\\xampp\\apache\\bin\\httpd.exe". If you run thatin a cmd you will get some more information (I once for instance had some issue with my httpd.conf file).Related: How do I free my port 80 on localhost Windows? and Apache won't run in xamppFollow these steps:Choose the "Apache (httpd.conf)" and find this code below and change it into this one:#Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below#to prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses.#Listen 0.0.0.0:80#Listen [::]:80Listen 80# Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) Support# Note: Configurations that use IPv6 but not IPv4-mapped addresses need two#       Listen directives: "Listen [::]:443" and "Listen 0.0.0.0:443"##Listen 0.0.0.0:443#Listen [::]:443Listen 443Just wait for it and your computer/laptop will be automatically restart and try to open your XAMPP control panel again, and then start your Apache.My problem was that in httpd.conf the DocumentRoot and <Directory> entries were pointing to non-existing folders.For example, the \'original\' httpd.conf had the following entries:If you\'ve installed in C:\\xampp then you need to change those entries to match, i.e.In the XAMPP Control Panel V3.2.1, click on "NetStat" button on top right. Make sure port 80 is not used by any other program. Then click on "Shell" Right below it. Issue this command "Type ap then TAB two times"Apache_Start.batYou will actually see the exact error why Apache failed. It will be mostly likely virtual host configuration issue or may something else. It will display the line number on which the error is occuring. Just fix that error. Note that in RootDocument  a trailing \\ can be a source of error as well. Remove an trailing "\\".For more detail answer, check hereI had the same issue, and it turns out I forgot to run setup_xampp.bat (portable version).If you\'re using Windows 7 . Search for IIS in Windows search (Click the Window icon in left bottom and type in where it says \'Search program and files\') .Open IIS (Internet Information Service) .In the right side in actions panel. Click Stop.Note: The stop link is faded in screen shot. As I\'ve stopped it.\n\nProblem Solved!I had the same problem sometime back. I had a old laptop, on which almost all the ports were either blocked or were malfunctioning. This is how I did it. Open the XAMPP control panel.Click on ConfigThen, go into Apache httpd.conf file. Open it with a text editor.Search for "80"  (Do Ctrl + F and find all of them. Replace it with 8080 or 4040 or 4000). Save the file. And restart XAMPP. It worked well for me, and I hope it helps you too.For me, world wide web publishing-service was using port 80. I killed this by running the following command on cmd:After that, XAMPP ran Apache without any problems.The simple thing that you can do is to check if Skype or VMware is installed in your machine or not.Skype uses port 80 and 443 as an additional port for incoming connections. To change the port number in Skype, go toTools > Connection Options > Connectionin the Skype window. Now change the default 80 port number to something other.VMware Workstation uses port 443 for sharing. To change this, open VMware Workstation and gotoEdit > Preferences > Shared VmsThat\'s all you have to do. Restart XAMPP and run the Apache server.When I found that there was no process using port 80 by using commandsthere was not a problem of any process using port 80.Then I ran command (in cmd)it showed some error in the virtual hosts configuration in httpd-vhosts.conf file which was recently edited by me for installation in a WordPress PHP environment in the Eclipse IDE. So I deleted those lines and Apache started perfectly.This error occurs because the port, which is allocated for Apache, is used by another program. To check the application which uses the port, which we allocated for Apache, it can be had by clicking,Netstat button.This is the Netstat file,At first, I have allocated port 8080 for Apache, and I recently installed Oracle DB.TNSLSNR.exe has used 8080 port now.So, by looking at this file we can choose a port which is not clashing with other applications. In my case, port 8060 is not clashing with any application. By selecting that we can change the httpd.conf file (XAMPP control panel -> Config) as mentioned above.For me, this problem began when I hosted a VPN-connection on my Windows 8 computer.Simply deleting the connection from "Control Panel\\Network and Internet\\Network Connections" solved the problem.Note that whenever you change the default ports, your browser will not know about that. 80 and 443 seem to be standard in some way, so for example, if you changed 80 to 8080, you\'ll have to access your websites this way then:localhost:8080/path_to_your_website.phpThis happend due to default port 80 is blocked for Apache. You need to change the port or make the port accesible.Go to your Apache configuration (httpd.conf)  file in the Apache installation.Find these lines:#Listen 192.168.1.2:80Listen 80#Here 192.168.1.2 is my private IP address. Change it according to yours.Change as belowListen 192.168.1.2:8081Listen 8081Now when you access localhost you have to add the port explicitily as\nhttp://localhost:8081/...One of the causes could be that you are not running the XAMPP Control Panel as an administrator.In my case, this issue was caused by an attempt to download other product of bitnami, like WordPress. That\'s common when we install WordPress via XAMPP. It is placed in the xampp/app directory that can be accessed from the XAMPP application homepage.As a solution, I removed the default installed WordPress from the xampp directory and manually installed WordPress in the htdocs folder of WordPress by downloading it and extracting zip files into the htdoc folder. You also need to restart XAMPP or may system after uninstalling/removing the default WordPress. All is OK for me now. The Apache server by default runs on ports 80, 443. Your problem is one or both of the two ports are busy. Usually Skype or VMware Workstation use these two ports. So, make sure that they\'re not running. The best way to make sure the ports are free on windows is :Click windows button.In the search bar type resmon, to open the resource monitor resmon.exe.Open Listening Ports, this will show you the opened used ports.Now you can see which process is using ports 80 and 443.Then you can kill the process either from CMD using its PID (which is shown in the resource monitor), or directly from Task Manager. To kill a process from CMD using PID type Taskkill /PID 26356 /F, where 26356 is the PID.I solved the problem with stopping the service "Web Deployment Agent Service". Open: System -> Computer Management -> Services -> Web Deployment Agent Service. Stop this service and starting XAMPP works.\nI think this is a service by MS Webmatrix.(German: Systemsteuerung -> System und Sicherheit -> Verwaltung -> Dienste -> Webbereitstellungs-Agent-Dienst)In my case this happened after installing sql server and the solution was as described in this answerXampp - Can't start Apache after install SQL Server and Visual Studioso I had to just disable "SQL Server Reporting Services" service from Windows servicesFirst of all you should verify that you have no excess virtual hosts in your httpd-vhosts file. I mean following simple rule: 1 project = 1 virtual host in config file. Otherwise you\'ll face with error even if you\'ll change ports etc.I had the exact same error message as the OP, but my problem was not addressed by any of the existing answers.  Many of the answers deal with conflicts on port 80, which I knew I did not have, since I had had localhost responding on port 80 very recently.Turns out I had inadvertently changed ServerRoot when I intended to change DocumentRoot (stupid, I know), and though the new ServerRoot directory existed, it did not contain the configuration files and other stuff apache needed, which caused it to fail on startup.  The error message probably addresses this scenario by the wording \'missing dependencies\'.On my Windows system, setting ServerRoot back to C:/XAMPP/apache solved the problem.Best Solution for windows user is :Make at first sure your \\xampp folder is in the root! This is important as the path is relative. Then make sure you run the xampp_control.exe with admin rights.Then change the files below to avoid issues with blocked port 80.In \\xampp\\xampp-control.ini it should be set: Find \\xampp\\apache\\conf\\httpd.conf and set:Find \\xampp\\apache\\conf\\extra\\httpd-ssl.conf and set: Then end all services and restart xampp-control.exe with admin rights. It should run!I tried to execute httpd.exe in cmd and got error that there\'s syntax error in httpd-vhosts.conf. \nI checked file and found what\'s wrong and it\'s working fine now. So, if you are facing this error then it may be because of httpd-vhosts or any other file. Try to execute the program via cmd and you will get the error details and the line where is syntax error. Best of luck It seems that no one has answered about executing xampp_start.exe.I did all the previous answers but it did not fixed my issue. I found out that running xampp_start.exe will give you a detailed info about the issue.This was I see on my end:As you can see I was having a path issue or xampp is pointing to non-existing folder.Installing the latest 5.6.12 from 5.6.8 on Windows 8.1 worked for me.I received the same error above and what caused it for me was that in the file \'httpd-vhosts.conf\' I put a comment inside the <Directory> tags like this...Once I removed the comment, Apache started. I guess I should have put the comment on its own line. I just thought, like other web code, it could be there.
