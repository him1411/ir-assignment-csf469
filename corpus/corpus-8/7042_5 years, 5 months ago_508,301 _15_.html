I have an R data frame with 6 columns, and I want to create a new dataframe that only has three of the columns.Assuming my data frame is df, and I want to extract columns A, B, and E, this is the only command I can figure out:Is there a more compact way of doing this?Yes, there is.This is the role of the subset() function:There are two obvious choices:  Joshua Ulrich\'s df[,c("A","B","E")] or as in Using the dplyr package, if your data.frame is called df1:This can also be written without the %>% pipe as:Again using dplyr, where df1 is your original data frame:You can also use the sqldf package which performs selects on R data frames as :df1 <- sqldf("select A, B, E from df")This gives as the output a data frame df1 with columns: A, B ,E.[  and subset are not substitutable:[ does return a vector if only one column is selected.
