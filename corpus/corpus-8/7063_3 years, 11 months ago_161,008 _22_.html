I want to set background for Navigation Bar to be black and all colors inside it to be white.So, I used this code :But back button text color, arrow and bar button have still default blue color.\nHow to change those colors like on image below?Behavior from some of the properties of UINavigationBar has changed from iOS 7. You can see in the image shown below :Two beautiful links I\'d like to share with you. For more details you can go through these links :Apple Documentation for barTintColor says :This color is made translucent by default unless you set the\n  translucent property to NO.Sample Code :This one took me about half a day to figure out but this is what worked for me.\nInside the rootViewController that initializes the navigationController, I put this code inside my viewDidAppear method:My full post on this hereSwift3, ios 10To globally assign the color, in AppDelegate didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:Vin\'s answer worked great for me.

This is how you can change the text/title color for the navbar in ios7:It seems that Accessibility controls in the iOS Settings override pretty much everything you try to do color-wise to the navigation bar buttons. Make sure you have all the settings to the default positions (set increase contrast, bold text, button shapes, etc to off) otherwise you won\'t see anything change. Once I did it, all the color change code started working as expected. You might not need to turn them all off, but I didn\'t pursue it further.
