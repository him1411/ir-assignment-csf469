The best way I can describe what I\'m looking for is to show you the failed code I\'ve tried thus far:I\'ve got about 4 or 5 different when situations that should be triggered by approximately 50 different possible values of car. Is there a way to do this with case blocks or should I try a massive if block?In a case statement, a , is the equivalent of || in an if statement. Some other things you can do with a Ruby case statementYou might take advantage of ruby\'s "splat" or flattening syntax.This makes overgrown when clauses \xe2\x80\x94 you have about 10 values to test per branch if I understand correctly \xe2\x80\x94 a little more readable in my opinion.  Additionally, you can modify the values to test at runtime.  For example:Another common approach would be to use a hash as a dispatch table, with keys for each value of car and values that are some callable object encapsulating the code you wish to execute.Another nice way to put your logic in data is something like this:
