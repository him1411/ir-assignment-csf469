Can someone please tell me how exactly to use getExtra() and putExtra() for Intent. Actually I have a string variable say str, which stores some string data. Now I want to send this data from one activity to the other activity.    and then in the SecondScreen.javaI know it is very basic question but unfortunately I am stuck here. \nPlease help.Thanks,edited : Here the string which I am trying to pass from one screen to the other is dynamic.\nThat is I have an editText where I am getting string whatever user types. Then with the help of myEditText.getText().toString() . I am getting the entered value as a string then I have to pass this data.Use this to "put" the file...Then, to retrieve the value try something like:first Screen.javaSecond Screen.javaBest Method...SendingActivity  RecievingActivity/// shortest way to recieve data..//This requires api 12.\n            //the second parameter is optional . If keyName is null then use the defaultkey as data.This is what i have been using, hopfully it helps someone.. simple and affective.send dataget datacheers!It is very easy to implement intent in Android.. It takes you to move from one activity to another activity,we have to two method putExtra(); and getExtra();Now I am showing you the example..Now we have to get the value from AnyKeyName parameter,the below mentioned code will help in doing thisWe can easily set the receiving value from Intent,wherever we required.More simple sender sidereceiver sideinvoked activity.put functionPush DataThe above code might be inside the main activity. "MyActivity.class" is the second Activity we want to launch; it must be explicitly included in your AndroidManifest.xml file.Pull DataIn this example, the above code would be inside your MyActivity.java file.GotchasThis method can only pass strings. So let\'s say you need to pass an ArrayList to your ListActivity; a possible workaround is to pass a comma-separated-string and then split it on the other side.Alternative SolutionsUse SharedPreferencesSimple,\nIn first Activity-In second Activity-You can add if/else conditions if you want.put string firstretrieve it after that thats All ;)
