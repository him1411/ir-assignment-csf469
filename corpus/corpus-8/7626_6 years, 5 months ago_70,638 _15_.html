Intersect can be used to find matches between two collections, like so:However what I\'d like to achieve is the opposite, I\'d like to list the items that are missing when comparing two collections:As stated, if you want to get 4 as the result, you can do like this:If you want the real non-intersection (also both 1 and 4), then this should do the trick:This will not be the most performant solution, but for small lists it should work just fine.You can use Or you can use This code enumerates each sequence only once and uses Select(x => x) to hide the result to get a clean Linq-style extension method. Since it uses HashSet<T> its runtime is O(n + m) if the hashes are well distributed. Duplicate elements in either list are omitted.I think you might be looking for Except:The Except operator produces the set\n  difference between two sequences. It\n  will only return elements in the first\n  sequence that don\'t appear in the\n  second. You can optionally provide\n  your own equality comparison function.Check out this link, this link, or Google, for more information.I\'m not 100% sure what your NonIntersect method is supposed to do (regarding set theory) - is it\nB \\ A (everything from B that does not occur in A)?\nIf yes, then you should be able to use the Except operation (B.Except(A)).array1.NonIntersect(array2);Nonintersect such operator is not present in Linq you should doexcept -> union -> except
