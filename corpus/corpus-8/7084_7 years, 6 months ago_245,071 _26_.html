I have the following method to save an Object to a file:I confess I did not write it (I only converted it to a extension method that took a type parameter).Now I need it to give the xml back to me as a string (rather than save it to a file).  I am looking into it, but I have not figured it out yet.I thought this might be really easy for someone familiar with these objects.  If not I will figure it out eventually.Use a StringWriter instead of a StreamWriter:Note, it is important to use toSerialize.GetType() instead of typeof(T) in XmlSerializer constructor: if you use the first one the code covers all possible subclasses of T (which are valid for the method), while using the latter one will fail when passing a type derived from T.\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\nHere is a link with some example code that motivate this statement, with XmlSerializer throwing an Exception when typeof(T) is used, because you pass an instance of a derived type to a method that calls SerializeObject that is defined in the derived type\'s base class: http://ideone.com/1Z5J1.Also, Ideone uses Mono to execute code; the actual Exception you would get using the Microsoft .NET runtime has a different Message than the one shown on Ideone, but it fails just the same.I know this is not really an answer to the question, but based on the number of votes for the question and the accepted answer, I suspect the people are actually using the code to serialize an object to a string.Using XML serialization adds unnecessary extra text rubbish to the output.For the following classit generates Better solution is to use JSON serialization (one of the best is Json.NET).\nTo serialize an object:To deserialize an object:The serialized JSON string would look like:Regarding the accepted answer, it is important to use toSerialize.GetType() instead of typeof(T) in XmlSerializer constructor: if you use the first one the code covers all possible scenarios, while using the latter one fails sometimes. Here is a link with some example code that motivate this statement, with XmlSerializer throwing an Exception when typeof(T) is used, because you pass an instance of a derived type to a method that calls SerializeObject<T>() that is defined in the derived type\'s base class: http://ideone.com/1Z5J1. Note that Ideone uses Mono to execute code: the actual Exception you would get using the Microsoft .NET runtime has a different Message than the one shown on Ideone, but it fails just the same. For the sake of completeness I post the full code sample here for future reference, just in case Ideone (where I posted the code) becomes unavailable in the future:Serialize and Deserialize:My 2p...I was unable to use the JSONConvert method suggested by xhafanIn .Net 4.5 even after adding the "System.Web.Extensions" assembly reference I was still unable to access the JSONConvert.However, once you add the reference you can get the same string print out using:The content of the question mentions XML but since the question is "Serialize an object to string" I will provide code to serialize to JSON (using Newtonsoft.Json library) since it is more common scenario at the time of this answer. In some rare cases you might want to implement your own String serialization. But that probably is a bad idea unless you know what you are doing. (e.g. serializing for I/O with a batch file)Something like that would do the trick (and it would be easy to edit by hand/batch), but be careful that some more checks should be done, like that name doesn\'t contain a newline.
