Given the name of a Python (2.X) package that can be installed with pip and virtualenv, is there any way to find out a list of all the possible versions of it that pip could install? Right now it\'s trial and error.I\'m trying to install a version for a third party library, but the newest version is too new, there were backwards incompatible changes made. So I\'d like to somehow have a list of all the versions that pip knows about, so that I can test them.The script at pastebin does work. However it\'s not very convenient if you\'re working with multiple environments/hosts because you will have to copy/create it every time.A better all-around solution would be to use yolk, which is available to install with pip. E.g. to see what versions of Django are available:A minor caveat: yolk depends on distribute. This is not a bad thing, but it may be a problem if you need for some reason to stick with (the deprecated) python setuptools.Note: I am not involved in the development of yolk. If something doesn\'t seem to work as it should, leaving a comment here should not make much difference. Use the yolk issue tracker instead and consider submitting a fix, if possible.Without actually having to download or install any additional packages you can use the syntax for specifying a particular version while not actually specifying any version, and the available versions will be printed:update: I had changed my answer to have nothing after the ==, this however doesn\'t work for older versions of pip (those of you should probably update pip) add any string after the == that is not likely to be an install candidate:Use pip install -v, you can see all versions that availableTo not install any package, use one of following solution:or Tested with pip 1.0You don\'t need a third party package to get this information. pypi provides simple JSON feeds for all packages underHere\'s some Python code using only the standard library which gets all versions.That code prints (as of Feb 23rd, 2015):You could the yolk3k package instead of yolk. yolk3k is a fork from the original yolk and it supports both python2 and 3.https://github.com/myint/yolkAfter looking at pip\'s code for a while, it looks like the code responsible for locating packages can be found in the PackageFinder class in pip.index. Its method find_requirement looks up the versions of a InstallRequirement, but unfortunately only returns the most recent version. The code below is almost a 1:1 copy of the original function, with the return in line 114 changed to return all versions.The script expects one package name as first and only argument and returns all versions.http://pastebin.com/axzdUQhZI can\'t guarantee for the correctness, as I\'m not familiar with pip\'s code. But hopefully this helps.Sample outputThe code:I came up with dead-simple bash script. Thanks to jq\'s author.Update: Add sorting by version number.https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Django/ - works for packages whose maintainers choose to show all packages\nhttps://pypi.python.org/simple/pip/ - should do the trick anyhow (lists all links)Pip 7.1.0 has removed --no-install option from install. I found a method to get all versions of a package without any extra package.I just ran this:e.g.:I didn\'t have any luck with yolk, yolk3k or pip install -v but so I ended up using this (adapted to Python 3 from eric chiang\'s answer):You can use this short Python3 snippet to grab the list of available versions for a package from PyPI. Unlike some other Python solutions posted here, this doesn\'t break on loose versions like django\'s 1.10rc1 or uwsgi\'s 2.0.13.1:This works for me on OSX:pip install docker-compose== 2>&1 | grep -oE \'(\\(.*\\))\' | awk -F:\\  \'{print$NF}\' | sed -E \'s/( |\\))//g\' | tr \',\' \'\\n\'It returns the list one per line:Or to get the latest version available:pip install docker-compose== 2>&1 | grep -oE \'(\\(.*\\))\' | awk -F:\\  \'{print$NF}\' | sed -E \'s/( |\\))//g\' | tr \',\' \'\\n\' | gsort -r -V | head -1Keep in mind gsort has to be installed (on OSX) to parse the versions. You can install it with brew install coreutilsI know this is kind of silly but you can try something like this:This will error out but will list all the versions that are available for this package.Just replace django with the package you want and also I believe, hopefully,  there is no such version called x.you can grep the result of your pip list
