This question already has an answer here:I want to add a new property to \'myObj\', name it \'string1\' and give it a value of \'string2\', but when I do it it returns \'undefined:In other words: How do I create an object property and give it the name stored in the variable, but not the name of the variable itself?There\'s the dot notation and the bracket notationES6 introduces computed property names, which allow you to doNote browser support is currently negligible.Dot notation and the properties are equivalent. So you would accomplish like so:(alerts "whatever")Ecu, if you do myObj.a, then it looks for the property named a of myObj.\nIf you do myObj[a] =b then it looks for the a.valueOf() property of myObj.Oneliner:Or:Anything more shorter?As $scope is an object, you can try with JavaScript by:It is equal to:I created a fiddle to test.You could just use this:Anything you pass as the first parameter will be the property name, and the second parameter is the property value.You cannot use a variable to access a property via dot notation, instead use the array notation.The following demonstrates an alternative approach for returning a key pair object using the form of (a, b). The first example uses the string \'key\' as the property name, and \'val\' as the value.Example #1:Example: #2:As shown in the second example, this can modify existing objects, too (if property is already defined in the object, value will be overwritten).Result #1: { key: \'val\' }Result #2: { foo: \'bar\', key: \'val\' }
