When I try to use the Chrome Developer Tools, it seems I can no longer view it in a new window.Is this a bug or that is really included on an update?How can we open the Chrome Developer Tools in a new window?Here\'s a screenshot of what I\'m talking about.Click and hold the button next to the close button of the Developer Tool in order to reveal the "Undock into separate window" option.Note: A "press" is not enough in that state.UPDATE:As of Chrome 52, the UI has changed. When the Developer Tools dialog is open, you select the vertical ellipsis and can then choose the docking position:You have to click and hold until the other icon shows up, then slide the mouse down to the icon.Just type ctrl+shift+I in google chrome & you will land in an isolated developer window.
