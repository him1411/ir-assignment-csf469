I have a basic controller that displays my products,In my view I\'m displaying this products in a listWhat I\'m trying to do is when someone click on the product name, i have another view named cart where this product is added.So my doubt here is, how do pass this clicked products from first controller to second? i assumed that cart should be a controller too.I handle click event using directive. Also i feel i should be using service to achieve above functionality just can\'t figure how? because cart will be predefined number of products added could be 5/10 depending on which page user is. So i would like to keep this generic.Update: I created a service to broadcast and in the second controller i receive it. Now the query is how do i update dom? Since my list to drop product is pretty hardcoded.From the description, seems as though you should be using a service. Check out http://egghead.io/lessons/angularjs-sharing-data-between-controllers and AngularJS Service Passing Data Between Controllers to see some examples.You could define your product service as such:Dependency inject the service into both controllers. In your ProductController, define some action that adds the selected object to the array:In your CartController, get the products from the service:how do pass this clicked products from first controller to second?On click you can call method that invokes broadcast:and the second controller will listen on this tag like:Since we can\'t inject $scope into services, there is nothing like a singleton $scope. But we can inject $rootScope. So if you store value into the Service, you can run $rootScope.$broadcast(\'SOME_TAG\', \'your value\'); in the Service body. (See @Charx description about services)Please check good article about $broadcast, $emitSolution without creating Service, using $rootScope:To share properties across app Controllers you can use Angular $rootScope. This is another option to share data, putting it so that people know about it.The preferred way to share some functionality across Controllers is Services, to read or change a global property you can use $rootscope.Using $rootScope in a template (Access properties with $root):You can do this by two methods.By using $rootscope, but I don\'t reccommend this. The $rootScope is the top-most scope. An app can have only one $rootScope which will be\nshared among all the components of an app. Hence it acts like a\nglobal variable.Using services. You can do this by sharing a service between two controllers. Code for service may look like this:You can see my fiddle here.An even simpler way to share the data between controllers is using nested data structures. Instead of, for examplewe can useThe data property will be inherited from parent scope so we can overwrite its fields, keeping the access from other controllers.we can store data in session and can use it anywhere in out program.Other placeI\'ve created a factory that controls shared scope between route path\'s pattern, so you can maintain the shared data just when users are navigating in the same route parent path.So, if the user goes to another route path, for example \'/Support\', the shared data for path \'/Customer\' will be automatically destroyed. But, if instead of this the user goes to \'child\' paths, like \'/Customer/1\' or \'/Customer/list\' the the scope won\'t be destroyed.You can see an sample here: http://plnkr.co/edit/OL8of9I saw the answers here, and it is answering the question of sharing data between controllers, but what should I do if I want one controller to notify the other about the fact that the data has been changed (without using broadcast)? EASY! Just using the famous visitor pattern:In this simple manner, one controller can update another controller that some data has been updated.Make a factory in your module and add a reference of the factory in controller and use its variables in the controller and now get the value of data in another controller by adding reference where ever you want  I don\'t know if it will help anyone, but based on Charx (thanks!) answer I have created simple cache service.
