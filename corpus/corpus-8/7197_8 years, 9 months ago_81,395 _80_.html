Some time ago, I saw a Mono application with colored output, presumably because of its log system (because all the messages were standardized). Now, Python has the logging module, which lets you specify a lot of options to customize output. So, I\'m imagining something similar would be possible with Python, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t find out how to do this anywhere. Is there any way to make the Python logging module output in color? What I want (for instance) errors in red, debug messages in blue or yellow, and so on. Of course this would probably require a compatible terminal (most modern terminals are); but I could fallback to the original logging output if color isn\'t supported.Any ideas how I can get colored output with the logging module?I already knew about the color escapes, I used them in my bash prompt a while ago. Thanks anyway.\nWhat I wanted was to integrate it with the logging module, which I eventually did after a couple of tries and errors.\nHere is what I end up with:And to use it, create your own Logger:Just in case anyone else needs it.Be careful if you\'re using more than one logger or handler: ColoredFormatter is changing the record object, which is passed further to other handlers or propagated to other loggers. If you have configured file loggers etc. you probably don\'t want to have the colors in the log files. To avoid that, it\'s probably best to simply create a copy of record with copy.copy() before manipulating the levelname attribute, or to reset the levelname to the previous value, before returning the formatted string (credit to Michael in the comments).Here is a solution that should work on any platform. If it doesn\'t just tell me and I will update it.How it works: on platform supporting ANSI escapes is using them (non-Windows) and on Windows it does use API calls to change the console colors.The script does hack the logging.StreamHandler.emit method from standard library adding a wrapper to it.TestColorer.pyColorer.pyYears ago I wrote a colored stream handler for my own use. Then I came across this page and found a collection of code snippets that people are copy/pasting :-(. My stream handler currently only works on UNIX (Linux, Mac OS X) but the advantage is that it\'s available on PyPI (and GitHub) and it\'s dead simple to use. It also has a Vim syntax mode :-). In the future I might extend it to work on Windows.To install the package:To confirm that it works:To get started with your own code:The default log format shown in the above example contains the date, time, hostname, the name of the logger, the PID, the log level and the log message. This is what it looks like in practice:Quick and dirty solution for predefined log levels and without defining a new class.Update: Because this is an itch that I\'ve been meaning to scratch for so long, I went ahead and wrote a library for lazy people like me who just want simple ways to do things: zenlogColorlog is excellent for this. It\'s available on PyPI (and thus installable through pip install colorlog) and is actively maintained. Here\'s a quick copy-and-pasteable snippet to set up logging and print decent-looking log messages:Output:I updated the example from airmind supporting tags for foreground and background.\nJust use the color variables $BLACK - $WHITE in your log formatter string. To set the background just use $BG-BLACK - $BG-WHITE.So now you can simple do the following in your config file:Look at the following solution. The stream handler should be the thing doing the colouring, then you have the option of colouring words rather than just the whole line (with the Formatter). http://plumberjack.blogspot.com/2010/12/colorizing-logging-output-in-terminals.htmlI modified the original example provided by Sorin and subclassed StreamHandler to a ColorizedConsoleHandler.The downside of their solution is that it modifies the message, and because that is modifying the actual logmessage any other handlers will get the modified message as well.This resulted in logfiles with colorcodes in them in our case because we use multiple loggers.The class below only works on platforms that support ansi, but it should be trivial to add the windows colorcodes to it.Now there is a released PyPi module for customizable colored logging output:https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rainbow_logging_handler/andhttps://github.com/laysakura/rainbow_logging_handlerSupports WindowsSupports DjangoCustomizable colorsAs this is distributed as a Python egg, it is very easy to install for any Python application.You can import the colorlog module and use its ColoredFormatter for colorizing log messages.Boilerplate for main module:The code only enables colors in log messages, if the colorlog module is installed and if the output actually goes to a terminal. This avoids escape sequences being written to a file when the log output is redirected.Also, a custom color scheme is setup that is better suited for terminals with dark background.Some example logging calls:Output:Another minor remix of airmind\'s approach that keeps everything in one class:To use attach the formatter to a handler, something like:A simple but very flexible tool for coloring ANY terminal text is \'colout\'.Where any text in the output of \'myprocess\' which matches group 1 of the regex will be colored with color1, group 2 with color2, etc.For example:i.e. the first regex group (parens) matches the initial date in the logfile, the second group matches a python filename, line number and function name, and the third group matches the log message that comes after that. I also use a parallel sequence of \'bold/normals\' as well as the sequence of colors. This looks like:Note that lines or parts of lines which don\'t match any of my regex are still echoed, so this isn\'t like \'grep --color\' - nothing is filtered out of the output.Obviously this is flexible enough that you can use it with any process, not just tailing logfiles. I usually just whip up a new regex on the fly any time I want to colorize something. For this reason, I prefer colout to any custom logfile-coloring tool, because I only need to learn one tool, regardless of what I\'m coloring: logging, test output, syntax highlighting snippets of code in the terminal, etc.It also avoids actually dumping ANSI codes in the logfile itself, which IMHO is a bad idea, because it will break things like grepping for patterns in the logfile unless you always remember to match the ANSI codes in your grep regex.Here\'s my solution:The bit I had trouble with was setting up the formatter properly:And then to use:While the other solutions seem fine they have some issues. Some do colour the whole lines which some times is not wanted and some omit any configuration you might have all together. The solution below doesn\'t affect anything but the message itself.CodeExampleOutputAs you see, everything else still gets outputted and remain in their initial color. If you want to change anything else than the message you can simply pass the color codes to log_format in the example.I have two submissions to add, one of which colorizes just the message (ColoredFormatter), and one of which colorizes the entire line (ColorizingStreamHandler).  These also include more ANSI color codes than previous solutions.Some content has been sourced (with modification) from:\nThe post above, and http://plumberjack.blogspot.com/2010/12/colorizing-logging-output-in-terminals.html.Colorizes the message only:Colorizes the whole line:Use pyfancy.Example:Just another solution, with the colors of ZetaSyanthis:call it once from your __main__ function. I have something like this there:it also verifies that the output is a console, otherwise no colors are used. Logger("File Name").info("This shows green text")Just answered the same on similar question: Python | change text color in shellThe idea is to use the clint library. Which has support for MAC, Linux and Windows shells (CLI).
