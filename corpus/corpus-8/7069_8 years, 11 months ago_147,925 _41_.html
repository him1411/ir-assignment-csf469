I want to be able to run a single spec file\'s tests â€” for the one file I\'m editing, for example.  rake spec executes all the specs.  My project is not a Rails project, so rake spec:doc doesn\'t work.Don\'t know if this matters, but here is my directory structure.Or you can skip rake and use the \'rspec\' command:In your case I think as long as your ./spec/db_spec.rb file includes the appropriate helpers, it should work fine. If you\'re using an older version of rspec it is:The raw invocation:Now figure out how to embed this into your editor.This question is an old one, but it shows up at the top of Google when searching for how to run a single test.  I don\'t know if it\'s a recent addition, but to run a single test out of a spec you can do the following:where -line number- is a line number that contains part of your test.  For example, if you had a spec like:Let\'s say it\'s saved in spec/models/foo_spec.rb.  Then you would run:and it would just run that one spec.  In fact, that number could be anything from 2 to 5.Hope this helps!You can also use the actual text of the *e*xample test case with -e !So for:you can useno need for rake here.from help (spec -h):Example:  spec spec/runner_spec.rb -l 162If you installed rspec as a plugin rather than as a gem, then you won\'t have the spec executable.At any rate, All you need to do is run the file using ruby. The rspec code is clever enough to run the tests for you.eg:http://github.com/grosser/single_test lets you do stuff like..Ruby 1.9.2 and Rails 3 have an easy way to run one spec file:Explanation:I was having trouble getting any of these examples to work, maybe because the post is old and the commands have changed?After some poking around I found this works:rspec spec/models/user_spec.rbThat will run just the single file and provides useful output in the terminal.specky.vimAlternatively, have a look at autotest.Running autotest in a command window will mean that the spec file will be executed whenever you save it. Also, it will be run whenever the file you are speccing is run.For instance, if you have a model spec file called person_spec.rb, and a model file that it is speccing called person.rb, then whenever you save either of these files from your editor, the spec file will be executed.Lets say, you\'re running test for creating todo. You can always run  that specific todo spec code using the file crete_spec.rb file as below.If you want to run all the specs in one single short.If you want to run all the specs in a specific controller user this.Hope it gives you more understanding!Although many great answers were written to this question, none of them uses the Rspec tags approach. I use tags to run one or more specs in different files -- only those related to my current development task.For example, I add the tag "dev" with the value "current":then I runDifferent tags/values can be set in individual specs or groups.
