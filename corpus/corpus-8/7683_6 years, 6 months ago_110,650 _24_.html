What would be a more simplified description of file descriptors compared to Wikipedia\'s? Why are they required? Say, take shell processes as an example and how does it apply for it?Does a process table contain more than one file descriptor. If yes, why?In simple words, when you open a file, the operating system creates an entry to represent that file and store the information about that opened file. So if there are 100 files opened in your OS then there will be 100 entries in OS (somewhere in kernel). These entries are represented by integers like (...100, 101, 102....). This entry number is the file descriptor.\nSo it is just an integer number that uniquely represents an opened file in operating system.\nIf your process opens 10 files then your Process table will have 10 entries for file descriptors.Similarly when you open a network socket, it is also represented by an integer and it is called Socket Descriptor.\nI hope you understand.A file descriptor is an opaque handle that is used in the interface between user and kernel space to identify file/socket resources. Therefore, when you use open() or socket() (system calls to interface to the kernel), you are given a file descriptor, which is an integer (it is actually an index into the processes u structure - but that is not important). Therefore, if you want to interface directly with the kernel, using system calls to read(), write(), close() etc. the handle you use is a file descriptor.There is a layer of abstraction overlaid on the system calls, which is the stdio interface. This provides more functionality/features than the basic system calls do. For this interface, the opaque handle you get is a FILE*, which is returned by the fopen() call. There are many many functions that use the stdio interface fprintf(), fscanf(), fclose(), which are there to make your life easier. In C, stdin, stdout, and stderr are FILE*, which in UNIX respectively map to file descriptors 0, 1 and 2.Hear it from the Horse\'s Mouth : APUE (Richard Stevens).\nTo the kernel, all open files are referred to by File Descriptors. A file descriptor is a non-negative number.\nWhen we open an existing file or create a new file, the kernel returns a file descriptor to the process.  The kernel maintains a table of all open file descriptors, which are in use. The allotment of file descriptors is generally sequential and they are alloted to the file as the next free file descriptor from the pool of free file descriptors. When we closes the file, the file descriptor gets freed and is available for further allotment.\nSee this image for more details :\nWhen we want to read or write a file, we identify the file with the file descriptor that was returned by open() or create() function call, and use it as an argument to either read() or write().\nIt is by convention that, UNIX System shells associates the file descriptor 0 with Standard Input of a process, file descriptor 1 with Standard Output, and file desciptor 2 with Standard Error.\nFile descriptor ranges from 0 to OPEN_MAX.\nFor more information, go through 3rd chapter of APUE Book.As an addition to other answers, unix considers everything as a file system. Your keyboard is a file that is read only from the perspective of the kernel. The screen is a write only file. Similarly, folders, input-output devices etc are also considered to be files. Whenever a file is opened, say when the device drivers[for device files] requests an open(), or a process opens an user file the kernel allocates a file descriptor, an integer that specifies the access to that file such it being read only, write only etc. [for reference : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file ]More points regarding file descriptorsFile descriptors (FD) is non-negative integers (0,1,2,..), that is associated with the file that is opened.0,1,2 are standard FDs that corresponds STDIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO and STDERR_FILENO. ( defined in unistd.h ) is opens by default on behalf of shell when the program starts.FDs are allotted in the sequential order, means the lowest possible unallotted integer value.FDs for a particular process can be seen in /proc/$pid/fd (on Unix based systems)Any operating system has processes (p\'s) running, say p1, p2, p3 and so forth. Each process usually makes an ongoing usage of files.Each process is consisted of a process tree (or a process table, in another phrasing).Usually, Operating systems represent each file in each process by a number (that is to say, in each process tree/table).The first file used in the process is file0, second is file1, third is file2, and so forth.Any such number is a file descriptor.File descriptors are usually integers (0, 1, 2 and not 0.5, 1.5, 2.5).Given we often describe processes as "process-tables", and given that tables has rows (entries) we can say that the file descriptor cell in each entry, uses to represent the whole entry.In a similar way, when you open a network socket, it has a socket descriptor.In some operating systems, you can run out of file descriptors, but such case is extremely rare, and the average computer user shouldn\'t worry from that.File descriptors might be global (process A starts in say 0, and ends say in 1 ; Process B starts say in 2, and ends say in 3) and so forth, but as far as I know, usually in modern operating systems, file descriptors are not global, and are actually process-specific (process A starts in say 0 and ends say in 5, while process B starts in 0 and ends say in 10).
