How can I get the number of items defined in an enum?You can use the static method Enum.GetNames which returns an array representing the names of all the items in the enum. The length property of this array equals the number of items defined in the enumThe question is:How can I get the number of items defined in an enum?The number of "items" could really mean two completely different things.  Consider the following example.What is the number of "items" defined in MyEnum?Is the number of items 5? (A, B, C, D, E)Or is it 3? (1, 2, 3)The number of names defined in MyEnum (5) can be computed as follows.The number of values defined in MyEnum (3) can be computed as follows.Enum.GetValues(typeof(MyEnum)).Length;A nifty trick I saw in a C answer to this question, just add a last element to the enum and use it to tell how many elements are in the enum:In the case where you\'re defining a start value other than 0, you can use NumberOfTypes - Type1 to ascertain the number of elements.I\'m unsure if this method would be faster than using Enum, and I\'m also not sure if it would be considered the proper way to do this, since we have Enum to ascertain this information for us.From the previous answers just adding code sample.You can use Enum.GetNames to return an IEnumerable of values in your enum and then .Count the resulting IEnumerable.GetNames produces much the same result as GetValues but is faster.[Enum].GetNames(typeof(MyEnum)).Length did not work with me, but\n[Enum].GetNames(GetType(Animal_Type)).length did.I was looking into this just now, and wasn\'t happy with the readability of the current solution. If you\'re writing code informally or on a small project, you can just add another item to the end of your enum called "Length". This way, you only need to type:Of course if others are going to use your code - or I\'m sure under many other circumstances that didn\'t apply to me in this case - this solution may be anywhere from ill advised to terrible.If you find yourself writing the above solution as often as I do then you could implement it as a generic:
