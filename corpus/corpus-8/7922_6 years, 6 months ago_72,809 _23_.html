Why on earth does Visual Studio 2005 generate the .pdb files when compiling in release?  I won\'t be debugging a release build, so why are they generated?Because without the PDB files, it would be impossible to debug a "Release" build by anything other than address-level debugging. Optimizations really do a number on your code, making it very difficult to find the culprit if something goes wrong (say, an exception is thrown). Even setting breakpoints is extremely difficult, because lines of source code cannot be matched up one-to-one with (or even in the same order as) the generated assembly code. PDB files help you and the debugger out, making post-mortem debugging significantly easier.You make the point that if your software is ready for release, you should have done all your debugging by then. While that\'s certainly true, there are a couple of important points to keep in mind:You should also test and debug your application (before you release it) using the "Release" build. That\'s because turning optimizations on (they are disabled by default under the "Debug" configuration) can sometimes cause subtle bugs to appear that you wouldn\'t otherwise catch. When you\'re doing this debugging, you\'ll want the PDB symbols.Customers frequently report edge cases and bugs that only crop up under "ideal" conditions. These are things that are almost impossible to reproduce in the lab because they rely on some whacky configuration of that user\'s machine. If they\'re particularly helpful customers, they\'ll report the exception that was thrown and provide you with a stack trace. Or they\'ll even let you borrow their machine to debug your software remotely. In either of those cases, you\'ll want the PDB files to assist you.Profiling should always be done on "Release" builds with optimizations enabled. And once again, the PDB files come in handy, because they allow the assembly instructions being profiled to be mapped back to the source code that you actually wrote.You can\'t go back and generate the PDB files after the compile.* If you don\'t create them during the build, you\'ve lost your opportunity. It doesn\'t hurt anything to create them. If you don\'t want to distribute them, you can simply omit them from your binaries. But if you later decide you want them, you\'re out of luck. Better to always generate them and archive a copy, just in case you ever need them.If you really want to turn them off, that\'s always an option. In your project\'s Properties window, set the "Debug Info" option to "none" for any configuration you want to change.Do note, however, that the "Debug" and "Release" configurations do by default use different settings for emitting debug information. You will want to keep this setting. The "Debug Info" option is set to "full" for a Debug build, which means that in addition to a PDB file, debugging symbol information is embedded into the assembly. You also get symbols that support cool features like edit-and-continue. In Release mode, the "pdb-only" option is selected, which, like it sounds, includes only the PDB file, without affecting the content of the assembly. So it\'s not quite as simple as the mere presence or absence of PDB files in your /bin directory. But assuming you use the "pdb-only" option, the PDB file\'s presence will in no way affect the run-time performance of your code.* As Marc Sherman points out in a comment, as long as your source code has not changed (or you can retrieve the original code from a version-control system), you can rebuild it and generate a matching PDB file. At least, usually. This works well most of the time, but the compiler is not guaranteed to generate identical binaries each time you compile the same code, so there may be subtle differences. Worse, if you have made any upgrades to your toolchain in the meantime (like applying a service pack for Visual Studio), the PDBs are even less likely to match. To guarantee the reliable generation of ex postfacto PDB files, you would need to archive not only the source code in your version-control system, but also the binaries for your entire build toolchain to ensure that you could precisely recreate the configuration of your build environment. It goes without saying that it is much easier to simply create and archive the PDB files.PDB can be generated for Release as well as for Debug. This is set at (in VS2010 but in VS2005 must be similar):Project \xe2\x86\x92 Properties \xe2\x86\x92 Build \xe2\x86\x92 Advanced \xe2\x86\x92 Debug InfoJust change it to None.Without the .pdb files it is virtually imposible to step through the production code; you have to rely on other tools which can be costly and time consuming. \nI understand you can use tracing or windbg for instance but it really depends on what you want to achieve. \nIn certain scenarios you just want to step through the remote code (no errors or exceptions) using the production data to observe particular behaviour, and this is where .pdb files come handy. Without them running the debugger on that code is impossible. Why are you so sure you will not debug release builds? Sometimes (hopefully rarely but happens) you may get a defect report from a customer that is not reproducible in the debug version for some reason (different timings, small different behaviour or whatever). If that issue appears to be reproducible in the release build you\'ll be happy to have the matching pdb.Also, you can utilize crash dumps to debug your software.  The customer sends it to you and then you can use it to identify the exact version of your source - and Visual Studio will even pull the right set of debugging symbols (and source if you\'re set up correctly) using the crash dump.  See Microsoft\'s documentation on Symbol Stores..PDB file is the short name of "Program Database". It contains the information about debug point for debugger and resources which are used or reference. Its generated when we build as debug mode. Its allow to application to debug at runtime. The size is increase of .PDB file in debug mode. It is used when we are testing our application.No need of this file when release or deploy.

Instead of changing the Debug Info property of every project to none, I thought it would be more expedient to add a post-build event that only works in a specific configuration.Unfortunately, Visual Studio doesn\'t allow you to specify different post-build events for different configurations. So I decided to do this manually, by editing the csproj file of the startup project and adding the following (instead of any existing PostBuildEvent tag):Unfortunately, this will make the post build event textbox blank and putting anything in it can have unpredictable results.
