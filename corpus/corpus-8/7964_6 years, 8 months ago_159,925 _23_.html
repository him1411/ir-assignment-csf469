I want to move one view on top of another, how can I know the z index of the view, and how to move on to top?UIView siblings are stacked in the order in which they are added to their superview. The UIView hierarchy methods and properties are there to manage view order. In UIView.h:The sibling views are ordered back to front in the subviews array. So the topmost view will be:and bottom view will be:Like Kolin Krewinkel said, [parentView bringSubviewToFront:view] will bring the view to the top, but this is only the case if the views are all siblings in the hierarchy.You can use the zPosition property of the view\'s layer (it\'s a CALayer object) to change the z-index of the view.As Viktor Nordling added, "big values are on top. You can use any values you want, including negative values." The default value is 0.You need to import the QuartzCore framework to access the layer. Just add this line of code at the top of your implementation file.IB and SwiftGiven the flowing layout where yellow is the superview and red, green, and blue are sibling subviews of yellow,the goal is to move a subview (let\'s say green) to the top.In the Interface Builder all you need to do is drag the view you want showing on the top to the bottom of the list in the Documents Outline.Alternatively, you can select the view and then in the menu go to Editor > Arrange > Send to Front.There are a couple of different ways to do this programmatically.Method 1An array of the subviews is contained in yellowView.subviews. Here, bringSubviewToFront moves the greenView from index 0 to 2. This can be observed with Method 2If you want to do this through XCode\'s Interface Builder, you can use the menu options under Editor->Arrangement. There you\'ll find "Send to Front", "Send to Back", etc.If you are using cocos2d, you may see an issue with [parentView bringSubviewToFront:view], at least it was not working for me. Instead of bringing the view I wanted to the front, I send the other views back and that did the trick.Within the view you want to bring to the top...\n(in swift)
