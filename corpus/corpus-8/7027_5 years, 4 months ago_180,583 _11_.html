I\'m using iTextSharp to read the text from a PDF file. However, there are times I cannot extract text, because the PDF file is only containing images. I download the same PDF files everyday, and I want to see if the PDF has been modified. If the text and modification date cannot be obtained, is a MD5 checksum the most reliable way to tell if the file has changed? If it is, some code samples would be appreciated, because I don\'t have much experience with cryptography.It\'s very simple using System.Security.Cryptography.MD5:(I believe that actually the MD5 implementation used doesn\'t need to be disposed, but I\'d probably still do so anyway.)How you compare the results afterwards is up to you; you can convert the byte array to base64 for example, or compare the bytes directly. (Just be aware that arrays don\'t override Equals. Using base64 is simpler to get right, but slightly less efficient if you\'re really only interested in comparing the hashes.)This is how I do it:I know this question was already answered, but this is what I use:Where GetHash:Probably not the best way, but it can be handy.Here is a slightly simpler version that I found. It reads the entire file in one go and only requires a single using directive.And if you need to calculate the MD5 to see whether it matches the MD5 of an Azure blob, then this SO question and answer might be helpful: MD5 hash of blob uploaded on Azure doesnt match with same file on local machine
