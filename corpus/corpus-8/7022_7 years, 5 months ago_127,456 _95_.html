I need to use certain font for my entire application. I have .ttf file for the same.\nIs it possible to set this as default font, at application start up and then use it elsewhere in the application? When set, how do I use it in my layout XMLs?Yes with reflection. This works (based on this answer):(Note: this is a workaround due to lack of support for custom fonts, so if you want to change this situation please do star to up-vote the android issue here). Note: Do not leave "me too" comments on that issue, everyone who has stared it gets an email when you do that. So just "star" it please.You then need to overload the few default fonts, for example in an application class:Or course if you are using the same font file, you can improve on this to load it just once.However I tend to just override one, say "MONOSPACE", then set up a style to force that font typeface application wide:I\'ve investigated the reports in the comments that it doesn\'t work and it appears to be incompatible with the theme android:Theme.Material.Light.If that theme is not important to you, use an older theme, e.g.:While this would not work for an entire application, it would work for an Activity and could be re-used for any other Activity. I\'ve updated my code thanks to @FR073N to support other Views. I\'m not sure about issues with Buttons, RadioGroups, etc. because those classes all extend TextView so they should work just fine. I added a boolean conditional for using reflection because it seems very hackish and might notably compromise performance.Note: as pointed out, this will not work for dynamic content! For that, it\'s possible to call this method with say an onCreateView or getView method, but requires additional effort.Then to use it you would do something like this:Hope that helps.There is a great library for custom fonts in android:Calligraphyhere is a sample how to use it. in Gradle you need to put this line into your app\'s build.gradle file:and then make a class that extends Application and write this code:and in the activity class put this method before onCreate:and the last thing your manifest file should look like this:and it will change the whole activity to your font! it\'s simple and clean! I would like to improve weston\'s answer for API 21 Android 5.0.Under API 21, most of the text styles include fontFamily setting, like:Which applys the default Roboto Regular font:The original answer fails to apply monospace font, because android:fontFamily has greater priority to android:typeface attribute (reference). \nUsing Theme.Holo.* is a valid workaround, because there is no android:fontFamily settings inside.Since Android 5.0 put system typeface in static variable Typeface.sSystemFontMap (reference), we can use the same reflection technique to replace it:In summary:Option#1:  Use reflection to apply font (combining weston & Roger Huang\'s answer):Usage in Application class:set up a style to force that font typeface application wide (based on lovefish):Pre-Lollipop:Lollipop (API 21):Option2:   Subclass each and every View where you need to customize font, ie. ListView, EditTextView, Button, etc. (Palani\'s answer):Option 3:   Implement a View Crawler that traverses through the view hierarchy of your current screen:Variation#1 (Tom\'s answer):Usage :Variation#2:   https://coderwall.com/p/qxxmaa/android-use-a-custom-font-everywhere.Option #4:  Use 3rd Party Lib called Calligraphy.Personally, I would recommend Option#4, as it saves a lot of headaches.its very simple...\n1.Download and put ur custom font in assets..then write one separate class for text view as follows:  here i used futura font}and do the following in xml :I would also suggest extending TextView and other controls, but it would be better I consider to set up font in constructs.I would like to improve weston\'s and Roger Huang\'s answers for over API 21 Android lollipop with theme "Theme.AppCompat".Below Android 4.4Over(equal) API 5.0And the FontsOverride util file is same as what in weston\'s answer. \nI have tested in these phones:Nexus 5(android 5.1 Primary Android System) ZTE V5(android 5.1 CM12.1) XIAOMI note(android 4.4 MIUI6)HUAWEI C8850(android 2.3.5 UNKNOWN)\nWorking for Xamarin.Android:Class:Application Implementation:Style:A brilliant solution can be found here: https://coderwall.com/p/qxxmaa/android-use-a-custom-font-everywhere.Simply extend activities from BaseActivity and write those methods. Also you should better cache fonts as described here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/16902532/2914140.After some research I wrote code that works at Samsung Galaxy Tab A (Android 5.0). Used code of weston and Roger Huang as well as https://stackoverflow.com/a/33236102/2914140. Also tested on Lenovo TAB 2 A10-70L, where it doesn\'t work.\nI inserted a font \'Comic Sans\' here in order to see a difference.To run the code in entire application you should write in some class like Application the following:Create a folder \'fonts\' inside \'assets\' and put needed fonts there. A simple instruction may be found here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/31697103/2914140.The Lenovo device also incorrectly gets a value of a typeface. In most times it returns Typeface.NORMAL, sometimes null. Even if a TextView is bold (in xml-file layout). See here: TextView isBold always returns NORMAL. This way a text on a screen is always in a regural font, not bold or italic. So I think it\'s a bug of a producer.You can set custom fonts for every layout one by one ,with just one function call from every layout by passing its root View.First ,create a singelton approach for accessing font object like this You can define different fonts in above class, Now Define a font Helper class that will apply fonts : In the above code, I am applying fonts on textView and EditText only , you can apply fonts on other view elements as well similarly.You just need to pass the id of your root View group to the above apply font method. for example your layout is :In the Above Layout the root parent id is "Main Parent " now lets apply font Cheers :) I would suggest extending TextView, and always using your custom TextView within your XML layouts or wherever you need a TextView. In your custom TextView, override setTypefaceAs of Android O this is now possible to define directly from the XML and my bug is now closed!See here for detailsTL;DR:First you must add your fonts to the projectSecond you add a font family, like so:Finally, you can use the font in a layout or style:Enjoy!Tom\'s solution works great, but only works with TextView and EditText.If you want to cover most of the views (RadioGroup, TextView, Checkbox...), I created a method doing that : This method will get back the style of the view set in XML (bold, italic...) and apply them if they exists. For the ListView, I always create an adapter, and I set the font inside getView. I wrote a class assigning typeface to the views in the current view hierarchy and based os the current typeface properties (bold, normal, you can add other styles if you want):Now in all fragments in onViewCreated or onCreateView, in all activities in onCreate and in all view adapters in getView or newView just invoke:I would also like to improve weston\'s answer for API 21 Android 5.0.I had the same issue on my Samsung s5, when using DEFAULT font. (with the others fonts it\'s working fine)I managed to make it working by setting the typeface ("sans" for example) in XML files, for each Textview or Buttonand in MyApplication Class :Hope it helps.This solution does not work correctly in some situations.\nSo I extend it:FontsReplacer.javahttps://gist.github.com/orwir/6df839e3527647adc2d56bfadfaad805Calligraphy works pretty well, but it is not suitable for me, since it does not support different weights (bold, italic, etc) for a font-family.So I tried Fontain, which allows you to define custom Views and apply them custom font families.in order to use Fontain, you should add the following to your app module build.gradle:Then, instead of using regular TextView, you should use FontTextViewExample of FontTextView with uppercase and bold content:Yes, its possible to set the font to the entire application.The easiest way to accomplish this is to package the desired font(s) with your application. To do this, simply create an assets/  folder in the project root, and put your fonts (in \nTrueType, or TTF, form) in the assets. You might, for example, create assets/fonts/  and put your TTF files in there.
