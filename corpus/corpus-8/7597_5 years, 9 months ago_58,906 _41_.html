This just started happening that my iOS project is only showing "My Mac 64-bit" rather than the Simulator or my iPhone to build to.  I have no idea why this is happening.  I do not think that I have changed anything.I have my project set to iOS 5 as the base SDK, but no matter what I do it seems to never show my any other options to build for.  I have restarted Xcode a few times, and still no luck.Why is the happening?Xcode 4.2, Build 4D199I figured it out. I had to edit the scheme (Product->Scheme->Edit Scheme...), and for some reason no executable was selected. I chose my app, saved and now I have my simulator and device options back.Here is how I solved this problem.  Right-click on the xcodeproj file and select "show package contents."  Now delete everything inside the xcuserdata folder.  Voila.  I hope it helps anyone else out there that is facing this problem.Had the same problem.None of the above solutions worked. In the end, I clicked on "Manage Schemes" and then "Autocreate Schemes Now". Then select the new scheme in Xcode. Now you will get back all device/simulator options.This might be a bit nuclear option if you are midway through the project. My problem happened as I was starting on a new project and renamed the project. In this scenario, only autocreating a new scheme seemed to work.This is basically happen, when you change your project name or something like that. The solution is, you have to select the right "Scheme" for your project. Here is the solution : After open your project :Hope this help you guys.There are different solution to this problem. Two approaches that I have used are below :Right-click on xcodeproj file. Select "show package contents".\nNow, delete everything inside the xcuserdata folder.Select "Edit Schema". Executable section will have "none" in Info tab of window.\nNow select "ProjectName.app".Often times this can happen when some files change without xcode\'s blessing. As in when switching between version control branches. Usually restarting Xcode fixes that problem.None of the suggestions here worked for me, but what did was clicking the project in the sidebar, then under "iOS Application Target", toggle "Devices".I was set to \'iPad\'. I changed it to \'Universal\' then back to \'iPad\' and the Scheme corrected itself.If it makes a difference, this is on a PhoneGap/Cordova project.If you are seeing this problem after you renamed your project, the actual issue is that the scheme has a container defined that refers to your old project name. You have to edit your scheme file also in a text editor and replace all the instances of the old project name with your new project name.You\'ve got to go through all the sub files in the project folder and replace the name of the old project with the new one to fix this issue. All the other work arounds listed in the other answers are just ways to force Xcode to do this for you.I got this issue when i created a project with Xcode 4.5 (iOS SDK 6) and opened it later with Xcode 4.2 (iOS SDK < 6). I solved this problem, Select target->Summary, under Deployment target, i set it to 5.0: Xcode 4.2 doesn\'t support iOS SDK 6.0, so i need to downgrade the deployment target, then i got my device in the scheme. Hope this help someone.Select Edit Schema, you\'ll be having None in "Executeable", select your .app instead from the drop down menu, Hope it helpsHi I got that issue a project I got it from a colleges.\nI have solved it by Creating a "New Scheme" with project name.  Thanx, Generally sample codes downloaded has such issue. These can be changed by changing Base SDK to Latest iOS from \'Build Setting\' tab of your Project.If nothing above work then click project from side bar as shown in image  at top then go to PROJECT then Build Settings then under Architectures change Supported Platforms from OSX to iOS.Hope it will helps!Automatic settings validation solved this issue for me. ("Validate Settings" button)I had this problem, and here is how i fixed it.In "build Settings" change the "Supported Platforms" from "iphoneos" to "iOS". I don\'t know why, but it works for me. I solved this problem by setting the deployment target version to a lower or same version  that the Xcode (iOS SDK) supports.in my case i had to change base SDK in project -> Build Settingd to latest ios sdk I tried every suggested solution I could find on stackoverflow for this problem. Eventually, I deleted the Xcode app and downloaded it again from the App Store. After installation, the simulators were back.
