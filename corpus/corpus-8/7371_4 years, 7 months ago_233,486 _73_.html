I am using the $http service of angular to make an ajax request. How to show a loader gif during the ajax request? I don\'t see any ajaxstartevent or similar event in documentation.Here are the current past AngularJS incantations:Here is the rest of it (HTML / CSS)....usingto toggle it.  NOTE: the above is used in the angular module at beginning of postThis really depends on your specific use case, but a simple way would follow a pattern like this:And then react to it in your template:Here\'s a version using a directive and ng-hide.This will show the loader during all calls via angular\'s $http service.In the template:<div class="loader" data-loading></div>directive:by using the ng-hide class on the element, you can avoid jquery.  Customize: add an interceptorIf you create a loading-interceptor, you can show/hide the loader based on a condition.directive:interceptor:more info on writing an interceptorIf you are using ngResource, the $resolved attribute of an object is useful for loaders:For a resource as follows:You can link a loader to the $resolved attribute of the resource object:https://github.com/wongatech/angular-http-loader is a good project for this.Example here http://wongatech.github.io/angular-http-loader/The code below shows a template example/loader.tpl.html when a request is happening.Just discovered the angular-busy directive that shows a little loader depending on some async call.For example, if you have to make a GET, reference the promise in your $scope,and call it like so :Here is the GitHub.You can also install it using bower (don\'t forget to update your project dependencies):If you\'re wrapping your api calls within a service/factory, then you can track the loading counter there (per answer and excellent simultaneous suggestion by @JMaylin), and reference the loading counter via a directive.  Or any combination thereof.For page loads and modals the easiest way is to use the ng-show direcive and use one of the scope data variables. Something like ng-show="angular.isUndefined(scope.data.someobject)". As the data is undefined the spinner will show. Once the service returns with data and scope is populated, the spinner will be hidden.This is the easiest way to add a spinner i guess:-You can use ng-show with the div tag of any one of these beautiful spinners\nhttp://tobiasahlin.com/spinkit/ {{This is not my page}}and then you can use this kind of logic This works well for me:HTML:Angular:While the promise returned from $http is pending, ng-show will evaluate it to be "truthy". This is automatically updated once the promise is resolved... which is exactly what we want.Add this css:And just in your angular add:$rootScope.loading = false;\n  $rootScope.loading = true; -> when $http.get ends.Used following intercepter to show loading bar on http request Sharing my version of the great answer from @bulltorious, updated for newer angular builds (I used version 1.5.8 with this code), and also incorporated @JMaylin\'s idea of using a counter so as to be robust to multiple simultaneous requests, and the option to skip showing the animation for requests taking less than some minimum number of milliseconds:create directive with this code:Another solution to show loading between different url changes is:And then in the markup just toggle the spinner with ng-show="loading". If you want to display it on ajax requests just add $scope.loading++ when the request starts and when it ends add $scope.loading--.You can try something like this as well:Create directive :Then you add something like this to mainCtrlAnd HTML can looks like this:The following way will take note of all requests, and hide only once all requests are done:Since the functionality of position:fixed changed recently, I had difficulty showing the gif loader above all elements, so I had to use angular\'s inbuilt jQuery. HtmlCssControllerHope this helps :)All answers are or to complicated, or need to set some variables on every request which is very wrong practice if we know the DRY concept. Here simple interceptor example, I set mouse on wait when ajax starts and set it to auto when ajax ends. Code has to be added in application config app.config. I showed how to change mouse on loading state but in there it is possible to show/hide any loader content, or add, remove some css classes which are showing the loader.Interceptor will run on every ajax call, so no need to create special boolean variables ( $scope.loading=true/false etc. ) on every http call.Here is my implementation, as simple as a ng-show and a request counter. It use a new service for all request to $http:And then you can use your loader base on the number of current calls:Here is my solution which i feel is alot easer that the other posted here. Not sure how "pretty" it is though, but it solved all my issues I have a css style called "loading"The html for the loading div can be whatever but I used some FontAwesome icons and the spin method there:On the elements that you want to hide you simply write this:and in the function i just set this on load.I am using SignalR so in the hubProxy.client.allLocks function (when its done going through the locks) I juts putThis also hides the {{someField}} when the page is loading since I am setting the loading class on load and AngularJS removes it afterwards.
