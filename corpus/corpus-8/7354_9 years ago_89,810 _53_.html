How can I start an interactive console for Perl, similar to the irb command for Ruby or python for Python?You can use the perl debugger on a trivial program, like so:Alternatively there\'s Alexis Sukrieh\'s Perl Console application, but I haven\'t used it.Not only did Matt Trout write an article about a REPL, he actually wrote one - Devel::REPLI\'ve used it a bit and it works fairly well, and it\'s under active development.BTW, I have no idea why someone modded down the person who mentioned using "perl -e" from the console. This isn\'t really a REPL, true, but it\'s fantastically useful, and I use it all the time.I wrote a script I call "psh":Whatever you type in, it evaluates in Perl:I think you\'re asking about a REPL (Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop) interface to perl. There are a few ways to do this:I use the command line as a console:Then I can use my bash history to get back old commands.  This does not preserve state, however.This form is most useful when you want to test "one little thing" (like when answering Perl questions).  Often, I find these commands get scraped verbatim into a shell script  or makefile.There isn\'t an interactive console for Perl built in like Python does.  You can however use the Perl Debugger to do debugging related things.  You turn it on with the -d option, but you might want to check out \'man perldebug\' to learn about it.  After a bit of googling, there is a separate project that implements a Perl console which you can find at http://www.sukria.net/perlconsole.html.Hope this helps! You can always just drop into the built-in debugger and run commands from there.If you want history, use rlwrap. This could be your ~/bin/ips for example:And this is how it looks like:There are two popular Perl REPLs.\n1. Devel::REPL is great.\n2. But IMO Reply is better. re.pl from Devel::REPLI\'ve created perli, a Perl REPL that runs on Linux, OS X, and Windows.Its focus is automatic result printing, convenient documentation lookups, and easy\ninspection of regular-expression matches.\nYou can see screenshots here.It works stand-alone (has no dependencies other than Perl itself), but installation of rlwrap is strongly recommended so as to support command-line editing, persistent command history, and tab-completion - read more here.InstallationIf you happen to have Node.js/io.js installed:Otherwise:Unix-like platforms: Download this script as perli to a folder in your system\'s path and make it executable with chmod +x.Windows: Download the this script as perli.pl (note the .pl extension) to a folder in your system\'s path.\nIf you don\'t mind invoking Perli as perli.pl, you\'re all set.\nOtherwise, create a batch file named perli.cmd in the same folder with the following content: @%~dpn.pl %*; this enables invocation as just perli.perl -d is your friend:I always did:With 5.10, I\'ve switched to:Perl doesn\'t have a console but the debugger can be used as one. At a command prompt, type perl -de 1. (The value "1" doesn\'t matter, it\'s just a valid statement that does nothing.)There are also a couple of options for a Perl shell.For more information read perlfaq3.Read-eval-print loop:You could look into psh here: http://gnp.github.io/psh/It\'s a full on shell (you can use it in replacement of bash for example), but uses perl syntax.. so you can create methods on the fly etc.Update: I\'ve since created a downloadable REPL - see my other answer.With the benefit of hindsight:What you do NOT get with J\xc3\xa1n\'s answer:The only third-party solution that offers these (with non-trivial installation + additional, non-obvious steps), is psh, but:it hasn\'t seen activity in around 2.5 yearsits focus is different in that it aims to be a full-fledged shell replacement, and thus works like a traditional shell, which means that it doesn\'t automatically evaluate a command as a Perl statement, and requires an explicit output command such as print to print the result of an expression.J\xc3\xa1n S\xc3\xa1ren\xc3\xadk\'s answer can be improved in one way:If you install the Data::Printer module with [sudo] cpan Data::Printer as a one-time operation, you can load it into the REPL for use of the p() function, to which you can pass lists/arrays/hashtables for enumeration.Here\'s an alias named iperl with readline and Data::Printer support, which can you put in your POSIX-like shell\'s initialization file (e.g., ~/.bashrc):E.g., you can then do the following to print all environment variables via hashtable %ENV:As with J\xc3\xa1n\'s answer, the scalar result of an expression is automatically printed; e.g.:Under Debian/Ubuntu:Matt Trout\'s overview lists five choices, from perl -de 0 onwards, and he recommends Reply, if extensibility via plugins is important, or tinyrepl from Eval::WithLexicals, for a minimal, pure-perl solution that includes readline support and lexical persistence.Also look for ptkdb on CPAN:\nhttp://search.cpan.org/search?query=ptkdb&mode=allSepia and PDE have also own REPLs (for GNU Emacs).See also Stylish REPL (for GNU Emacs) http://blog.jrock.us/articles/Stylish%20REPL.pod
