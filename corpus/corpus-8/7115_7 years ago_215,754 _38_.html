I have recently reinstalled postgresql 8.3 on my Ubuntu 8.04 after update. Used EnterpriseDB package. I can connect to the database locally, I see system DB postgres but I can\'t configure it because I can\'t find config files. Searched through entire hard drive and found only samples like pg_hba.conf.sampleWhere are the postgres *.conf files?Or ask your database: Runfollowed byUbuntu 13.04 installed using software centre :The location for mine is:Query the database with the sql query:The reason you may have trouble finding postgresql.conf is because it is owned by postgres, not root.Here is where mine is on Fedora 17: Notice it is owned by postgres:It has permission 600 which explains why you have a hard time finding it with a file search.  The location of postgresql.conf will be different depending on what operating system you are using.  Here is the contents of mine:On Mac (Postgres installed using brew) :/usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.3.3>bin/postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres/On Fedora 20For CentOS 6 and 7 and postgresql 9.2 (and below, I suppose, possibly Fedora and Redhat as well):/var/lib/pgsql/dataFor CentOS 6 and 7 postgresql 9.3 or 9.4 (and above, I suppose):For Ubuntu 14 and postgresql 9.3: /etc/postgresql/9.3/main/postgresql.confTo get the location of the pg_hba.conf file, you can also query the database likeYou should get something likeThe answer may be that you have not initialized the database yet.   After installing postgres, but before initializing the database, the postgres*.sql files will be absent.   After initializing the database the postgres*.sql files will appear.  (Centos 6, Postgres 9.3 demonstrated here)As I don\'t have access to postgres account (so can\'t run SHOW config_file) and my postgres is installed on Windows, none of the answers helped me, so I\'m sharing my file location for future Windows readers:C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\9.5\\dataI\'m afraid this is yet-another-non-answer.  I did all the good things explained above on Windows and the database failed to start.  It is still a mystery why moving to a different PGDATA is \'challenging\'  Anyway the only fix to this problem was to delete the old PGDATA directory.  And then reinstall postgresql.  If the old default folder is still hanging around or non-empty, the (Windows) install barfs.  Not really up to scratch is it?  What ever happened to a nice dbadmin gui?If you followed the white paper put out by Amazon for installing Postgresql on AWS, which included creating a /data/ directory on a filesystem mounted on a separate EBS volume, then your postgresql.conf file is in /data/From which I conclude the file is created during initialisation of the data directory, and resides in the root of the data dir. For a default install this appears to be /var/lib/pgsql/data, but not if you moved the data dir In CentOS 7 with PostgreSQL 9.4 it\'s in the following directory: I can see it when I\'m logged in as root. I like this thread because it documents the default locations for various postgresql.conf files on various architectures...However, I\'ve also gotten in trouble by relying on those defaults on installations where they have specified alternate locations. One way to find out where a particular config file is by querying the database directly:select * from pg_settings where name=\'config_file\'Drop the where clause to see all the settings, which can also be illuminating because it shows where data directories, pg_hba.conf, etc. are. Besides the direct answer, you will probably want to check out the docs about Postgres config file locations.In most cases: under $PGDATA, which is normally /var/lib/postgresql/data or something similar (at least it\'s the default path if you use Docker images).
