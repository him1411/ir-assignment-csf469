What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?From what I\'ve seen, either one can work as a replacement for the other if need be, so should I bother using both or should I stick to just one of them?Will the style of the program influence my choice? I am doing some machine learning using numpy, so there are indeed lots of matrices, but also lots of vectors (arrays).Numpy matrices are strictly 2-dimensional, while numpy arrays (ndarrays) are\nN-dimensional.  Matrix objects are a subclass of ndarray, so they inherit all\nthe attributes and methods of ndarrays.The main advantage of numpy matrices is that they provide a convenient notation\nfor matrix multiplication: if a and b are matrices, then a*b is their matrix\nproduct.On the other hand, as of Python 3.5, NumPy supports infix matrix multiplication using the @ operator, so you can achieve the same convenience of matrix multiplication with ndarrays in Python >= 3.5.Both matrix objects and ndarrays have .T to return the transpose, but matrix\nobjects also have .H for the conjugate transpose, and .I for the inverse.In contrast, numpy arrays consistently abide by the rule that operations are\napplied element-wise (except for the new @ operator). Thus, if a and b are numpy arrays, then a*b is the array\nformed by multiplying the components element-wise:To obtain the result of matrix multiplication, you use np.dot (or @ in Python >= 3.5, as shown above):The ** operator also behaves differently:Since a is a matrix, a**2 returns the matrix product a*a.\nSince c is an ndarray, c**2 returns an ndarray with each component squared\nelement-wise.There are other technical differences between matrix objects and ndarrays\n(having to do with np.ravel, item selection and sequence behavior).The main advantage of numpy arrays is that they are more general than\n2-dimensional matrices. What happens when you want a 3-dimensional array? Then\nyou have to use an ndarray, not a matrix object. Thus, learning to use matrix\nobjects is more work -- you have to learn matrix object operations, and\nndarray operations.Writing a program that uses both matrices and arrays makes your life difficult\nbecause you have to keep track of what type of object your variables are, lest\nmultiplication return something you don\'t expect.In contrast, if you stick solely with ndarrays, then you can do everything\nmatrix objects can do, and more, except with slightly different\nfunctions/notation.If you are willing to give up the visual appeal of NumPy matrix product\nnotation (which can be achieved almost as elegantly with ndarrays in Python >= 3.5), then I think NumPy arrays are definitely the way to go.PS. Of course, you really don\'t have to choose one at the expense of the other,\nsince np.asmatrix and np.asarray allow you to convert one to the other (as\nlong as the array is 2-dimensional).Scipy.org recommends that you use arrays:*\'array\' or \'matrix\'? Which should I use? - Short answerUse arrays.They are the standard vector/matrix/tensor type of numpy. Many numpy function return arrays, not matrices.There is a clear distinction between element-wise operations and\n  linear algebra operations.You can have standard vectors or row/column vectors if you like.The only disadvantage of using the array type is that you will have to\n  use dot instead of * to multiply (reduce) two tensors (scalar product,\n  matrix vector multiplication etc.).Just to add one case to unutbu\'s list. One of the biggest practical differences for me of numpy ndarrays compared to numpy matrices or matrix languages like matlab, is that the dimension is not preserved in reduce operations. Matrices are always 2d, while the mean of an array, for example, has one dimension less. For example demean rows of a matrix or array:with matrixwith arrayI also think that mixing arrays and matrices gives rise to many "happy" debugging hours.\nHowever, scipy.sparse matrices are always matrices in terms of operators like multiplication.As others have mentioned, perhaps the main advantage of matrix was that it provided a convenient notation for matrix multiplication.However, in Python 3.5 there is finally a dedicated infix operator for matrix multiplication: @.With recent NumPy versions, it can be used with ndarrays:So nowadays, even more, when in doubt, you should stick to ndarray.
