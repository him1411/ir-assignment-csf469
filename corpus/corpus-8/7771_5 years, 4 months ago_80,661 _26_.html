I have a fragment with a Constructor with multiple arguments, everything worked fine during testphase but now after about 300 users downloaded the app, i have ONE occurence of that exception: I mean i could provide a different Constructor but that doesn\'t make too much sense since i would then have to call another method to really set up the Fragment.I\'m curious as to why that is happening sporadically and not always and maybe im using the Fragmented Viewpager just wrong, because i instantiate all the fragments myself and save them into a list inside the activity. I don\'t use the FragmentManager transaction stuff, since the example about Fragmented Viewpager was not very clear about that and in the end everything worked fine.Yes they do.You shouldn\'t really be overriding the constructor anyway. You should have a newInstance() static method defined and pass any parameters via arguments (bundle)For example:And of course grabbing the args this way:Then you would instantiate from your fragment manager like so:This way if detached and re-attached the object state can be stored through the arguments. Much like bundles attached to Intents.Reason - Extra readingI thought I would explain why for people wondering why.If you check: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/core/java/android/app/Fragment.javaYou will see the instantiate(..) method in the Fragment class calls the newInstance method.In case of a broken link, you can also see it here:\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html#newInstance() Explains why, upon instantiation it checks that the accessor is public and that that class loader allows access to it.It\'s a pretty nasty method all in all, but it allows the FragmentManger to kill and recreate Fragments with states. (The Android subsystem does similar things with Activities).Example ClassI get asked alot about calling newInstance,(do not confuse this with the class method.  This whole class example should show the usage.As noted by CommonsWare in this question https://stackoverflow.com/a/16064418/1319061, this error can also occur if you are creating an anonymous subclass of a Fragment, since anonymous classes cannot have constructors.Don\'t make anonymous subclasses of Fragment :-)Yes, as you can see the support-package instantiates the fragments too (when they get destroyed and re-opened). Your Fragemnt subclasses need a public empty constructor as this is what\'s being called by the framework.Here is my simple solution:1 - Define your fragment2 - Create your new fragment and populate the parameter3 - Enjoy it!Obviously you can change the type and the number of parameters.\nQuick and easy.
