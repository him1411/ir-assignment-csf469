I have installed the new Android Studio. Everything was working fine but when I try to create a new project it gets stuck at downloading Gradle.Is there any way to install the Gradle required by Android Studio manually? Or any other method to solve this problem ?It is not stuck, it will take some time normally 5-7 mins , it also depends upon internet connection, so wait for some time. It will take time only for first launch. Update: Check the latest log file in your C:\\Users\\<User>\\.gradle\\daemon\\x.y folder to see what it\'s downloading.Yes, There is. I found the same issue happening on my laptop, despite waiting for quite a long time. This is what I did and it worked for me. Just force close the Android Studio and launch it again. This time, just open the existing project and let it take care of finishing up the process of building/downloading.Another option that you could possibly try is that if you look into File --> Settings, there is an option for Gradle location. You could go to the Gradle download site, download a local distribution of Gradle and point the Gradle location to that local directory.If you\'re using OS X, and it continues to hang indefinitely, I\'d recommend shutting down Android Studio (may have to force kill), then going to your ~/.gradle directory on the console. You\'ll see a wrapper/dists directory there and whatever version of gradle AS is trying to download. Check the timestamp of the download underneath the randomly named subdirectory. If you see that it is never changing, most likely your download was interrupted and AS wasn\'t able to restart it properly and will not unless you delete everything below the dists directory and start over.So, with AS shutdown delete everything below ~/.gradle/wrapper/dists and then try again with a new project in AS. You can check the progress of the gradle download file (it will end in .part) to make sure that it\'s growing. Give it plenty of time as it IS a large file.That\'s what finally worked for me.Yes, You can install Gradle manually before Android Studio, first install gradle in any location then add de gladle location to path variable (in Environment Variables Window).Gradle is actually included with Android Studio (at least on the Mac OS X version.) I had to point it to the installed location, inside the Android Studio application "package contents" (can view by control/right-clicking on the application icon.)\n\nSolution :1). Delete the C:\\Users\\username.gradle folder2). Download http://downloads.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.2.1-all.zip3). Create a new project in android studio.4). When this time it stucks at gradle building, Force close the android studio.5) Now go to C:\\Users\\username.gradle\\wrapper\\dists\\gradle-2.2.1-all\\c64ydeuardnfqctvr1gm30w53 (the end directory name may be different)6) Delete gradle-2.2.1-all.zip.lck and other files from this directory.7) Paste the new downloaded gradle-2.2.1-all.zip here.8) Run the android studio. :)Note : My answer seems quite long but its only 2 steps away if you want a correct way to configure with current project.I found what was the actual problem.\nActually, each android project comes with its own version of gradle wrapper.have a look at dir projectname/gradle/wrapperhere the properties file says the version of gradle that this project uses:So the issue is if you dont have that version of gradle then it will download that version for you. \nFor instance have a look at this dir, where it downloaded gradle versions for me /home/myusername/.gradle/wrapper/dists looks like Here it will try to download version of gradle if you dont have.\nIf you are comfortable with downloading other version of gradle then you can wait till it completes elseWorkaround will be:\n1. if project is on git clone it first.  3.change version of distributionUrl to version that you already have :\neg: for 2.2.1-all url will be   distributionUrl=https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.2.1-all.zip4.copy gradle-wrapper.jar to your projectdir/gradle/wrapper from   .gradle/wrapper/dists/gradle-2.1.1-all/4ryh47z6pv2tj9n03uiw8pzc6/gradle-2.2.1/lib/gradle-wrapper.jar(dont forget to rename gradle-wrapper2.2.1.jar to gradle-wrapper.jar)For Windows UsersUse your Network Resource MonitorOpen Task Manager [Ctrl+Shift+Esc]Performance TabOpen Resource Monitor (From the bottom)First i decided to wait after reading answers here. But how long..? How to make sure it will finish.? They should have provided percentage of download, but they have not. So to know some kind of progress is going on, open this network resource monitor, it will show you some kind of download is going on for the Studio64.exe. IF not (if it shows 0B/Sec), then either network is not available or the application is not responding.What worked for me:I had fixed this problem by removing the .gradle folderin windows:\nC:\\Users{Logged in User}.gradleThe gradle included with Android Studio is located in /Applications/Android Studio.app/plugins/gradle/libTo go into the Android Studio.app directory I did cd "Android Studio.app"or you could just do cd /Applications/Android\\ Studio.app/plugins/gradle/libAndroid Studio comes with Gradle, but it does not have the command line gradle functionality.Quick Fix: Just turn off your firewall, it seems that android studio wants to download something and because our firewall prevents it from downloading the file that it wants it becomes stuck.Note: Turning your firewall off can lower your security, if you have time you can just allow android studio in your firewall. By doing this you can turn on your firewall while allowing android studio to download anything that it wants.
