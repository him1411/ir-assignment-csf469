I am using following optionsIn bash script to stop execution on error. I have 100 of script executing and I don\'t want to check return code of the script. \nBut for a particular script I want to ignore the error. How can I do that ?The solution:Example:drei will be never printed.Also, I want to add that when pipefail is on,\nit is enough for shell to think that the entire pipe has non-zero exit code\nwhen one of commands in the pipe has non-zero exit code (with pipefail off it must the last one).Just add || true after the command where you want to ignore the error.More concisely:From the POSIX specification regarding set -e (emphasis mine):When this option is on, if a simple command fails for any of the reasons listed in Consequences of Shell Errors or returns an exit status value >0, and is not part of the compound list following a while, until, or if keyword, and is not a part of an AND or OR list, and is not a pipeline preceded by the ! reserved word, then the shell shall immediately exit.Instead of "returning true", you can also use the noop : and just "do nothing". You\'ll save a few letters. :)Just in case if you want your script not to stop if a particular command fails and you also want to save error code of failed command:code
