I want to generate recursive file listings with full paths but as far as I can see both ls and find only give relative path listingsIt seems like an obvious requirement but I can\'t see anything in the find or ls man pages.If you give find an absolute path to start with, it will print absolute paths. For instance, to find all .htaccess files in the current directory:find simply prepends the path it was given to a relative path to the file from that path. Greg Hewgill also suggested using pwd -P if you want to resolve symlinks in your current directory.gives the full absolute path. but if the file is a symlink, u\'ll get the final resolved name.Use this for dirs:this for files:this for everything:Taken from here\n  http://www.zsh.org/mla/users/2002/msg00033.htmlYou can use in bashIf you give the find command an absolute path, it will spit the results out with an absolute path.  So, from the Ken directory if you were to type:find /home/ken/foo/ -name bar -print\n(instead of the relative path find . -name bar -print)You should get:/home/ken/foo/barTherefore, if you want an ls -l and have it return the absolute path, you can just tell the find command to execute an ls -l on whatever it finds.find /home/ken/foo -name bar -exec ls -l {} ;\\ NOTE: There is a space between {} and ;You\'ll get something like this:-rw-r--r--   1 ken admin       181 Jan 27 15:49 /home/ken/foo/barIf you aren\'t sure where the file is, you can always change the search location.  As long as the search path starts with "/", you will get an absolute path in return.  If you are searching a location (like /) where you are going to get a lot of permission denied errors, then I would recommend redirecting standard error so you can actually see the find results:find / -name bar -exec ls -l {} ;\\ 2> /dev/null(2> is the syntax for borne and bash shells, but will not work with c shell.  It may work in other shells too, but I only know for sure that it works in bourne and bash).I hope this helps!The $PWD is a good option by Matthew above. If you want find to only print files then you can also add the  -type f option to search only normal files. Other options are "d" for directories  only etc. So in your case it would be (if i want to search only for files with .c ext):or if you want all files:Note: You can\'t make an alias for the above command, because $PWD gets auto-completed to your home directory when the alias is being set by bash. find / -print will do this
