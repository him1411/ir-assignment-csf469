I\'m looking for an efficient way to convert rows to columns in SQL server, I heard that PIVOT is not very fast, and I need to deal with lot of records.This is my example:This is my result:How can I build the result?There are several ways that you can transform data from multiple rows into columns.  In SQL Server you can use the PIVOT function to transform the data from rows to columns:See Demo.If you have an unknown number of columnnames that you want to transpose, then you can use dynamic SQL:See Demo.If you do not want to use the PIVOT function, then you can use an aggregate function with a CASE expression:See Demo.This could also be completed using multiple joins, but you will need some column to associate each of the rows which you do not have in your sample data. But the basic syntax would be:as pivoting data is still a hot one I decided to add something form me. This is rather a method than just a single script but gives you much more possibilities. First of all There are 3 scripts you need to deploy:\n1) User defined TABLE type [ColumnActionList] -> holds data as parameter\n2) SP [proc_PivotPrepare] -> prepares our data\n3) SP [proc_PivotExecute] -> execute the scriptFrom executing the first query (by passing source DB and table name) you will get a pre-created execution query for the second SP, all you have to do is define is the column from your source:\n+ Stable\n+ Value (will be used to concentrate values based on that)\n+ Dim (column you want to use to pivot by)Names and datatypes will be defined automatically!I cant recommend it for any production environments but does the job for adhoc BI requests.
