How do I move the turtle in LOGO?Check out some other turtle commands found here...BACKGROUND ## [BG] - Set Background color (0-15)CLEARSCREEN [CS] - Clear Screen without moving turtleSamples taken directly from website: http://gaza.freehosting.net/logo/index.htmlLogo is all about moving the turtle... you give it commands like this:You can do stuff like repeating commands too:(What do I win? 8-)Whoa! Is it still around?That used to work.I\'ve seen a few LOGO implementations where you can use localized commands like:or even NAPRZ\xc3\x93D (with Polish letter \xc3\x93).LOGO is nice language to teach kids programming in their native spoken language.By issuing commands in the correct syntax. E.G.:There is only one necessary command to move the turtle. It is forward which has the mnemonic fd. When working with a robot (real) turtle as opposed to a graphics based (virtual) one, you might find that the turning commands left and right [lt & rt] move the turtle a little, accidentally.Most implementations also allow the command backwards [bk].When the turtle moves, it may draw a line as it goes depending on whether the pen is up or down at the time, and whether the current pen color is different from the background color.A graphics based (virtual) turtle can also jump around the screen with setx, sety, and setxytry: bk(back), fd(forward), ld(left turn in degrees), rt(right turn).
