I\'ve noticed this pattern in a lot of Android apps and games recently: when clicking the back button to "exit" the application, a Toast comes up with a message similar to "Please click BACK again to exit".I was wondering, as I\'m seeing it more and more often, is that a built-in feature that you can somehow access in an activity? I\'ve looked at the source code of many classes but I can\'t seem to find anything about that.Of course, I can think about a few ways to achieve the same functionality quite easily (the easiest is probably to keep a boolean in the activity that indicates whether the user already clicked once...) but I was wondering if there\'s something already here.EDIT: As @LAS_VEGAS mentioned, I didn\'t really mean "exit" in the traditional meaning. (i.e. terminated) I meant "going back to whatever was open before the application start activity was launched", if that makes sense :)I Think this handler helps to reset the variable after 2 second.Sudheesh B Nair\'s has a nice (and accepted) answer on the question, which i think should have a better alternative such as;What\'s wrong with measuring time passed and checking if TIME_INTERVAL miliseconds (say 2000) passed since the last back press. The following sample code uses System.currentTimeMillis(); to store the time onBackPressed() is called;Back on accepted answer critique; Using a flag to indicate if it was pressed in last TIME_INTERVAL (say 2000) milliseconds and set - reset is via Handler\'s postDelayed() method was the first thing to come in my mind. But the postDelayed() action should be cancelled when activity is closing, removing the Runnable.In order to remove the Runnable, it must not be declared anonymous, and be declared as member along with the Handler aswell. Then removeCallbacks() method of Handler can be called appropriately.The following sample is the demonstration;Thanks to @NSouth for contributing; In order to prevent toast message appearing even after the application is closed, Toast can be declared as a member - say mExitToast - and can be cancelled via mExitToast.cancel(); just before super.onBackPressed(); call.Just thought I would share how I did it in the end, I just added in my activity:And it just works exactly as I want. Including the reset of the state whenever the activity is resumed.Process Flow Diagram:\nJava Code:Based upon the correct answer and suggestions in comments, I have created a demo which works absolutely fine and removes the handler callbacks after being used.MainActivity.javaI hope it will be helpful !!There is very simplest way among all these answers.Simply write following code inside onBackPressed() method.You need to define back_pressed object as long in activity.It is not a good idea to use a Runnable when exit the application, I recently figure out a much simpler way to record and compare the period between two BACK button clicks. Sample code as following:This will do the trick  to exit the application  by a double BACK button clicks within a certain delay period which is 2000 millisecond in sample.Declare Variableprivate boolean doubleBackToExitPressedOnce = false;Paste this in your Main Activity and this will solve your issue`It\'s not a built in functionality. I think it is not even the recommended behavior. Android apps are not meant to exit:Why dont Android applications provide an "Exit" option?I know this is a very old question, but this is the easiest way to do what you want.I know this isn\'t the best method, but it works fine!Zefnus\'s answer using System.currentTimeMillis() is the best one (+1). The way I did it is not better than that, but still posting it to add to the above ideas.If the toast is not visible when the back button is pressed, the toast is displayed, whereas, if it is visible (back has already been pressed once within the last Toast.LENGTH_SHORT time), then it exits.Recently, I needed to implement this back button feature in an app of mine. The answers on the original question were useful, but I had to take two more points into consideration:Based on the answers and comments, I created the following code:The code above assumes that the support library is used. If you use fragments but not the support library, you want to replace getSupportFragmentManager() by getFragmentManager().Remove the first if, if the back button is never cancelled. Remove the second if, if you don`t use fragments or a fragment back stackAlso, it is important to be aware that the method onBackPressed is supported since Android 2.0. Check this page for an elaborate description. To make the back press feature work on older versions as well, add the following method to your activity:The Accepted answer is Best one but if you are using Android Design Support Library then you can use SnackBar for Better Views. My solution using snackbar:Finally create a onBackPressedMethod as Follows:This works correctly, i have tested. and I think this is much simpler. For this purpose I have implemented the following function:Here is the full working code. And also don\'t forget to remove the callbacks so that it don\'t cause a memory leak in the app. :) Some Improvements in Sudheesh B Nair\'s answer, i have noticed it will wait for handler even while pressing back twice immediately, so cancel handler as shown below. I have cancled toast also to prevent it to display after app exit.This is also help when you have previous stack activity store in stack. i modified the Sudheesh\'s Answer This is the same of the accepted and most voted response but this snipped used Snackbar instead of Toast.A slightly better method than Zefnus I think. Call System.currentTimeMillis() just one time and omit return; :In my case, I\'ve depend on Snackbar#isShown() for better UX.For the activity whose is having Navigation Drawer, Use the following code for OnBackPressed()If you wanna go simple without messing up with junky complex code, Try this method.
