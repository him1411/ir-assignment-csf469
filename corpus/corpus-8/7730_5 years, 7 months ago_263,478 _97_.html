I\'m going mad here.I\'ve got the following HTML:And the Bootstrap style tooltip refuses to display, just a normal tooltip. I\'ve got bootstrap.css working just fine, and I can see the classes in thereI\'ve got all of the relevant JS files at the end of my HTML file:I\'ve looked at the source of Bootstrap\'s example and cannot see anything that initiates the tooltip anywhere in there. So I\'m guessing it should just work, or am I missing something vital here?I\'ve got modals and alerts and other things working just fine, so I\'m not a total moron ;)Thanks for any help!To sum up: activate your tooltips using jQuery selectorsIn fact, you don\'t need to use the attribute selector, you can invoke it on any element even if it doesn\'t have rel="tooltip" in its tag.After experiencing the same problem, I found this solution worked without having to add additional tag attributes outside of the Bootstrap required attributes.HTMLJQueryHope this helps!You dont need all js files separatelyJust use the following files if you are going to use all bootstrap functions:both of them can be found in http://twitter.github.com\nand finally\n-Latest version of jquery.js For Glyphicons you need the imageglyphicons-halfings.png and/or glyphicons-halfings-white.png(white coloured images)\nwhich u need to upload inside /img/ folder of u r website  (or) store it where ever u want but change the folder directory inside the bootstrap.cssFor tooltip u need the following script inside your\n          <head> </head> tag That\'s it...http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tooltips-usageOpt-in functionality\nFor performance reasons, the Tooltip and Popover data-apis are opt-in, meaning you must initialize them yourself.One way to initialize all tooltips on a page would be to select them by their data-toggle attribute:putting this piece of code in your html  allows you to use the tooltipsExamples:I know this is an old question, but since I had this problem with the new release of bootstrap and its not clear on the website, here is how you enable the tooltip.give your element a class like "tooltip-test"then activate this class in your javascript tag:HTMLJQueryThis one is work for me.If you do $("[rel=\'tooltip\']").tooltip(); as other answers have suggested then you will activate tooltips only on elements that are currently there in DOM. That means if you are going to change DOM and insert dynamic content later it won\'t work. Also this is much less efficient because it installs event handler for individual elements as opposed to using JQuery event delegation. So the best way I\'ve found to activate Bootstrap tooltips is this one line of code that you can place in document ready and forget about it:Note that I\'m using title as selector instead of rel=title or data-title. This has an advantage that it can be applied to many other elements (the rel is supposed to be only for anchors) and also it works as "fallback" for old browsers. Also note that you don\'t need data-toggle="tooltip" attribute if you are using above code.Bootstrap tooltips are expensive because you need to handle mouse events on each of the elements. This is the reason why they haven\'t enabled it by default. So if you ever decide to comment out above line, your page would still work if you use title attribute.If you are OK not to use title attribute then I would recommend using pure CSS solution such as Hint.css or check http://csstooltip.com which does not require any JavaScript code at all.Tooltip and popover are NOT only-css plugins like dropdown or progressbar. To use tooltips and popover, you MUST to activate them using jquery (read javascript).So, lets say we want a popover to be shown on click of an html button.Then you need to have following javascript code to activate popover:Actually, above javascript code will activate popover on all the html elements which have class "popovers-to-be-activated". Needless to say, put the above javascript inside DOM-ready callback to activate all popovers as soon as DOM is ready:This is the simplest way.\nJust put this before </body>:  <script type="text/javascript">\n    $("[data-toggle=\\"tooltip\\"]").tooltip();\n</script>Check out the examples given in the Bootstrap\'s documentation about tooltips.  For example:  <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Tooltip text here">Link with tooltip</a>in head section you need to add the following code firstThen in the body section you need to do write the following codeIf everything is still not resolved Use Latest Jquery library, you dont need any of the jquery selectors if you use the latest bootstrap 2.0.4 and jquery-1.7.2.jsJust use rel="tooltip" title="Your Title" data-placement=" "Use top / bottom / left / right in the data-placement as per your wish.I have added jquery and bootstrap-tooltip.js in header. Adding this code in footer works for me! but when i add the same code in header it doesn\'t work!     If using Rails+Haml is much easier to include the tooltip, just do:That is just add the following line at the end of the element.In my particular case, it didn\'t work because I was including two versions of jQuery. One for bootstrap, but another one (another version) for Google Charts.When I remove the jQuery loading for the charts, it works fine.I just added:below bootstrap.min.js and it works.Lets use an example to show how the Tooltips can be added to any HTML element in your document.  If these tooltip samples don\'t work when you put them in your page, then you have another problem.  You need to look at things like:See if you are including the JS file that provides the functionality you need (not just for tooltips, but any components you use on the page).Failure of ANY of the above items can (and often does) prevent javascript from loading and/or running, and that keeps everything nice and broken.Let\'s say you have a badge, and you want it to show a tooltip when the user hovers over it.Original HTML:If you are creating tooltips for an HTML Element, and you are using Plain Bootstrap tooltips, then you will be responsible for calling the Tooltip Initializers with your own JavaScript code.BEFOREAFTERINITIALIZERIf you are using a bootstrap template (such as INSPINIA), you are including a supporting script to support the template features:In the case of INSPINIA, the included script automatically initializes all tooltips by running the following javascript code when the document is finished loading:Because of this, you do NOT have to initialize INSPINIA-style Tooltips yourself.  But you DO have to format your elements in a specific way.  The Initializer looks for HTML elements with tooltip-demo in the class attribute, then calls the tooltip() method to initialize any child elements that have the attribute data-toggle="tooltip" defined.  For our example badge, place an outer element around it (like a <div> or <span>) that has class="tooltip-demo", then place the data-toggle, data-placement, and title attributes for the actual tooltip within the element that is the badge.  Modify the original HTML from above to look something like this:  BEFOREAFTERINITIALIZERNote that any child elements within the <span class="tooltip-demo"> element will have their tooltip properly prepared.  I could have three child elements, all needing tooltips, and place them within one container.The best use for this would be to add the class="tooltip-demo" to a <td> or an outermost <div> or <span>.If you are using INSPINIA, but you don\'t want to add extra outer <div> or <span> tags to create tooltips, you can use standard Bootstrap Tooltips without interfering with the template.  In this case, you will be responsible for initializing the Tooltips yourself.  However, you should use a custom value in the  class attribute to identify your Tooltip items.  This will keep your Tooltip initializer from interfering with elements affected by INSPINIA.  In our example, let\'s use standalone-tt:BEFOREAFTERINITIALIZERIf you are creating your html that contains the tooltip with javascript, and then inserting it into the document, you have to activate the popover/tooltip AFTER you have inserted the html into the document, not on document load...You must put the tooltip javascript after the html. like this : Or use $(document).ready : The tooltip not working because you put the tooltip html before the javascript, so they don\'t know if there is a javascript for the tooltip. In my opinion, the script is read from the top to the bottom.I had a similar issue and especially if you are running in a button container like a vertical button container. In that case you have to set the container as the \'body\'examplePut your code inside document readyIn my case I was also missing the tooltip css classes on http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/assets/css/bootstrap.css\nso son\'t forget that.You need to do the following:Quick and lighter alternative to Bootstrap tooltip plugin:Label/text must be enclosed in a wrapper of class "mytooltip" This wrapper must have an Id.After the label there is the tool tip text wrapped in a div of class "mytooltiptext" and id consisting of the id of the parent wrapper + "_tttext". Other options for selectors can be used.Hope it helps.
