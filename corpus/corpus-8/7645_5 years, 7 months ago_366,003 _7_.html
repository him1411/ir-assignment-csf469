Below is my code for creating a symlink of a directory:I already created the directory /etc/nginx.  I just want the contents of the source directory (conf) to be in the contents of the target directory (nginx). But when I execute the code, /etc/nginx contains a directory called "conf", instead of the contents of "conf". That directory contains the contents I want, but in the wrong location.So, why did it put a directory in the target folder, instead of just putting the contents of the directory in the target folder?This is the behavior of ln if the second arg is a directory. It places a link to the first arg inside it. If you want /etc/nginx to be the symlink, you should remove that directory first and run that same command.That\'s what ln is documented to do when the target already exists and is a directory. If you want /etc/nginx to be a symlink rather than contain a symlink, you had better not create it as a directory first!In script is usefull something like this:it prevents before re-create "bad" looped symlink after re-run script
