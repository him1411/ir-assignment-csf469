I\'m cloning a project from a git repo, but when I execute pod install the first line I see is "Setting up CocoaPods Master repo" and after that I can\'t see anything more, the console stops there.I don\'t know what is happening. Anyone knows what\'s happening here? Why Does CocoaPods stop there?You could try running in verbose mode:This\'ll show you what cocoapods is up to:(as suggested here)For me the above step took quite a long time as the repo (Dec 2016) is now 1.1 GBpod install or pod setup fetches whole repo with history when you first time run it. You don\'t need that commit history.It takes around 2 mins on decent network connection (4Mbps). master directory is around 519M big.Try this command to track its work.The issue is that you haven\'t got command line tools installed, I believe.\nTry run in terminal:after that download command line tools from Apple\njust search for \'Command Line Tools\' and download the right version for your OS.\nOnce you install it run in terminal:May be this information will be helpful:Official answer: http://blog.cocoapods.org/Master-Spec-Repo-Rate-Limiting-Post-Mortem/As a result of this discussion https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/4989Briefly:\nCocoaPods repository experiences a huge volume of fetches from GitHub and it was the problem. Changes have been available since version 1.0.0.beta.6.  Tips from this document:My hack to first installation:Today it takes near 15 minutesWhen CocoaPods is doing that it is downloading the entire specs repo to ~/.cocoapods. This could take a while depending on your connection. I would try doing it explicitly first with pod setupNothing above worked for me, so this is what worked:Once completed it worked.Cheers!I am running the above mentioned command right now but as mentioned by @Joe Blow, it shows absolutely no information on the progress. But if you open the Activity Monitor on Mac (Task Manager on Windows?), under the \'Network\' tab you will see a process named \'git-remote-https\' and it shows the size of \'Received Bytes\' increasing. After downloading about 300MB it stopped and then I could see further progress in the Terminal window.What I tried and faster than clonning the repo:After that I finally could see the pods being installedGood luck!EDIT: The zip size is 144 MB (Jul 6 2017)This happens only once. Master repo has +-1GB (November 2016). To track the progress you can use activity monitor app and look for git-remote-https.Next time it (pod setup or pod repo update) will only fast update all spec-repos in ~/.cocoapods/repos.I used the following 4 commandsI took time as expected, but at least I didn\'t have to stair at the screen wondering whats happening in the background. You will have to remove the repo and re-setup it...I\'m monitoring the download progress by using the progress is very slow... and failed few times. \n But somehow after increasing the git buffer limit by using this command line git config --global http.postBuffer 2M The download speed is improving greatly and after downloading in total 347 Mb on ./cocoapods folder, the progress seems to stop and network activity is also stopping.\nbut after waiting few minutes, turn out that cocoapod is verifying and extracting the repo and makes the total size up to 853 Mb.notes: I\'m doing it on 23 Oct 2016.I Faced same problem but it work for.I executed the Pod Install Command Before 3 Hour ago after that its updated what i want.\nYou just need to Keep tracking the "Activity Monitor" You can see their "git remote https" or "Git" in disk tab. It will download around 330 Mb then it shows 1 GB and After some minutes it will starts installing. No need to Execute extra command.Note : during downloading your MAC need to in continuously Active mode.If your system goes in sleep mode then CPU stop the process and you will get a error Like Add manually. pod setup works and should only take 10 mins on a solid connection. After that run: pod install --verbose and you should see all the comments you would normally see when running a dependancy manager.Hope that helpsJust setup the master repo, was excited to see that we have a download progress, see screenshot ;)CocoaPods release 1.2.0 (Jan 28) fixes this issue, thanks to all contributors and Danielle Tomlinson for this release.
