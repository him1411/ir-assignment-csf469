I\'m printing my exceptions to a log file currently with:Could I be printing more information about the exception and the code that generated it than just the exception string? Things like line numbers or stack traces would be great.logger.exception does that. For example:Output:@Paulo Cheque notes, "be aware that in Python 3 you must call the logging.exception method just inside the except part. If you call this method in an arbitrary place you may get a bizarre exception. The docs alert about that."One nice thing about logging.exception that SiggyF\'s answer doesn\'t show is that you can pass in an arbitrary message, and logging will still show the full traceback with all the exception details:With the default (in recent versions) logging behaviour of just printing errors to sys.stderr, it looks like this:Using exc_info options may be better, to allow you to choose the error level (if you use exception, it will always show error): QuotingWhat if your application does logging some other way \xe2\x80\x93 not using the logging module?Now, traceback could be used here.Use it in Python 2:Use it in Python 3:This answer builds up from the above excellent ones.In most applications, you won\'t be calling logging.exception(e) directly. Most likely you have defined a custom logger specific for your application or module like this:In this case, just use the logger to call the exception(e) like this:If you use plain logs - all your log records should correspond this rule: one record = one line. Following this rule you can use grep and other tools to process your log files.But traceback information is multi-line. So my answer is an extended version of solution proposed by zangw above in this thread. The problem is that traceback lines could have \\n inside, so we need to do an extra work to get rid of this line endings:After that (when you\'ll be analyzing your logs) you could copy / paste required traceback lines from your log file and do this:Profit!If you can cope with the extra dependency then use twisted.log, you don\'t have to explicitly log errors and also it returns the entire traceback and time to the file or stream.A clean way to do it is using format_exc() and then parse the output to get the relevant part:Regards
