Searching the web, I find heaps of different suggestions for what the proper MIME type for a font is, but I have yet to try any MIME type that rids me of a Chrome warning such as the following:Resource interpreted as font but transferred with MIME type font/otfThe font is an OTF.I\'ve tried the following MIME types so farTry using "font/opentype".There are a number of font formats that one can set MIME types for, on both Apache and IIS servers. I\'ve traditionally had luck with the following:According to the Internet Engineering Task Force who maintain the initial document regarding Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME types) here: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045#section-5 ... it says in specifics:"It is expected that additions to the larger set of\n     supported types can generally be accomplished by the creation of new\n     subtypes of these initial types.  In the future, more top-level types\n     may be defined only by a standards-track extension to this standard.\n     If another top-level type is to be used for any reason, it must be\n     given a name starting with "X-" to indicate its non-standard status\n     and to avoid a potential conflict with a future official name."As it were, and over time, additional MIME types get added as standards are created and accepted, therefor we see examples of vendor specific MIME types such as vnd.ms-fontobject and the like.UPDATE August 16, 2013: WOFF was formally registered at IANA on January 3, 2013 and Webkit has been updated on March 5, 2013 and browsers that are sourcing this update in their latest versions will start issuing warnings about the server MIME types with the old x-font-woff declaration. Since the warnings are only annoying I would recommend switching to the approved MIME type right away. In an ideal world, the warnings will resolve themselves in time.UPDATE February 26, 2015: WOFF2 is now in the W3C Editor\'s Draft with the proposed mime-type. It should likely be submitted to IANA in the next year (possibly by end of 2016) following more recent progress timelines. As well SFNT, the scalable/spline container font format used in the backbone table reference of Google Web Fonts with their sfntly java library and is already registered as a mime type with IANA and could be added to this list as well dependent on individual need.For Subversion auto-properties, these can be listed as:Ignore the chrome warning. There is no standard MIME type for OTF fonts.font/opentype may silence the warning, but that doesn\'t make it the "right" thing to do.Arguably, you\'re better off making one up, e.g. with "application/x-opentype" because at least "application" is a registered content type, while "font" is not.Update: OTF remains a problem, but WOFF grew an IANA MIME type of application/font-woff in January 2013.Update 2: OTF  has grown a MIME type:  application/font-sfnt In March 2013.  This type also applies to .ttfAs there\'s still a lot of confusion on the web about MIME types for web fonts, I thought I\'d give a current answer, complete with effective dates, and supporting links to IANA and the W3C.Here are the official MIME types for Web Fonts: Note there is a movement to change all the above to MIME types of font/XXX, as backed by the W3C in its proposal for WOFF v2. This is being tracked by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) under The font Top Level Type and in February 2017 was approved RFC status (see RFC 8081) so it may all change yet!While on the topic of web servers, it\'s worth mentioning that HTTP responses may gzip (or otherwise compress) all the above font formats except .woff & .woff2 which are already heavily compressed. I say more in MIME Types for Web Fonts with (Fantom) BedSheet.FWIW regarding Apache 2.2 VirtualHosting and mod_mime tested on Debian Linux and OS X Leopard and Snow Leopard:If you have a VirtualHost configuration you will want to add the types via the AddType Directive as follows at least at the bottom of the configuration as follows:Tested against Chrome Unstable/Trunk and Safari WebKit Nightly which eliminates the mime octet-stream warnings for both the ttf and otf font types.Note: .htaccess has zero effect when dealing with VirtualHosting. If you\'re developing for several sites you\'ll be using VirtualHosting development and each configuration will need these AddType additions.I just did some research on IANA official list. I believe the answer given here \'font/xxx\' is incorrect as there is no \'font\' type in the MIME standard.Based on the RFCs and IANA, this appears to be the current state of the play as at May 2013:These three are official and assigned by IANA:These are not not official/assigned, and so must use the \'x-\' syntax:The application/font-woff appears new and maybe only official since Jan 2013. So "application/x-font-woff" might be safer/more compatible in the short term.Here is NGINX solutionfileaddremoveThanks to Mike Fulcherhttp://drawingablank.me/blog/font-mime-types-in-nginx.htmlAs from March 2013 IANA.ORG recommends for .otf:\napplication/font-sfntOther fonts: See more...As a specific instance of one of the two hard things in computing, it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting to see how the answers to this question have changed since this question was originally posted. Thankfully, the powers that be have brought order to the chaos:In February this year (2017), the W3C published the Standards Track RFC 8081: The "font" Top-Level Media Type which greatly simplifies the appropriate media types for font files:This memo serves to register and document the "font" top-level media type,\n  under which subtypes for representation formats for fonts may be registered.\n  This document also serves as a registration application for a set of\n  intended subtypes, which are representative of some existing subtypes\n  already in use, and currently registered under the "application" tree by\n  their separate registrations.It\xe2\x80\x99s quite a readable document and it describes the historical context (lack of \xe2\x80\x9ca registration of formats for font\xe2\x80\x9d) which gave rise to the confusing mix of media types and sub-types. With the (relatively) recent rise in popularity of downloadable web fonts, the W3C recognised the need for an \xe2\x80\x9cintuitive top-level font type\xe2\x80\x9d.  What they came up with is \xe2\x80\xa6 font.Accordingly, the IANA have since updated their official list of Media types with the font media type and all its sub-types that they currently recognise:Here\xe2\x80\x99s hoping this is the last answer this question needs.application/font-woff for woff:\nhttp://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/font-woffMaybe this will help someone. I saw that on IIS 7 .ttf is already a known mime-type. It\'s configured as:So I just added that for all the CSS font types (.oet, .svg, .ttf, .woff) and IIS started serving them. Chrome dev tools also do not complain about re-interpreting the type.Cheers,\nMichaelThe following can be used in the eBook space:\napplication/vnd.ms-opentype\nI would imagine that it is the same for the web.As of February 2017, RFC 8081 adds font/* media types, which are also listed in the IANA Media Types list. font/otf is in this list.One way to silence this warning from Chrome would be to update Chrome and then make sure your mime type is one of these:This list is per the patch found at Bug 111418 at webkit.org.The same patch demotes the message from a "Warning" to a "Log", so just upgrading Chrome to any post March-2013 version would get rid of the yellow triangle.Since the question is about silencing a Chrome warning, and folks might be holding on to old Chrome versions for whatever reasons, I figured this was worth adding.
