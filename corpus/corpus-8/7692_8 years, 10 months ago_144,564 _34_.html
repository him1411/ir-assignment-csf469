I just want to clarify one thing. This is not a question on which one is better, that part I leave to someone else to discuss. I don\'t care about it.\nI\'ve been asked this question on my job interview and I thought it might be useful to learn a bit more.These are the ones I could come up with:Please add others you think are relevant.Update:\nJust popped up my mind, Java doesn\'t have something like custom attributes on classes, methods etc. Or does it?Comparing Java 7 and C# 3(Some features of Java 7 aren\'t mentioned here, but the using statement advantage of all versions of C# over Java 1-6 has been removed.)Not all of your summary is correct:Beyond that (and what\'s in your summary already):This is not exhaustive, but it covers everything I can think of off-hand.The following is a great in depth reference by Dare Obasanjo on the differences between C# and Java.  I always find myself referring to this article when switching between the two.http://www.25hoursaday.com/CsharpVsJava.htmlC# has automatic properties which are incredibly convenient and they also help to keep your code cleaner, at least when you don\'t have custom logic in your getters and setters.Features of C# Absent in Java\n\xe2\x80\xa2   C# includes more primitive types and the functionality to catch arithmetic exceptions.\xe2\x80\xa2   Includes a large number of notational conveniences over Java, many of which, such as operator overloading and user-defined casts, are already familiar to the large community of C++ programmers.\xe2\x80\xa2   Event handling is a "first class citizen"\xe2\x80\x94it is part of the language itself.\xe2\x80\xa2   Allows the definition of "structs", which are similar to classes but may be allocated on the stack (unlike instances of classes in C# and Java).\xe2\x80\xa2   C# implements properties as part of the language syntax.\xe2\x80\xa2   C# allows switch statements to operate on strings.\xe2\x80\xa2   C# allows anonymous methods providing closure functionality.\xe2\x80\xa2   C# allows iterator that employs co-routines via a functional-style yield keyword.\xe2\x80\xa2   C# has support for output parameters, aiding in the return of multiple values, a feature shared by C++ and SQL.\xe2\x80\xa2   C# has the ability to alias namespaces.\xe2\x80\xa2   C# has "Explicit Member Implementation" which allows a class to specifically implement methods of an interface, separate from its own class methods. This allows it also to implement two different interfaces which happen to have a method of the same name. The methods of an interface do not need to be public; they can be made to be accessible only via that interface.\xe2\x80\xa2   C# provides integration with COM.\xe2\x80\xa2   Following the example of C and C++, C# allows call by reference for primitive and reference types.Features of Java Absent in C#\xe2\x80\xa2   Java\'s strictfp keyword guarantees that the result of floating point operations remain the same across platforms.\xe2\x80\xa2   Java supports checked exceptions for better enforcement of error trapping and handling.Another good resource is http://www.javacamp.org/javavscsharp/\nThis site enumerates many examples that ilustrate almost all the differences between these two programming languages.About the Attributes, Java has Annotations, that work almost the same way.Generics:With Java generics, you don\'t actually get any of the execution efficiency that you get with .NET because when you compile a generic class in Java, the compiler takes away the type parameter and substitutes Object everywhere. For instance if you have a Foo<T> class the java compiler generates Byte Code as if it was Foo<Object>. This means casting and also boxing/unboxing will have to be done in the "background".I\'ve been playing with Java/C# for a while now and, in my opinion, the major difference at the language level are, as you pointed, delegates.Please go through the link given below\n         msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms836794.aspx \nIt covers both the similarity and difference between C# and java
