I am beginner to PostgreSQL.I want to connect to another database from the query editor of Postgres - like the USE command of MySQL or MS SQL Server. I found \\c databasename by searching the Internet, but its runs only on psql. When I try it from the PostgreSQL query editor I get a syntax error.I have to change the database by pgscripting. Does anyone know how to do it?When you get a connection to PostgreSQL it is always to a particular database.  To access a different database, you must get a new connection.Using \\c in psql closes the old connection and acquires a new one, using the specified database and/or credentials.  You get a whole new back-end process and everything.You must specify the database to use on connect; if you want to use psql for your script, you can use "\\c name_database" At this point you might see the following outputNotice how the prompt changes. Cheers, have just been hustling looking for this too, too little information on postgreSQL compared to MySQL and the rest in my view.In pgAdmin you can also useSET search_path TO your_db_name;
