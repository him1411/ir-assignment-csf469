What the difference between text() and html() functions in jQuery ?vsI think the difference is nearly self-explanatory.  And it\'s super trivial to test.Live demo on http://jsfiddle.net/hossain/sUTVg/jQuery.html() treats the string as HTML, jQuery.text() treats the content as text.((please update if necessary, this answer is a Wiki))Answer: .html() is faster!  See here a "behaviour test-kit" for all the question.So, in conclusion, if you have "only a text", use html() method. Note: Doesn\'t make sense? Remember that the .html() function is only a wrapper to .innerHTML, but in the .text() function jQuery adds an "entity filter", and this filter naturally consumes time.Ok, if you really want performance... Use pure Javascript to access direct text-replace by the nodeValue property.\nBenchmark conclusions: PS: .textContent property was introduced with DOM-Level-3, .nodeValue is DOM-Level-2 and is faster (!).See this complete benchmark:The first example will actually embed HTML within the div whereas the second example will escape the text by means of replacing element-related characters with their corresponding character entities so that it displays literally (i.e. the HTML will be displayed not rendered).The text() method entity-escapes any HTML that is passed into it.  Use text() when you want to insert HTML code that will be visible to people who view the page.Technically, your second example produces:which would be rendered in the browser as:Your first example will be rendered as an actual link and some bold text.Actually both do look somewhat similar but are quite different it depends on your usage or intention what you want to achieve ,.text() method cannot be used on form inputs or scripts.Picking up html content from .text() will convert the html tags into html entities.Check this example on jsfiddle to see the differences in actionUse .text(\xe2\x80\xa6) when you intend to display the value as a simple text.Use .html(\xe2\x80\xa6) when you intend to display the value as a html formatted text (or HTML content).You should definitely use .text(...) when you\xe2\x80\x99re not sure that your text (e.g. coming from an input control) do not contain characters/tags that has special meaning in HTML. This is really important because this could result in the text will not display properly but it could also cause that an unwanted JS script snippet (e.g. coming from another user input) to be activated.Strange that no-one mentioned the Cross Site scripting prevention benefit of .text() over .html() (Although others have just mentioned that .text() escapes the data).It\'s always recommended to use .text() when you want to update data in DOM which is just data / text for the user to see..html() should be mostly used to get the HTML content within a div.Basically, $("#div").html uses element.innerHTML to set contents, and $("#div").text (probably) uses element.textContent. http://docs.jquery.com/Attributes/html: http://docs.jquery.com/Attributes/text: $(\'.div\').html(val) will set the HTML values of all selected elements, $(\'.div\').text(val) will set the text values of all selected elements.API docs for jQuery.text()API docs for jQuery.html()I would guess that they correspond to Node#textContent and Element#innerHTML, respectively. (Gecko DOM references).I think that the difference  is to insert html tag \nin text() you  html tag do not functions output : replacing text() with html()output  then the tag <br> works in html()text function set or retrieve the value as plain text, otherwise, HTML function set or retrieve the value as HTML tags to change or modify that.\nIf you want to just change the content then use text(). But if you need to change the markup then you have to use hmtl().It\'s a dummy answer for me after six years, Don\'t mind.
