How do I pass authorization header using cURL? (Not the PHP cURL extension, the executable in /usr/bin/curl).http://curl.haxx.se/docs/httpscripting.htmlSee part 6. HTTP AuthenticationHTTP AuthenticationHTTP Authentication is the ability to tell the server your username and\n   password so that it can verify that you\'re allowed to do the request you\'re\n   doing. The Basic authentication used in HTTP (which is the type curl uses by\n   default) is plain text based, which means it sends username and password\n   only slightly obfuscated, but still fully readable by anyone that sniffs on\n   the network between you and the remote server.To tell curl to use a user and password for authentication:The site might require a different authentication method (check the headers\n   returned by the server), and then --ntlm, --digest, --negotiate or even\n   --anyauth might be options that suit you.Sometimes your HTTP access is only available through the use of a HTTP\n   proxy. This seems to be especially common at various companies. A HTTP proxy\n   may require its own user and password to allow the client to get through to\n   the Internet. To specify those with curl, run something like:If your proxy requires the authentication to be done using the NTLM method,\n   use --proxy-ntlm, if it requires Digest use --proxy-digest.If you use any one these user+password options but leave out the password\n   part, curl will prompt for the password interactively.Do note that when a program is run, its parameters might be possible to see\n   when listing the running processes of the system. Thus, other users may be\n   able to watch your passwords if you pass them as plain command line\n   options. There are ways to circumvent this.It is worth noting that while this is how HTTP Authentication works, very\n   many web sites will not use this concept when they provide logins etc. See\n   the Web Login chapter further below for more details on that.Just adding so you don\'t have to click-through:or if you\'re trying to do send authentication for OAuth 2:Bearer tokens look like this:(for those who are looking for php-curl answer) This worked for me:  Be careful that when you using:\ncurl -H "Authorization: token_str" http://www.example.comtoken_str and Authorization must be separated by white space, otherwise server-side will not get the HTTP_AUTHORIZATION environment.For HTTP Basic Auth:curl -H "Authorization: Basic <_your_token_>" http://www.example.comreplace _your_token_ and the URL.
