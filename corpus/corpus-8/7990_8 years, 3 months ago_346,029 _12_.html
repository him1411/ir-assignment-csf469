I\'m planning to use PHP for a simple requirement.  I need to download a XML content from a URL, for which I need to send HTTP GET request to that URL.How do I do it in PHP?Unless you need more than just the contents of the file, you could use file_get_contents.For anything more complex, I\'d use cURL.For more advanced GET/POST requests, you can install the CURL library (http://us3.php.net/curl):http_get should do the trick. The advantages of http_get over file_get_contents include the ability to view HTTP headers, access request details, and control the connection timeout.Remember that if you are using a proxy you need to do a little trick in your php code:Depending on whether your php setup allows fopen on URLs, you could also simply fopen the url with the get arguments in the string (such as http://example.com?variable=value )Edit: Re-reading the question I\'m not certain whether you\'re looking to pass variables or not - if you\'re not you can simply send the fopen request containg http://example.com/filename.xml - feel free to ignore the variable=value partI like using fsockopen open for this.In the other hand, using REST API of other servers are very popular in PHP. Suppose you are looking for a way to redirect some HTTP requests into the other server (for example getting an xml file). Here is a PHP package to help you:So, getting the xml file:
