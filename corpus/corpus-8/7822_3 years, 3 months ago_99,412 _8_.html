This question already has an answer here:I am using Eclipse Luna with the m2e plug-in. When I search for dependencies, I get the following warning (also see the screenshot after):Index downloads are disabled, search result may be incomplete.How can I enable index downloads?Tick \'Full Index Enabled\' and then \'Rebuild Index\' of the central repository in \'Global Repositories\' under Window > Show View > Other > Maven > Maven Repositories, and it should work.The rebuilding may take a long time depending on the speed of your internet connection, but eventually it works.
