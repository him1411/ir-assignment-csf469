When viewing information about stylesheets in the Network tab of Chrome\'s dev tools, one column specifies both "size" and "content":Can anybody shed light on the difference between these two numbers? On some pages the numbers are close and others they are different by a considerable amount."Size" is the number of bytes on the wire, and "content" is the actual size of the resource. A number of things can make them different, including:From the docs:Size is the combined size of the response headers (usually a few\n  hundred bytes) plus the response body, as delivered by the server.\n  Content is the size of the resource\'s decoded content. If the resource\n  was loaded from the browser\'s cache rather than over the network, this\n  field will contain the text (from cache).Size is the size of response itself, and Content is the size of resource, that you are accessing.Compare:empty cache: main.js GET 200 OK .. Size: 31.72KB Content: 31.42KBcached: main.js GET 304 Not modified .. Size: 146B Content: 31.42KBIn simple terms Google article explain it as \nSize = Transfer size and Content = Actual size\nThis is my formula based on reading various articles on this topic (and I am open to improve it further with your comments) \nSize = Compression(Content) + Response Header See the image used in this articleExplanation by Google
