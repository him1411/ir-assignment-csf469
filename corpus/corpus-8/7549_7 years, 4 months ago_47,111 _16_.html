In every modern day IDE and text editor, there is an action to open a file without putting your hand on the mouse.  For example:Eclipse: Cmd|Ctrl + Shift + R -> Open ResourceIntelliJ: Cmd|Ctrl + Shift + N -> Open FileTextMate: Cmd + T -> Go to FileIn Xcode, I have found no such options.  Please, please tell me I just overlooked it in my growing frustration.Is there a "Go to file" or "Open File" shortcut in Xcode?Since Xcode 4 (including 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9) it\'s \xe2\x8c\x98 + \xe2\x87\xa7 + OCommand + Shift + O is now the shortcut to find a file quickly and open it in Xcode 4Its not quite the same, but this might interest you:Cmd + alt + JOpens the project navigator and highlights the search bar, ready to type.Cmd + shift + J\nJust opens the project navigator.File → Open Quickly...You can assign a shortcut to it in Preferences → Key Bindings. The default should be Cmd+Shift+D.(If you have a #include/#import, you can place the text cursor on it and press Cmd+Shift+D to fill the file name automatically.)Also note that if you hold down Command and click on the name of a class, Xcode will jump you to that class\' implementation.
