First open the file for editing, e.g.:sudo gedit /etc/php5/apache2/php.iniORsudo gedit /etc/php/7.0/apache2/php.iniNext, search for the post_max_size entry, and enter a larger number than the size of your database (15M in this case), for example:Next edit the entry for memory_limit and give it a larger value than the one given to post_max_size. Then ensure the value of upload_max_filesize is smaller than post_max_size.The order from biggest to smallest should be:After saving the file, restart apache (e.g. sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart) and you are set.Don\'t forget to Restart Apache Services for changes to be applied.For further details, click here.Increase phpMyAdmin upload / import sizeBy default you get a 2mb limit of upload / import size in phpmyadmin. That makes it odd and highly impossible to import larger files. You can increase the allowed upload size of phpmyadmin by editing your server\xe2\x80\x99s php.ini configuration file.

So I had to change the php.ini file under that webserver as well which is in the path:/usr/local/zend/gui/lighttpd/etc/php-fcgi.iniIn the end, you were right about the files, of course, but I was wrong on what file I had to change :)C:\\xampp\\php\\php.ini in my case\nor it could be C:\\php\\php.ini if the Apache / PHP / MySQL are stand aloneupload_max_filesize = 2M by defaultso it can be changed as desired.

The below is from the phpinfo():It turns out that the first result in the locate command above is what I\'m looking for.At least in OS X 10.9.4 Mavericks (OS X is something new to me) /etc is actually a link, etc -> private/etc, and by the looks of it PHP assumes default values unless php.ini is actually present.I copied /private/etc/php.ini.defaultThen checked the variables in the new /etc/php.ini as per Aditya Bhatt advice above and it worked.\nIn my case the values were:Obviously, the apache service has to be restarted to see the changes.How to import huge amount of Data in Xampp It\xe2\x80\x99s the best solution to open new, clean database, and import the file in phpMyAdmin. Choose file from local folder and leave all settings as is. That should be it.But if your file exceeded file size of 2MB (that is default value in xampp installation) than you need to tweak some out. Basically we will just increase the maximum upload file size.Open your xampp install folder and go to php folder. With some text editor file (notepad++) open the file called php.ini (by type windows describe it as configuration settings) and edit the line (cca. 770, or press ctrl+f  in notepad++ to find it):post_max_size = 2Minstead 2M, put wanted maximum file size (16MB for example but not higher than 128M), after that go to this line:\nmax_execution_time = 30\ninstead 30, increase execution time that\xe2\x80\x99s in seconds (90 for example), also you need to change this line:instead 60, increase input time in seconds (120 for example)\nand top of all you have to change this line:instead of 2M, increase to 16M for example.\nSave the file, restart apache and mysql in xampp and try to upload again, if you follow correctly you should be able to import files through 16MB (example)None of the current answers will work for WHM / cPanel servers.To increase the limit in WHM:You could just use MySQL administrator app or MySQL workbench.\nLightweight apps and you can export or import your entire server however the size.\nAm late to the party here but I hope it helps someone.I had the same problem, My upload limit was 2 MB, I edited my php.ini, and I set it to 5 MB but still it was showing 2 MB even after restarting server. Than I compressed my .sql file to zip by keeping its name as xyz.sql.zip so it became 451 kb from 3.5 mb. Then I uploaded it again. It worked for me.I found that increasing the upload and post limit in php.ini did not affect the limit in phpmyadmin.  This is because my server has a separate setting for cpanel upload limit.  If you have access to WHM, you probably have this.To adjust:No need to restart apache or anything, changes are instant.  This process increased the value of max upload file size in phpmyadmin.  You can check this by going to phpmyadmin and selecting your database, then clicking "import" at the top.  Beside the file selector you will see the upload limit.  My server default was 100.This is also frequently asked question in the phpMyAdmin documentation: http://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/faq.html#i-cannot-upload-big-dump-files-memory-http-or-timeout-problemsIn my case, I also had to add the line "FcgidMaxRequestLen 1073741824" (without the quotes) in /etc/apache2/mods-available/fcgid.conf.
