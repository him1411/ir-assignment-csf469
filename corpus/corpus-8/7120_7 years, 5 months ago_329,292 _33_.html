This question already has an answer here:My Hashtable in Java would benefit from a value having a tuple structure. What data structure can I use in Java to do that?I don\'t think there is a general purpose tuple class in Java but a custom one might be as easy as the following:Of course, there are some important implications of how to design this class further regarding equality, immutability, etc., especially if you plan to use instances as keys for hashing.javatuples is a dedicated project for tuples in Java.Apache Commons provided some common java utilities including a Pair. It implements Map.Entry, Comparable and Serializable.If you are looking for a built-in Java two-element tuple, try AbstractMap.SimpleEntry.As an extension to @maerics nice answer, I\'ve added a few useful methods:Another 2 cents : Starting with Java 7, there is now a class for this in standard Lib : javafx.util.Pair.And Yes, It is standard Java, now that JavaFx is included in the JDK :)Here\'s this exact same question elsewhere, that includes a more robust equals, hash that maerics alludes to:http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.java.help/browse_thread/thread/f8b63fc645c1b487/1d94be050cfc249bThat discussion goes on to mirror the maerics vs ColinD approaches of "should I re-use a class Tuple with an unspecific name, or make a new class with specific names each time I encounter this situation".  Years ago I was in the latter camp; I\'ve evolved into supporting the former.Android Tuple UtilsThis object provides a sensible implementation of equals(), returning true if equals() is true on each of the contained objects.To supplement @maerics\'s answer, here is the Comparable tuple:Create a class that describes the concept you\'re actually modeling and use that. It can just store two Set<Long> and provide accessors for them, but it should be named to indicate what exactly each of those sets is and why they\'re grouped together.With lombok it\'s easy to declare a Pair class:This will generates getters, static constructor named "of", equals(), hashcode() and toString().see @Data documentation for more informationYou can use Google Guava TableWith proper formatting, making it more new developer friendly, and fixing bug in Aram Kocharyan\'s equals() function.Though the article is pretty old now, and though I understand that I\'m not really very helpful, I think the work done here: http://www.pds.ewi.tudelft.nl/pubs/papers/cpe2005.pdf, would have been nice in mainstream Java.You can do things like:ororHere tuples are:This approach increasesI will start from a general point of view about tuples in Java and finish with an implication for your concrete problem.1) The way tuples are used in non-generic languages is avoided in Java because they are not type-safe (e.g. in Python: tuple = (4, 7.9, \'python\')). If you still want to use something like a general purpose tuple (which is not recommended), you should use Object[] or List<Object> and cast the elements after a check with instanceof to assure type-safety.Usually, tuples in a certain setting are always used the same way with containing the same structure. In Java, you have to define this structure explicitly in a class to provide well-defined, type-safe values and methods. This seems annoying and unnecessairy at first but prevents errors already at compile-time.2) If you need a tuple containing the same (super-)classes Foo, use Foo[], List<Foo>, or List<? extends Foo> (or the lists\'s immutable counterparts). Since a tuple is not of a defined length, this solution is equivalent.3) In your case, you seem to need a Pair (i.e. a tuple of well-defined length 2). This renders maerics\'s answer or one of the supplementory answers the most efficient since you can reuse the code in the future.
