I\'m trying to use this code to replace spaces with _, it works for the first space in the string but all the other instances of spaces remain unchanged. Anybody know why?Try .replace(/ /g,"_"); Edit: or .split(\' \').join(\'_\') if you have an aversion to REsEdit: John Resig said:If you\'re searching and replacing\n  through a string with a static search\n  and a static replace it\'s faster to\n  perform the action with\n  .split("match").join("replace") -\n  which seems counter-intuitive but it\n  manages to work that way in most\n  modern browsers. (There are changes\n  going in place to grossly improve the\n  performance of .replace(/match/g,\n  "replace") in the next version of\n  Firefox - so the previous statement\n  won\'t be the case for long.)try this:that\'ll do a global find/replacejavascript replaceTo answer Prasanna\'s question below:How do you replace multiple spaces by\n  single space in Javascript ?You would use the same function replace with a different regular expression.  The expression for whitespace is \\s and the expression for "1 or more times" is + the plus sign, so you\'d just replace Adam\'s answer with the following:I created JS performance test for it http://jsperf.com/split-and-join-vs-replace2You can try thisIt will even replace multiple spaces with single \'-\'.Replace spaces with underscore Output: How_are_youI know this is old but I didn\'t see anyone mention extending the String prototype.
