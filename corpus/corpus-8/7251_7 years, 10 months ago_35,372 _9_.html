When a compile fails in VB.NET in Visual Studio 2008, an Error List pops up at the bottom of the screen.

It gets a little bit tedious at times having to reach down and double click a list that I like to keep collapsed.F8 (and Shift+F8 to go backwards).Or at least that\'s what it is in my keyboard profile - you can go to tools\\options\\environment\\keyboard and check out Edit.GoToNextLocation.Note If you configured Visual Studio using VB keyboard settings, no key has been assigned to this function.
