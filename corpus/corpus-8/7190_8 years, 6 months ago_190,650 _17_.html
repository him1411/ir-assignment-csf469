In Java, Is there an object that acts like a Map for storing and accessing key/value pairs, but can return an ordered list of keys and an ordered list of values, such that the key and value lists are in the same order?So as explanation-by-code, I\'m looking for something that behaves like my fictitious OrderedMap:The SortedMap interface (with the implementation TreeMap) should be your friend.The interface has the methods:So this interface fulfills exactly your requirements. However, the keys must have a meaningful order. Otherwise you can used the LinkedHashMap where the order is determined by the insertion order.Is there an object that acts like a Map for storing and accessing key/value pairs, but can return an ordered list of keys and an ordered list of values, such that the key and value lists are in the same order?You\'re looking for java.util.LinkedHashMap. You\'ll get a list of Map.Entry<K,V> pairs, which always get iterated in the same order. That order is the same as the order by which you put the items in. Alternatively, use the java.util.SortedMap, where the keys must either have a natural ordering or have it specified by a Comparator.LinkedHashMap maintains the order of the keys.java.util.LinkedHashMap appears to work just like a normal HashMap otherwise.I think the closest collection you\'ll get from the framework is the SortedMapI think the SortedMap interface enforces what you ask for and TreeMap implements that. http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/SortedMap.html\nhttp://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/TreeMap.htmlSince Java 6 there is also non-blocking thread-safe alternative to TreeMap.\nSee ConcurrentSkipListMap.You can leverage NavigableMap interface that may be accessed and traversed in either ascending or descending key order. This interface is intended to supersede the SortedMap interface. The Navigable map is usually sorted according to the natural ordering of its keys, or by a Comparator provided at map creation time.There are three most useful implementations of it: TreeMap, ImmutableSortedMap, and ConcurrentSkipListMap.
