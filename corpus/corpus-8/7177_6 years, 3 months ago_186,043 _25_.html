I am getting timeouts using the Entity Framework (EF) when using a function import that takes over 30 seconds to complete. I tried the following and have not been able to resolve this issue:I added Default Command Timeout=300000 to the connection string in the App.Config file in the project that has the EDMX file as suggested here.This is what my connection string looks like:I tried setting the CommandTimeout in my repository directly like so:What else can I do to get the EF from timing out? This only happens for very large datasets. Everything works fine with small datasets.Here is one of the errors I\'m getting:System.Data.EntityCommandExecutionException: An error occurred while executing the command definition. See the inner exception for details. ---> System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: Timeout expired.  The timeout period elapsed prior to completion of the operation or the server is not responding.OK - I got this working and it\'s silly what happened. I had both the connection string with Default Command Timeout=300000 and the CommandTimeout set to 180. When I removed the Default Command Timeout from the connection string, it worked. So the answer is to manually set the CommandTimeout in your repository on your context object like so:Apparently setting the timeout settings in the connection string has no effect on it.There is a known bug with specifying default command timeout within the EF connection string.http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=56806Remove the value from the connection string and set it on the data context object itself. This will work if you remove the conflicting value from the connection string.If you are using a DbContext, use the following constructor to set the command timeout:If you are using DbContext and EF v6+, alternatively you can use:Usually I handle my operations within a transaction. As I\'ve experienced, it is not enough to set the context command timeout, but the transaction needs a constructor with a timeout parameter. I had to set both time out values for it to work properly.At the end of the function I set back the command timeout to the previous value in prevto.Using EF6This is what I\'ve fund out. Maybe it will help to someone:So here we go:If You use LINQ with EF looking for some exact elements contained in the list like this:everything is going fine until IdList contains more than one Id.The \xe2\x80\x9ctimeout\xe2\x80\x9d problem comes out if the list contains just one Id. To resolve the issue use if condition to check number of ids in IdList. Example:Explanation:Simply try to use Sql Profiler and check the Select statement generated by Entity frameeork. \xe2\x80\xa6
