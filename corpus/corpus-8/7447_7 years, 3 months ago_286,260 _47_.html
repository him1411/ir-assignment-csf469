I\'m experienced with PHP, JavaScript and a lot of other scripting languages, but I don\'t have a lot of experience with Java or Android.I\'m looking for a way to send POST data to a PHP script and display the result.                * (Re) Updated Answer which works on Android 6.0*References: Older AnswerNote: This solution is outdated. It only works on Android devices up to 5.1. Android 6.0 and above do not include the Apache http client used in this answer.Http Client from Apache Commons is the way to go. It is already included in android. Here\'s a simple example of how to do HTTP Post using it.for Android 6 & 5The org.apache.http classes and the AndroidHttpClient class have been deprecated in Android 5.1. These classes are no longer being maintained and you should migrate any app code using these APIs to the URLConnection classes as soon as possible.https://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-5.1.html#httpThought of sharing my code using HttpUrlConnection ...also you can Post method :Update 21/02/2016for post request with json , see this example :UPDATE 24/08/2016Use some best library , such as :because :On lower API levels (mostly on Gingerbread and Froyo), HttpUrlConnection and HttpClient are far from being perfectSince the introduction of Honeycomb (API 11), it\'s been mandatory to perform network operations on a separate thread, different from the main threadBy this way we can send data with http post method and get resultThis is an example of how to POST multi-part data WITHOUT using external Apache libraries:to @primpop answer I would add how to convert the response in a String:Here is an example of convertStramToString.Better use Apache Commons HttpClient, that is also included in android already.\nHave a look at \nAndroid Developer: Apache HTTP Client Package Summary\nfor general api info.You can use this to send an HTTP POST request to a URL. You can easily send request and get response. I always use this . I fine work to me.You Also need to Add bellow Jar file in libs foldeFinally edit your build.gradleIn the last Rebuild your project.You can use URLConnection with setDoOutput(true), getOutputStream() (for sending data), and getInputStream() (for receiving).   Sun has an example for exactly this.For me works next :If you just want to append data to the Url You can do so by using HttpUrlConnection since HttpClient is now deprecated.\nA better way would be to use a library like-Volley \nRetrofit We can post data to the php script and fetch result and display it by using this code performed Through AsyncTask class.But using libraries such as volley or retrofit is much better option because Asynctask class and HttpurlConnection is slower compared to libraries. Also the library will fetch everything and is faster as well.Method to post data as HTTP request,In newer versions of Android you have to put all web I/O requests into a new thread. AsyncTask works best for small requests.You can POST an HttpRequest using WebServer class and track the response in its listener interface.Now create a DataRack to bind your dataNow simply send the POST request with that rackYou need to include my library for this.
