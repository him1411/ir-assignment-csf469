The ObjectiveC.swift file from the standard library contains the following few lines of code around line 228:What does open var mean in this context, or what is the open keyword in general?open is a new access level in Swift 3, introduced with the implementation\nofIt is available with the Swift 3 snapshot from August 7, 2016, \nand with Xcode 8 beta 6.In short:So open is what public used to be in previous\nSwift releases and the access of public has been restricted.\nOr, as Chris Lattner puts it in \nSE-0177: Allow distinguishing between public access and public overridability:\xe2\x80\x9copen\xe2\x80\x9d is now simply \xe2\x80\x9cmore public than public\xe2\x80\x9d, providing a very simple and clean model.In your example, open var hashValue is a property which is accessible and can be overridden in NSObject subclasses.For more examples and details, have a look at SE-0117.Open is an access level, was introduced to impose limitations on class inheritance on Swift. This means that the open access level can only be applied to classes and class members.In ClassesAn open class can be subclassed in the module it is defined in and in modules that import the module in which the class is defined.In Class membersThe same applies to class members. An open method can be overridden by subclasses in the module it is defined in and in modules that import the module in which the method is defined.NEED OF THIS UPDATIONSome classes of libraries and frameworks are not designed to be subclassed and doing so may result in unexpected behavior. Native Apple library also wont allows to override same methods and classes, So after this addition they will apply public and private access levels accordingly.For more details have look at Apple Documentation on Access ControlExcept for subclass, an open class func is also accessible from anywhere in your project. Say you are defining an open class function in your Util class like thisThen in anywhere of your view controllers, you can simply access this method by callingRead open as open for inheritance in other modulesI repeat open for inheritance in other modules. \nSo an open class is open for subclassing in other modules that include the defining module. Open vars and functions are open for overriding in other modules. Its the least restrictive access level. It is as good as public access accept that something that is public is closed for inheritance in other modules. From Apple Docs Open access applies only to classes and class members, and it differs from public access as follows:Classes with public access, or any more restrictive access level, can\n  be subclassed only within the module where they\xe2\x80\x99re defined. Class members with public access, or any more restrictive access level, can\n  be overridden by subclasses only within the module where they\xe2\x80\x99re\n  defined.Open classes can be subclassed within the module where they\xe2\x80\x99re defined, and within any module that imports the module where\n  they\xe2\x80\x99re defined.
