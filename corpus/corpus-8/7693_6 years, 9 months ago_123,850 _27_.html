Ruby example:The successful Python string concatenation is seemingly verbose to me.Python 3.6 will add literal string interpolation similar to Ruby\'s string interpolation.  Starting with that version of Python (which is scheduled to be released by the end of 2016), you will be able to include expressions in "f-strings", e.g.Prior to 3.6, the closest you can get to this isThe % operator can be used for string interpolation in Python.  The first operand is the string to be interpolated, the second can have different types including a "mapping", mapping field names to the values to be interpolated.  Here I used the dictionary of local variables locals() to map the field name name to its value as a local variable.The same code using the .format() method of recent Python versions would look like this:There is also the string.Template class:Since Python 2.6.X you might want to use:I\'ve developed the interpy package, that enables string interpolation in Python.Just install it via pip install interpy.\nAnd then, add the line # coding: interpy at the beginning of your files!Example:Python\'s string interpolation is similar to C\'s printf() If you try:The tag %s will be replaced with the name variable. You should take a look to the print function tags: http://docs.python.org/library/functions.htmlString interpolation is going to be included with Python 3.6 as specified in PEP 498. You will be able to do this:Note that I hate Spongebob, so writing this was slightly painful. :)Usage:PS: performance may be a problem. This is useful for local scripts, not for production logs.Duplicated:Python string formatting: % vs. .formatWhat is the Python equivalent of embedding an expression in a string? (ie. "#{expr}" in Ruby)What is Ruby equivalent of Python's `s= "hello, %s. Where is %s?" % ("John","Mary")`Is there a Python equivalent to Ruby's string interpolation?You can also have thishttp://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#formatstringsFor old Python (tested on 2.4) the top solution points the way. You can do this:And you get
