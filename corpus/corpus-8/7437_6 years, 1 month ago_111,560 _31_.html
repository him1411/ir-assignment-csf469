I created a new Rails project using rails 3.1.0.rc4 on my local machine but when I try to start the server I get:\nCould not find a JavaScript runtime. See here for a list of available runtimes. (ExecJS::RuntimeUnavailable)Note: This is not about Heroku.To install nodejs on ubuntu, you can type the following command in the terminal:To install nodejs on systems using yum, type the following in the terminal:Note from Michael 12/28/2011 - I have changed my accept from this (rubytheracer) to above (nodejs) as therubyracer has code size issues.  Heroku now strongly discourage it.   It will \'work\' but may have size/performance issues. If you add a runtime, such as therubyracer to your Gemfile and run bundle then try and start the server it should work.A javascript runtime is required for compiling coffeescript and also for uglifier.Update, 12/12/2011: Some folks found issues with rubytheracer (I think it was mostly code size).  They found execjs (or nodejs) worked just as well (if not better) and were much smaller.   n.b.

This came after trying multiple other routes including trying to get \'therubyracer\' working. Though the github for node.js suggests that installation on windows is still unstable, the website at http://nodejs.org/ had a Windows installer which worked perfectly.if you already install nodejs from source for example, and execjs isn\'t recognizing it you might want to try this tip: https://coderwall.com/p/hyjdlwIf all fails you can try# aptitude install nodejsas root. You can test your install with the following command:# node -vIf you want to install NPM, please refer following link. Hope it helps.On CentOS 6.5, the following worked for me:The error is caused by the absence of a Javascript runtime on your local machine. To resolve this, you\'ll need to install NodeJS.You can install NodeJS through the Node Version Manager or nvm:First, install nvm:  Install Node through nvm:This will install version 5.9.1 of Node.
