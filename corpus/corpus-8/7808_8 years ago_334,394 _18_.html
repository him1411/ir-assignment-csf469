If I have a span, say:How do I use JavaScript to change "hereismytext" to "newtext"?EDIT\nFor modern browsers :Using innerHTML is SO NOT RECOMMENDED.\nInstead, you should create a textNode. This way, you are "binding" your text and you are not, at least in this case, vulnerable to an XSS attack.The right way:For more information about this vulnerability:\nCross Site Scripting (XSS) - OWASPIf you are the one supplying the text and no part of the text is supplied by the user (or some other source that you don\'t control), then setting innerHTML is fine:However, as others note, if you are not the source for any part of the text string, using innerHTML can subject you to content injection attacks like XSS if you\'re not careful to properly sanitize the text first.If you are using input from the user, here is one way to do it securely while also maintaining cross-browser compatibility:Firefox doesn\'t support innerText and IE8 doesn\'t support textContent so you need to use both if you want to maintain cross-browser compatibility.And if you want to avoid reflows (caused by innerText) where possible:I use Jquery and none of the above helped, I don\'t know why but this worked:Here\'s another way:The innerText property will be detected by Safari, Google Chrome and MSIE.  For Firefox, the standard way of doing things was to use textContent but since version 45 it too has an innerText property, as someone kindly apprised me recently. This solution tests to see if a browser supports either of these properties and if so, assigns the "newtext". Live demo: hereLike in other answer, innerHTML and innerText are not recommended, it\'s better use textContent. This attribute is well supported, you can check it this:\n    http://caniuse.com/#search=textContentFor this span You can go like this :-
