I\'ve read the examples in python docs, but still can\'t figure out what this method means. Can somebody help? Here are two examples from the python docsandthe parameters int and list are for what? Usually, a Python dictionary throws a KeyError if you try to get an item with a key that is not currently in the dictionary.  The defaultdict in contrast will simply create any items that you try to access (provided of course they do not exist yet).  To create such a "default" item, it calls the function object that you pass in the constructor (more precisely, it\'s an arbitrary "callable" object, which includes function and type objects).  For the first example, default items are created using int(), which will return the integer object 0.  For the second example, default items are created using list(), which returns a new empty list object.defaultdict means that if a key is not found in the dictionary, then instead of a KeyError being thrown, a new entry is created. The type of this new entry is given by the argument of defaultdict.For example:"The standard dictionary includes the method setdefault() for retrieving a value and establishing a default if the value does not exist. By contrast, defaultdict lets the caller specify the default(value to be returned) up front when the container is initialized."as defined by Doug Hellmann in The Python Standard Library by ExampleInitialize it by passing callable as its first argument(mandatory)**kwargs as its second argument(optional)orAs is a child class of standard dictionary, it can perform all the same functions.But in case of passing an unknown key it returns the default value instead of error. For ex:In case you want to change default value overwrite default_factory:orExample 1As int has been passed as default_factory, any unknown key will return 0 by default.Now as the string is passed in the loop, it will increase the count of those alphabets in d.Example 2As a list has been passed as default_factory, any unknown(non-existent) key will return [ ](ie. list) by default.Now as the list of tuples is passed in the loop, it will append the value in the d[color]There is a great explanation of defaultdicts here: http://ludovf.net/blog/python-collections-defaultdict/Basically, the parameters int and list are functions that you pass. Remember that Python accepts function names as arguments. int returns 0 by default and list returns an empty list when called with parentheses.In normal dictionaries, if in your example I try calling d[a], I will get an error (KeyError), since only keys m, s, i and p exist and key a has not been initialized. But in a defaultdict, it takes a function name as an argument, when you try to use a key that has not been initialized, it simply calls the function you passed in and assigns its return value as the value of the new key.Since the question is about "how it works", some readers may want to see more nuts and bolts. Specifically, the method in question is the __missing__(key) method. See: https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#defaultdict-objects .More concretely, this answer shows how to make use of __missing__(key) in a practical way:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/17956989/1593924To clarify what \'callable\' means, here\'s an interactive session (from 2.7.6 but should work in v3 too):That was the most typical use of defaultdict (except for the pointless use of the x variable). You can do the same thing with 0 as the explicit default value, but not with a simple value:Instead, the following works because it passes in a simple function (it creates on the fly a nameless function which takes no arguments and always returns 0):And with a different default value:My own 2\xc2\xa2: you can also subclass defaultdict:This could come in handy for very complex cases.The standard dictionary includes the method setdefault() for retrieving a value and establishing a default if the value does not exist. By contrast, defaultdict lets the caller specify the default up front when the container is initialized.This works well as long as it is appropriate for all keys to have the same default. It can be especially useful if the default is a type used for aggregating or accumulating values, such as a list, set, or even int. The standard library documentation includes several examples of using defaultdict this way.I think its best used in place of a switch case statement. Imagine if we have a switch case statement as below:There is no switch case statements available in python. We can achieve the same by using defaultdict.It prints:In the above snippet dd has no keys 4 or 5 and hence it prints out a default value which we have configured in a helper function. This is quite nicer than a raw dictionary where a KeyError is thrown if key is not present. From this it is evident that defaultdict more like a switch case statement where we can avoid a complicated if-elif-elif-else blocks.One more good example that impressed me a lot from this site is:If we try to access any items other than eggs and spam we will get a count of 0.The documentation and the explanation are pretty much self-explanatory:http://docs.python.org/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdictThe type function(int/str etc.) passed as an argument is used to initialize a default value for any given key where the key is not present in the dict.
