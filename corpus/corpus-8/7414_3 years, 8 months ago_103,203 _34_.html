I\'m playing with lambdas in Java 8 and I came across warning local variables referenced from a lambda expression must be final or effectively final. I know that when I use variables inside anonymous class they must be final in outer class, but still - what is the difference between final and effectively final?... starting in Java SE 8, a local class can access local variables and parameters of the enclosing block that are final or effectively final. A variable or parameter whose value is never changed after it is initialized is effectively final.For example, suppose that the variable numberLength is not declared final, and you add the marked assignment statement in the PhoneNumber constructor:Because of this assignment statement, the variable numberLength is not effectively final anymore. As a result, the Java compiler generates an error message similar to "local variables referenced from an inner class must be final or effectively final" where the inner class PhoneNumber tries to access the numberLength variable:http://codeinventions.blogspot.in/2014/07/difference-between-final-and.htmlhttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/localclasses.htmlI find the simplest way to explain "effectively final" is to imagine adding the final modifier to a variable declaration. If, with this change, the program continues to behave in the same way, both at compile time and at run time, then that variable is effectively final.[Edit: Henno Vermeulen, in a comment below, points out a minor exception to this rule. The rule is still very simple and useful, but syntax rules mean it isn\'t universally applicable.] According to the docs:A variable or parameter whose value is never changed after it is initialized is effectively final.Basically, if the compiler finds a variable does not appear in assignments outside of its initialization, then the variable is considered effectively final.For example, consider some class:From a article by \'Brian Goetz\',\'Effectively final\' is a variable which would not give compiler error\n  if it were to be appended by \'final\'lambda-state-final- Brian GoetzA variable is final or effectively final when it\'s initialized once and it\'s never mutated in its owner class. And we can\'t initialize it in loops or inner classes.Final:Effectively Final:When a lambda expression uses an assigned local variable from its enclosing space there is an important restriction. A lambda expression may only use local variable whose value doesn\'t change. That restriction is referred as "variable capture" which is described as; lambda expression capture values, not variables. \nThe local variables that a lambda expression may use are known as "effectively final". \nAn effectively final variable is one whose value does not change after it is first assigned. There is no need to explicitly declare such a variable as final, although doing so would not be an error.\nLet\'s see it with an example, we have a local variable i which is initialized with the value 7, with in the lambda expression we are trying to change that value by assigning a new value to i. This will result in compiler error - "Local variable i defined in an enclosing scope must be final or effectively final"This variable below is final, so we can\'t change it\'s value once initialised. If we try to we\'ll get a compilation error...But if we create a variable like this, we can change it\'s value...But in Java 8, all variables are final by default. But the existence of the 2nd line in the code makes it non-final. So if we remove the 2nd line from the above code, our variable is now "effectively final"...So.. Any variable that is assigned once and only once, is "effectively final".As others have said, a variable or parameter whose value is never changed after it is initialized is effectively final. In the above code, if you change the value of x in inner class FirstLevel then the compiler will give you the error message:Local variables referenced from a lambda expression must be final or effectively final.If you could add the final modifier to a local variable, it was\n  effectively final.Lambda expressions can access static variables, instance variables,effectively final\nmethod parameters, and effectively final\nlocal variables.Source: OCP: Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 8 Programmer II Study Guide, Jeanne Boyarsky, Scott SelikoffHowever, starting in Java SE 8, a local class can access local variables and parameters of the >enclosing block that are final or effectively final.This didn\'t start on Java 8, I use this since long time.\nThis code used (before java 8) to be legal:
