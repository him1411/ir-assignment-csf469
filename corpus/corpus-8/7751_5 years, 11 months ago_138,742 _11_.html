I need to read a file from the file system and load the entire contents into a string in a groovy controller, what\'s the easiest way to do that?If you need to specify the character encoding, use the following instead:The shortest way is indeed justbut in this case you have no control on how the bytes in the file are interpreted as characters. AFAIK groovy tries to guess the encoding here by looking at the file content.If you want a specific character encoding you can specify a charset name withSee API docs on File.getText(String) for further reference.A slight variation...the easiest way would benew File(filename).getText()which means you could just do:new File(filename).text
