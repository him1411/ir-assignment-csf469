I have a dataset of about 1000 items in-memory and am attempting to create a pager for\nthis dataset, but I\'m not sure on how to do this.I\'m using a custom filter function to filter the results, and that works fine, but somehow I need to get the number of pages out.Any clues?Check out UI Bootstrap\'s pagination directive. I ended up using it rather than what is posted here as it has enough features for my current use and has a thorough test spec to accompany it.I have made a working plunker for reference.I have made a working plunker for reference.I recently implemented paging for the Built with Angular site. You chan checkout the source: https://github.com/angular/builtwith.angularjs.orgI\'d avoid using a filter to separate the pages. You should break up the items into pages within the controller.I\'ve had to implement pagination quite a few times with Angular, and it was always a bit of a pain for something that I felt could be simplified. I\'ve used some of the ideas presented here and elsewhere to make a pagination module that makes pagination as simple as:That\'s it. It has the following features:For those who are looking for a "plug and play" solution, I think you\'ll find this useful.The code is available here on GitHub and includes a pretty good set of tests:https://github.com/michaelbromley/angularUtils/tree/master/src/directives/paginationIf you are interested I also wrote a short piece with a little more insight into the design of the module: http://www.michaelbromley.co.uk/blog/108/paginate-almost-anything-in-angularjs/I just made a JSFiddle that show pagination + search + order by on each column using btford code: http://jsfiddle.net/SAWsA/11/I updated Scotty.NET\'s plunkr http://plnkr.co/edit/FUeWwDu0XzO51lyLAEIA?p=preview so that it uses newer versions of angular, angular-ui, and bootstrap.ControllerBootstrap UI componentThis is a pure javascript solution that I\'ve wrapped as an Angular service to implement pagination logic like in google search results.Working demo on CodePen at http://codepen.io/cornflourblue/pen/KVeaQL/Details and explanation at this blog postI\'ve extracted the relevant bits here. This is a \'no frills\' tabular pager, so sorting or filtering is not included. Feel free to change/add as needed:The jQuery Mobile angular adapter has a paging filter you could base off of. Here\'s a demo fiddle that uses it (add more than 5 items and it becomes paged): http://jsfiddle.net/tigbro/Du2DY/Here\'s the source: https://github.com/tigbro/jquery-mobile-angular-adapter/blob/master/src/main/webapp/utils/paging.jsFor anyone who find it difficult like me to create a paginator for a table I post this.\nSo, in your view :In your angularJs:I use this 3rd party pagination library and it works well. It can do local/remote datasources and it\'s very configurable.https://github.com/michaelbromley/angularUtils/tree/master/src/directives/paginationng-repeat paginationPrevious messages recommended basically how to build a paging by yourself. If you are like me, and prefer a finished directive, I just found a great one called ngTable. It supports sorting, filtering and pagination. It is a very clean solution, all you need in your view:And in controller:Link to GitHub: https://github.com/esvit/ng-table/There is my example. Selected button in the middle on the list\nController.\nconfig >>>Logic for pagination:and my view on bootstapIt is usefulI wish I could comment, but I\'ll just have to leave this here: Scotty.NET\'s answer and user2176745\'s redo for later versions are both great, but they both miss something that my version of AngularJS (v1.3.15) breaks on: i is not defined in $scope.makeTodos. As such, replacing with this function fixes it for more recent angular versions.Overview : Pagination usingView :JS Controller :Angular-Pagingis a wonderful choiceA directive to aid in paging large datasets while requiring the bare minimum of actual paging information. We are very dependant on the server for "filtering" results in this paging scheme. The central idea being we only want to hold the active "page" of items - rather than holding the entire list of items in memory and paging on the client-side.Old question but since I think my approach is a bit different and less complex I will share this and hope that someone besides me find it useful.What I found to be an easy and small solution to pagination is to combine a directive with a filter which uses the same scope variables.To implement this you add the filter on the array and add the directiv like thisp_Size and p_Step are scope variables which can be customized in the scope else the default value of the p_Size is 5 and p_Step is 1.When a step is change in the pagination the p_Step is updated and will trigger a new filtering by cust_pagination filter.\nThe cust_pagination filter then slices the array depending on the p_Step value like below and only return the active records selected in the pagination sectionDEMO View the complete solution in this plunkerYou can easily do this using Bootstrap UI directive.This answer is a modification of the answer given by @Scotty.NET, I have changed the code because <pagination> directive is deprecated now.Following code generates the pagination:To make it functional, use this in your controller:Refer to this for more options of pagination: Bootstrap UI Pagination DirectiveI would like to add my solution that works with ngRepeat and filters that you use with it without using a $watch or a sliced array.Your filter results will be paginated!In the HTML make sure that you apply your filters to the ngRepeat before the pagination filter.
