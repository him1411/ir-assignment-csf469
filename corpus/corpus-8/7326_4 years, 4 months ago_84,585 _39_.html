This is continuation of question\nSpring MVC @PathVariable getting truncatedSpring forum states that it has fixed(3.2 version) as part of ContentNegotiationManager. see the below link.\nhttps://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-6164\n\nhttps://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-7632In my application requestParameter with .com is truncated.Could anyone explain me how to use this new feature? how is it configurable at xml?Note:http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?137000-Spring-MVC-PathVariable-with-dot-(-)-is-getting-truncated&p=444607#post444607As far as i know this issue appears only for the pathvariable at the end of the requestmapping. We were able to solve that by defining the regex addon in the requestmapping.Spring considers that anything behind the last dot is a file extension such as .jsonor .xml and trucate it to retrieve your parameter.So if you have /somepath/{variable} :if you change your mapping to /somepath/{variable:.+} as suggested, any dot, including the last one will be consider as part of your parameter :If you don\'t care of extension recognition, you can disable it by overriding mvc:annotation-driven automagic :So, again, if you have /somepath/{variable} :note : the difference from the default config is visible only if you have a mapping like somepath/something.{variable}. see Resthub project issueif you want to keep extension management, since Spring 3.2 you can also set the useRegisteredSuffixPatternMatch property of RequestMappingHandlerMapping bean in order to keep suffixPattern recognition activated but limited to registered extension.Here you define only json and xml extensions : Note that mvc:annotation-driven accepts now a contentNegotiation option to provide a custom bean but the property of RequestMappingHandlerMapping has to be changed to true (default false) (cf. https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-7632).For that reason, you still have to override the all mvc:annotation-driven configuration. I opened a ticket to Spring to ask for a custom RequestMappingHandlerMapping : https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-11253. Please vote if you are intereted in.While overriding, be carreful to consider also custom Execution management overriding. Otherwise, all your custom Exception mappings will fail. You will have to reuse messageCoverters with a list bean :I implemented, in the open source project Resthub that I am part of, a set of tests on these subjects : see https://github.com/resthub/resthub-spring-stack/pull/219/files & https://github.com/resthub/resthub-spring-stack/issues/217In addition to Martin Frey\'s answer, this can also be fixed by adding a trailing slash in the RequestMapping value:Keep in mind that this fix does not support maintainability. It now requires all URI\'s to have a trailing slash - something that may not be apparent to API users / new developers. Because it\'s likely not all parameters may have a . in them, it may also create intermittent bugsUpdate for Spring 4: since 4.0.1 you can use PathMatchConfigurer (via your WebMvcConfigurer), e.g.In xml, it would be (https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-10163):adding the ":.+" worked for me, but not until I removed outer curly brackets.value = {"/username/{id:.+}"} didn\'t workvalue = "/username/{id:.+}"   worksHope I helped someone :)/somepath/{variable:.+} works in Java requestMapping tag.Here\'s an approach that relies purely on java configuration:One pretty easy way to work around this issue is to append a trailing slash ...e.g.:use :instead of:The complete solution including email addresses in path names for spring 4.2 is Add this to the application-xmlIf you are using Spring 3.2.x and <mvc:annotation-driven />, create this little BeanPostProcessor:Then put this in your MVC config xml:In Spring Boot, The  Regular expression solve the problem  like
