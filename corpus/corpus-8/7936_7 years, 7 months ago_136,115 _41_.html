For how long data, stored in localStorage (as a part of Dom Storage HTML 5) is available? Can I set expiration time for the data which, I put to localStorage?According to John Resig, it\'s not possible to specify expiration. It\'s completely up to the user.http://ejohn.org/blog/dom-storage/edit â€” obviously, your own application can actively remove stuff if it decides it\'s too old. That is, you can explicitly include some sort of timestamp in what you\'ve got saved, and then use that later to decide whether or not information should be flushed.I would suggest to store timestamp in the object you store in the localStorage You can parse the object, get the timestamp and compare with the current Date, and if necessary, update the value of the object.You can use lscache. It handles this for you automatically, including instances where the storage size exceeds the limit. If that happens, it begins pruning items that are the closest to their specified expiration.From the readme:This is the only real difference between the regular storage methods. Get, remove, etc work the same. If you don\'t need that much functionality, you can simply store a time stamp with the value (via JSON) and check it for expiry.Noteworthy, there\'s a good reason why local storage is left up to the user. But, things like lscache do come in handy when you need to store extremely temporary data.  While local storage does not supply an expiration mechanism, cookies do. Simply pairing a local storage key with a cookie provides an easy way to ensure that local storage can be updated with the same expiration parameters as a cookie.Example in jQuery:This example sets a cookie with the default parameter to expire when the browser is closed. Thus, when the browser is closed and re-opened, the local data store for your_data gets refreshed by a server-side call.Note that this is not exactly the same as removing the local data store, it is instead updating the local data store whenever the cookie expires. However, if your main goal is to be able to store more than 4K client-side (the limitation for cookie size), this pairing of cookie and local storage will help you to accomplish a larger storage size using the same expiration parameters as a cookie.Brynner Ferreira, has brought a good point: storing a sibling key where expiration info resides. This way, if you have a large amount of keys, or if your values are large Json objects, you don\'t need to parse them to access the timestamp.here follows an improved version:The lifecycle is controlled by the application/user.From the standard:User agents should expire data from the local storage areas only for security reasons or when requested to do so by the user. User agents should always avoid deleting data while a script that could access that data is running.From the W3C draft:User agents should expire data from the local storage areas only for security reasons or when requested to do so by the user. User agents should always avoid deleting data while a script that could access that data is running.You\'ll want to do your updates on your schedule using setItem(key, value); that will either add or update the given key with the new data.If someone using jStorage Plugin of jQuery the it can be add expiry with setTTL function if jStorage pluginWorkaround using angular and localforage:@sebarmeli\'s approach is the best in my opinion, but if you only want data to persist for the life of a session then sessionStorage is probably a better option:This is a global object (sessionStorage) that maintains a storage area\n  that\'s available for the duration of the page session. A page session\n  lasts for as long as the browser is open and survives over page\n  reloads and restores. Opening a page in a new tab or window will cause\n  a new session to be initiated.MDN: sessionStorageHere highly recommended to use sessionStoragefor set value usefor get value useclick here for view apiall ways for set areall ways for get areFor the benefit of searchers: Like Fernando, I didn\'t want to add a load of json when the values stored were simple. I just needed to track some UI interaction and keep the data relevant (e.g. how a user used an ecommerce site before checking out).This will not meet everyones criteria, but will hopefully be a quick copy+paste starter for someone and save adding another lib.NOTE: This would not be good if you need to retrieve the items individually.If anyone still looking for a quick solution and don\'t want dependencies like jquery etc I wrote a mini lib that add expiration to local / session / custom storage, you can find it with source here: https://github.com/RonenNess/ExpiredStorageIt works..
