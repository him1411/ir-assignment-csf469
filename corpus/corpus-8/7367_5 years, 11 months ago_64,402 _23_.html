I was in an (probably false) assumption that enabling the right margin indicator in xib is equivalent to using UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleLeftMargin inside code and so on.So, I used to think according to this snapshot:\nLater today I had to cross check, and stumbled upon this thread.And also the apple documentation, entitled with the section with title - "Handling Layout Changes Automatically Using Autoresizing Rules" in this link: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/WindowsViews/Conceptual/ViewPG_iPhoneOS/CreatingViews/CreatingViews.htmlSo I now have a renewed concept in my mind as to how setting autoresizing masks programmatically would be equivalent to xib settings:Scenario 1:\nSetting only (UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight) is equivalent to:In XIB?Scenario 2:\nSetting (UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleLeftMargin | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleRightMargin | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleTopMargin | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleBottomMargin) in code is equivalent to:In XIB?Are my 2 renewed scenarios correct? Am I right now in my understanding?Yes, Interface Builder has it "reversed" in a sense (or UIView, depending on how you look at it). Your cited "scenarios" are correct.Yes, you have cited things correctly.  Also, I agree that it feels a bit backwards, so for that reason I appreciate your post.You might like using a preprocessor Macro UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleMargins when making a UIView\'s margin flexible in every direction.  I put this in the precompiled header file so it gets included everywhere.Using UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleMargins will make a UI Element stay centered since it will NOT be hugging any one side.  To make the element grow / shrink with its parent, set the UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth and UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight respectively. I like using UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleMargins because I can later reference it like:instead ofAll to often I see these margins OR\'ed together on one line like the example above.  Just hard to read.Enabling the vertical/horizontal arrow (called spring) inside the box will make the height/width flexible. But enabling an outside line (called strut) will make that side inflexible/ non-flexible.Enabling the outer left line (left strut) is not equivalent to enabling UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleRightMargin. Instead, UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleRightMargin = on if right strut disabled, off if right strut enabled.It is quite confusing at first, but if you see closely, there is a difference in the springs and struts. I don\'t know why Apple did this, but for me, there were some cases where it was easier to use. And using opposite properties in code is even more confusing.
