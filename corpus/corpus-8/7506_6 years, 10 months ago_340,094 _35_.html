How do I verify the existence of an object in JavaScript?The following works:But this fails:Error: maybeObject is not defined.You can safely use the typeof operator on undefined variables.If it has been assigned any value, including null, typeof will return something other than undefined. typeof always returns a string.ThereforeThere are a lot of half-truths here, so I thought I make some things clearer.Actually you can\'t accurately tell if a variable exists (unless you want to wrap every second line into a try-catch block).The reason is Javascript has this notorious value of undefined which strikingly doesn\'t mean that the variable is not defined, or that it doesn\'t exist undefined !== not definedSo both a variable that exists and another one that doesn\'t can report you the undefined  type.As for @Kevin\'s misconception, null == undefined. It is due to type coercion, and it\'s the main reason why Crockford keeps telling everyone who is unsure of this kind of thing to always use strict equality operator === to test for possibly falsy values. null !== undefined gives you what you might expect. Please also note, that foo != null can be an effective way to check if a variable is neither undefined nor null. Of course you can be explicit, because it may help readability.If you restrict the question to check if an object exists, typeof o == "object" may be a good idea, except if you don\'t consider arrays objects, as this will also reported to be the type of object which may leave you a bit confused. Not to mention that typeof null will also give you object which is simply wrong.The primal area where you really should be careful about typeof, undefined, null, unknown and other misteries are host objects. They can\'t be trusted. They are free to do almost any dirty thing they want. So be careful with them, check for functionality if you can, because it\'s the only secure way to use a feature that may not even exist.You can use:If that\'s a global object, you can use if (!window.maybeObject)Two ways.You can test for a local object using typeof:You can test for a global object (one defined on the global scope) by inspecting the window object:You could use "typeof".I used to just do a if(maybeObject) as the null check in my javascripts. So only if maybeObject - is an object, the alert would be shown.\nI have an example in my site.https://sites.google.com/site/javaerrorsandsolutions/home/javascript-dynamic-checkboxesI\'ve just tested the typeOf examples from above and none worked for me, so instead I\'ve used this:Apart from checking the existence of the object/variable you may want to provide a "worst case" output or at least trap it into an alert so it doesn\'t go unnoticed.Example of function that checks, provides alternative, and catch errors.I created this also because the object I was passing to it could be  x  ,  x.m  , x.m[z]  and  typeof x.m[z] would fail with an error if x.m did not exist.I hope it helps. (BTW, I am novice with JS)set Textbox value to one frame to inline frame using div alignmnt tabbed panel.\nSo first of all, before set the value we need check selected tabbed panels frame available or not using following codes:Javascript Code :for me this worked:Think it\'s easiest like this    Or, you can all start using my exclusive exists() method instead and be able to do things considered impossible. i.e.:Things like: exists("blabla"), or even:  exists("foreignObject.guessedProperty.guessNext.propertyNeeded") are also possible...
