I\'m starting a new project, and would like to give a try to MVC 5 (I have built a web app using MVC 4 before).In Visual Studio 2013, I click the New Project and navigate to Visual C# > Web > Visual Studio 2012 (even though I have installed VS 2013 it says 2012 in the menu) and on that list I only have MVC 4 application - not 5.The framework in the drop down menu is set to .NET Framework 4.5.1 - and still nothing.I\'ve checked Tools > Extensions and Update and searched for MVC 5 - but it doesn\'t find anything official from Microsoft.How can I add MVC 5 to my Visual Studio 2013?Thank youVisual Studio 2013 no longer has separate project types for different ASP.Net features.You must select .NET Framework 4.5 (or higher) in order to see the ASP.NET Web Application template (For ASP.NET One).\nSo just select Visual C# > Web > ASP.NET Web Application, then select the MVC checkbox in the next step.Note: Make sure not to select the C# > Web > Visual Studio 2012 sub folder. MVC 5 is already built into Visual Studios 2013.Open a new project, on the left make sure you are under Templates > Visual C# > Web not Templates > Visual C# > Web > Visual Studios 2012.Important: Now look near the top of the new project dialog box and select .NET 4.5 or higher. Once under web and the proper framework is selected click ASP.NET Web Application in the middle pane. Click OK This will bring you to a page where you can select MVC as the project and start the wizard.  Go File -> New Project.Select Web under Visual C#.Select ASP.NET Web ApplicationClick OK.Select MVC.Click OK.With respect to other answers, it\'s not always there. Sometimes on setup process people forget to select the Web Developer Tools. In order to fix that, one should:It will download or use the setup media if exist. After the setup windows may restart, and you are ready to have fun with your Web Developer Tools now.Go File -> New Project. Select Web under Visual C#.Select ASP.NET Web Applicationselect mvc when solution is created, you will find resources getting added in solution in status bar of vs 2013. Check property of Dll file --> system.web.mvc, it shows latest version (5.2.2.0)but depending on your OS runtime version will be decided.Also, while installing Visual Studio 2013, ensure that you have checked "Web Developer Tools"You can look into Windows installed folder from here of your pc path:View of Opened file where showing installed MVC 3, MVC 4Select web development tools when you install the visual studio 2013.
