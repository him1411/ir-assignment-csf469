Is there a way in git to have a \'description\' for branches? While I try to use descriptive names, working for a while on a single branch sometimes dampens my memory of why I made some of the other topic branches. I try to use descriptive names for the branches but I think a \'description\' (short note about the purpose of the branch) would be nice. Git 1.7.9 supports this. From the 1.7.9 release notes:You can see that feature introduced back in September 2011, with commits 6f9a332, 739453a3, b7200e8:Open an editor and edit the text to explain what the branch is for, to be used by various other commands (e.g. request-pull).Note that it won\'t work for a detached HEAD branch.That description is used by the script request-pull: see commit c016814783, but also git merge --log.  request-pull is a script used to summarizes the changes between two commits to the standard output, and includes the given URL in the generated summary.If you do end up using the README, create a git alias modifying git checkout so that your README is displayed every time you switch branches.For example, add this in ~/.gitconfig, under [alias]After this, you can run git cor <branch_name> to switch branch and display the README of the branch you\'re switching to.The README suggested by Chris J can work, provided it is setup with a custom merge driver defined in a .gitattribute.\nThat way, the local version of the README is always preserved during merges.The "description" for branches is also know as a "comment" associated with that meta data, and it is not supported.At least, with a README file, you can, for any branch, do a:If your README is at the root directory of your REPO, it  will work from any path, since the path used by git show is an absolute one from the top directory of said repo.Use git branch --edit-description to set or edit a branch description.Here is a shell function to show branches similar to git branch but with descriptions appended.Here is what gb looks like, shown here as text in case the image rots:And as an image, so you can see the colors:Command will define a global option alias.about as shell expression. Running git about <branch> in a repository will display branch\'s description if set.Here\'s a possible implementation of the git branches command Greg Hewgill alluded to:There are two popular suggestions here:We\'ve decided to create an orphan branches-readme branch. Orphan branches are branches with their own separate history - you may know them from Github\'s gh-pages branches. This orphan branch contains a single README file. It has contents like:It is push-able and merge-friendly. View the README from any branch with:Disadvantages are that you need to checkout the weird orphan branch when you want to update the README and the README doesn\'t auto-update as branches get renamed, come or go. That is fine for us, though.Do it like:Similary, individual team members can also create their own  branches-$user orphan branches describing their own private branches if they want to, as long as they don\'t push them to the team.With further tooling this could also be integrated with the output of git branch. To that end, perhaps a README.yaml file could be considered instead of a plain README.You can attach comments to tags:By convention, you could have tags related to your branch names or you could use tag -f to keep a commented tag at the head of your topic branches.use:to show upstream branch:add -r to show remotes only or -a to show remotes and localI am pretty sure that feature is not currently supported. I think your best bet is to create a description text file, a README basically, in the branch that has the information that you want.The selected answer seems like overkill to me.  I\'d be inclined to maintain a per branch description file that is a normal source controlled file, say master.txt, dev.txt, etc. and if there is an unwieldy number or branches I\'d create a hierarchy to better organize it.
