For example, sometimes when I try to start Firefox it says a Firefox process is already running. So I have to do this:What I\'d like is a command that would do all that for me. It would take an input string and grep for it (or whatever) in the list of processes, and would kill all the processes in the output:I tried doing it in PHP but exec(\'ps aux\') seems to only show processes that have been executed with exec() in the PHP script itself (so the only process it shows is itself.)More information: http://linux.about.com/library/cmd/blcmdl1_pkill.htmYou can kill processes by name with killall <name>killall sends a signal to all\n  processes running any of the specified\n  commands. If no signal name is\n  specified, SIGTERM is sent.Signals can be specified either by\n  name (e.g. -HUP or -SIGHUP ) or by number (e.g.\n  -1) or by option -s.If the command name is not regular\n  expression (option -r) and contains a\n  slash (/), processes executing that\n  particular file will be selected for\n  killing, independent of their name.But if you don\'t see the process with ps aux, you probably won\'t have the right to kill it ...Also possible to use: pkill -f "Process name".For me it work perfect, it was what I was looking for.\nIn my case without flag pkill didn\xe2\x80\x99t work with name.When -f is set, the full command line is used for pattern matching. A bit longer alternative:On Mac I could not find the pgrep and pkill neither was killall working so wrote a simple one liner script:-If there\'s an easier way of doing this then please share.Using #killall command:The easiest way to do is first check you are getting right process IDs with:If the result is as expected. Go with:Strange, but I haven\'t seen the solution like this:it can also kill multiple processes (multiple pids) like:I prefer pidof since it has single line output:I normally use the killall command see here for details.more correct would be: To kill with grep:I was asking myself the same question but the problem with the current answers is that they don\'t safe check the processes to be killed so... it could lead to terrible mistakes :)... especially if several processes matches the pattern.As a disclaimer, I\'m not a sh pro and there is certainly room for improvement.So I wrote a little sh script :The default kill command accepts command names as an alternative to PID. See kill (1). An often occurring trouble is that bash provides its own kill which accepts job numbers, like kill %1, but not command names. This hinders the default command. If the former functionality is more useful to you than the latter, you can disable the bash version by callingenable -n killFor more info see kill and enable entries in bash (1).If you run GNOME, you can use the system monitor (System->Administration->System Monitor) to kill processes as you would under Windows. KDE will have something similar.kill -9 $(ps aux | grep -e myprocessname| awk \'{ print $2 }\')Kill all processes having snippet in startup path. You can kill all apps started from some directory by for putting /directory/ as a snippet. This is quite usefull when you start several components for the same application from the same app directory.
