How can I check the size of a collection with JSTL?Something like:From: http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/jstl/1.1/docs/tlddocs/fn/tld-summary.htmllength( java.lang.Object) - Returns the number of items in a collection, or the number of characters in a string.put this at the top of the page to allow the fn namespace:and use like this in your jsp page:So to test with length of a collection:Note the use of gt instead of > as > is not allowed inside jsp/jsf tags.As suggested by @Joel and @Mark Chorley in earlier comments:This checks for null and empty lists/collections/arrays. It doesn\'t get you the length but it satisfies the example in the OP. If you can get away with it this is just cleaner than importing a tag library and its crusty syntax like gt.You can use like this In order for your jstl statement to work, you would have to change it to:For this you have to add a method to the companies class called getSize which returns the size as int. and then just use the same jstl statement you have used before. Here is an example for the getSize method that you should add to your companies class:use ${fn:length(companies) > 0} to check the size. This returns a boolean
