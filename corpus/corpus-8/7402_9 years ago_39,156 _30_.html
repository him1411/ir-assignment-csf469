Does anyone know how to ask powershell where something is?\nFor instance "which notepad" and it returns the directory where the notepad.exe is run from according to the current paths.The very first alias I made once I started customizing my profile in powershell was \'which\'.To add this to your profile, type this:The `n is to ensure it will start as a new line.Here is an actual *nix equivalent, i.e. it gives *nix-style output.Just replace  with whatever you\'re looking for.When you add it to your profile, you will want to use a function rather than an alias because you can\'t use aliases with pipes:Now, when you reload your profile you can do this:I usually just type:orgcm is the default alias for Get-Command.On my system, gcm note* outputs:You get the directory and the command that matches what you\'re looking for.Try this example:This seems to do what you want (i found it on http://huddledmasses.org/powershell-find-path/ )Try the where command on Windows 2003 or later (or Windows 2000/XP if you\'ve installed a Resource Kit): http://ss64.com/nt/where.htmlBTW, this received more answers in other threads:Is there an equivalent of \'which\' on windows?Powershell equivalent to unix which command?Check this Powershell WhichThe code provided there suggests thisMy proposition for the Which function :function which($cmd) { get-command $cmd | % { $_.Path } }PS C:\\> which devconC:\\local\\code\\bin\\devcon.exeA closer match to Unix which, especially for scripting $(which command) isOr this version, calling the original where command.\nThis version also works better, because not limited to bat filesI like get-command | format-list, or:You can find aliases like this:Tab completion works with gcm.
