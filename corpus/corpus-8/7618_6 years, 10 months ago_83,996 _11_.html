Razor encodes string by default. Is there any special syntax for rendering without encoding?Since ASP.NET MVC 3, you can use:As well as the already mentioned @Html.Raw(string) approach, if you output an MvcHtmlString it will not be encoded. This can be useful when adding your own extensions to the HtmlHelper, or when returning a value from your view model that you know may contain html.For example, if your view model was:thenUse @Html.Raw() with caution as you may cause more trouble with encoding and security. I understand the use case as I had to do this myself, but carefully... Just avoid allowing all text through. For example only preserve/convert specific character sequences and always encode the rest:Then you have peace of mind that you haven\'t created a potential security hole and any special/foreign characters are displayed correctly in all browsers.In case of ActionLink, it generally uses HttpUtility.Encode on the link text.\nIn that case\nyou can use \nHttpUtility.HtmlDecode(myString) \nit worked for me when using HtmlActionLink to decode the string that I wanted to pass. eg: You can also use the WriteLiteral methodHTML RAW :\n@Html.Raw(yourString)
