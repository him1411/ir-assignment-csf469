Python has string.find() and string.rfind() to get the index of a substring in string.I wonder, maybe there is something like string.find_all() which can return all founded indexes (not only first from beginning or first from end)?For example:There is no simple built-in string function that does what you\'re looking for, but you could use the more powerful regular expressions:If you want to find overlapping matches, lookahead will do that:If you want a reverse find-all without overlaps, you can combine positive and negative lookahead into an expression like this:re.finditer returns a generator, so you could change the [] in the above to () to get a generator instead of a list which will be more efficient if you\'re only iterating through the results once.Thus, we can build it ourselves:No temporary strings or regexes required.Here\'s a (very inefficient) way to get all (i.e. even overlapping) matches:You can use re.finditer() for this. Come, let us recurse together.No need for regular expressions this way.Again, old thread, but here\'s my solution using a generator and plain str.find. returnsthis is an old thread but i got interested and wanted to share my solution.It should return a list of positions where the substring was found.\nPlease comment if you see an error or room for improvment.If you\'re just looking for a single character, this would work:Also,My hunch is that neither of these (especially #2) is terribly performant.This thread is a little old but this worked for me:please look at below code
