How does one change the font size for all elements (ticks, labels, title) on a matplotlib plot?I know how to change the tick label sizes, this is done with:But how does one change the rest?From the matplotlib documentation, This sets the font of all items to the font specified by the kwargs object, font.Alternatively, you could also use the rcParams update method as suggested in this answer:You can find a full list of available properties on the Customizing matplotlib page.If you want to change the fontsize for just a specific plot that has already been created, try this:Update: See the bottom of the answer for a slightly better way of doing it.\nUpdate #2: I\'ve figured out changing legend title fonts too.\nUpdate #3: There is a bug in Matplotlib 2.0.0 that\'s causing tick labels for logarithmic axes to revert to the default font. Should be fixed in 2.0.1 but I\'ve included the workaround in the 2nd part of the answer.This answer is for anyone trying to change all the fonts, including for the legend, and for anyone trying to use different fonts and sizes for each thing. It does not use rc (which doesn\'t seem to work for me). It is rather cumbersome but I could not get to grips with any other method personally. It basically combines ryggyr\'s answer here with other answers on SO.The benefit of this method is that, by having several font dictionaries, you can choose different fonts/sizes/weights/colours for the various titles, choose the font for the tick labels, and choose the font for the legend, all independently.UPDATE:I have worked out a slightly different, less cluttered approach that does away with font dictionaries, and allows any font on your system, even .otf fonts. To have separate fonts for each thing, just write more font_path and font_prop like variables.Hopefully this is a comprehensive answerIf you are a control freak like me, you may want to explicitly set all your font sizes:Note that you can also set the sizes calling the rc method on matplotlib:Here is a totally different approach that works surprisingly well to change the font sizes:Change the figure size!I usually use code like this:The smaller you make the figure size, the larger the font is relative to the plot. This also upscales the markers. Note I also set the dpi or dot per inch. I learned this from a posting the AMTA (American Modeling Teacher of America) forum.\nExample: Figure from above codeBased on the above stuff:I totally agree with Prof Huster that the simplest way to proceed is to change the size of the figure, which allows keeping the default fonts. I just had to complement this with a bbox_inches option when saving the figure as a pdf because the axis labels were cut.
