When trying to create package level Javadoc comments, whats the preferred method? What do you do?package-info.javapackage.htmlFor me, I\'ve always used Package.html. But I\'m wondering if its the correct choice. package-info.java: "This file is new in JDK 5.0, and is preferred over package.html."\xe2\x80\x94javadoc - The Java API Documentation GeneratorAddendum: The big difference seems to be package annotations. There\'s a little more in the way of rationale in 7.4 Package Declarations.Addendum: The annotation feature is also mentioned here and here.Addendum: See also Declarative Programming in Java: Package-Level Annotations.
