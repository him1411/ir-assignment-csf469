We have a project in Team Foundation Server (TFS) that has a non-English character (\xc5\xa1) in it. When trying to script a few build-related things we\'ve stumbled upon a problem - we can\'t pass the \xc5\xa1 letter to the command-line tools. The command prompt or what not else messes it up, and the tf.exe utility can\'t find the specified project.I\'ve tried different formats for the .bat file (ANSI, UTF-8 with and without BOM) as well as scripting it in JavaScript (which is Unicode inherently) - but no luck. How do I execute a program and pass it a Unicode command line?Try:which will change the code page to UTF-8. Also, you need to use Lucida console fonts.I had same problem (I\'m from the Czech Republic). I have an English installation of Windows, and I have to work with files on a shared drive. Paths to the files include Czech-specific characters.The solution that works for me is:In the batch file, change the charset pageMy batch file:The batch file has to be saved in CP 1250.Note that the console will not show characters correctly, but it will understand them...Check the language for non-Unicode programs. If you have problems with Russian in the Windows console, then you should set Russian here:Actually, the trick is that the command prompt actually understands these non-english characters, just can\'t display them correctly.When I enter a path in the command prompt that contains some non-english chracters it is displayed as "?? ?????? ?????". When you submit your command (cd "??? ?????? ?????" in my case), everything is working as expected.On a WindowsÂ 10 x64 machine, I made the command prompt display non-English characters by:Open an elevated command prompt (run CMD.EXE as administrator). Query your registry for available TrueType fonts to the console by:You\'ll see an output like:Now we need to add a TrueType font that supports the characters you need like Courier New. We do this by adding zeros to the string name, so in this case the next one would be "000":Now we implement UTF-8 support:Set default font to "Courier New":Set font size to 20:Enable quick edit if you like:It\'s is quite difficult to change the default Codepage of Windows console. When you search the web you find different proposals, however some of them may break your Windows entirely, i.e. your PC does not boot anymore.The most secure solution is this one:\nGo to your Registry key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Command Processor and add String value Autorun = chcp 65001.Or you can use this small Batch-Script for the most common code pages.Using @chcp 65001>nul instead of chcp 65001 suppresses the output "Active code page: 65001" you would get every time you start a new command line windows.A full list of all available number you can get from Code Page IdentifiersNote, the settings will apply only for the current user. If you like to set it for all users, replace line SET ROOT_KEY="HKEY_CURRENT_USER" by SET ROOT_KEY="HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE"As I haven\'t seen any full answers for Python 2.7, I\'ll outline the two important steps and an optional step that is quite useful.For a more permanent solution, refer to this answer on Super User. In short, create a REG_SZ (String) entry using regedit at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Command Processor and name it AutoRun. Change the value of it to chcp 65001. If you don\'t want to see the output message from the command, use @chcp 65001>nul instead.Some programs have trouble interacting with this encoding, MinGW being a notable one that fails while compiling with a nonsensical error message. Nonetheless, this works very well and doesn\'t cause bugs with the majority of programs.For a similar problem, (my problem was to show UTF-8 characters from MySQL on a command prompt),I solved it like this:I changed the font of command prompt to Lucida Console. (This step must be irrelevant for your situation. It has to do only with what you see on the screen and not with what is really the character).I changed the codepage to Windows-1253. You do this on the command prompt by "chcp 1253". It worked for my case where I wanted to see UTF-8.A quick decision for .bat files if you computer displays your path/file name correct when you typing it in DOS-window:This way you create a .txt file - temp.txt. Open it in Notepad, copy the text (don\'t worry it will look unreadable) and paste it in your .bat file.\nExecuting the .bat created this way in DOS-window worked for m\xd0\xb5 (Cyrillic, Bulgarian).A better cleaner thing to do: Just install the available, free, Microsoft Japanese language pack. (Other oriental language packs will also work, but I have tested the Japanese one.)This gives you the fonts with the larger sets of glyphs, makes them the default behavior, changes the various Windows tools like cmd, WordPad, etc.Changing code page to 1252 is working for me. The problem for me is the symbol double doller \xc2\xa7 is converting to another symbol by DOS on Windows Server 2008.I have used CHCP 1252 and a cap before it in my BCP statement ^\xc2\xa7.I got around a similar issue deleting Unicode-named files by referring to them in the batch file by their short (8 dot 3) names.  The short names can be viewed by doing dir /x. Obviously, this only works with Unicode file names that are already known.One really simple option is to install a Windows bash shell such as MinGW and use that:There is a little bit of a learning curve as you will need to use Unix command line functionality, but you will love the power of it and you can set the console character set to UTF-8. Of course you also get all the usual *nix goodies like grep, find, less, etc.This problem is quite annoying. I usually have Chinese character in my filename and file content. Please note that I am using Windows 10, here is my solution:To display the file name, such as dir or ls if you installed Ubuntu bash on Windows 10Set the region to support non-utf 8 character.After that, console\'s font will be changed to the font of that locale, and it also changes the encoding of the console. After you have done previous steps, in order to display the file content of a UTF-8 file using command line toolBrazilian Portuguese code is 1252:To utf-8: chcp 65001Back to default: chcp 437
