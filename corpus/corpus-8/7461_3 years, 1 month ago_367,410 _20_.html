I am loading an <iframe> in my HTML page and trying to access the elements within it using Javascript, but when I try to execute my code, I get the following error:Can you please help me to find a solution so that I can access the elements in the frame?I am using this code for testing, but in vain:You can\'t access an <iframe> with Javascript, it would be a huge security flaw if you could do it. For the same-origin policy browsers block scripts trying to access a frame with a different origin.  Origin is considered different if at least one of the following parts of the address isn\'t maintained: Protocol, hostname and port must be the same of your domain, if you want to access a frame. Here\'s what would happen trying to access the following URLs from http://www.example.com/home/index.html Even though same-origin policy blocks scripts from accessing the content of sites with a different origin, if you own both the pages, you can work around this problem using window.postMessage and its relative message event to send messages between the two pages, like this: In your main page: In your <iframe> (contained in the main page): This method can be applied in both directions, creating a listener in the main page too, and receiving responses from the frame. The same logic can also be implemented in pop-ups and basically any new window generated by the main page (e.g. using window.open()) as well, without any difference.There already are some good answers about this topic (I just found them googling), so, for the browsers where this is possible, I\'ll link the relative answer. However, please remember that disabling the same-origin policy (or the CORS) will only affect your browser. Also, running a browser with same-origin security settings disabled grants any website access to cross-origin resources, so it\'s very unsafe and should be done for development purposes only.Complementing Marco Bonelli\'s answer: the best current way of interacting between frames/iframes is using window.postMessage, supported by all browsersCheck the domain\'s web server for http://www.<domain>.com configuration for X-Frame-Options\nIt is a security feature designed to prevent clickJacking attacks, Technically the evil has an iframe with source to the victim page.If you want to prevent web server request to be rendered within an iframe add the x-frame-optionsX-Frame-Options DENYthe options are:This is IIS config example:If the web server activated the security feature it my cause a client side SecurityError as it should.
