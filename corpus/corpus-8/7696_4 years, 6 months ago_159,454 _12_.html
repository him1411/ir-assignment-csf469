I am trying to inject a service to Directive like below  But this is returning me error Unknown provider: myDataProvider. Someone please look into the code and tell me if I am doing wrong somewhere..You can do injection on Directives, and it looks just like it does everywhere else.Change your directive definition from app.module to app.directive. Apart from that everything looks fine. \n\nBtw, very rarely do you have to inject a service into a directive. If you are injecting a service ( which usually is a data source or model ) into your directive ( which is kind of part of a view ), you are creating a direct coupling between your view and model. You need to separate them out by wiring them together using a controller. \nIt does work fine. I am not sure what you are doing which is wrong. Here is a plunk of it working.http://plnkr.co/edit/M8omDEjvPvBtrBHM84AmYou can also use the $inject service to get whatever service you like. I find that useful if I don\'t know the service name ahead of time but know the service interface. For example a directive that will  plug a table into an ngResource end point or a generic delete-record button which interacts with any api end point. You don\'t want to re-implement the table directive for every controller or data-source.template.htmlmy-directive.directive.coffeenow your \'anonymous\' service is fully available. If it is ngResource for example you can then use the standard ngResource interface to get your dataFor example:I have found this technique to be very useful when making elements that interact with API endpoints especially.
