I\'m a Git newbie.  I recently moved a Rails project from Subversion to Git.  I followed the tutorial here: http://www.simplisticcomplexity.com/2008/03/05/cleanly-migrate-your-subversion-repository-to-a-git-repository/I am also using unfuddle.com to store my code.  I make changes on my Mac laptop on the train to/from work and then push them to unfuddle when I have a network connection using the following command:I use Capistrano for deployments and pull code from the unfuddle repository using the master branch.Lately I\'ve noticed the following message when I run "git status" on my laptop:And I\'m confused as to why.  I thought my laptop was the origin... but don\'t know if either the fact that I originally pulled from Subversion or push to Unfuddle is what\'s causing the message to show up.  How can I:My mac is running Git version 1.6.0.1.When I run git remote show origin as suggested by dbr, I get the following:When I run git remote -v as suggested by Aristotle Pagaltzis, I get the following:Now, interestingly, I\'m working on my project in the geekfor directory but it says my origin is my local machine in the gf directory.  I believe gf was the temporary directory I used when converting my project from Subversion to Git and probably where I pushed to unfuddle from.  Then I believe I checked out a fresh copy from unfuddle to the geekfor directory.So it looks like I should follow dbr\'s advice and do:1. Find out where Git thinks \'origin/master\' is using git-remote..which will return something like..A remote is basically a link to a remote repository. When you do....git will push changes to that address you added. It\'s like a bookmark, for remote repositories.When you run git status, it checks if the remote is missing commits (compared to your local repository), and if so, by how many commits. If you push all your changes to "origin", both will be in sync, so you wont get that message.2. If it\'s somewhere else, how do I turn my laptop into the \'origin/master\'?There is no point in doing this. Say "origin" is renamed to "laptop" - you never want to do git push laptop from your laptop.If you want to remove the origin remote, you do..This wont delete anything (in terms of file-content/revisions-history). This will stop the "your branch is ahead by.." message, as it will no longer compare your repository with the remote (because it\'s gone!)One thing to remember is that there is nothing special about origin, it\'s just a default name git uses.Git does use origin by default when you do things like git push or git pull. So, if you have a remote you use a lot (Unfuddle, in your case), I would recommend adding unfuddle as "origin":or do the above in one command using set-url:Then you can simply do git push or git pull to update, instead of git push unfuddle masterI came to this question looking for an explanation about what the message "your branch is ahead by..." means, in the general scheme of git. There was no answer to that here, but since this question currently shows up at the top of Google when you search for the phrase "Your branch is ahead of \'origin/master\'", and I have since figured out what the message really means, I thought I\'d post the info here.So, being a git newbie, I can see that the answer I needed was a distinctly newbie answer. Specifically, what the "your branch is ahead by..." phrase means is that there are files you\'ve added and committed to your local repository, but have never pushed to the origin. The intent of this message is further obfuscated by the fact that "git diff", at least for me, showed no differences. It wasn\'t until I ran "git diff origin/master" that I was told that there were differences between my local repository, and the remote master.So, to be clear:"your branch is ahead by..." => You need to push to the remote master. Run "git diff origin/master" to see what the differences are between your local repository and the remote master repository.Hope this helps other newbies.(Also, I recognize that there are configuration subtleties that may partially invalidate this solution, such as the fact that the master may not actually be "remote", and that "origin" is a reconfigurable name used by convention, etc. But newbies do not care about that sort of thing. We want simple, straightforward answers. We can read about the subtleties later, once we\'ve solved the pressing problem.)EarlI had a problem that was similar to this where my working directory was ahead of origin by X commits but the git pull was resulting in Everything up-to-date. I did manage to fix it by following this advice. I\'m posting this here in case it helps someone else with a similar problem.The basic fix is as follows:Where the words in brackets should be replaced by your remote name, your local branch name and your remote branch name. e.g.sometimes there\'s a difference between the local cached version of origin master (origin/master) and the true origin master.If you run git remote update this will resynch origin master with origin/mastersee the accepted answer to this questionDifferences between git pull origin master & git pull origin/masterI thought my laptop was the origin\xe2\x80\xa6That\xe2\x80\x99s kind of nonsensical: origin refers to the default remote repository \xe2\x80\x93 the one you usually fetch/pull other people\xe2\x80\x99s changes from.How can I:git remote -v will show you what origin is; origin/master is your \xe2\x80\x9cbookmark\xe2\x80\x9d for the last known state of the master branch of the origin repository, and your own master is a tracking branch for origin/master. This is all as it should be.You don\xe2\x80\x99t. At least it makes no sense for a repository to be the default remote repository for itself.It isn\xe2\x80\x99t. It\xe2\x80\x99s merely telling you that you have made so-and-so many commits locally which aren\xe2\x80\x99t in the remote repository (according to the last known state of that repository).[ Solution ]^ this solved it for me. \nWhat it did, it synchronized my master (on laptop) with "origin" that\'s on the remote server.I am struggling with this problem and none of the previous answers tackle the question as I see it. I have stripped the problem back down to its basics to see if I can make my problem clear.I create a new repository (rep1), put one file in it and commit it.I create a clone of rep1 and call it rep2. I look inside rep2 and see the file is correct.In rep1 I make a single change to the file and commit it. Then in rep1 I create a remote to point to rep2 and push the changes.Now when I go into rep2 and do a \'git status\' I get told I am ahead of origin.README in rep2 is as it was originally, before the second commit. The only modifications I have done are to rep1 and all I wanted to do was push them out to rep2. What is it I am not grasping?It\'s waiting for you to "push". Try:$ git pushI had this problem recently and I figured it was because I had deleted some files that I did not need anymore. The problem is that git does not know that the files have been deleted and it sees that the server still has it. (server = origin)So I ran And then ran a commit and push. That solved the issue.I am a git newbie as well. I had the same problem with \'your branch is ahead of origin/master by N commits\' messages. Doing the suggested \'git diff origin/master\' did show some diffs that I did not care to keep. So ...Since my git clone was for hosting, and I wanted an exact copy of the master repo, and did not care to keep any local changes, I decided to save off my entire repo, and create a new one:(on the hosting machine)For expediency, I used to make changes to the clone on my hosting machine. No more. I will make those changes to the master, git commit there, and do a git pull. Hopefully, this should keep my git clone on the hosting machine in complete sync./NaraI was wondering the same thing about my repo.  In my case I had an old remote that I wasn\'t pushing to anymore so I needed to remove it.Get list of remotes:Remove the one that you don\'t needIt is possible to reset to a specific commit before your own commits take place.Use git log to find what commit was the commit you had before the local changes took place.Take note of the local commits and reset directly to the previous commit:I had the problem "Your branch is ahead of \'origin/master\' by nn commits." when i pushed to a remote repository with:When i found that my remote adress was in the file .git/FETCH_HEAD and used:the problem disappeared.
