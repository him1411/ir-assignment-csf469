What I am trying to do is click a button (that was created in code) and have it call up a different view controller then have it run a function in the new view controller.I know it could be done relatively easily in IB but that isn\'t an option.An example of what I want to do would be if you had two view controllers one with a splash screen of house. The other view controller had a walk through of the house on it that you could go through all the rooms in a set order. The splash screen would have buttons for each room that would allow you to jump to any point on the walk through.You can access the delegate like this:Replace MainClass with the name of your application class.Then, provided you have a property for the other view controller, you can call something like:Sounds like you just need a UINavigationController setup?You can get the AppDelegate anywhere in the program viaIn your app delegate you should have your navigation controller setup, either via IB or in code.  In code, assuming you\'ve created your \'House overview\' viewcontroller already it would be something like this in your AppDelegate didFinishLaunchingWithOptions...After this you just need a viewcontroller per \'room\' and invoke the following when a button click event is picked up...I\'ve not tested the above code so forgive any syntax errors but hope the pseudo code is of help...And if anyone is wondering how to do this in swift:This is how I do it.Dont forget to import.It avoid having to include your AppDelegate.h everywhere. \nIt\'s a simple cast that goes a long way, allowing to develop independent Controller and reuse them elsewhere without to worry about class name and so on...EnjoyJust Follow these steps1.import your app delegate in your class where you want app delegate object.2.inside your class create an instance of your app delegate object(Its basically a singleton).3.Now invoke method using selectoror directly byfor swifti will recommend the first one. Run and Go.A lot of good answers are already added. Though I want to add something which suits me most of the time.and thats it. Use it throughout the application just like a constant.e.g.Don\'t forget to import yourAppDelegate.h in corresponding .pch or macros file.If someone need the same in Xamarin (Xamarin.ios / Monotouch), this worked for me:(Require using UIKit;)And in case you need access to your WatchKit extension delegate from a view controller on watchOS:You can add #define uAppDelegate (AppDelegate *)[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate] in your project\'s Prefix.pch file and then call any method of your AppDelegate in any UIViewController with the below code.
