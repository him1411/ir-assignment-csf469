I\'m a bit out of my depth here and I\'m hoping this is actually possible.I\'d like to be able to call a function that would sort all the items in my list alphabetically.I\'ve been looking through the jQuery UI for sorting but that doesn\'t seem to be it. Any thoughts?You do not need jQuery to do this...Easy to use...Live Demo â†’Something like this:From this page: http://www.onemoretake.com/2009/02/25/sorting-elements-with-jquery/Above code will sort your unordered list with id \'myUL\'. OR you can use a plugin like TinySort. https://github.com/Sjeiti/TinySortlive demo : http://jsbin.com/eculis/876/editTo make this work work with all browsers including Chrome you need to make the callback function of sort() return -1,0 or 1. see http://inderpreetsingh.com/2010/12/01/chromes-javascript-sort-array-function-is-different-yet-proper/If you are using jQuery you can do this:Note that returning 1 and -1 (or 0 and 1) from the compare function is absolutely wrong.@SolutionYogi\'s answer works like a charm, but it seems that using $.each is less straightforward and efficient than directly appending listitems :FiddleI have used TinySort for a while and it is light and fast. It use to be a jQuery plug-in but now it is pure JS.http://tinysort.sjeiti.com/I was looking to do this myself, and I wasnt satisfied with any of the answers provided simply because, I believe, they are quadratic time, and I need to do this on lists hundreds of items long.I ended up extending jquery, and my solution uses jquery, but could easily be modified to use straight javascript.I only access each item twice, and perform one linearithmic sort, so this should, I think, work out to be a lot faster on large datasets, though I freely confess I could be mistaken there:Put the list in an array, use JavaScript\'s .sort(), which is by default alphabetical, then convert the array back to a list.http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_sort.aspHTMLJavaScriptJSFiddle Demo https://jsfiddle.net/97oo61nw/Here we are push all values of li elements inside ul with specific id (which we provided as function argument) to array arr and sort it using sort() method which is sorted alphabetical by default. After array arr is sorted we are loop this array using forEach() method and just replace text content of all li elements with sorted content
