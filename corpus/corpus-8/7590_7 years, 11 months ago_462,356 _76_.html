I am using a web view in which I am adding an image view. How can I set the background of this image view to transparent?I have tried this:Where trans \xe2\x86\x92 <color name="trans">#00000000 </color>.In your XML set the Background attribute to any colour, White(#FFFFFF) shade or Black(#000000) shade. If you want transparency, just put 80 before the actual hash code:This will change any colour you want to a transparent one.. :)You can set the background transparent of any layout, any view, or any component by adding this code in XML:In addition to what Harshad mentioned:Two hexadecimal characters can be appended to any hexadecimal color code. The first two characters in an 8-digit hex color code represents its opacity in Android.The two hexadecimal characters can range from 00 to FF. For example,This way you can change any color to any level of transparency.To find the hexadecimal prefix from a percentage:Divide the percentage number by 100 and multiply by 255 to get the decimal value. Convert the decimal to hexadecimal here.For example, for 50%, 50/100 * 255 = 127. Using the link we get hexadecimal value 7F.Source: Android: how to create a transparent or opaque backgroundIf you want to add 20% or 30% transparency, you should pre-pend two more characters to the hexadecimal code, like CC.android:background="#CCFF0088" in XMLwhere CC is the alpha value, FF is the red factor, 00 is the green factor, and 88 is the blue factor.You can also set opacity programmatically like:Set opacity between 0 (fully transparent) to 255 (completely opaque). The 127.5 is exactly 50%.You can create any level of transparency using the given formula. If you want half transparent:And for 25% transparency:There is already a predefined constant. Use Color.TRANSPARENT.There is already a transparent built into Android: R.color.transparent. http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.color.html#transparentBut I think you may want to make the background of the image that you are placing into the WebView transparent, for example, with a transparent PNG, rather than the ImageView background. If the actual image is not at all see-through then the ImageView background can\'t be seen through it.Use the below code for black:Now if you want to use opacity then you can use the below code:And the below for opacity code:100% \xe2\x80\x94 FF95% \xe2\x80\x94 F290% \xe2\x80\x94 E685% \xe2\x80\x94 D980% \xe2\x80\x94 CC75% \xe2\x80\x94 BF70% \xe2\x80\x94 B365% \xe2\x80\x94 A660% \xe2\x80\x94 9955% \xe2\x80\x94 8C50% \xe2\x80\x94 8045% \xe2\x80\x94 7340% \xe2\x80\x94 6635% \xe2\x80\x94 5930% \xe2\x80\x94 4D25% \xe2\x80\x94 4020% \xe2\x80\x94 3315% \xe2\x80\x94 2610% \xe2\x80\x94 1A5% \xe2\x80\x94 0D0% \xe2\x80\x94 00In case you want it in code, just:Or, as an alternate, parse the resource ID with the following code:For those who are still facing this problem, you may try this\nelement.getBackground().setAlpha(0);Use the following for complete transparency:When I tried with #80000000 I got a black transparent overlay which I don\'t want. Try to change the first two digits; it controls the level of transparency, likeOne more simple way:Another working option I came across is to set android:background="@null"You could also use View.setAlpha(float) to change the visibility precisely.0 would be transparent, 1 fully visible. ;)Try to use the following code. It will help you in full or more.A .xml file designed to use this code to set background color:orOr you can set it programmatically as well.Also you can use this code programmatically:Also this code for setting the background color as well programmatically:This code for the same programmatically:The color depends on your choice of which color you want to use for transparent. Mostly use a white or #FFFFFF color.Regarding R.drawable.llabackground: This line of code is for your style of the background, like something special or different for your purpose. You can also use this.In Android Studio it is very simple to adjust color and opacity using a built-in tool:In your XML file, set an attribute "Alpha"such as where 1.0 is opaque and 0.0 is fully transparent. Try this:For transparency 000000 = black, you can change these six numbers for the color you want.If you use a drawable XML image you can make it transparent as shown in the picture below, or you can use a color code:
