I am building a custom events system, and if you have a repeating event that looks like this:Event A repeats every 4 days starting on March 3, 2011or Event B repeats every 2 weeks on Tuesday starting on March 1, 2011How can I store that in a Database in a way that would make it simple to lookup. I don\'t want performance issues if there are a large number of events, and I have to go through each and every one when rendering the calendar.For my PHP/MySQL based calendar, I wanted to store repeating/recurring event information as efficiently as possibly. I didn\'t want to have a large number of rows, and I wanted to easily lookup all events that would take place on a specific date.The method below is great at storing repeating information that occurs at regular intervals, such as every day, every n days, every week, every month every year, etc etc. This includes every Tuesday and Thursday type patterns as well, because they are stored separately as every week starting on a Tuesday and every week starting on a Thursday.Assuming I have two tables, one called events like this:And a table called events_meta like this:With repeat_start being a date with no time as a unix timestamp, and repeat_interval an amount in seconds between intervals (432000 is 5 days). repeat_interval_1 goes with repeat_start of the ID 1. So if I have an event that repeats every Tuesday and every Thursday, the repeat_interval would be 604800 (7 days), and there would be 2 repeat_starts and 2 repeat_intervals. The table would look like this:Then, if you have a calendar that loops through every day, grabbing the events for the day it\'s at, the query would look like this:Replacing {current_timestamp} with the unix timestamp for the current date (Minus the time, so the hour, minute and second values would be set to 0).Hopefully this will help somebody else too!This method is better suited for storing complex patterns such as Event A repeats every month on the 3rd of the month starting on March 3, 2011 or Event A repeats Friday of the 2nd week of the month starting on March 11, 2011I\'d recommend combining this with the above system for the most flexibility. The tables for this should like like:And a table called events_meta like this:repeat_week_im represents the week of the current month, which could be between 1 and 5 potentially. repeat_weekday in the day of the week, 1-7.Now assuming you are looping through the days/weeks to create a month view in your calendar, you could compose a query like this:This combined with the above method could be combined to cover most repeating/recurring event patterns. If I\'ve missed anything please leave a comment.While the currently accepted answer was a huge help to me, I wanted to share some useful modifications that simplify the queries and also increase performance.To handle events which recur at regular intervals, such as:or You should create two tables, one called events like this:And a table called events_meta like this:With repeat_start being a unix timestamp date with no time (1369008000 corresponds to May 20th 2013) , and repeat_interval an amount in seconds between intervals (604800 is 7 days).   By looping over each day in the calendar you can get repeat events using this simple query:Just substitute in the unix-timestamp (1299736800) for each date in your calendar.Note the use of the modulo (% sign). This symbol is like regular division, but returns the \'\'remainder\'\' instead of the quotient, and as such is 0 whenever the current date is an exact multiple of the repeat_interval from the repeat_start.This is significantly faster than the previously suggested "meta_keys"-based answer, which was as follows:If you run EXPLAIN this query, you\'ll note that it required the use of a join buffer:The solution with 1 join above requires no such buffer.You can add support for more complex types to support these types of repeat rules:orYour events table can look exactly the same:Then to add support for these complex rules add columns to events_meta like so:Note that you simply need to either specify a repeat_interval or a set of repeat_year, repeat_month, repeat_day, repeat_week, and repeat_weekday data.This makes selection of both types simultaneously very simple. Just loop through each day and fill in the correct values, (1370563200 for June 7th 2013, and then the year, month, day, week number and weekday as follows):This returns all events that repeat on the Friday of the 2nd week, as well as any events that repeat every Friday, so it returns both event ID 1 and 2:*Sidenote in the above SQL I used PHP Date\'s default weekday indexes, so "5" for Friday Hope this helps others as much as the original answer helped me!For all of you who are interested in this, now you can just copy and paste to get started within minutes. I took the advice in the comments as well as I could. Let me know if I\'m missing something."COMPLEX VERSION":eventsevents_metaSQL code:also available as MySQL export (for easy access)PHP example code index.php:PHP example code connect.php:Also the php code is available here (for better readability):\nindex.php\nand\nconnect.php\nNow setting this up should take you minutes. Not hours. :)As a small enhancement to the accepted answer that was subsequently refined by ahoffner - it is possible to use a date format rather than timestamp.  The advantages are:to do this, change the DB repeat_start to be stored as type \'date\' and repeat_interval now hold days rather than seconds.  i.e. 7 for a repeat of 7 days. change the sql line:\nWHERE  (( 1370563200 - repeat_start) % repeat_interval = 0 )to:\nWHERE ( DATEDIFF( \'2013-6-7\', event_start ) % repeat_interval = 0 ) everything else remains the same. Simples!Why not use a mechanism similar to Apache cron jobs? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CronFor calendar\\scheduling I\'d use slightly different values for "bits" to accommodate standard calendar reoccurence events - instead of \n[day of week (0 - 7), month (1 - 12), day of month (1 - 31), hour (0 - 23), min (0 - 59)]-- I\'d use something like \n[Year (repeat every N years), month (1 - 12), day of month (1 - 31), week of month (1-5), day of week (0 - 7)]Hope this helps.While the proposed solutions work, I was trying to implement with Full Calendar and it would require over 90 database calls for each view (as it loads current, previous, and next month), which, I wasn\'t too thrilled about.I found an recursion library https://github.com/tplaner/When where you simply store the rules in the database and one query to pull all the relevant rules.Hopefully this will help someone else, as I spent so many hours trying to find a good solution.Edit: This Library is for PHPI would follow this guide:\nhttps://github.com/bmoeskau/Extensible/blob/master/recurrence-overview.mdAlso make sure you use the iCal format so not to reinvent the wheel and \nremember\nRule #0:\nDo NOT store individual recurring event instances as rows in your database!@Rogue CoderThis is great!You could simply use the modulo operation (MOD or % in mysql) to make your code simple at the end:Instead of:Do:To take this further, one could include events that do not recur for ever. Something like "repeat_interval_1_end" to denote the date of the last "repeat_interval_1" could be added. This however, makes the query more complicated and I can\'t really figure out how to do this ...Maybe someone could help!Sounds very much like MySQL events that are stored in system tables. You can look at the structure and figure out which columns are not needed:I developed an esoteric programming language just for this case. The best part about it is that it is schema less and platform independent. You just have to write a selector program, for your schedule, syntax of which is constrained by the set of rules described here - https://github.com/tusharmath/sheql/wiki/RulesThe rules are extendible and you can add any sort of customization based on the kind of repetition logic you want to perform, without worrying about schema migrations etc.This is a completely different approach and might have some disadvantages of its own.The two examples you\'ve given are very simple; they can be represented as a simple interval (the first being four days, the second being 14 days). How you model this will depend entirely on the complexity of your recurrences. If what you have above is truly that simple, then store a start date and the number of days in the repeat interval.If, however, you need to support things likeEvent A repeats every month on the 3rd of the month starting on March 3, 2011Or Event A repeats second Friday of the month starting on March 11, 2011Then that\'s a much more complex pattern.
