Before the AppCompat update came out today I was able to change the color of buttons in Android L but not on older versions. After including the new AppCompat update I am unable to change the color for either version, when I do try the button just disappears. Does anyone know how to change the button color?The following pictures shows what I want to achieve:The white button is default, the red one is what I want.This is what I was doing previously to change the color of the buttons in the styles.xml:and to do it dynamically:Also I did change the theme parent from @android:style/Theme.Material.Light.DarkActionBar to Theme.AppCompat.Light.DarkActionBarOfficially fixed in Support Library rev.22 (Fri March 13, 2015). See relevant google code issue:https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37008632Usage exampletheme.xml:v21/theme.xmlAppcompat library started to support material buttons after I posted the original response. In this post you can see the easiest implementation of raised and flat buttons.Since that AppCompat doesn\'t support the button yet you can use xml as backgrounds. For doing that I had a look at the source code of the Android and found the related files for styling material buttons.Have a look at the btn_default_material.xml on android source code.You can copy the file into your projects drawable-v21 folder. But don\'t touch the color attr here. The file you need to change is the second file.drawable-v21/custom_btn.xmlAs you realise there is a shape used inside this drawable which you can find in this file of the source code.And in this file you there are some dimensions used from the file that you can find here. You can copy the whole file and put into your values folder. This is important for applying the same size (that is used in material buttons) to all buttons For older versions you should have another drawable with the same name. I am directly putting the items inline instead of referencing. You may want to reference them. But again, the most important thing is the original dimensions of the material button.drawable/custom_btn.xmlYour button will have ripple effect on Lollipop devices. The old versions will have exactly same button except the ripple effect. But since that you provide drawables for different states, they\'ll also respond to touch events (as the old way).This has been enhanced in v23.0.0 of AppCompat library\nwith the addition of more themes includingWidget.AppCompat.Button.ColoredFirst of all include appCompat dependency if you haven\'t alreadynow since you need to use v23 of the app compat, you\'ll need to target SDK-v23 as well!In your values/themeIn your values/styleIn your values-v21/styleSince your button theme is based on Widget.AppCompat.Button.Colored The text color on the button is by default white!but it seems there is an issue when you disable the button, the button will change its color to light grey, but the text color will remain white!a workaround for this is to specifically set the text color on the button to white!\nas I have done in the style shown above.now you can simply define your button and let AppCompat do the rest :)Disabled State\nEnabled State\nIn Android Support Library 22.1.0, Google made the Button tint aware.\nSo, another way to customise the background color of button is to use the backgroundTint attribute.For example,To support colored buttons use the latest AppCompat library (>23.2.1) with:inflate - XMLAppCompat Widget:AppCompat Style:NB! To set a custom color in xml: use the attr: app instead of android (use alt+enter or declare xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto" to use app)app:backgroundTint="@color/your_custom_color"Example:or set it programmatically - JAVAWith latest Support Library you could just inherit you activity from AppCompatActivity, so it will inflate your Button as AppCompatButton and give you an opportunity to style color of every single button on the layout with using of android:theme="@style/SomeButtonStyle", where SomeButtonStyle is:Worked for me in 2.3.7, 4.4.1, 5.0.2if you want below styleadd this style your button if you want this style add below code The answer is in THEME not styleThe problem is that the Button color is stick to the colorButtonNormal of the theme. I have tried to change the Style in many different ways with no luck. So I changed the button theme.Create a theme with colorButtonNormal and colorPrimary:Use this theme in buttonThe "AppTheme.Button" can be any thing extends Button style like here I use primary color for text color:And you get the button in any color you want that compatible to material design.I\'ve just created an android library, that allows you to easily modify the button color and the ripple colorhttps://github.com/xgc1986/RippleButtonYou don\'t need to create an style for every button you want wit a different color, allowing you to customize the colors randomlythis work for me with appcompat-v7:22.2.0 in android + 4.0 in your styles.xml in your layout file Layout:styles.xml:color/button_background_selector.xml:color/button_text_selector.xml:For those using an ImageButton here is how you do it:In style.xml:in v21/style.xml:Then in your layout file:If you use style solution with colorButtonNormal, don\'t forget to inherit from Widget.AppCompat.Button.Colored so the ripple effect is working ;)LikeIf you only want "Flat" material button, you can customize their background using selectableItemBackground attribute as explained here.For me, the problem was that in Android 5.0 the android:colorButtonNormal had no effect, and actually, no item from the theme (like android:colorAccent), but in Android 4.4.3, for example, did. The project was configured with compileSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion to 22, so I\'ve made all the changes as @Muhammad Alfaifi sugessted, but in the end, I\'ve noticed that the problem was the buildToolsVersion, that wasn\'t updated. Once I changed to 23.0.1, everything start working almost as normal. Now, the android:colorButtonNormal still has no effect, but at least the button reacts to android:colorAccent, which for me is acceptable.I hope that this hint could help someone.\nNote: I\'ve applied the style directly to the button, since the button\'s android:theme=[...] also didn\'t have effect.One way to pull this off allows you to just point to a style and NOT theme ALL the buttons in your app the same.\nIn themes.xml add a themeNow in styles.xml addNow in your layout simply point to the STYLE in your Button Use design support library(23.2.0) and appcompatwidgets  as belowIn Android Support Library 22.1 :This is done automatically when inflating layouts - replacing Button\n  with AppCompatButton, TextView with AppCompatTextView, etc. to ensure\n  that each could support tinting. In this release, those tint aware\n  widgets are now publicly available, allowing you to keep tinting\n  support even if you need to subclass one of the supported widgets.The full list of tint aware widgets:Material Design for Pre-Lollipop Devices :AppCompat (aka ActionBarCompat) started out as a backport of the\n  Android 4.0 ActionBar API for devices running on Gingerbread,\n  providing a common API layer on top of the backported implementation\n  and the framework implementation. AppCompat v21 delivers an API and\n  feature-set that is up-to-date with Android 5.0I actually didn\'t want a change to my custom button styles but unfortunately they weren\'t working anymore.My App has a minSdkVersion of 9 and everything worked before.I don\'t know why but since I removed the android: before the buttonStyle it seems to work againnow = working:<item name="buttonStyle">@style/ButtonmyTime</item>before = just gray material buttons:<item name="android:buttonStyle">@style/ButtonmyTime</item>I have no spezial folder for newver android version since my buttons are quite flat and they should look the same across all android versions.Maybe someone can tell me why I had to remove the "android:"\nThe ImageButton is still working with "android:"After 2 days looking for answers, the button theming didn\'t work for me in API < 21.My only solution is to override AppCompatButton  tinting not only with the base app theme "colorButtonNormal" but also the view backgroundTint like this :You can then define your Button color like this :To change the color of a single buttonThis SO answer helped me arrive at an answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/30277424/3075340I use this utility method to set the background tint of a button. It works with pre-lollipop devices:How to use in code:This way, you do not have to specify a ColorStateList if you just want to change the background tint and nothing more but maintain the pretty button effects and what not.If you want to use AppCompat style like Widget.AppCompat.Button , Base.Widget.AppCompat.Button.Colored, etc., you need to use these styles with compatible views from support library.Code below does not work for pre-lolipop devices:You need to use AppCompatButton to enabled AppCompat styles:
