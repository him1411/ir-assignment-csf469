I want to delete the first character of a string, if the first character is a 0.  The 0 can be there more than once.Is there a simple function that checks the first character and deletes it if it is 0?Right now, I\'m trying it with the JS slice() function but it is very awkward.This will kill any 0\'s at the start of the string.Use .charAt() and .slice().Example: http://jsfiddle.net/kCpNQ/If there could be several 0 characters at the beginning, you can change the if() to a while().Example: http://jsfiddle.net/kCpNQ/1/The easiest way to strip all leading 0s is:If just stripping a single leading 0 character, as the question implies, you could useVery readable code is to use .substring() with a start set to index of the second character (1) (first character has index 0). Second parameter of the .substring() method is actually optional, so  you don\'t even need to call .length()......yes it is that simple...As @Shaded suggested, just loop this while first character of your string is the "unwanted" character...Quote from (and more on that in) What is the difference between String.slice and String.substring?He also points out that if the parameters to slice are negative, they\n  reference the string from the end. Substring and substr doesn\xc2\xb4t.Did you try the substring function?Here\'s a reference - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substringAnd you can always do this for multiple 0s:For all 0s: http://jsfiddle.net/An4MY/Here\'s one that doesn\'t assume the input is a string, uses substring, and comes with a couple of unit tests:http://jsfiddle.net/TRU66/1/This may be a bit of overkill but hey I was bored.This version may be of more use to you though.From the Javascript implementation of trim() > that removes and leading or ending spaces from strings. Here is an altered implementation of the answer for this question.Original implementation for this on JS
