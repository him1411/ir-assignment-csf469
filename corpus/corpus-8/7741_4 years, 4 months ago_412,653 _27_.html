I have a string that is up to 3 characters long when it\'s first created in SQL Server 2008 R2.I would like to pad it with leading zeros, so if its original value was \'1\' then the new value would be \'001\'. Or if its original value was \'23\' the new value is \'023\'. Or if its original value is \'124\' then new value is the same as original value.I am using SQL Server 2008 R2. How would I do this using T-SQL?If the field is already a string, this will workIf you want nulls to show as \'000\'It might be an integer -- then you would want Although the question was for SQL Server 2008 R2, in case someone is reading this with version 2012 and above, since then it became much easier by the use of FORMAT.For this question for example a code likeoutputs "001"Here\'s a more general technique for left-padding to any desired width:However, if you\'re dealing with negative values, and padding with leading zeroes, neither this, nor other suggested technique will work. You\'ll get something that looks like this:[Probably not what you wanted]So â€¦ you\'ll have to jump through some additional hoops Here\'s one approach that will properly format negative numbers:One should note that the convert() calls should specify an [n]varchar of sufficient length to hold the converted result with truncation.The safe method:This has the advantage of returning the string \'***\' for n < 0 or n > 999, which is a nice and obvious indicator of out-of-bounds input. The other methods listed here will fail silently by truncating the input to a 3-character substring.I have always found the following method to be very helpful.Here is a variant of Hogan\'s answer which I use in SQL Server Express 2012:Instead of worrying if the field is a string or not, I just CONCAT it, since it\'ll output a string anyway. Additionally if the field can be a NULL, using ISNULL might be required to avoid function getting NULL results.Use this function which suits every situation.Sample outputFor integers you can use implicit conversion from int to varchar:For those wanting to update their existing data here is the query:Wrote this because I had requirements for up to a specific length (9).\nPads the left with the @pattern ONLY when the input needs padding.\nShould always return length defined in @pattern.Returns 1234inputI had similar problem with integer column as input when I needed fixed sized varchar (or string) output. For instance, 1 to \'01\', 12 to \'12\'. This code works:If the input is also a column of varchar, you can avoid the casting part.
