Do you know of any way to delete all of the entries stored in Core Data? My schema should stay the same; I just want to reset it to blank.EditI\'m looking to do this programmatically so that a user can essentially hit a reset button.You can still delete the file programmatically, using the NSFileManager:removeItemAtPath:: method.Then, just add the persistent store back to ensure it is recreated properly.The programmatic way for iterating through each entity is both slower and prone to error.  The use for doing it that way is if you want to delete some entities and not others.  However you still need to make sure you retain referential integrity or you won\'t be able to persist your changes.Just removing the store and recreating it is both fast and safe, and can certainly be done programatically at runtime.Update for iOS5+With the introduction of external binary storage (allowsExternalBinaryDataStorage or Store in External Record File) in iOS 5 and OS X 10.7, simply deleting files pointed by storeURLs is not enough. You\'ll leave the external record files behind. Since the naming scheme of these external record files is not public, I don\'t have a universal solution yet. \xe2\x80\x93 an0 May 8 \'12 at 23:00You can delete the sqllite file - but I choose to do it by purging the tables individually with a functions:The reason I chose to do it table by table is that it makes me confirm as I am doing the programming that deleting the contents of the table is sensible and there is not data that I would rather keep.Doing it this will is much slower than just deleting the file and I will change to a file delete if I this method takes too long.Use NSBatchDeleteRequest to delete all the objects in the entity without having to load them into memory or iterate through them.This code has been updated for iOS 10 and Swift 3. If you need to support iOS 9, see this question.Sources: I\'ve written a clearStores method that goes through every store and delete it both from the coordinator and the filesystem (error handling left aside):This method is inside a coreDataHelper class that takes care of (among other things) creating the persistentStore when it\'s nil. I remove all data from core data on a button Event in a HomeViewController class:\nThis article helped me so much I figured I\'d contribute.Note that in order to call self.persistentStoreCoordinator I declared a property in the Home View Controller. (Don\'t worry about the managedObjectContext that I use for saving and loading.)Then in the AppDelegate ApplicationDidFinishLaunching right below creating a HomeViewController I have :MagicalRecord makes this very easy.[Late answer in response to a bounty asking for newer responses]Looking over earlier answers,But there\'s a different, similar approach to removing the persistent store that does work. The key is to put your persistent store file in its own sub-directory that doesn\'t contain anything else. Don\'t just stick it in the documents directory (or wherever), create a new sub-directory just for the persistent store. The contents of that directory will end up being the persistent store file, the journal files, and the external binary files. If you want to nuke the entire data store, delete that directory and they\'ll all disappear.You\'d do something like this when setting up your persistent store:Then when you wanted to remove the store,That recursively removes both the custom sub-directory and all of the Core Data files in it.This only works if you don\'t already have your persistent store in the same folder as other, important data. Like the documents directory, which probably has other useful stuff in it. If that\'s your situation, you could get the same effect by looking for files that you do want to keep and removing everything else. Something like:This approach may be error prone. You\'ve got to be absolutely sure that you know every file you want to keep, because otherwise you might remove important data. On the other hand, you can remove the external binary files without actually knowing the file/directory name used to store them.iOS9+, Swift 2Delete all objects in all entitiesIf you want to delete all objects and do not want to delete the backing files, you can use following methods:Beware that it may be very slow (depends on how many objects are in your object graph).Here is combined solution for purging Core Data.If you want to go the delete all objects route (which is much simpler than tearing down the Core Data stack, but less performant), than this is a better implementation:This implementation leverages NSOperation to perform the deletion off of the main thread and notify on completion. You may want to emit a notification or something within the completion block to bubble the status back to the main thread.Here is a somewhat simplified version with less calls to AppDelegate self and the last bit of code that was left out of the top rated answer. Also I was getting an error "Object\'s persistent store is not reachable from this NSManagedObjectContext\'s coordinator" so just needed to add that back.swift solution:As a quick reference to save searching elsewhere - recreating the persistent store after deleting it can be done with:Thanks for the post. I followed it and it worked for me. But I had another issue that was not mentioned in any of the replies. So I am not sure if it was just me. Anyway, thought I would post here the problem and my way that solved it.I had a few records in the database, I wanted to purge everything clean before write new data to the db, so I did everything including and then used managedObjectContext to access the database (supposed to be empty by now), somehow the data was still there. \nAfter a while of troubleshooting, I found that I need to reset managedObjectContext, managedObject, managedObjectModel and \npersistentStoreCoordinator, before I use managedObjectContext to access the dabase. Now I have a clean database to write to.  Several good answers to this question. Here\'s a nice concise one. The first two lines delete the sqlite database. Then the for: loop deletes any objects in the managedObjectContext memory.iOS 10 + Swift 3 solution:Iterates through all of the core data entities and clears themyou can also find all the entity names, and delete them by name. Its a longer version but works well, that way you dont have to work with persistence storefor "Any_Entity_Name" just give any one of your entity\'s name, we only need to figure out the entity description your entities are within. ValueForKey@"name" will return all the entity names. Finally, dont forget to save.The accepted answer is correct with removing URL by NSFileManager is correct, but as stated in iOS 5+ edit, the persistent store is not represented only by one file. For SQLite store it\'s *.sqlite, *.sqlite-shm and *.sqlite-wal ... fortunately since iOS 7+ we can use method [NSPersistentStoreCoordinator\n+removeUbiquitousContentAndPersistentStoreAtURL:options:error:] to take care of removal, so the code should be something like this:iOS 10 and Swift 3Assuming that your entity name is "Photo", and that you create a CoreDataStack class...Here is a good tutorial of how to use CoreData and how to use this method.\nhttps://medium.com/compileswift/parsing-json-response-and-save-it-in-coredata-step-by-step-fb58fc6ce16f#.1tu6kt8qbDelete sqlite from your fileURLPath and then build.Assuming you are using MagicalRecord and have a default persistence store:I don\'t like all the solutions that assume certain files to exist and/or demand entering the entities names or classes. This is a Swift(2), safe way to delete all the data from all the entities. After deleting it will recreate a fresh stack too (I am actually not sure as to how neccessery this part is). It\'s godo for "logout" style situations when you want to delete everything but have a working store and moc to get new data in (once the user logs in...)Use thisI took Grouchal\'s code and to speed it up I used enumeration with concurrent mode (NSEnumerationConcurrent), it got a bit faster compared to for loop (in my app I added this feature for Testers so that they can clear data and do testcases rather than delete and install app)here my swift3 version for delete all records. \'Users\' is entity nameWorks with all versions. Pass entity name and iterate through to delete all the entries and save the context.Delete the persistent store file and setup a new persistent store coordinator?you\'re all making this seem complicated. You can just send your NSManagedObjectContext the    reset method
