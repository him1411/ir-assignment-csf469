This question already has an answer here:I am running a bash script that creates a log file for the execution of the commandI use the followingThis only sends the standard output and not the standard error which appears on the terminal.Can I log both the stderr and stdout logged to a file?If you want to log to the same file:If you want different files:The simplest syntax to redirect both is:If you want to append to the file instead of overwrite:You can do it like that 2>&1:Use:Please use command 2>file\nHere 2 stands for file descriptor of stderr. You can also use 1 instead of 2 so that stdout gets redirected to the \'file\'
