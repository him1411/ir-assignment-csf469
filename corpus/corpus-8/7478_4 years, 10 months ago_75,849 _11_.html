ES6 looks like an incredibly awesome language!  I\'m really impressed with everything I\'ve seen in videos and presentation slides online.I\'m curious as to how I can use ES6 in modern browsers. Is ES6 "production ready?"  Furthermore, is there a way to make my ES6 code backwards compatible with older ECMAscript runtimes?Yes, I agree! ES6 is looking pretty exciting.Originally, the draft was intended to be feature-complete by the end of 2013. And the spec is projected to be finalized by the end of 2014. This date, according to a tweet by Allen Wirfs-Brock, has been pushed back to June 2015. For more details, see this blog post by Dr. Axel Rauschmayer.If all goes well we\'ll see it in all A-grade browsers by the end of 2015.Many of the features are already available on Firefox and Chrome (on Chrome you have to turn on experimental JavaScript in order to access it). It\'ll probably take Safari the longest.Clearly, it\'ll be some years after that before a significant percentage of the people on the internet are using an up-to-date browser. If you\'re in the position to require A-grade browsers, you\'ll be able to make the transition more quickly. But there are some tools that can help start making the transition now:There has been developed a pretty extensive ES6 shim for ES5 compliant browsers, available here: https://github.com/paulmillr/es6-shimIt includes shims for Symbols, Maps, Sets, and a host of new Math, String, and Array functions. It\'s being developed along with the drafts, and it\'s pretty close to up-to-date with the most recent ES6 draft. It\'s meant to be a placeholder until ES6 is ready so that I can start writing ES6 code now, code which will work when browsers start supporting ES6 natively.Unfortunately there\'s no way to simply "shim" in the syntactic changes. For that you either need an interpreter, compiler, or just need to wait on the browsers.
