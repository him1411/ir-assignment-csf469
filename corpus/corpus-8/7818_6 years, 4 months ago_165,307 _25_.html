How can I check if a user has selected something from a <select> field in HTML5?I see <select> doesn\'t support the new required attribute... do I have to use JavaScript then? Or is there something I\xe2\x80\x99m missing? :/Mandatory: Have the first value empty - required works on empty values   Prerequisites: correct html5 DOCTYPE and a named input fieldAs per the documentation (the listing and bold is mine)The required attribute is a boolean\n  attribute.\n  When specified, the user\n  will be required to select a value\n  before submitting the form.If a select element then that option is the\n  select element\'s placeholder label\n  option.The <select> element does support the required attribute, as per the spec:Which browser doesn\xe2\x80\x99t honour this?(Of course, you have to validate on the server anyway, as you can\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee that users will have JavaScript enabled.)You can use the selected attribute for the option element to select a choice by default.  You can use the required attribute for the select element to ensure that the user selects something.  In Javascript, you can check the selectedIndex property to get the index of the selected option, or you can check the value property to get the value of the selected option.According to the HTML5 spec, selectedIndex "returns the index of the first selected item, if any, or \xe2\x88\x921 if there is no selected item.  And value "returns the value of the first selected item, if any, or the empty string if there is no selected item."  So if selectedIndex = -1, then you know they haven\'t selected anything.Yes, it\'s working:you have to keep first option blank.In html5 you can do using the full expression:I don\'t know why the short expression doesn\'t work, but try this one.\nIt will solve.first you have to assign blank value in first option.\ni.e. Select here.than only required will work.Make the value of first item of selection box to blank. So when every you post the FORM you get blank value and using this way you would know that user hasn\'t selected anything from dropdown.Try this You can do it also dynamically with JQuerySet requiredRemove required
