I\'m trying to find a good way to print leading 0\'s, such as 01001 for a zipcode.  While the number would be stored as 1001, what is a good way to do it?I thought of using either case statements/if then to figure out how many digits the number is and then convert it to an char array with extra 0\'s for printing but I can\'t help but think there may be a way to do this with the printf format syntax that is eluding me.  The correct solution is to store the zip code in the database as a STRING.  Despite the fact that it may look like a number, it isn\'t.  It\'s a code, where each part has meaning.A number is a thing you do arithmetic on. A zip code is not that.You place a zero before the minimum field width:Zipcode is a highly localised field, many countries have characters in their postcodes, e.g., UK, Canada. Therefore in this example you should use a string / varchar field to store it if at any point you would be shipping or getting users/customers/clients/etc from other countries.However in the general case you should use the recommended answer (printf("%05d", number);).Here, "05" says "use 5 digits with leading zeros".If you are on a *NIX Machine:This will show a manual page, similar to:0      The value should be zero padded.  For d, i, o, u, x, X, a, A, e,\n                E, f, F, g, and G conversions, the converted value is padded  on\n                the  left  with  zeros rather than blanks.  If the 0 and - flags\n                both appear, the 0 flag is ignored.  If  a  precision  is  given\n                with  a numeric conversion (d, i, o, u, x, and X), the 0 flag is\n                ignored.  For other conversions, the behavior is undefined.Even though the question is for C, this page may be of aid.printf allows various formatting options.ex:You will save yourself a heap of trouble (long term) if you store a zip code as a character string, which it is, rather than a number, which it is not.More flexible.. \nHere\'s an example printing rows of right-justified numbers with fixed widths, and space-padding.The function and macro are designed so the printfs are more readable.If you need to store the zipcode in a character array zipcode[] , you can use this:
