Since downloading the latest SDK and installing Android Studio, my project fails to build. I get the following message:Note: This has been updated to reflect the release of API 21, Lollipop. Be sure to download the latest SDK.In one of my modules I had the following in build.gradle:Changing this tofixed the issue. Make sure you\'re not doing a general inclusion of com.android.support:support-v4:+ or any other support libraries (v7, v13, appcompat, etc), anywhere in your project.I\'d assume the problem is v4:+ picks up the release candidate (21.0.0-rc1) latest L release which obviously requires the L SDK. Edit:If you need to use the new views (CardView, RecyclerView, and Palette), the following should work:(Credit to EddieRingle on /androiddev - http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/297xli/howto_use_the_v21_support_libs_on_older_versions/)Another EditBe sure to see @murtuza\'s answer below regarding appcompat-v7 and upvote if it helps!Also, in case you are importing the appcompat-v7 library make sure you tag a version number at the end of it like so:After only changing the support-v4 version, I still received the error: Manifest merger failed : uses-sdk:minSdkVersion 15 cannot be smaller than version L declared in library com.android.support:support-v4:21.0.0-rc1It was a bit confusing because it looks like v4 is still the problem, but, in fact, restricting the appcompat v7 version fixed the problem.Solution 1:Change uses-sdk to <uses-sdk tools:node="replace" /> and add      xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"\nin AndroidManifest.xmlMake sure you use gradle 0.11 and above to use Manifest merger.Solution 2:Change     compile \'com.android.support:support-v4:+\' to  compile \'com.android.support:support-v4:20.+\' in build.gradle. This will prevent gradle from using \nv4:21.0.0 that requires version L.However, if your any of your external dependencies uses the same. You will probably have to wait for them to update the same.Solution 3:Remove/Comment <version>21.0.0-rc1</version> in your file <android-sdk>/extras/android/m2repository/com/android/support-v4/maven-metadata.xmlRepeat the same for support-v7no longer works.Change uses-sdk to and add xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools" in AndroidManifest.xmlThe problem still arises with transitive dependencies. Gradle offers a way to force the usage of a specific version of a dependency.For example you can add something like:to your build.gradle.If you want to learn more about gradle resolution strategies refer to this guide http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.ResolutionStrategy.htmlI found this while reading the corresponding issue which I will link hereIn the build.gradle file, It was by default compile \'com.android.support:support-v4:+\' so when you build the gradle projecit would consider, com.android.support:support-v4:21.0.0-rc1 because of the recent L developer preview release.Make changes in the following line and it will resolve the issue.\nChangetoSimilarly when using v7-appcompat support library, make the change fromcompile \'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:+\'to Adding to the correct answers above, the problem still might occur due to library nesting. In this case, try as the example below:I also had the same issue and changing following helped me:from:to:for people building hybrid apps using cordova CLI, this command will help:yes it uses double double dashes as you saw it.For people facing this issue in the Android Studio beta, the accepted answer didn\'t solve my problem. Importing a project downloaded from GitHub, I had the following in my build.gradle file of app giving an error in question:But in my external library folder I have this folder:I solved the above problem by changing the dependency to:Note: you might also need to download api level lower than the currently available in Android Studio for some library and projects for this to work properly.I solved the problem by editing the line below in build.gradle and it works! :-)adding version  20.+\'FromToYou have to configure all the supports and appcompat libraries with version 19.+If the recommendation of leave the support library with the 19.+ version doesn\'t works you can try the next tip in your AndroidManifest file.First add this code:And then, at the application level (not inside application!)    I make all of the solutions in here with no result, so i look in another place and i found a way to trick the IDE, so you have to put a line in the Mainfest to make the Gradle use a different one, the one that you put on build.gradle the line is:just it, and it work.I hope it helps.Helped me, taken from hereYou need to remove from build.gradle compile \'com.android.support:support-v13:+\'Here\'s the new bug filed for this btw https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=72430Assuming you are using the Support Repository, the workaround is to comment or remove the line21.0.0-rc1\nin the local Maven repo listing file at /extras/android/m2repository/com/android/support-v4/maven-metadata.xmlDon\'t forget, you should edit build.gradle in \'app\' subfolder of your project, not in project\'s folder. I\'ve lost a working day trying to solve a problem with version "L".Try deleting the build folder(s) in your project and resync your gradle project to rebuild it.  Also, like others have said in this post - instead of doing something like this:do this:Thank you @Murtuza. Your answer helped me to solve my problem but in my case compile \'com.android.support:support-v13:19.+ also, along with compile \'com.android.support:support-v4:19.+\'\ncompile \'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:19.+\'from\ncompile \'com.android.support:support-v4:+\'\ncompile \'com.android.support:support-v7:+\'\ncompile \'com.android.support:support-v13:+\'\nHope this might help some oneI have some projects where I prefer to target L.MR1(SDKv22) and some projects where I prefer KK(SDKv19). Your result may be different, but this worked for me.In Android Studio 1.1.0: File - Project Structure - Tab Flavors - Select Min SDK Version which is higher than in ManifestI have the second solution:change build.gradle like add in Manifest with xmlns:tools="schemas.android.com/tools";Go to sdk\\extras\\android\\m2repository\\com\\android\\support\\support-v4\\21.0.0-rc1\\unpack support-v4-21.0.0-rc1.aar and edit AndroidManifest.xml likefrom to P.S. You can do this with all support libraries that need.The only thing that worked for me is this:In project.properties, I changed:cordova.system.library.1=com.android.support:support-v4:+\nto\ncordova.system.library.1=com.android.support:support-v4:20.+
