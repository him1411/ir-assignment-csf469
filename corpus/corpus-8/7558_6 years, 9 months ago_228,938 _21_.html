I am creating a mobile web page that is basically a big form with several text inputs.However (at least on my Android cellphone), every time I click on some input the whole page zooms there, obscuring the rest of the page. Is there some HTML or CSS command to disable this kind of zoom on moble web pages?This should be everything you need For those of you late to the party, kgutteridge\'s answer doesn\'t work for me and Benny Neugebauer\'s answer includes target-densitydpi (a feature that is being deprecated).This however does work for me: You can use:But please note that with Android 4.4 the property target-densitydpi is no longer supported. So for Android 4.4 and later the following is suggested as best practice:There are a number of approaches here- and though the position is that typically users should not be restricted when it comes to zooming for accessibility purposes, there may be incidences where is it required:Render the page at the width of the device, dont scale:Prevent scaling- and prevent the user from being able to zoom:Removing all zooming, all scalingYou can use add user-scalable=0 and it should work on your inputs as well.Since there is still no solution for initial issue, here\'s my two cents.Mobile Safari requires font-size in inputs to be 16px. Sosolves the issue. So you don\'t need to disable zoom and loose accessibility features of you site.If you base font-size is not 16px or not 16px on mobiles, you can use media queries.some device viewport meta tag will not work \n.i this case you can add this scripteg:\n    \n
