I need delete row 1 of a table in a function I have defined. In order to use deleteRowAtIndexPath you must use an IndexPath with a section and row defined. How can I create an indexpath like this? An array with the int {1} as its only member will crash; the NSLog message states that the section needs to be defined as well. *Edit -> Code relating to cell delete:Use [NSIndexPath indexPathForRow:inSection:] to quickly create an index path.Edit: In Swift 3:indexPathForRow is a class method!The code should read:Obligatory answer in Swift : NSIndexPath(forRow:row, inSection: section) You will notice that NSIndexPath.indexPathForRow(row, inSection: section) is not available in swift and you must use the first method to construct the indexPath.For Swift 3 it\'s now: IndexPath(row: rowIndex, section: sectionIndex)
