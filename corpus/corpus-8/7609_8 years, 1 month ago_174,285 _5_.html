I am trying to get the HTTP status code number from the HttpWebResponse object returned from a HttpWebRequest.  I was hoping to get the actual numbers (200, 301,302, 404, etc.)  rather than the text description. ("Ok", "MovedPermanently", etc.)  Is the number buried in a property somewhere in the response object?  Any ideas other than creating a big switch function?  Thanks.   HttpStatusCode (the type of response.StatusCode) is an enumeration where the values of the members match the HTTP status codes, e.g.You have to be careful, server responses in the range of 4xx and 5xx throw a WebException. You need to catch it, and then get status code from a WebException object:As per \'dtb\' you need to use HttpStatusCode, but following \'zeldi\' you need to be extra careful with code responses >= 400.This has worked for me:
