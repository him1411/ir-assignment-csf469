I found out that some classes use the [Serializable] attribute.When you create an object in a .Net framework application, you don\'t need to think about how the data is stored in memory. Because the .Net Framework takes care of that for you. However, if you want to store the contents of an object to a file, send an object to another process or transmit it across the network, you do have to think about how the object is represented because you will need to convert to a different format. This conversion is called SERIALIZATION.Serialization allows the developer to save the state of an object and recreate it as needed, providing storage of objects as well as data exchange. Through serialization, a developer can perform actions like sending the object to a remote application by means of a Web Service, passing an object from one domain to another, passing an object through a firewall as an XML string, or maintaining security or user-specific information across applications. Apply SerializableAttribute to a type to indicate that instances of this type can be serialized. Apply the SerializableAttribute even if the class also implements the ISerializable interface to control the serialization process.All the public and private fields in a type that are marked by the SerializableAttribute are serialized by default, unless the type implements the ISerializable interface to override the serialization process. The default serialization process excludes fields that are marked with NonSerializedAttribute. If a field of a serializable type contains a pointer, a handle, or some other data structure that is specific to a particular environment, and cannot be meaningfully reconstituted in a different environment, then you might want to apply NonSerializedAttribute to that field.See MSDN for more details.Some practical uses for the [Serializable] attribute:These are the most common usage cases that I have come across.Here is short example of how serialization works. I was also learning about the same and I found two links useful.\nWhat Serialization is and how it can be done in .NET.A sample program explaining serialization If you don\'t understand the above program a much simple program with explanation is given here.Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of\n  bytes in order to store the object or transmit it to memory, a\n  database, or a file.How Serialization WorksThis illustration shows the overall process of serialization.The object is serialized to a stream, which carries not just the data, but information about the object\'s type, such as its version, culture, and assembly name. From that stream, it can be stored in a database, a file, or memory.Details in msdn.SerializationSerialization is the process of converting an object or a set of objects graph into a stream, it is a byte array in the case of binary serializationUses of SerializationBelow are some useful custom attributes that are used during serialization of an object[Serializable]  -> It is used when we mark an object\xe2\x80\x99s serializable\n[NonSerialized] -> It is used when we do not want to serialize an object\xe2\x80\x99s field.\n[OnSerializing] -> It is used when we want to perform some action while serializing an object\n[OnSerialized] -> It is used when we want to perform some action after serialized an object into stream.Below is the example of serializationHere is the calling code
