I want to display animated GIF images in my aplication.\nAs I found out the hard way Android doesn\'t support animated GIF natively.However it can display animations using AnimationDrawable:\nhttp://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/2d-graphics.html#frame-animationThe example uses animation saved as frames in application resources but what I need is to display animated gif directly.My plan is to break animated GIF to frames and add each frame as drawable to AnimationDrawable.Does anyone know how to extract frames from animated GIF and convert each of them into Drawable?Android actually can decode and display animated GIFs, using android.graphics.Movie class.This is not too much documented, but is in SDK Reference. Moreover, it is used in Samples in ApiDemos in BitmapDecode example with some animated flag.UPDATE:Use glide:usage:old answer:This is an excellent library :https://github.com/koral--/android-gif-drawableUsage from XML:Usage from JAVA:GifDrawable can be constructed directly from various sources:and setImageDrawable:also put (main/assets/htmls/name.gif) [with this html adjust to the size]declare in your Xml for example like this (main/res/layout/name.xml): [you define the size, for example]in your Activity put the next code inside of onCreateif you want load dynamically you could load the webview with data:suggestion: is better load gif with static images for more information check https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/drawable/AnimationDrawable.htmlThat\'s it, I hope you help.I solved the problem by splitting gif animations into frames before saving it to phone, so I would not have to deal with it in Android.Then I download every frame onto phone, create Drawable from it and then create AnimationDrawable - very similar to example from my questioni found a very easy way, with a nice and simple working example heredisplay animated widgetBefore getting it working there are some chages to do do in the codeIN THE FOLLOWINGjust replace inAND INProvide your own gif animation fileREPLACE THE FIRST LINE INaccording to the name of the class...after done this little changes it should work as for me...hope this helpWays to show animated GIF on Android:https://github.com/koral--/android-gif-drawable - decoder is implemented in C, so it\'s very efficient. https://code.google.com/p/giffiledecoder - decoder is implemented in Java, so it\'s easier to work with. Still reasonably efficient, even with large files.You\'ll also find many libraries based on GifDecoder class. That\'s also a Java-based decoder, but it works by loading the entire file into memory, so it\'s only applicable to small files.Use ImageViewEx, a library that makes using a gif as easy as using an ImageView.  I had a really hard time to have animated gif working in Android. I only had following two working:WebView works OK and really easy, but the problem is it makes the view loads slower and the app would be unresponsive for a second or so. I did not like that. So I have tried different approaches (DID NOT WORK):I had some back and forth with Ion; Finally, I have it working, and it is really fast :-)Nobody has mentioned the Ion or Glide library. they work very well.It\'s easier to handle compared to a WebView.GlideImage Loader Library for Android, recommended by Google.What that Glide has but Picasso doesn\'tAn ability to load GIF Animation to a simple ImageView might be the most interesting feature of Glide. And yes, you can\'t do that with Picasso.\n\nSome important links-I have had success with the solution proposed within this article, a class called GifMovieView, which renders a View which can then be displayed or added to a specific ViewGroup. Check out the other methods presented in parts 2 and 3 of the specified article. The only drawback to this method is that the antialiasing on the movie is not that good (must be a side-effect of using the "shady" Android Movie Class). You are then better off setting the background to a solid color within your animated GIF.@PointerNull gave good solution, but it is not perfect. It doesn\'t work on some devices with big files and show buggy Gif animation with delta frames on pre ICS version.\nI found solution without this bugs. It is library with native decoding to drawable: koral\'s android-gif-drawable.Some thoughts on the BitmapDecode example... Basically it uses the ancient, but rather featureless Movie class from android.graphics.\nOn recent API versions you need to turn off hardware acceleration, as described here. It was segfaulting for me otherwise.Here is the BitmapDecode example shortened with only the GIF part. You have to make your own Widget (View) and draw it by yourself. Not quite as powerful as an ImageView.2 other methods, one with ImageView another with WebView can be found in this fine tutorial. The ImageView method uses the Apache licensed android-gifview from Google Code.Try this, bellow code display gif file in progressbarloading_activity.xml(in Layout folder)custom_loading.xml(in drawable folder)here i put black_gif.gif(in drawable folder), you can put your own gif hereLoadingActivity.java(in res folder)Put it into a WebView, it has to be able to display it correctly, since the default browser supports gif files. (Froyo+, if i am not mistaken)I think the better library to handle gif files is this one: by koralUsed it and i\'m successful and this library is dedicated to GIF\'S; but where as the picasso and glide are general purpose image framework; so i think the developers of this library have entirely concentrated on gif filesUse fresco. Here\'s how to do it:http://frescolib.org/docs/animations.html Here\'s the repo with the sample:https://github.com/facebook/fresco/tree/master/samples/animationBeware fresco does not support wrap content!First of all the Android browser should support Animated GIFs. If it doesn\'t then it\'s a bug! Have a look at the issue trackers.If you\'re displaying these animated GIFs outside of a browser it might be a different story. To do what you\'re asking would require external library that supports the decoding of Animated GIFs.The first port of call would be to look at Java2D or JAI (Java Advanced Imaging) API, although I would be very surprised if Android Dalvik would support those libraries in your App.Similar to what @Leonti said, but with a little more depth:  What I did to solve the same problem was open up GIMP, hide all layers except for one, export it as its own image, and then hide that layer and unhide the next one, etc., until I had individual resource files for each one.  Then I could use them as frames in the AnimationDrawable XML file.I solved this by spliting gif in frames and use standard android animationYou may use GifAnimationDrawable library found in this link - https://github.com/Hipmob/gifanimateddrawable, and which convert any gif to AnimationDrawable. Enjoy :)
