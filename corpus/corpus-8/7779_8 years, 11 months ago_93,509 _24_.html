I am looking to get started building a project and want to use RSpec from day one. My Ruby background is limited; however, I do have a good understanding of MVC and the structure within Ruby.In doing some research for books and tutorials, I\'ve found no currently published books, and have found no tutorials that give a good "hello world" type write up. And the documentation on the RSpec site is sparse to say the least.\nDo any of you have links that you\'d like to share of good tutorials of getting started with roR and RSpec?A good tutorialhttp://blog.davidchelimsky.net/blog/2007/05/14/an-introduction-to-rspec-part-iexamples on the RSpec site\nhttp://rubydoc.info/github/rspec/rspec-core/framesthe rspec Docs which will be useful\nhttp://rspec.rubyforge.org/rspec/1.1.8/developing a rails model with Rspec and BDD\nhttp://www.lukeredpath.co.uk/2006/8/29/developing-a-rails-model-using-bdd-and-rspec-part-1 (from the wayback machine)Peepcode has a fantastic Screencast series ($) on RSpec that should get you started:Peepcode is a fantastic resource and the quality of the videos are top notch.  I would also recommend their unlimited plan for $149 which gives you access to all of their content for a year (and any content released in the next year).Good luck!The RSpec Book by David Chelimsky et al. is now in beta:http://www.pragprog.com/titles/achbd/the-rspec-bookHave a look at this: http://kerryb.github.com/iprug-rspec-presentation/#3\nIt\'s simple. But this is a great RSpec primer/cheat-sheet. \nPocket guide kind of thing i\'m hammering my way through this one: http://railstutorial.orgI found this resource http://betterspecs.org/ recently and it\'s helping me to improove my testing skills throught community tips. Reading others people tests on github projects helps too.The best documentation that I have seen for rspec can be found here: http://relishapp.com/rspec/I\'ll second the ringing endorsement of the Peepcode screencasts. I would definitely start with those.One resource that might not be obvious is Ian Dees\' Scripted GUI Testing with Ruby. It\'s not specifically geared towards Rails, but it has some of the clearest and most detailed examples of RSpec that I\'ve seen. In particular, the chapter on integrating RSpec and Selenium is excellent.Two more links I want to suggest:A few more links that are actually screen-casts are:Here\'s another resource that has been getting a lot of great reviews (I bought it but haven\'t started it yet):https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspecI think this is the a very good tutorial to get started with Rspec.\nhttp://testerstories.com/?p=298This helps you start visualizing things and actually see what Rspec can do.\nI highly recommend for BEGINNERS .\nThose who know a little bit of Rspec, you can find small tutorials on Capybara and Cucumber on this website.
