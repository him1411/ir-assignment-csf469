I want to search in all fields from all tables of a MySQL database a given string, possibly using syntax as:Is it possible to do something like this? You can peek into the information_schema schema. It has a list of all tables and all fields that are in a table. You can then run queries using the information that you have gotten from this table.The tables involved are SCHEMATA, TABLES and COLUMNS.  There are foreign keys such that you can build up exactly how the tables are created in a schema. You could do an SQLDump of the database (and its data) then search that file.If you have phpMyAdmin installed use its \'Search\' feature.I have used this on up to 250 table/10GB databases (on a fast server) and the response time is nothing short of amazing.You can use this project:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/anywhereindbThis will search all the data in all table. I also did my own mysql crawler to search some wordpress configuration, was unable to find it in both the interface and database, and database dumps were too heavy and unreadable. I must say I can\'t do without it now.It works like the one from @Olivier, but it manages exotic database / table names and is LIKE-joker safe.Running this script could output something like:This is the simplest query to retrive all Columns and TablesAll the tables or those with specific string in name could be searched via Search tab in phpMyAdmin. Have Nice Query... \\^.^/If you are avoiding stored procedures like the plague, or are unable to do a mysql_dump due to permissions, or running into other various reasons. I would suggest a three-step approach like this:1) Where this query builds a bunch of queries as a result set. Results should look like this:2) You can then just Right Click and use the Copy Row (tab separated) 3) Paste results in a new query window and run to your hearts content.Detail: I exclude system schema\'s that you may not usually see in your workbench unless you have the option Show Metadata and Internal Schemas checked.I did this to provide a quick way to ANALYZE an entire HOST or DB if needed, or to run OPTIMIZE statements to support performance improvements.I\'m sure there are different ways you may go about doing this but here\xe2\x80\x99s what works for me:Tested On MySQL Version: 5.6.23 WARNING: DO NOT RUN THIS IF:You are unsure what you are doing.You are trying to anger you DBA. (you may have people at your desk with the quickness.)Cheers, Jay ;-]Here is my solution for thisYou could useThen get the columns in those tables (in a loop) withand then with that info create many many queries which you can also UNION if you need.But this is extremely heavy on the database. Specially if you are doing a LIKE search.Dumping the SQL file was probably the quickest and fastest for me. Also discovered another problem anyways..Using MySQL Workbench it\'s easy to select several tables and run a search for text in all those tables of the DB ;-)I am use HeidiSQL is a useful and reliable tool designed for web developers using the popular MySQL server.In HeidiSQL you can push shift + ctrl + f and you can find text on the server in all tables. This option is very usefully.Although this question is old , here is how you can do it if you are using mysql workbench 6.3. ( Most likely it also works for other versions)Right click your schema and "Search table data" , enter your value and hit "Start Search". Thats it.I modified the PHP answer of Olivier a bit to:show total number of resultsThis solution \na) is only MySQL, no other language needed, and\nb) returns SQL results, ready for processing!I used Union to string together queries. Don\'t know if it\'s the most efficient way, but it works.
