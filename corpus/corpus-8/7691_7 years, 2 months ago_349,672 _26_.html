Is there a Boolean data type in Microsoft SQL Server like there is in MySQL?If so, what is the alternative in MS SQL Server?You could use the BIT datatype to represent boolean data. A BIT field\'s value is either 1 or 0.You may want to use the BIT data type, probably setting is as NOT NULL:Quoting the MSDN article:bit (Transact-SQL)An integer data type that can take a value of 1, 0, or NULL.The SQL Server Database Engine optimizes storage of bit columns. If there are 8 or less bit columns in a table, the columns are stored as 1 byte. If there are from 9 up to 16 bit columns, the columns are stored as 2 bytes, and so on.The string values TRUE and FALSE can be converted to bit values: TRUE is converted to 1 and FALSE is converted to 0.Alternatively, you could use the strings \'true\' and \'false\' in place of 1 or 0, like so-Also, any non 0 value (either positive or negative) evaluates to (or converts to in some cases) a 1.Note that SQL Server uses three valued logic (true, false, and NULL), since NULL is a possible value of the bit data type.  Here are the relevant truth tables- More information on three valued logic-Example of three valued logic in SQL Serverhttp://www.firstsql.com/idefend3.htmhttps://www.simple-talk.com/sql/learn-sql-server/sql-and-the-snare-of-three-valued-logic/There is boolean data type in SQL Server. Its values can be TRUE, FALSE or UNKNOWN. However, the boolean data type is only the result of a boolean expression containing some combination of comparison operators (e.g. =, <>, <, >=) or logical operators (e.g. AND, OR, IN, EXISTS). Boolean expressions are only allowed in a handful of places including the WHERE clause, HAVING clause, the WHEN clause of a CASE expression or the predicate of an IF or WHILE flow control statement. For all other usages, including the data type of a column in a table, boolean is not allowed. For those other usages, the BIT data type is preferred. It behaves like a narrowed-down INTEGER which allows only the values 0, 1 and NULL, unless further restricted with a NOT NULL column constraint or a CHECK constraint.To use a BIT column in a boolean expression it needs to be compared using a comparison operator such as =, <> or IS NULL. e.g.From a formatting perspective, a bit value is typically displayed as 0 or 1 in client software. When a more user-friendly format is required, and it can\'t be handled at an application tier in front of the database, it can be converted "just-in-time" using a CASE expression e.g.Storing boolean values as a character data type like char(1) or varchar(5) is also possible, but that is much less clear, has more storage/network overhead, and requires CHECK constraints on each column to restrict illegal values.For reference, the schema of answers table would be similar to:Use the Bit datatype. It has values 1 and 0 when dealing with it in native T-SQLSQL Server uses the Bit datatypeYou can use Bit DataType in SQL Server to store boolean data.
