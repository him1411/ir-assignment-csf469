I\'m working on a project that involves Raphaeljs. Turns out, it doesn\'t work on Android. It does on the iPhone.How the heck to I go about debugging something on the Android browser? It\'s WebKit, so if I know the version, will debugging it on that full version of WebKit produce the same results?Update: Remote DebuggingPreviously, console logging was the best option for debugging JavaScript on Android. These days with Chrome for Android remote debugging, we are able to make use of all the goodness of the Chrome for Desktop Developer Tools on Android. Check out https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debugging for more information.Update: JavaScript ConsoleYou can also navigate to about:debug in the URL bar to activate the debug menu and the JavaScript error console with recent Android devices. You should see SHOW JAVASCRIPT CONSOLE at the top of the Browser. Currently in Android 4.0.3 (Ice Cream Sandwich), the logcat outputs to the browser channel. So you can filter using adb logcat browser:* *:S.Original AnswerYou can use the built in console JavaScript object to print log messages that you can review with adb logcat.Produces this output:Determining the version of WebKitIf you type javascript:alert(navigator.userAgent) in the location bar you\xe2\x80\x99ll see the WebKit version listed e.g.In Chrome:\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.2 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.221.6 Safari/532.2On Android Emulator\nMozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 1.6; en-us; sdk Build/DRC76) AppleWebKit/528.5+ (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.1.2 Mobile Safari/525.20.1N.B.Versions of WebKit that are not part of a Safari release have a + after the version number, and their version number is generally higher than the latest released version of WebKit. So, for example, 528+ is an unofficial build of WebKit that is newer than the 525.x version that shipped as part of Safari 3.1.2.Try: while on that page, in the address bar of a stock Android browser, type:(Note nothing happens, but some new options have been enabled.) Works on the devices I  have tried. Read more on Android browser\'s about:debug, what do those settings do?Edit:\nWhat also helps to retrieve more information like line number is to add this code to your script:The http://jsconsole.com ( http://jsconsole.com/remote-debugging.html ) provides a nice way you can use to access the content of you webpage.I use Weinre, part of Apache Cordova.With Weinre, I get Google Chrome\'s debug console in my desktop browser, and can connect Android to that debug console, and debug HTML and CSS. I can execute Javascript commands in the console, and they affect the Web page in the Android browser. Log messages from Android appear in the desktop debug console.However I think it\'s not possible to view or step through the actual Javascript code. So I combine Weinre with log messages.(I don\'t know much about JConsole but it seems to me that HTML and CSS inspection isn\'t possible with JConsole, only Javascript commands and logging (?).)Take a look at jsHybugger. It will allow you to remotely debug your js code for:How this works (more details and alternatives on the projects site, this was what I found to be the best way). Again, with Chrome on Android use the ADB extension without jsHybugger. I think this already described in the accepted answer to this question.FYI, the reason why RaphaelJS doesn\'t work on android is that android webkit (unlike iPhone webkit) doesn\'t support SVG at this time. Google has only recently come to the conclusion that SVG support an android is a good idea, so it won\'t be available yet for some time.Full Chrome remote debugging of Android native browser on a Galaxy S6 on Android 5.1.1:The Galaxy S5 devices shows in Chrome but the tabs only show after you restart. After restarting and attempting to attach, the mobile browser crashes.Raphael is not supported on pre 3.0 Android browsers, that\'s what your problem is. They have no support for SVG graphics. It does have support for canvas though. If you don\'t need to animate it, you could render the graphics with canvg: http://code.google.com/p/canvg/That\'s how we got around this issue for rendering SVG icons in the default Android browser.Put into address line chrome://about. You will see links to all possible dev pages.The about:debug (or chrome:\\\\debug both of which say page cannot be found, but enable the Debug menu in the settings)  when tried on Chrome or Opera on Android KitKat 4.4.2 on a Samsung TabIf you have ROOT permissions on your device, you can view the console messages directly on the device. Use an app like CatLog to view the log output - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nolanlawson.logcat&hl=en This will let you view all logcat activity.In Android KitKat/4.4.2, the browser console is output to the Chromium channel. You could filter by "Chromium" to get all browser activity (include browser\'s internal activity), or simply filter by "Console" to only see the Browser console log.You can try YConsole a js embedded console. It is lightweight and simple to use.How to use :According to this link, the javascript debugging can be done by downloading the firebug.js file mentioned in the link and loading the downloaded file in your HTML page so that you can debug without any resort to Internet. My solution is (for the stock browser):If you are building a \'hybrid\' app (cordova), The CrossWalk plugin utilizes google chromes webview instead of the standard internet webview that comes with android. When I installed the plugin, it came with the ability to debug.CrossWalkAndroid studio provide all you need to see console.log and other. In logcat just filter to "/Web\xc2\xa0Console" and you will see your js logs...If you get any issue you can add this plugin :\nhttps://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-consoleIf you are looking for non remote options:On earlier and non rooted Jellybean releases a logcat viewer can be used if android.permission.READL_LOGS is granted via adb once.On firefox, there is a console addon that reads and shows all app logs and there is also firebug lite.mobile-console-log allows you to display any console.log to the Chrome Devtools from any device.
