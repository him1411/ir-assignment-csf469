I\'m aware of the reason that git push --tags is a separate operation to plain old git push. Pushing tags should be a conscious choice since you don\'t want accidentally push one. That\'s fine. But is there a way to push both together? (Aside from git push && git push --tags.)As of git 2.4.1, you can doIf set to true enable --follow-tags option by default. You may override this configuration at time of push by specifying --no-follow-tags.Since git 1.8.3 (April 22d, 2013), you no longer have to do 2 commands to push branches, and then to push tags:The new "--follow-tags" option tells "git push" to push relevant annotated tags when pushing branches out.You can now try, when pushing new commits:That won\'t push all the local tags though, only the one referenced by commits which are pushed with the git push.Git 2.4.1+ (Q2 2015) will introduce the option push.followTags: see "How to make \xe2\x80\x9cgit push\xe2\x80\x9d include tags within a branch?".The nuclear option would be git push --mirror, which will push all refs under refs/.You can also push just one tag with your current branch commit:You can combine the --tags option with a refspec like:(since --tags means: All refs under refs/tags are pushed, in addition to refspecs explicitly listed on the command line)You also have this entry "Pushing branches and tags with a single "git push" invocation"A handy tip was just posted to the Git mailing list by Zolt\xc3\xa1n F\xc3\xbczesi:I use .git/config to solve this:With these lines added git push origin will upload all your branches and tags. If you want to upload only some of them, you can enumerate them.Haven\'t tried it myself yet, but it looks like it might be useful until some other way of pushing branches and tags at the same time is added to git push.\n  On the other hand, I don\'t mind typing:Beware, as commented by Aseem Kishore push = +refs/heads/* will force-pushes all your branches. This bit me just now, so FYI.This works for me:
