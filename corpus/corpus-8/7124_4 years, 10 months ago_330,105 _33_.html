I have found various examples of how to revert an SVN commit likeorBut neither of them seems to work. I tried those commands and checked the files that were changed by hand.How do I revert a commit with revision number 1944? How do I check that the revert has been done (without looking in the actual file to the changes have been reverted)?Both examples must work, butsvn merge -r UPREV:LOWREV . undo rangesvn merge -c -REV . undo single revisionin this syntax - if current dir is WC and (as in must done after every merge) you\'ll commit resultsDo you want to see logs?If you\'re using the TortoiseSVN client, it\'s easily done via the Show Log dialog.svn merge -r 1944:1943 . should revert the changes of r1944 in your working copy. You can then review the changes in your working copy (with diff), but you\'d need to commit in order to apply the revert into the repository.First, revert the working copy to 1943.Second, check what is about to be commited.Third, commit version 1945.Fourth, look at the new log.It is impossible to "uncommit" a revision, but you can revert your working copy to version 1943 and commit that as version 1945. The versions 1943 and 1945 will be identical, effectively reverting the changes.The following will do a dry run, as it says.  HEAD being current version, PREV is previous, then the path to your file, or committed item:If the dry run looks good, run the command without the --dry-runVerify the change in revision and re-commit.  To browse for version numbers try:Alex, try this: svn merge [WorkingFolderPath] -r 1944:1943I tried the above, (svn merge) and you\'re right, it does jack.  However seems to work, but isn\'t permanent (my svn is simply showing an old revision).  So I had to In my particular case my target is interfaces/AngelInterface.php.  I made changes to the file, committed them, updated the build computer ran the phpdoc compiler and found my changes were a waste of time.  svn log interfaces/AngelInterface.php shows my change as r22060 and the previous commit on that file was r22059.  So I can svn update -r 22059 interfaces/AngelInterface.php and I end up with code as it was in -r22059 again.  Then :-Alternatively I could do the same thing on a directory, by specifying . -R in place of interfaces/AngelInterface.php in all the above.  While the suggestions given already may work for some people, it does not work for my case. When performing the merge, users at rev 1443 who update to rev 1445, still sync all files changed in 1444 even though they are equal to 1443 from the merge. I needed end users to not see the update at all.If you want to completely hide the commit it is possible by creating a new branch at correct revision and then swapping the branches. The only thing is you need to remove and re add all locks.This worked for me, perhaps it will be helpful to someone else out there =)This saved my life.I was having the same issue, after reverting back also I was not seeing old code.\nAfter running the above command I got a clean old version code.If you want to completely remove commits from history, you can also do a dump of the repo at a specific revision, then import that dump. Specifically:The svnrdump command performs the same function as svnadmin dump but works on a remote repo. Next just import the dump file into your repo of choice. This was tested to worked well on Beanstalk.There is no way to revert back to a specific version bcoz as we humans are well taught on merging two rivers but not for separating the gravy from curry(and that also has mathematics as versioning). The best and safe way to roll back your code is to check out your code on two places. So after commit(from first checkout) you find trouble you can commit from second checkout.
