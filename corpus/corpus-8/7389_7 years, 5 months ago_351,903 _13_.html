I have an html textarea that is of fixed width, but variable height. I would like to set overflow:scroll and be able to show a vertical scrollbar, but not a horizontal one. I am not able to use overflow:auto due to other things specific to my situation.I know there is no way using CSS 2 to show only vertical but not horizontal scrollbars. Is there anything I can do with javascript to hide the horizontal scrollbar?You can use css like this:Use CSS. It\'s easier and faster than javascript.Disable horizontal scrollbar completely by adding this code.Using wrap=virtual in your HTML form boxes gets rid of the horizontal scrollbar at the bottom of the box: See example here : http://jsbin.com/opube3/2 (Tested on FF and IE)sets 200px scrolldown size, overflow-x hides any horizontal scrollbar.Working example with snippet and jsfiddle link https://jsfiddle.net/sx8u82xp/3/For me:Of course remove the arrows
