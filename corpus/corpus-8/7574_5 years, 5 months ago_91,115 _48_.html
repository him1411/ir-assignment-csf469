What are the differences between socket.io and websockets in\n    node.js?\nAre they both server push technologies?\nThe only differences I felt was,socket.io allowed me to send/emit messages by specifying an event name.In the case of socket.io a message from server will reach on all clients, but for the same    in websockets I was forced to keep an array of all connections and loop through it to send messages to all clients.Also,\nI wonder why web inspectors (like Chrome/firebug/fiddler) are unable to catch these messages (from socket.io/websocket)  from server?Please clarify this.Socket.IO uses WebSockets when it can. Its advantages are that it simplifies the usage of WebSockets as you described in #2, and probably more importantly it provides failovers to other protocols in the event that WebSockets are not supported on the browser or server. I would avoid using WebSockets directly unless you are very familiar with what environments they don\'t work and you are capable of working around those limitations.This is a good read on both WebSockets and Socket.IO.http://davidwalsh.name/websocketThere are few common misconceptions regarding WebSocket and Socket.IO:The first misconception is that using Socket.IO is significantly easier than using WebSocket which doesn\'t seem to be the case. See examples below.The second misconception is that WebSocket is not widely supported in the browsers. See below for more info.The third misconception is that Socket.IO downgrades the connection as a fallback on older browsers. It actually assumes that the browser is old and starts an AJAX connection to the server, that gets later upgraded on browsers supporting WebSocket, after some traffic is exchanged. See below for details.I wrote an npm module to demonstrate the difference between WebSocket and Socket.IO:It is a simple example of server-side and client-side code - the client connects to the server using either WebSocket or Socket.IO and the server sends three messages in 1s intervals, which are added to the DOM by the client.Compare the server-side example of using WebSocket and Socket.IO to do the same in an Express.js app:WebSocket server example using Express.js:Source: https://github.com/rsp/node-websocket-vs-socket.io/blob/master/ws.jsSocket.IO server example using Express.js:Source: https://github.com/rsp/node-websocket-vs-socket.io/blob/master/si.jsCompare the client-side example of using WebSocket and Socket.IO to do the same in the browser:WebSocket client example using vanilla JavaScript:Source: https://github.com/rsp/node-websocket-vs-socket.io/blob/master/ws.htmlSocket.IO client example using vanilla JavaScript:Source: https://github.com/rsp/node-websocket-vs-socket.io/blob/master/si.htmlTo see the difference in network traffic you can run my test. Here are the results that I got:From those 2 requests:(The connection upgrade request is visible on the developer tools with a 101 Switching Protocols response.)From those 6 requests:WebSocket results that I got on localhost:Socket.IO results that I got on localhost:Quick start:Open http://localhost:3001/ in your browser, open developer tools with Shift+Ctrl+I, open the Network tab and reload the page with Ctrl+R to see the network traffic for the WebSocket version.Open http://localhost:3002/ in your browser, open developer tools with Shift+Ctrl+I, open the Network tab and reload the page with Ctrl+R to see the network traffic for the Socket.IO version.To uninstall:As of June 2016 WebSocket works on everything except Opera Mini, including IE higher than 9.This is the browser compatibility of WebSocket on Can I Use as of June 2016:See http://caniuse.com/websockets for up-to-date info.Im going to provide an argument against using socket.io.I think using socket.io solely because it has fallbacks isnt a good idea. Let IE8 RIP.In the past there have been many cases where new versions of NodeJS has broken socket.io.  You can check these lists for examples... https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/issues?q=install+errorIf you go to develop an Android app or something that needs to work with your existing app, you would probably be okay working with WS right away, socket.io might give you some trouble there...Plus the WS module for Node.JS is amazingly simple to use.Using Socket.IO is basically like using jQuery - you want to support older browsers, you need to write less code and the library will provide with fallbacks. Socket.io uses the websockets technology if available, and if not, checks the best communication type available and uses it.Socket.IO uses WebSocket and when WebSocket is not available uses fallback algo to make real time connections.
