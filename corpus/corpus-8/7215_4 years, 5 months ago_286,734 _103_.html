Is the method for getting a SHA-1 fingerprint the same as the method of getting the a fingerprint? Previously, I was running this command:It\'s not clear to me if the result I\'m getting is the SHA-1 fingerprint. Can somebody clarify this?Follow this tutorial for creating SHA1 fingerprint for Google Map v2If you are using android studio use simple stepResult Under Run Tab If Android Studio < 2.2\nFrom android studio 2.2\nResult will be available under Run console but use highlighted toggle buttonOr \nSecond Way is\nCreate new project in android studio New -> Google Maps Activity\nthen open google_maps_api.xml xml file as shown in pics you will see your SHA key\nEasiest way for getting SHA1 Key in android studio both (Debug and release Mode)If you are using new Android Studio it shows time to execute on top there is Toggle task execution mode click on that you will get you SHA-1 key.
