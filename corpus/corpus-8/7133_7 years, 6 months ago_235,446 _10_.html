I\'m using PHP\'s function file_get_contents() to fetch contents of a URL and then I process headers through the variable $http_response_header.Now the problem is that some of the URLs need some data to be posted to the URL (for example, login pages). How do I do that?I realize using stream_context I may be able to do that but I am not entirely clear.Thanks.Sending an HTTP POST request using file_get_contents is not that hard, actually : as you guessed, you have to use the $context parameter.\nThere\'s an example given in the PHP manual, at this page : HTTP context options (quoting) :Basically, you have to create a stream, with the right options (there is a full list on that page), and use it as the third parameter to file_get_contents -- nothing more ;-)\nAs a sidenote : generally speaking, to send HTTP POST requests, we tend to use curl, which provides a lot of options an all -- but streams are one of the nice things of PHP that nobody knows about... too bad...An alternative, you can also use fopen
