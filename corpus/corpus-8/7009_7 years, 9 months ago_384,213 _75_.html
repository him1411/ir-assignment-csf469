How can i convert an array like this to object?In the simplest case, it\'s probably sufficient to "cast" the array as an object:Another option would be to instantiate a standard class as a variable, and loop through your array while re-assigning the values:As Edson Medina pointed out, a really clean solution is to use the built-in json_ functions:This also (recursively) converts all of your sub arrays into objects, which you may or may not want. Unfortunately it has a 2-3x performance hit over the looping approach.Warning! (thanks to Ultra for the comment):json_decode on different enviroments converts UTF-8 data in different ways. I end up getting on of values \'240.00\' locally and \'240\' on production - massive dissaster. Morover if conversion fails string get\'s returned as NULLyou can simply use type casting to convert an array to object.Here are three ways:Fake a real object:Convert the array into an object by casting it to an object:Manually convert the array into an object:Quick hack:Not pretty, but works.The easy way would beBut that\'s not what you want. If you want objects you want to achieve something, but that#s missing in this question. Using objects just for the reason of using objects makes no sense.Depending on where you need that and how to access the object there are different ways to do it.For example: just typecast itHowever, the most compatible one is using a utility method (not yet part of PHP) that implements standard PHP casting based on a string that specifies the type (or by ignoring it just de-referencing the value):The usage example in your case (Online Demo):This one worked for meusage :returns :like usual you can loop it like:Its way to simple, This will create an object for recursive arrays as well:$object = json_decode(json_encode((object) $yourArray), FALSE);There\'s no built-in method to do it as far as I\'m aware, but it\'s as easy as a simple loop:You can expound on that if you need it to build your object recursively.Actually if you want to use this with multi-dimensional arrays you would want to use some recursion.I would definitly go with a clean way like this :if you submit:you will get this:I found this more logical comparing the above answers from Objects should be used for the purpose they\'ve been made for (encapsulated cute little objects).Also using get_object_vars ensure that no extra attributes are created in the manipulated Object (you don\'t want a car having a family name, nor a person behaving 4 wheels).Easy:Example:Then, the following is true:You could also use an ArrayObject, for example:recursion is your friend:use this function that i\'ve made:Usage:You could also do this by adding (object) on left of variable to create a new object.http://codepad.org/9YmD1KsUUsing json_encode is problematic because of the way that it handles non UTF-8 data. It\'s worth noting that the json_encode/json_encode method also leaves non-associative arrays as arrays. This may or may not be what you want. I was recently in the position of needing to recreate the functionality of this solution but without using json_ functions. Here\'s what I came up with:Best Method in the WORLD :)if you use different methods you will have problems. This is the best method. You have ever seen.Inspired by all these codes, i tried to create a enhanced version with support to: specific class name, avoid constructor method, \'beans\' pattern and strict mode (set only existing properties):This function works as same as json_decode(json_encode($arr), false).Output:Output:Output:Little complicated but easy to extend technique:Suppose you have an array Suppose YOu have have person class which may have more or less attributes from this array. for exampleIf you still wanna change your array to the person object. You can use ArrayIterator Class. Now you have iterator object. Create a class extending FilterIterator Class; where you have to define the abstract method accept. Follow the exampleThe above impelmentation will bind the property only if it exists in the class. Add one more method in the class PersonIteratorMake sure you have mutators defined in your class. \nNow you are ready to call these function where you want to create object.CakePHP has a recursive Set::map class that basically maps an array into an object. You may need to change what the array looks like in order to make the object look the way you want it.http://api.cakephp.org/view_source/set/#line-158Worst case, you may be able to get a few ideas from this function.Obviously just an extrapolation of some other folks\' answers, but here\'s the recursive function that will convert any mulch-dimensional array into an object:And remember that if the array had numeric keys they can still be referenced in the resulting object by using {} (for instance: $obj->prop->{4}->prop)i have done it with quite simple way, By using (array) and (object) as prefix, you can simply convert object array to standard array and vice-verseI use the following to parse Yaml files associative arrays into an object state.This checks all supplied arrays if there are objects hiding there, and turns them also in objects.This turns a yaml configured asto an array consisting of:to an object of:one liner
