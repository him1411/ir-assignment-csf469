I have the following code:I expected: abcdcI got: abcdNow I do Is there a better way?You could do this:Or using regular expressions:If you are sure that the string only appears at the end, then the simplest way would be to use \'replace\':Since it seems like nobody has pointed this on out yet:This should be more efficient than the methods using split() as no new list object is created, and this solution works for strings with several dots.Depends on what you know about your url and exactly what you\'re tryinh to do.  If you know that it will always end in \'.com\' (or \'.net\' or \'.org\') then is the quickest solution. If it\'s a more general URLs then you\'re probably better of looking into the urlparse library that comes with python.  If you on the other hand you simply want to remove everything after the final \'.\' in a string then    will work.  Or if you want just want everything up to the first \'.\' then tryIn one line:How about url[:-4]?For urls (as it seems to be a part of the topic by the given example), one can do something like this:Both will output:\n(\'http://www.stackoverflow\', \'.com\')This can also be combined with str.endswith(suffix) if you need to just split ".com", or anything specific. If you know it\'s an extension, thenThis works equally well with abcdc.com or www.abcdc.com or abcdc.[anything] and is more extensible.I want to repeat this answer as the most expressive way to do it. Of course, the following would take less CPU timeHowever, if CPU is the bottle neck why write in Python?When is CPU a bottle neck anyway?? in drivers , maybe.The advantages of using regular expression is code reusability. What if you next want to remove \'.me\' , which only has three characters?Same code would do the trick.This is a perfect use for regular expressions:Or you can use split:In my case I needed to raise an exception so I did:url.rsplit(\'.com\', 1)is not quite right.  What you actually would need to write is, and it looks pretty succinct IMHO.However, my personal preference is this option because it uses only one parameter:If you mean to strip only extensionIt works with any extension, with potential other dots existing in filename as well. It simply splits string to list on dots and joins it without last element.Probably not the fastest, but for me it\'s more readable than other methods.I don\'t see anything wrong with the way you\'re doing it with rsplit, it does exactly what you want. It all depends on how generic you want the solution to be. Do you always want to remove .com, or will it sometimes be .org? If that is the case, use one of the other solutions, otherwise, stick with rsplit()The reason that strip() does not work the way you expect is that it works on each character individually. It will scan through your string and remove all occurrences of the characters from the end AND the front. So if your string started with \'c\', that would also be gone. You would use rstrip to only strip from the back.
