Does anybody know how to get hold of an element defined in a component template? Polymer makes it really easy with the $ and $$.\nI was just wondering how to go about it in Angular 2.Take the example from the tutorial:How do I catch hold of a reference of the \'P\' or \'input\' element from within the class definition?You can get a handle to the DOM element via ElementRef by injecting it into your component\'s constructor:Docs: https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/core/index/ElementRef-class.htmlInstead of injecting ElementRef and using querySelector or similar from there, a declarative way can be used instead to access elements in the view directly:elementPlunker exampledescendants@ContentChildren() is the only one that allows to also query for descendants \n{descendants: true} should be the default but is not in 2.0.0 final and it\'s considered a bug\n\nThis was fixed in 2.0.1readIf there are a component and directives the read parameter allows to specify which instance should be returned.For example ViewContainerRef that is required by dynamically created components instead of the default ElementRefsubscribe changesEven though view children are only set when ngAfterViewInit() is called and content children are only set when ngAfterContentInit() is called, if you want to subscribe to changes of the query result, it should be done in ngOnInit()https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/9689#issuecomment-229247134direct DOM accesscan only query DOM elements, but not components or directive instances:get arbitrary projected contentSee Access transcluded contentExample updated to work with the latest versionFor more details on native element, hereFor people trying to grab the component instance inside a *ngIf or *ngSwitchCase, you can follow this trick.Create an init directive.Export your component with a name such as myComponentUse this template to get the ElementRef AND MyComponent instanceUse this code in TypeScriptAngular 4+:\nUse renderer.selectRootElement with a CSS selector to access the element.I\'ve got a form that initially displays an email input. After the email is entered, the form will be expanded to allow them to continue adding information relating to their project. However, if they are not an existing client, the form will include an address section above the project information section.As of now, the data entry portion has not been broken up into components, so the sections are managed with *ngIf directives. I need to set focus on the project notes field if they are an existing client, or the first name field if they are new.I tried the solutions with no success. However, Update 3 in this answer gave me half of the eventual solution. The other half came from MatteoNY\'s response in this thread. The result is this:Since the only thing I\'m doing is setting the focus on an element, I don\'t need to concern myself with change detection, so I can actually run the call to renderer.selectRootElement outside of Angular. Because I need to give the new sections time to render, the element section is wrapped in a timeout to allow the rendering threads time to catch up before the element selection is attempted. Once all that is setup, I can simply call the element using basic CSS selectors.I know this example dealt primarily with the focus event, but it\'s hard for me that this couldn\'t be used in other contexts.I would like to add that if you are using ElementRef, as recommended by all answers, then you will immediately encounter the problem that ElementRef has an awful type declaration that looks likethis is stupid in a browser environment where nativeElement is an HTMLElement.To workaround this you can use the following technique
