Is it possible to import css stylesheets into a html page using Javascript? If so, how can it be done?P.S the javascript will be hosted on my site, but I want users to be able to put in the <head> tag of their website, and it should be able to import a css file hosted on my server into the current web page. (both the css file and the javascript file will be hosted on my server).Here\'s the "old school" way of doing it, which hopefully works across all browsers. In theory, you would use setAttribute unfortunately IE6 doesn\'t support it consistently.This example checks if the CSS was already added so it adds it only once.Put that code into a javascript file, have the end-user simply include the javascript, and make sure the CSS path is absolute so it is loaded from your servers.Here is an example that uses plain JavaScript to inject a CSS link into the head element based on the filename portion of the URL:Insert the code just before the closing head tag and the CSS will be loaded before the page is rendered. Using an external JavaScript (.js) file will cause a Flash of unstyled content (FOUC) to appear.I guess something like this script would do:This JS file contains the following statement:The address of the javascript and css would need to be absolute if they are to refer to your site.Many CSS import techniques are discussed in this "Say no to CSS hacks with branching techniques" article.But the "Using JavaScript to dynamically add Portlet CSS stylesheets" article mentions also the CreateStyleSheet possibility (proprietary method for IE):If you use jquery:Call the following function to dynamically load CSS or JavaScript file.  Pass the complete file path with the name as filename argument.I know this is a pretty old thread but here comes my 5 cents.There is another way to do this depending on what your needs are.I have a case where i want a css file to be active only a while. Like css switching. Activate the css and then after another event deativate it. Instead of loading the css dynamically and then removing it you can add a Class/an id in front of all elements in the new css and then just switch that class/id of the base node of your css (like body tag).You would with this solution have more css files initially loaded but you have a more dynamic way of switching css layouts.There is a general jquery plugin that loads css and JS files synch and asych on demand.\nIt also keeps track off what is already been loaded :)\nsee: http://code.google.com/p/rloader/Here\'s a way with jQuery\'s element creation method (my preference) and with callback onLoad:If you want to know (or wait) until the style itself has loaded this works:The YUI library might be what you are looking for. It also supports cross domain loading.If you use jquery, this plugin does the same thing.You may use for this YUI library or use this article to implement Below a full code using for loading JS and/or CSSI\'m using thymeleaf and this is work fine.
