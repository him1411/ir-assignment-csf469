I\'ve been searching around for code that would let me detect if the user visiting the website has Firefox 3 or 4. All I have found is code to detect the type of browser but not the version.How can I detect the version of a browser like this?You can see what the browser says, and use that information for logging or testing multiple browsers.This is an improvement on Kennebec\'s answer.And then you just run:This way you can shield yourself from the obscurity of the code.Use this: http://www.quirksmode.org/js/detect.htmlThis combines kennebec\'s (K) answer with Hermann Ingjaldsson\'s (H) answer: I was looking for a solution for myself, since jQuery 1.9.1 and above have removed the $.browser functionality. I came up with this little function that works for me.\nIt does need a global variable (I\'ve called mine _browser) in order to check which browser it is. I\'ve written a jsfiddle to illustrate how it can be used, of course it can be expanded for other browsers by just adding a test for _browser.foo, where foo is the name of the browser. I did just the popular ones.detectBrowser()To check if the current browser is Opera you would doEdit Fixed the formatting, fixed the detection for IE11 and Opera/Chrome, changed to browserResult from result. Now the order of the _browser keys doesn\'t matter. Updated jsFiddle link.2015/08/11 Edit Added new testcase for Internet Explorer 12 (EDGE), fixed a small regexp problem. Updated jsFiddle link.This will return an array, first element is the browser name, second element is the complete version number in string format.jQuery can handle this quite nice (jQuery.browser)EDIT: As Joshua wrote in his comment below, jQuery.browser property is no longer supported in jQuery since version 1.9 (read jQuery 1.9 release notes for more details).\njQuery development team recommends using more complete approach like adapting UI with Modernizr library.The bowser JavaScript library offers this functionality.  It seems to be well maintained.In pure Javascript you can do a RegExp match on the navigator.userAgent to find the Firefox version:ffVersion will be undefined if not a Firefox browser.See working example → I have made a script in ASP code to detect browser, browser version, OS and OS version.\nThe reason for me to do this in ASP was because i want to store the data in a log-database.\nSo I had to detect the browser serverside.Here is the code:Look at navigator.userAgent - Firefox/xxx.xxx.xxx is specified right at the end.See the demo here..http://jsfiddle.net/hw4jM/3/I wrote a version detector based on Hermann Ingjaldsson\'s answer, but more robust and which returns an object with name/version data in it.  It covers the major browsers but I don\'t bother with the plethora of mobile ones and minor ones:It can then be used like this:This page seems to have a pretty nice snippet which only uses the appString and appVersion property as a last resort as it claims them to be unreliable with certain browsers.\nThe code on the page is as follows:Here is the java version for somemone who whould like to do it on server side using the String returned by HttpServletRequest.getHeader("User-Agent");It is working on the 70 different browser configuration I used for testing.I wrote this for my needs.It get info like if is a mobile device or if has a retina displaytry itAdding my own implementation of Hermann\'s answer. I needed OS detection so that\'s been added. Also includes some ES6 code (because we have a transpiler) that you might need to ES5-ify.Returns: Object {browser: "Chrome", version: "50", os: "UNIX"}
