I wrote a PHP code like thisBut when I remove "http://" from $site I get the following warning:Warning:\n  file_get_contents(www.google.com)\n  [function.file-get-contents]: failed\n  to open stream:I tried try and catch but it didn\'t work.Step 1: check the return code: if($content === FALSE) { // handle error here... }Step 2: suppress the warning by putting an error control operator (i.e. @) in front of the call to file_get_contents():\n$content = @file_get_contents($site);You can also set your error handler as an anonymous function that calls an Exception and use a try / catch on that exception.Seems like a lot of code to catch one little error, but if you\'re using exceptions throughout your app, you would only need to do this once, way at the top (in an included config file, for instance), and it will convert all your errors to Exceptions throughout.My favourite way to do this is fairly simple:I found this after experimenting with the try/catch from @enobrev above, but this allows for less lengthy (and IMO, more readable) code. We simply use error_get_last to get the text of the last error, and file_get_contents returns false on failure, so a simple "if" can catch that. You can prepend an @:\n$content = @file_get_contents($site);This will supress any warning - use sparingly!. See Error Control OperatorsEdit: When you remove the \'http://\' you\'re no longer looking for a web page, but a file on your disk called "www.google....."One alternative is to suppress the error and also throw an exception which you can catch later. This is especially useful if there are multiple calls to file_get_contents() in your code, since you don\'t need to suppress and handle all of them manually. Instead, several calls can be made to this function in a single try/catch block.Here\'s how I did it... No need for try-catch block... The best solution is always the simplest... Enjoy!Here\'s how I handle that:The best thing would be to set your own error and exception handlers which will do something usefull like logging it in a file or emailing critical ones.\nhttp://www.php.net/set_error_handlerYou could use this scriptSince PHP 4 use error_reporting():This will try to get the data, if it does not work, it will catch the error and allow you to do anything you need within the catch.Change the file php.iniYou should also set theallow_url_use = On in your php.ini to stop receiving warnings.You should use file_exists() function before to use file_get_contents().\nWith this way you\'ll avoid the php warning.
