I\'m using Handlebars for templating in my project. Is there a way to get the index of the current iteration of an "each" helper in Handlebars?In the newer versions of Handlebars index (or key in the case of object iteration) is provided by default with the standard each helper. snippet from : https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/250#issuecomment-9514811The index of the current array item has been available for some time now via @index:For object iteration, use @key instead:This has changed in the newer versions of Ember.For arrays:It looks like the #each block no longer works on objects. My suggestion is to roll your own helper function for it.Thanks for this tip.I know this is too late. But i solved this issue with following Code:Java Script:HTML:if you want start your index with 1 you should do following code:Javascript:HTML:Thanks.In handlebar version 3.0 onwards,In this particular example, user will have the same value as the current context and userId will have the index value for the iteration.\nRefer - http://handlebarsjs.com/block_helpers.html in block helpers sectionArrays:If you have arrays of objects... you can iterate through the children:Objects:If you have nested objects you can access the key of parent object with \n{{@../key}}
