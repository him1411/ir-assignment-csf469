I\'m very new on Android development.I want to create and start an activity to show information about a game. I show that information I need a gameId.How can I pass this game ID to the activity? The game ID is absolutely necessary so I don\'t want to create or start the activity if it doesn\'t have the ID.It\'s like the activity has got only one constructor with one parameter.How can I do that?Thanks.Put an int which is your id into the new Intent.Then grab the id in your new Activity:Just add extra data to the Intent you use to call your activity.In the caller activity :Inside the onCreate() of the activity you call :Edit : Oops, Charlie Sheen was quicker.I like to do it with a static method in the second activity:Then from your first activity (and for anywhere else), you just do:The existing answers (pass the data in the Intent passed to startActivity()) show the normal way to solve this problem. There is another solution that can be used in the odd case where you\'re creating an Activity that will be started by another app (for example, one of the edit activities in a Tasker plugin) and therefore do not control the Intent which launches the Activity.You can create a base-class Activity that has a constructor with a parameter, then a derived class that has a default constructor which calls the base-class constructor with a value, as so:If you need to generate the parameter to pass to the base-class constructor, simply replace the hard-coded value with a function call that returns the correct value to pass.
