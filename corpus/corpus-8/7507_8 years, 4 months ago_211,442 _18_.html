I\'ve read all the answers on to this questions and none of the solutions seem to work. Also, I am getting the vibe that triggering keypress with special characters does not work at all.

It\'s always safest to do the standard cross-browser checks for e.which and e.keyCode and in this case just define both.If you\'re using jQuery UI too, you can do like this:it can be also accomplished like this (docs)Ok, for me that work with this...console.log( String.fromCharCode(event.charCode) );no need to map character i guess.In case you need to take into account the current cursor and text selection...This wasn\'t working for me for an AngularJS app on Chrome. As Nadia points out in the original comments, the character is never visible in the input field (at least, that was my experience). In addition, the previous solutions don\'t take into account the current text selection in the input field. I had to use a wonderful library jquery-selection.I have a custom on-screen numeric keypad that fills in multiple input fields. I had to...On blur, save the current text selection (start and stop)When a button on the my keypad is pressed:I made it work with keyup.
