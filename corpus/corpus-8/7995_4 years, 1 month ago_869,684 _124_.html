I get the following error when trying to connect to SQL Server:Cannot connect to 108.163.224.173. A network-related or\n  instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to\n  SQL Server. The server was not found or was not accessible. Verify\n  that the instance name is correct and that SQL Server is configured to\n  allow remote connections. (provider: Named Pipes Provider, error: 40 -\n  Could not open a connection to SQL Server) (Microsoft SQL Server,\n  Error: 1326)This error is thrown when I try to configure my database to gridview in Visual Studio 2010. I\'m at a loss as to how to debug this error.How would you debug this error?  What steps should I take in order to determine what is really going on here, in addition to the one mentioned in the error message?I found the following techniques helpful:Make sure your database engine is configured to accept remote connections:You may need to create an exception on the firewall for the SQL Server instance and port you are using:Check if your SQL server services is up and running properly:In addition, ensure that your remote server is in the same network. Run sqlcmd -L to ascertain if your server is included in your network list.Enable TCP/IP in SQL Server ConfigurationWhen two or more SQL Servers are connected across network they do all communication using TCP/IP. The default port of SQL Server installation is 1433. This port can be changed through SQL Server Configuration Manager. TCP/IP should be enabled for SQL Server to be connected.You must restart SQL Server Services for all the changes to take effect. Right click and go to menu properties to select location where default port of SQL Server can be changed.I got Solution for me :Open "SQL Server Configuration Manager"Now Click on "SQL Server Network Configuration" and Click on "Protocols for Name"Right Click on "TCP/IP" (make sure it is Enabled) Click on PropertiesNow Select "IP Addresses" Tab -and- Go to the last entry "IP All"Enter "TCP Port"  1433.Now  Restart  "SQL Server .Name." using "services.msc" (winKey + r)It Will Work...I am solving that problem by opening Services then start running Sql Server (Sqlexpress) service.Adding my heavily upvoted comment as an answer with screenshots.I spent a lot of time on this, finally what worked for me is: 1) Open Sql Server Configuration Manager --> SQL Server Network configuration --> Protocols for <(INSTANCE)> --> TCP/IP (double click on it).2) Select --> IP Addresses(Tab). 3) Go to the last entry IP All and mention TCP Port 1433. 4) Press Win+R and enter services.msc.5) Now restart SQL Server <(INSTANCE)>. After this, the problem got resolved!If none of the above solutions work (nothing worked for me) then just RESTART your computer and you will be able to connect to your sql server (localhost).I had the same error when I wanted to run my WinForms project (that includes working with a SQL Server database and that worked perfectly on my PC) on another PC. The problem was in Windows Firewall on my PC. I solved this by adding two rules. This is the whole procedure how to allow SQL Server through Windows Firewall:This is the YouTube link where you can see this procedure: Allow SQL Server through Windows FirewallPress window + R (Run window Open) and in run window type "services.msc" and new services open find SQL SERVER(SQLEXPRESS) service start and try again it works for me Hope Its Works for You also.Try to add "\\SQLEXPRESS" to your server namee.g. "MY-SERVER\\SQLEXPRESS"I was experiencing the same problem and the problem was that I hade several projects in the solution (Weband Droid) and even though Default project was choosen in the Package Manager Console it used the connection string from the Droid project:After setting the Startup Project to Web and the Default Project in Package Manger Console I got it to work.I am using SQL Server 2016 and Window 10.First thing is to allow remote connection to SQL Server.\nWhat I did is to type sqlservermanager13.msc at start menu in order to open the SQL Server Configuration Manager. Make sure the TCP/IP status is enabled.\nCheck your TCP port number by double click TCP/IP protocol name. Usually it is 1433 by default.The following procedures configure the Windows Firewall by using the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in. The Windows Firewall with Advanced Security only configures the current profile. To open a port in the Windows firewall for TCP accessAnother thing to configure.To open access to SQL Server when using dynamic portsHave a look at Microsoft doucmentation\nConfigure a Windows Firewall for Database Engine AccessAfter doing everything mentioned here:\nhttp://blog.sqlauthority.com/2009/05/21/sql-server-fix-error-provider-named-pipes-provider-error-40-could-not-open-a-connection-to-sql-server-microsoft-sql-server-error/\nStill did not work for me. Steps worked for me: Start > Run > cmd > sqlcmd -LIt will prompt you the server name. Make sure this server name is same as the one you are trying to get connected to in CONNECT TO SERVER box of SQL management studio.  I made this silly mistake I keep using MSSQLSERVER rather using this server name. Hope this helps for the people who make silly mistake like me. Thanks.I have to run SQL Server Browser service into SQL Server Configuration Manager. \nInstallation can\'t discover newly created service without this.While the above solutions should work in 90% of the cases, but if you are still reading this answer!!! You are probably trying to connect to a different server than intended. It may be due to a configuration file pointing to a different SQL server than the actual server you think you are trying to connecting to.Happened to me atleast.This solution also solves both network error and the service behind sql serverI answered a similar question here, you need to stat the other open Run type-> services.msc - under services -> sort by stopped you will see a bunch of stopped SQL services Right click and startTo begin - there are 4 issues that could be causing the common LocalDb SqlExpress Sql Server connectivity errors SQL Network Interfaces, error: 50 - Local Database Runtime error occurred, before you begin you need to rename the v11 or v12 to (localdb)\\mssqllocaldbI found that the simplest is to do the below - I have attached the pics and steps for help.First verify which instance you have installed, you can do this by checking the registry and by running cmd You can test the following methods.abcIn the middle tab find the record that \'local Port\' is 1433, If you can\'t found it try to created it with following levelsThis error occurs when your sql server instance is stopped.GO to all Programs>SQL Server >Configuration tools>SQL SERVER CONFIGURATION MANAGERthen click on SQL sERVER SERVICES, list of instances will appear, select instance in question and click on play icon on top tool bar, hope this will help.this answer is very late(but better late than never;)I moved from a work laptop on Windows 7 to a work laptop on Windows 10.\nI had been successfully using SSMS2016 on Windows 7.The same issue applied using SSMS2012 or SSMS2016.\nMy access to the 10 sql servers using windows authentication was still the same.  I could test this from another server.\nHowever, 2 of the 10 servers would not connect from my laptop.\nBoth were ms sql server 9 but I could connect to other sql server 9 databases.The solution was to add a firewall rule (using Windows Firewall with Advanced Security).Create an Incoming rule for each SSMS\neg C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SQL Server\\130\\Tools\\Binn\\ManagementStudio\\Ssms.exeI\'m not a network expert so I\'ve not included the details but hopefully it will point you in the right direction.Error msg (pre firewall rule)\n"A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server.

I was using a SQL Server on an Azure VM.I eventually remembered that the VM has endpoints that are controlled by the Azure account proxy, so I went on to the Azure Portal and added 1433 as an available endpoint and I could connect to my SQL instance.Hope this helps someone who as tried all the other answers and is still having no luck!I resolved this problem by setting the project that makes use of Entity Framework as the start-up project and then run the "update-database" command.If you\'re encountering this while debugging in Visual Studio, make sure that the project build path points to a local drive, or follow these steps to grant permissions to the network folder.It seems that your instance of localdb is not running.\nTo start it on computer startup, add into your Start menu \\ Startup folder BAT file with following linewhere name_of_instance is name of localdb instance, which you want to start.\nYou can list available instances in command line using sqllocaldb i.e.g. If you\'re using SQL Server Management Studio and connecting to Server Name (localdb)\\v11.0, then your BAT file will look likeMy issue started when I tried to change the server from IIS Express to Local IIS (while using LocalDB).I was using LocalDB (for dev purposes), and when I went to revert from Local IIS to IIS Express, Visual Studio had switched my data source from Data Source=(LocalDb)\\MSSQLLocalDB to Data Source=.\\SQLEXPRESSIncorrect connection string<add name="DefaultConnection" connectionString="Data Source=.\\SQLEXPRESS;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|\\SurveyTestsDB.mdf;Initial Catalog=SurveyTestsDB;Integrated Security=True;User Instance=True"\n      providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />Correct connection string<add name="DefaultConnection" connectionString="Data Source=(LocalDb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|\\SurveyTestsDB.mdf;Initial Catalog=SurveyTestsDB;Integrated Security=True" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />Hope this helps someone out there.My issue was that you need to have a connection string entry in both your repository layer and web layer. Once I added it to my web.config as well as my app.config, Entity Framework was able to create the migration.My question is why, does the web.config need it, when there is absolutely no database access there. Along with trying everything as suggested by Teo Chuen Wei Bryan, make sure you are also referring to the correct Server/Instance name in the connection string. If you are using the short form of host name/Instance on the database server or in the web.config file, make sure you use the fully qualified domain name(FQDN)/InstanceAlso, to test connectivity from a server where SQL server client is NOT present, --> create a text file and change its file extension to .udl--> Right click the file and you can see connection tab. --> Input server name and log on information to test connection to the database server. Hope this helps.When I experienced this error in Visual Studio, \xe2\x80\x9cA network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server. The server was not found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance name is correct and that SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections. (provider: Named Pipes Provider, error: 40 - Could not open a connection to SQL Server)\xe2\x80\x9d...it was during the execution of the following C# code, which was attempting to obtain my SQL Server data to display it in a grid. The break occurred exactly on the line that says connect.Open():It was inexplicable because the SQL query was very simple, I had the right connection string, and the database server was available. I decided to run the actual SQL query manually myself in SQL Management Studio and it ran just fine and yielded several records. But one thing stood out in the query results: there was some improperly encoded HTML text inside a varchar(max) type field within the Friends table (specifically, some encoded comment symbols of the sort <!-- lodged within the "Narrative" column\'s data). The suspect data row looked like this:Notice the encoded HTML symbol "&lt;", which stood for a "<" character. Somehow that made its way into the database and my C# code could not pick it up! It failed everytime right at the connect.Open() line! After I manually edited that one row of data in the database table Friends and put in the decoded "<" character instead, everything worked! Here\'s what that row should have looked like:I edited the one bad row I had by using this simple UPDATE statement below. But if you had several offending rows of encoded HTML, you might need a more elaborate UPDATE statement that uses the REPLACE function:So, the moral of the story is (at least in my case), sanitize your HTML content before storing it in the database and you won\'t get this cryptic SQL Server error in the first place! (Uh, properly sanitizing/decoding your HTML content is the subject of another discussion worthy of a separate StackOverflow search if you need more information!)MS sql server 2014 in windows 71) go to search programm and type(Sql server 2014 configuration manager)2) then click on "Sql server Service" on left hand side tree menu 3) check your instance of sql server service status( stop or running)4) if it is stop please change the status running and log in your sql server management studio 2014
