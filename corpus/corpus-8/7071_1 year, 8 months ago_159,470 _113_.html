As I\'ve been using In the build.gradle file, I got the following error since gradle version 2.10 has been released.\nThe error is :Warning:Gradle version 2.10 is required. Current version is 2.8. If\n  using the gradle wrapper, try editing the distributionUrl in\n  C:\\Users\\blahblah\\myproject\\gradle\\wrapper\\gradle-wrapper.properties\n  to gradle-2.10-all.zipat first it looks easy to solve by the guide, but when I\'d done the change, I got the error again. I\'m using Android Studio 2.0 with the latest Android SDK Tools 24.4.1 and Android SDK Build Tools 23.0.2I\'ve even tried to download Gradle 2.10 and put it manually on android-studio\\gradle\\ folder, but no luck.Any help would be appreciated.You need to change File > Settings > Builds,Execution,Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle >Gradle home pathOn Mac OS, change the path in Android Studio > Preferences > Builds,Execution,Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle >Gradle homeOr set Use default gradle wrapper and edit Project\\gradle\\wrapper\\gradle-wrapper.properties files field distributionUrl  like thisOpen Preference and search for Gradle or Navigate to Builds, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle Then change Project-Level setting to Use default gradle wrapper (recommended) Or keep local gradle distribution option and set Gradle home to /.../gradle-2.10Make Sure that Gradle version is already setup to 2.10 in Module SettingsOn the Project Window, right click on your project then select Open Module Settings (\xe2\x8c\x98+\xe2\x86\x93)UpdateGradle Version: 3.3\nAndroid Plugin version: 2.3.1An easier way to accomplish this is to go to:\nOpen Module Settings (your project) > Project > Gradle version and enter 2.10Download the latest gradle-3.0-all.zip fromhttp://gradle.org/gradle-download/download from Complete Distribution linkopen in android studio file ->settings ->gradleopen the path and paste the downloaded zip folder gradle-3.0 in that folderchange your gradle 2.8 to gradle 3.0 in file ->settings ->gradleOr you can change your gradle wrapper in the projectedit YourProject\\gradle\\wrapper\\gradle-wrapper.properties file and edit the  field distributionUrl in todistributionUrl=   https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-3.0-all.zipFor people who are using Ionic/Cordova framework, we need to change the distributionUrl in GradleBuilder.js file to var distributionUrl = process.env[\'CORDOVA_ANDROID_GRADLE_DISTRIBUTION_URL\'] || \'http\\\\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.10-all.zip\';The GradleBuilder.js locates at project/platforms/android/cordova/lib/builders/GradleBuilder.jsFirst Check your  Project-level settings at File > Settings > Build, Executions, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradleand Select the Option :then go to Project\'s Gradle > wrapper > gradle-wrapper.properties and edit version of the distributionUrldistributionUrl=https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.10-all.zipAnd you are done :)For Android studio v2.1Follow these easy steps from images.Go "File" and click "Project structure".Then select "Project" from left menu and then change "Gradle version" to the version your sdk manager has installed. In my case it is 2.10 so i change version to 2.10 and then click on "Ok". And then android studio automatically do gradle sync again and error was fixed.Easiest way for me to fix this issue:The Android build system uses the Android Plugin for Gradle to support building Android applications with the Gradle build toolkit. The plugin runs independent of Android Studio so the plugin and the Gradle build system can be updated independently of Android Studio.Use gradle wrapper (recommended) - select this option to use Gradle\n  wrapper. Using Gradle wrapper lets you get automatic Gradle download\n  for the build. It also lets you build with the precise Gradle version.Newer versions of the Gradle plugin may require newer versions of\n  Studio to enable the new features in the IDE, but the project should\n  open in older versions of Studio, and build from there (since Gradle\n  does the build). We will be very careful about this.You can useI encountered the same issue before.In the end, the problem is that you use terminal; it uses system config.check it, whether you have set Hope it helpsGo to File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Gradle -> choose Use default gradle wrapperfor me all previous solutions failed, so i just editedtoIf the problem persist, add the following code in the build.gradle of the top project.For those who uses ionic, go to [project name]/platforms/android/cordova/lib/builders/GradleBuilder.js on line 164 you will see the following: var distributionUrl = process.env[\'CORDOVA_ANDROID_GRADLE_DISTRIBUTION_URL\'] || \'http\\\\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.13-all.zip\';This line is used to create your gradle-wrapper.properties, so any changes to the gradle-wrapper.properties wont matter. All you need to do is change the url to the latest version, sync the gradle and the problem is solved.Just want to change the gradle version in the Android studio, go to File>settings>project and change the gradle version. After you apply, it will sync the project and you are ready to build. If you are getting this when you run:\n gradle build\n from command line you have to use:\n gradlew build\n instead so that you will use gradle wrapper to downloaded the appropriate  gradle version needed by the app. When you execute gradle build you are using the global gradle installed on your system.My problem maybe is different,so I just wanna tell somebody who may have the same problem as me.I solved this problem by change Terminal path.\nwhen I run gradle clean, the error come cross "Gradle version 2.10 is required. Current version is 2.2.1".I checked .gradle directory in my project, there are two versions in it: 2.2.1, 2.10.when I run gradle -v, it shows my current version is 2.2.1.\nI change my system environment GRADLE_HOME to 2.10 root directory, then I restart terminal in AS and run \'gradle -v\', it still shows the current verision is 2.2.1.open setting -> terminal change the cmd.exe path to the System32/cmd.exe.\nthen restart terminal, run gradle clean,everything is fine.You need to change Prefrences > Builds,Execution,Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle >Gradle home pathOr set Use default gradle wrapper and edit Project\\gradle\\wrapper\\gradle-wrapper.properties files field distributionUrl like thisdistributionUrl=https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.10-all.zipI had Android Studio version 1.5.1 installed and was running into this error. I have the following buildscript (which was working on Ubuntu but not Windows):I tried:None of these solutions worked unfortunately. It should be worth noting that upgrading Android Studio from 1.5.1 to 2.1.1 also failed with errors about 2.10 missing so could not be performed.Solution: What I ended up doing was simply downloaded the latest stable version of Android Studio and installing that instead (2.1.1 at the time).  After doing that gradle synced succesfullyI had the same problem and no answer in stackoverflow helped. But I found the issue in my project. It was because my .gitignore file contained these lines:and that is why git did not upload the MyProject\\gradle\\wrapper\\gradle-wrapper.jar file to remote. So, I added this line to .gitignore:Make sure you had this line too. At least this solved my problemIn Terminal type gradlew clean. it will automatically download and install gradle version 2.10(ie latest gradle verson available)Eg : C:\\android\\workspace\\projectname>gradlew cleanWhat worked for me on Mint 17.03 which is base off Ubuntu 14.04sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cwchien/gradle\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gradleReopen Android Studio. Go to Run/Debug Configuration and there should be  an icon saying you need to Update gradle. Just click it.this work for me.create a new project in android studio. Open project setting and copy the local gradle path. now open the project having gradle problem and paste that url and select local path.click apply problem will get solved.Some cases it does not work-out because there is no problem in your project gradle or android-studio.Step 1: Minimum supported Gradle version is 2.14.1. Current version is 2.11. If using the gradle wrapper, try editing the distributionUrl Step 2Go to android-studio-> Preference-> Build,Execution,Deployment-> Gradle Use default gradle wrapper and un-mark offline workStep 3Check distributionUrl in gradle-wrapper.properties Upgrade if older version.Clean ProjectI had to upgrade my version of Cordova to support the latest version of Gradle.  Updating the distributionUrl in GradleBuilder.js didn\'t work for me.if your has this error that "supported Gradle version is 2.14.1. Current version is 2.4. ", on terminal. means your should update your gradle.On Mac OS: you can use brew upgrade gradleIn my case the problem was indeed in the distributionURL in gradle-wrapper.properties file and Android Studio auto-fixed insertingdistributionUrl=https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-4.0-20170417000025+0000-all.zipBut this was a wrong URL. The correct one isdistributionUrl=https://services.gradle.org/distributions-snapshots/gradle-4.0-20170417000025+0000-all.zipApparently the url changed in gradle\'s API but not in Android Studio so fixing it by hand solved the problem for me.Latest gradle Download the latest gradle-3.3-all.zip fromhttp://gradle.org/gradle-download/1.download from Complete Distribution link2.open in android studio file ->settings ->gradle3.open the path and paste the downloaded zip folder gradle-3.3 in that folder4.change your gradle 2.8 to gradle 3.3 in file ->settings ->gradle5.Or you can change your gradle wrapper in the project6.edit YourProject\\gradle\\wrapper\\gradle-wrapper.properties file and edit the field distributionUrl in todistributionUrl=\n  https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-3.0-all.zipshown in android studio\'s gradle filesFile - setting - Build Execution Deployment - Gradle - Select \'Use default gradle wrapper(recommended)\'
