The HTML elements del, strike, or s may all be used for a text strike-through effect. Examples:....gives: del....gives: strike and strikeThe CSS text-decoration property with a value line-through may be used similarly. The code......will also render to look like: text-decoration:line-through However, the strikethrough line is typically the same color as the text. Can CSS be used to make the line a different color?Yes, by adding an extra wrapping element. Assign the desired line-through color to an outer element, then the desired text color to the inner element. For example:...or...(Note, however, that <strike> is considered deprecated in HTML4 and obsolete in HTML5 (see also W3.org). The recommended approach is to use <del> if a true meaning of deletion is intended, or otherwise to use an <s> element or style with text-decoration CSS as in the first example here.)To make the strikethrough appear for a:hover, an explicit stylesheet (declared or referenced in <HEAD>) must be used. (The :hover pseudo-class can\'t be applied with inline STYLE attributes.) For example:As of Feb. 2016, CSS 3 has the support mentioned below. Here is a snippet from a WooCommerce\'s single product page with price discountResulting in:\nCSS 3 will likely have direct support using the text-decoration-color property. In particular:The text-decoration-color CSS property sets the color used when drawing underlines, overlines, or strike-throughs specified by text-decoration-line. This is the preferred way to color these text decorations, rather than using combinations of other HTML elements.Also see text-decoration-color in the CSS 3 draft spec.If you want to use this method immediately, you probably have to prefix it, using -moz-text-decoration-color. (Also specify it without -moz-, for forward-compatibility.)I\'ve used an empty :after element and decorated one border on it. You can even use CSS transforms to rotate it for a slanted line. Result: pure CSS, no extra HTML elements! Downside: doesn\'t wrap across multiple lines, although IMO you shouldn\'t use strikethrough on large blocks of text anyway.Adding to @gojomo you could use :after pseudo element for the additional element. The only caveat is that you\'ll need to define your innerText in a data-text attribute since CSS has limited content functions. CSS HTMLHere\'s an approach which uses a gradient to fake the line. It works with multiline strikes and doesn\'t need additional DOM elements. But as it\'s a background gradient, it\'s behind the text...See fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/YSvaY/Gradient color-stops and background size depend on line-height. (I used LESS for calculation and Autoprefixer afterwards...)Blazemonger\'s reply (above or below) needs voting up - but I don\'t have enough points.I wanted to add a grey bar across some 20px wide CSS round buttons to indicate "not available" and tweaked Blazemonger\'s css:In my experience theisn\'t the best option. I had a co worker use this method without testing cross browser, so I had to go back and fix it because it caused issues in firefox. My personal recommendation would be to use the :after selector to create a strikethrough. That way it can go back to IE8 if you really wanted to without any style conflicts as well as solid across all other browsers. It also creates less markup and about the same amount of styling which in my opinion is a pretty big deal.So if anyone else runs into similar issues hopefully this can help out:obviously you could use transform: translate instead of margins, but this example is to work back to IE8Assigning the desired line-through color to a parent element works for the deleted text element (<del>) as well - making the assumption the client renders <del> as a line-through.http://jsfiddle.net/kpowz/vn9RC/Here you go:Here you go:you don\'t need complicated codes. See the simple example below:Here is a sample jQuery implementation â€“ thanks to gojomo\'s answer and utype\'s suggestion (+1 for both)The CSS for that could be
