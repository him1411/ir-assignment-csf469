I was accidentally working on a branch I shouldn\'t have been for a while, so I branched off of it giving it the appropriate name.  Now I want to overwrite the branch I shouldn\'t have been on to the version from origin (github).  Is there an easy way to do this?  I tried deleting the branch and then resetting up the tracking branch, but it just gives me the version I was working on again.If you don\'t have pushed yet to origin, you can reset your branch to the upstream branch with:(Make sure that you reference your latest commit in a separate branch, like you mention in your question)Note that, just after the reset, mybranch@{1} refers to the old commit, before reset.But if you had already pushed, see "Create git branch, and revert original to upstream state" for other options.As commented by Brad Herman, a reset --hard would remove any new file or reset modified file to HEAD.  Actually, to be sure you start from a "clean slate", a git clean -f -d after the reset would ensure a working tree exactly identical to the branch you just reset to.This blog post suggests those aliases (for master branch only, but you can adapt/extend those):Then you can type:orAssuming this is what happened:Then you realise you make changes on the wrong branch.But master still points to your commit. You want it to point where it pointed before.The easiest way is:Another way is:Note that using reset --hard will cause your uncommitted changes to be lost (tests.py in my example).I have a private repo on a server and regularly rebase/force-push to it, which makes it necessary to reset the local branch on my other computer often. I therefore created the following alias "catchup", which allows doing this for the current branch. Unlike the other answer there is no hardcoded branch name in this alias.Hold on tight.Properly formatted (won\'t work with the newlines in .gitconfig) it looks like this:Since reset is a potentially dangerous call (especially with the --hard option, you will lose any uncommitted changes), it first tells you what it\'s about to do. For example if you\'re on branch dev-container with remote called qcpp/dev-container and you enter git catchup, you\'ll be prompted: reset dev-container to qcpp/dev-container? (Y/n)If you then type y or just hit return, it will perform the reset. If you enter anything else the reset will not be carried out.If you want to be super safe and programmatically prevent losing unstaged/uncommitted changes, you can pimp the above alias further with according checks for diff-index.The obligatory word of warning: If you are working on a public repository other people have based work on, and you need this alias, you are doing it wrong\xe2\x84\xa2.
