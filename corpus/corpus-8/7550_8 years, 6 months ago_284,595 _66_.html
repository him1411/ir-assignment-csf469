What are the good email address validation libraries for Java?  Are there any alternatives to commons validator?Apache Commons is generally known as a solid project.  Keep in mind, though, you\'ll still have to send a verification email to the address if you want to ensure it\'s a real email, and that the owner wants it used on your site.EDIT: There was a bug where it was too restrictive on domain, causing it to not accept valid emails from new TLDs.This bug was resolved on 03/Jan/15 02:48 in commons-validator version 1.4.1Using the official java email package is the easiest: Apache Commons validator can be used as mentioned in the other answers.pom.xml:build.gradle:The import:The code:and to allow local addressesLate answer, but I think it is simple and worthy:Test Cases:For production purpose, Domain Name validations should be performed network-wise.If you are trying to do a form validation received from the client, or just a bean validation - keep it simple.\nIt\'s better to do a loose email validation rather than to do a strict one and reject some people, (e.g. when they are trying to register for your web service).\nWith almost anything allowed in the username part of the email and so many new domains being added literally every month (e.g. .company, .entreprise, .estate), it\'s safer not to be restrictive:I\'m just wondering why nobody came up with @Email from Hibernate Validator\'s additional constraints. The validator itself is EmailValidator.Les Hazlewood has written a very thorough RFC 2822 compliant email validator class using Java regular expressions. You can find it at http://www.leshazlewood.com/?p=23. However, its thoroughness (or the Java RE implementation) leads to inefficiency - read the comments about parsing times for long addresses.Late to the question, here, but: I maintain a class at this address: http://lacinato.com/cm/software/emailrelated/emailaddressIt is based on Les Hazlewood\'s class, but has numerous improvements and fixes a few bugs. Apache license.I believe it is the most capable email parser in Java, and I have yet to see one more capable in any language, though there may be one out there. It\'s not a lexer-style parser, but uses some complicated java regex, and thus is not as efficient as it could be, but my company has parsed well over 10 billion real-world addresses with it: it\'s certainly usable in a high-performance situation. Maybe once a year it\'ll hit an address that causes a regex stack overflow (appropriately), but these are spam addresses which are hundreds or thousands of characters long with many many quotes and parenthesis and the like.RFC 2822 and the related specs are really quite permissive in terms of email addresses, so a class like this is overkill for most uses. For example, the following is a legitimate address, according to spec, spaces and all:No mail server would allow that, but this class can parse it (and rewrite it to a usable form).We found the existing Java email parser options to be insufficiently durable (meaning, all of them could not parse some valid addresses), so we created this class.The code is well-documented and has a lot of easy-to-change options to allow or disallow certain email forms. It also provides a lot of methods to access certain parts of the address (left-hand side, right-hand side, personal names, comments, etc), to parse/validate mailbox-list headers, to parse/validate the return-path (which is unique among the headers), and so forth.The code as written has a javamail dependency, but it\'s easy to remove if you don\'t want the minor functionality it provides.I ported some of the code in Zend_Validator_Email:With a hostname validator as follows:And a validIDNs.xml with regex patterns for the different tlds (too big to include:)What do you want to validate? The email address?The email address can only be checked for its format conformance. See the standard: RFC2822. Best way to do that is a regular expression. You will never know if really exists without sending an email.I checked the commons validator. It contains an org.apache.commons.validator.EmailValidator class. Seems to be a good starting point.Current Apache Commons Validator version is 1.3.1.Class that validates is org.apache.commons.validator.EmailValidator. It has an import for org.apache.oro.text.perl.Perl5Util which is from a retired Jakarta ORO project.BTW, I found that there is a 1.4 version, here are the API docs. On the site it says: "Last Published: 05 March 2008  | Version: 1.4-SNAPSHOT", but that\'s not final. Only way to build yourself (but this is a snapshot, not RELEASE) and use, or download from here. This means 1.4 has not been made final for three years (2008-2011). This is not in Apache\'s style.\nI\'m looking for a better option, but didn\'t find one that is very adopted. I want to use something that is well tested, don\'t want to hit any bugs.If you\'re looking to verify whether an email address is valid, then VRFY will get you some of the way. I\'ve found it\'s useful for validating intranet addresses (that is, email addresses for internal sites). However it\'s less useful for internet mail servers (see the caveats at the top of this page)You may also want to check for the length - emails are a maximum of 254 chars long. I use the apache commons validator and it doesn\'t check for this.This is the best method:Sources:-\nhttp://howtodoinjava.com/2014/11/11/java-regex-validate-email-address/http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322.txtThere don\'t seem to be any perfect libraries or ways to do this yourself, unless you have to time to send an email to the email address and wait for a response (this might not be an option though). I ended up using a suggestion from here  http://blog.logichigh.com/2010/09/02/validating-an-e-mail-address/    and adjusting the code so it would work in Java.Heres my pragmatic approach, where I just want reasonable distinct blah@domain addresses using the allowable characters from the RFC. Addresses must be converted to lowercase beforehand.|*| Simple Check if email is valid :This is the simplest way to do it, without any regular expressions or Object-Armageddon.
