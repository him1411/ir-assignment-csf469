I\'m calling a REST API and am receiving an XML response back. It returns a list of a workspace names, and I\'m writing a quick IsExistingWorkspace() method. Since all workspaces consist of contiguous characters with no whitespace, I\'m assuming the easiest way to find out if a particular workspace is in the list is to remove all whitespace (including newlines) and doing this (XML is the string received from the web request):I know it\'s case-sensitive, and I\'m relying on that. I just need a way to remove all whitespace in a string efficiently. I know RegEx and LINQ can do it, but I\'m open to other ideas. I am mostly just concerned about speed.This is fastest way I know of, even though you said you didn\'t want to use regular expressions:I have an alternative way without regexp, and it seems to perform pretty good. It is a continuation on Brandon Moretz answer:I tested it in a simple unit test:For 1,000,000 attempts the first option (without regexp) runs in less then a second (700Â ms on my machine), and the second takes 3.5 seconds.Try the replace method of the string in C#.My solution is to use Split and Join and it is surprisingly fast, in fact the fastest of the top answers here.Timings for 10,000 loop on simple string with whitespace inc new lines and tabsImprove this by wrapping it up in method to give it meaning, and also make it an extension method while we are at it ...Just an alternative because it looks quite nice :) - NOTE: Henks answer is the quickest of these.Testing 1,000,000 loops on "This is a simple Test"This method = 1.74 seconds\nRegex = 2.58 seconds\nnew String (Henks) = 0.82Building on Henks answer I have created some test methods with his answer and some added, more optimized, methods. I found the results differ based on the size of the input string. Therefore, I have tested with two result sets. In the fastest method, the linked source has a even faster way. But, since it is characterized as unsafe I have left this out.Long input string results:Short input string results:Code:Tests:If you need superb performance, you should avoid LINQ and regular expressions in this case. I did some performance benchmarking, and it seems that if you want to strip white space from beginning and end of the string, string.Trim() is your ultimate function.If you need to strip all white spaces from a string, the following method works fastest of all that has been posted here:I found a nice write-up on this on CodeProject by Felipe Machado (with help by Richard Robertson)He tested ten different methods. This one is the fastest unsafe version...And the fastest safe version...There are also some nice independent benchmarks on Stack Overflow by Stian Standahl that also show how Felipe\'s function is about 300% faster than the next fastest function.Regex is overkill; just use extension on string (thanks Henk). This is trivial and should have been part of the framework. Anyhow, here\'s my implementation:Here is a simple linear alternative to the RegEx solution. I am not sure which is faster; you\'d have to benchmark it.I assume your XML response looks like this:The best way to process XML is to use an XML parser, such as LINQ to XML:I needed to replace white space in a string with spaces, but not duplicate spaces. e.g., I needed to convert something like the following:toI used the following methodI have found different results to be true. I am trying to replace all whitespace with a single space and the regex was extremely slow.What worked the most optimally for me (in C++ cli) was:I tried the above routine first by replacing each character separately, but had to switch to doing substrings for the non-space sections. When applying to a 1,200,000 character string:Here is yet another variant:As with most of the other solutions, I haven\'t performed exhaustive benchmark tests, but this works well enough for my purposes.We can use:Say we have this string: string MyString = " test test    test".\nYou can split your string with one space delimiter: MyString.Split(\' \'). \nIt results in array of empty strings and other charters. \nIn this case it generates this array: { "", "test", "test", "", "", "", "test" }.\nThen using string.concat method you can Concatenate all strings in array which results in "testtesttest".We can use System.Linq and we can do it in one line:This block of code removes all the spaces from the string.
