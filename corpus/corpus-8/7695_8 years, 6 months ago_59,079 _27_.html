I am trying to replace a character - say ; - with a new line using replace-string and/or replace-regexp in Emacs.I have tried the following commands:  M-x replace-string RET ; RET \\n This will replace ; with 2 characters: \\n.M-x replace-regex RET ; RET \\nThis results in the following error (shown in the minibuffer):Invalid use of `\\\' in replacement text. What\'s wrong with using replace-string for this task? Is there any other way to do it?Thanks. M-x replace-string RET ; RET C-q C-j.C-q for quoted-insert,C-j is a newline.Cheers!There are four ways I\'ve found to put a newline into the minibuffer.C-oC-q C-jC-q 12 (12 is the octal value of newline)C-x o to the main window, kill a newline with C-k, then C-x o back to the minibuffer, yank it with C-yDon\'t forget that you can always cut and paste into the minibuffer.So you can just copy a newline character (or any string) from your buffer, then yank it when prompted for the replacement text.More explicitly:To replace the semi colon character (;) with a newline, follow these exact steps.Bit more to it than the original explanation says.Switch to text-mode Highlight block to indent Indent Switch back to whatever mode..
