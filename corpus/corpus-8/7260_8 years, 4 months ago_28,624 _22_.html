Does the method get called with a null value or does it give a null reference exception?If this is the case I will never need to check my \'this\' parameter for null?That will work fine (no exception). Extension methods don\'t use virtual calls (i.e. it uses the "call" il instruction, not "callvirt") so there is no null check unless you write it yourself in the extension method. This is actually useful in a few cases:etcFundamentally, calls to static calls are very literal - i.e.becomes:where there is obviously no null check.Addition to the correct answer from Marc Gravell.You could get a warning from the compiler if it is obvious that the this argument is null:Works well at runtime, but produces the warning "Expression will always cause a System.NullReferenceException, because the default value of string is null".As you\'ve already discovered, since extension methods are simply glorified static methods, they will be called with null references passed in, without a NullReferenceException being thrown. But, since they look like instance methods to the caller, they should also behave as such. You should then, most of the time, check the this parameter and throw an exception if it\'s null. It\'s OK not to do this if the method explicitly takes care of null values and its name indicates it duly, like in the examples below:I\'ve also written a blog post about this some time ago.A null will be passed to the extension method.If the method tries to access the object without checking is it null, then yes, it will throw an exception. A guy here wrote "IsNull" and "IsNotNull" extension methods that check is the reference passed null or not. Personally I think this is an aberration and shouldn\'t have seen light of day, but it\'s perfectly valid c#.As others pointed out, calling an extension method on null reference causes the this argument to be null and nothing else special will happen. This gives raise to an idea to use extension methods to write guard clauses.You may read this article for examples: How to Reduce Cyclomatic Complexity: Guard Clause Short version is this:This is the string class extension method which can be called on null reference:The call works fine only because runtime will successfully call the extension method on null reference. Then you can use this extension method to implement guard clauses without messy syntax:The extensionmethod is static, so if you don\'t to anything to the this MyObject it shouldn\'t be a problem, a quick test should verify it :)There are few golden rules when you want in your to be readable and vertical.In your case\n- DesignByContract is broken ... you are going to perform some logic on a null instance.
