I had a Macintosh I used to develop iPhone apps with using XCode 4.\nI now have a new Macintosh with a new install of... everything.When opening Xcode projects built on the old Mac, I cannot run the app on the iPhone that was configured as a development iPhone.\nXcode 4 organizer tells me "Valid signing identity not found" on my provisioning profiles.I guess this is something to do with the .certSigningRequest file I had generated before on the old Mac (I have a backup of that file), but what do I have to do with it on the new Mac?Another strange thing, I don\'t see my 5 existing provisioning profiles (defined on Apple provisioning portal) in the organizer, even after a refresh and after having entered my provisioning portal login and password :With Xcode 4.2 and later versions, including XCode 4.6, there is a better way to migrate your entire developer profile to a new machine.  On your existing machine, launch Xcode and do this:Edit for Xcode 4.4:With Xcode 4.4, at step 3 choose Provisioning Profiles under LIBRARY.  Then select your provisioning profiles either with the mouse or Command-A.Also, Apple is making improvements in the way they manage this aspect of Xcode, and some users have reported that the Refresh button in the lower-right corner does the trick.  So try clicking Refresh first, and if that doesn\'t help, do the export/import sequence.Picture for XCode 4.6 added by WPEdit for XCode 5.0 or newer:On your new machine, launch Xcode and import the profile you exported above.  Works like a charm.Picture for XCode 5.0 added by AnkurI just run into the similar issue today. Unfortunately my HD died on me so I couldn\'t do the migration mentioned here in the accepted answer. I had to do the following steps:The same action is also mentioned on this post.Make sure your certificate is in the "login" keychain. Highlight the login keychain if you don\'t see it, search for it. Then drag the cert over the words "login". Close and Open XCode, ta-da.You need to copy over the private key and certificate from your old Mac. Open Keychain Access on the old Mac and look in the Keys category of the login keychain: the key should be there. You need to export both the public and private key, then copy yourkey.pem and yourkey.p12 to the new Mac.Importing them using Keychain Access will probably fail, at least under 10.6; you can use these commands instead:For the errorValid signing identity not foundsee Apple\'s published steps to resolve this problem.Regarding the issue of your "5 existing provisioning profiles" on the iOS Portal which are missing from your local library in Xcode 4.x Organizer > Devices tab > Provisioning Profile section under Library.I recommend following the steps that walks you through restoring missing profiles and also covers the case of an Xcode bug in which Xcode 4.1-4.2.1 mistakenly deletes from your local library profiles which are "Active" on the iOS Portal. You will have to go to your developer site, go to your certificates, and generate a new one for your current MAC and add it to your keychain.And then you will need to add the Provisioning Profile again. It should work now. Basically you need to perform the same steps you did when you first got your Dev Certificate.I had the same error but the issue was slightly different. \nWe have a team of developers but we all use the same Apple ID (Developer Account), so when I generated the Provisioning profile, I kept getting the same error as in the subject question. Then although I had downloaded the certificate (that gets prompted as part of the Development Provisioning Assistant steps), I was still getting that error. Then I found the issue was that our Apple Developer account was using a Certificate that was generated on my work mate machine, so I needed to revoke it, and generate a new certificate, then create the provisioning profile. The Summary, the lesson learned is that the certificate that is used for your provisioning profile must be generated on the same computer where the provisioning profile will be used. This is especially important to consider when you have a team of developers sharing the same Apple ID.\nHope it helps somebodyMy 2 cents on this error, even if not related to an export/import scenario:when adding the mobile provisioning certificate (i.e. the PROV file), DO NOT drag the file from Finder to Keychain Access. Instead, just double click the PROV file within Finder, while keeping the Keychain Access application running somewhere.I\'ve actually seen my former provisioning item in Keychain (the one with yellow light) being substituted with a new, green one with same name and app ID. HTHI faced this problem this morning when I just opened an old app with a different certificate and allowed its access to the keychain. My other app that was working pretty well, stopped working with this error. I\'ve been pulling out my hair till now, when I simply did this:Xcode Menu > Preferences > Accounts > THE_APPLE_ID_THAT_YOU_ARE_USING > View DetailsIn the new window, at the bottom left of the Signing identities press the + button and select iOS Development. It\'ll re-add the identity, and after that my problem is fixed now and the app is running on the device again.My MAC OS Crashed recently. I reinstalled Mac 10.7.4 and XCode 4.5. But all provisioning profiles were showing the following message in organizer.I struggled to find help for a couple of days. Later I realized that if you have migrated from one system to another(or formatted your system), you need to export your private key from your keychain from your old system to the new system (or new OS installed).One can also export your developer profile/team developer profile in organizer.Hope it helps.I had the same thing happen to me as Tiguero (thank you for your answer, it gave me hope), but here is a way to get rid of the valid signing identity not found error without having to delete all your provisioning profiles. If you are on a new system and cannot retrieve your keys from another system, you do indeed have to delete and regenerate new Development and Distribution certificates for Xcode. You can do this via Xcode, or the old-fashioned way using Keychain Access.Then what you can do is go into Provisioning, and in each tab, Development, and Distribution, click Edit next to the profile you want to update, and then Modify. You will see a list of certificates, and you must check off the box next to the one you just made, then Submit.Once you do this, go into your Xcode (I\'m using 4.3.3) \nOrganizer > Devices > Library > Provisioning Profiles where you are getting the error message, and click Refresh. Once you answer the prompt to enter your developer login, Organizer will re-download the profiles, and the error message should go away. I solved the "Valid signing identity not found" error with more or less:It seems that you can transfer your Certificates and Provisioning profiles from one machine to the other, so if you are having issues in setting up your certificate and/or profiles because you migrated your Dev machine, have a look at this:how to transfer xcode certificates between macsThe trick for me was discovering that even though I could see the developer cert under login, it was not under My Certificates. The fix was to export the cert from the keychain on the old mac, then import it into My Certificates/login on the new mac.No one has mentioned this yet, and this may not be a common problem, but I had a similar problem with Xcode 5: Make sure you have a default keychain selected in the Mac\'s Keychain Access. I trying out a fresh install of Mountain Lion and deleted one keychain, which happened to be the default. After setting another keychain as the default (right-click on the keychain and select Make Keychain "Keychain_name" default"), Xcode was able to set up the valid signing identities.I had this problem because the iOS Development Certificate associated with the provisioning profile was not in my keychain. I had reinstalled OSX and this was the result. I did the following:If you don\'t have a valid cert, generate a new one and make a new provisioning profile with it.
