This question already has an answer here:I saw this in someone\'s code:where img_index is a running index and num_images is 3.When I mess around with // in IPython, it seems to act just like a division sign (i.e. one forward slash).  I was just wondering if there is any reason for having double forward slashes?In Python 3, they made the / operator do a floating-point division, and added the // operator to do integer division (i.e. quotient without remainder); whereas in Python 2, the / operator was simply integer division, unless one of the operands was already a floating point number.In Python 2.X:In Python 3:For further reference, see PEP238.// is unconditionally "flooring division", e.g:As you see, even though both operands are floats, // still floors -- so you always know securely what it\'s gonna do.Single / may or may not floor depending on Python release, future imports, and even flags on which Python\'s run, e.g....:As you see, single / may floor, or it may return a float, based on completely non-local issues, up to and including the value of the -Q flag...;-).So, if and when you know you want flooring, always use //, which guarantees it. If and when you know you don\'t want flooring, slap a float() around other operand and use /.  Any other combination, and you\'re at the mercy of version, imports, and flags!-)To complement Alex\'s response, I would add that starting from Python 2.2.0a2, from __future__ import division is a convenient alternative to using lots of float(\xe2\x80\xa6)/\xe2\x80\xa6.  All divisions  perform float divisions, except those with //.  This works with all versions from 2.2.0a2 on.To complement these other answers, the // operator also offers significant (3x) performance benefits over /, presuming you want integer division.// can be considered an alias to math.floor() for divisions with return value of type float. It operates as no-op for divisions with return value of type int.
