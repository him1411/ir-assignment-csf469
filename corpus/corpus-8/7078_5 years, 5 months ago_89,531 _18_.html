I\'m using Twitter bootstrap tooltips with javascript like the following:My markup looks like this:This works fine, but I add <a> elements dynamically and the tooltips aren\'t showing up for those dynamic elements.  I know it\'s because I only bind .tooltip() once when the document is finished loaded with the typical jquery $(document).ready(function() functionality.How can I bind this to dynamically created elements?  Usually I would do this via the jquery live() method.  However, what is the event that I use to bind?  I\'m just not sure how to hook up the bootstrap .tooltip() with jquery .live().I\'ve found one way to make this work is something like this:This works, but seems kind of hackish.  I\'m also calling the exact same .tooltip() line in the $(ready) call.  So, do the elements that exist when the page first loads and match that selector end up with the tooltip twice?I don\'t see any problems with this approach.  I\'m just looking for a best practice or understanding of the behavior.Try this one: If you have multiple tooltip configurations that you want to initialise, this works well for me. You can then set the property on individual elements using data attributes.For me, only catching the mouseenter event was a bit buggy, and the tooltip was not showing/hiding properly. \nI had to write this, and it is now working perfectly:I\'ve posted longer answer here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/20877657/207661TL;DR: You need only one line of code that runs in document ready event:Other more complicated code suggested in other answers don\'t seem necessary (I\'ve tested this with Bootstrap 3.0). For me, this js reproduces the same problem that happens with PaolaMy solution:I found a combination of these answers gave me the best outcome - allowing me to still position the tooltip and attach it to the relevant container:Relevant HTML:
