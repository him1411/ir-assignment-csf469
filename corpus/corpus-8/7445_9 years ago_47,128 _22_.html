From question How to replace a character for a newline in Vim?. You have to use \\r when replacing text for a newline, like thisBut when replacing end of lines and newlines for a character, you can do it like:What section of the manual documents these behaviors, and what\'s the reasoning behind them?From vim docs on patterns:\\r  matches <CR>\\n  matches an end-of-line - \n    When matching in a string instead of\n  buffer text a literal newline\n    character is matched.From http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Search_and_replace :When Searching...\\n is newline, \\r is CR (carriage return = Ctrl-M = ^M)When Replacing...\\r is newline, \\n is a null byte (0x00).Another aspect to this is that \\0, which is traditionally NULL, is taken in\ns//\\0/ to mean "the whole matched pattern". (Which, by the way, is redundant with, and longer than, &).\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x98\x88<Nul> characters in the file are stored as <NL> in memory. In the display\n  they are shown as "^@".  The translation is done when reading and writing\n  files.  To match a <Nul> with a search pattern you can just enter CTRL-@ or\n  "CTRL-V 000".  This is probably just what you expect.  Internally the\n  character is replaced with a <NL> in the search pattern.  What is unusual is\n  that typing CTRL-V CTRL-J also inserts a <NL>, thus also searches for a <Nul>\n  in the file.  {Vi cannot handle <Nul> characters in the file at all}First of all, open :h :s to see the section "4.2 Substitute" of documentation on "Change". Here\'s what the command accepts:Notice the description about pattern and stringFor the {pattern} see |pattern|. \n  {string} can be a literal string, or something \n  special; see |sub-replace-special|.So now you know that the search pattern and replacement patterns follow different rules.\nIf you follow the link to |pattern|, it takes you to the section that explains the whole regexp patterns used in Vim.Meanwhile, |sub-replace-special| takes you to the subsection of "4.2 Substitute", which contains the patterns for substitution, among which is \\r for line break/split.(The shortcut to this part of manual is :h :s%)
