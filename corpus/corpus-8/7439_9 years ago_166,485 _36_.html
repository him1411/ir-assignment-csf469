Given a Python object of any kind, is there an easy way to get the list of all methods that this object has?Or,if this is not possible, is there at least an easy way to check if it has a particular method other than simply checking if an error occurs when the method is called?It appears you can use this code, replacing \'object\' with the object you\'re interested in:-I discovered it at this site, hopefully that should provide some further detail!You can use the built in dir() function to get a list of all the attributes a module has.  Try this at the command line to see how it works.Also, you can use the hasattr(module_name, "attr_name") function to find out if a module has a specific attribute.See the Guide to Python introspection for more information.The simplest method is to use dir(objectname). It will display all the methods available for that object. Cool trick.To check if it has a particular method:On top of the more direct answers, I\'d be remiss if I didn\'t mention iPython.\nHit \'tab\' to see the available methods, with autocompletion.And once you\'ve found a method, try:to see the pydocs, method signature, etc.Ahh... REPL.I believe that what you want is something like this: a list of attributes/methods of an object IMHO, dir() built-in can do this job for you.As I was checking your issue, I decided to make a script in order to better format and demonstrate the output of dir(). Here goes:list_objects_methods.pyHope that I have contributed :). Regards!If you specifically want methods, you should use inspect.ismethod.For method names:For the methods themselves:Sometimes inspect.isroutine can be useful too (for built-ins, C extensions, Cython without the "binding" compiler directive).The problem with all methods indicated here is that you CAN\'T be sure that a method doesn\'t exist.In Python you can intercept the dot calling thru __getattr__ and __getattribute__, making it possible to create method "at runtime"Exemple:If you execute it, you can call method non existing in the object dictionary...And it\'s why you use the Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission paradigms in Python.One can create a getAttrs function that will return an object\'s callable property namesThat\'d returnThere is no reliable way to list all object\'s methods. dir(object) is usually useful, but in some cases it may not list all methods. According to dir() documentation: "With an argument, attempt to return a list of valid attributes for that object."Checking that method exists can be done by callable(getattr(object, method)) as already mentioned there....is there at least an easy way to check if it has a particular method other than simply checking if an error occurs when the method is calledWhile "Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission" is certainly the Pythonic way, what you are looking for maybe:
