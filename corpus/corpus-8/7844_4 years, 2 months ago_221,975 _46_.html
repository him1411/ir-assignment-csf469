I have been using Github for a little while and I have been fine with git add, git commit, and git push so far with no problems. Suddenly I am having an error that says:fatal: Authentication FailedIn the terminal I cloned a repository, worked on a file and then I used git add to add the file to the commit log and when I did git commit, it worked fine. Finally, git push asks for username and password. I put those in correctly and every time I do this, it says the same error.Does anyone have any idea what the cause of this problem is and how I can fix it?The contents of .git/config are:If you enabled two-factor authentication in your Github account you\n  won\'t be able to push via HTTPS using your accounts password. Instead\n  you need to generate a personal access token. This can be done in the\n  application settings of your Github account. Using this token as your\n  password should allow you to push to your remote repository via HTTPS.\n  Use your username as usual.https://help.github.com/articles/https-cloning-errors#provide-access-token-if-2fa-enabledYou may also need to update the origin for your repository if set to https: First, you can make sure to use the proper url:Then, if it was working before, and if it wasn\'t asking for you username, it must be because you had stored your credentials (login/password) in a $HOME/.netrc file, as explained here. You can double-check those settings, and make sure that your proxy, if you have one, hasn\'t changed.If that still doesn\'t work, you can switch to an ssh url:But that means you have published your ssh public key in your Account settings.This worked for me, and it also remembers my credentials:Run gitbashPoint to the repo directoryRun git config --global credential.helper wincredI think that for some reason GitHub is expecting the URL to NOT have subdomain www. When I use (for example)it gives the following messages:However, if I useit works perfectly fine. Doesn\'t make too much sense to me... but I guess remember not to put www in the remote URL for GitHub repositories.Also notice the clone URLs provided on the GitHub repository webpage doesn\'t include the www.If you found authentication error problem when you entered correct password and username it\'s git problem. To solves this problem when you are installing the git in your machine uncheck the enable git credential managerMay you have changed password recently for you git account\nYou could try the git push with -u optionAfter executing above command it will ask for password provide your updated passwordHope it may help youI had the same problem. I set url in that way:git remote set-url origin https://github.com/zkirkland/Random-Python-Tests.gitI also removed from config file this entry: askpass = /bin/echo.\nThen "git push" asked me for username and password and this time it worked.I\'m not really sure what I did to get this error, but doing:didn\'t work for me. However:somehow worked.Just from your .config file change:url = http://www.github.com/###user###/Random-Python-TestsTo:url = http://###user###@github.com/###user###/Random-Python-TestsFor me, I forgot that I had changed the password on Github.com, and my keychain for shell authentication never updated to that new password. Deleting everything git from my keychain and then re-running the git request helped solve the issue, prompting me again for the new password.Just to chime in here, what fixed the issue for me was I simply canceled out of the initial prompt, the ssh one opened up with my bitbucket account, I entered the password there and everything worked as expected.I was facing the same issue on windows. Most of the time I normally face the issue due to using multiple git accounts. If you are on windows, please do open the terminal as an administrator and try running the commands again. Make sure that you have the administrator access rights. I\'ve ran into \n"$ git fetch\nfatal: Authentication failed for \'http://...." \nafter my windows password has expired and was changed. Multiple fetches, reboot and even reinstall of git with windows credential manager didn\'t help.Surprisingly the right answer somewhere here in comments but not in answers (and some of them are really weird!).\nYou need to go to Control panel -> Credential Manager / Windows Credentials\nand update you password for git:http://yourrepoaddressI also ran into the error (that\'s why I am landed here), but none of the suggestions worked for me. This was my very first time I try to deploy local Git to azure. When I got this error, I reset my credentials (by clicking the link in Azure) after a few tries. The problem is that at this point it tells me my user name is already taken, so I also changed my user name to another one. In the end, I manually deleted the .git folder on my local drive, and redeployed it without problem.Problem Statement: "git fatal authentication failed". I am using bitbucket.Solution:\nI simply deleted the user from using access management of bitbucket and then added the same user. The .gitconfig file is simplewith correct credentials if the problem prevails if your using androidstudio 2.1 beta then its bug , upgrade  to beta 2 (3 mb update file) , this worked for meMake sure you have WRITE permission to push.
