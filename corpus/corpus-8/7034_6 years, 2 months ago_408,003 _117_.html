I\'m trying to get data from an Excel file on a button click event. My connection string is:When I click on the button, I got the following error:The \'Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0\' provider is not registered on the local machine.I have no clue how to fix this. My operating system is Windows 7.Well, you need to install it. You\'re looking for:A 64-bit version of the \'Microsoft Access Database Engine 2010 Redistributable\' that will allow you to use the \'Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0\' provider is available here:\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13255If you use the download from the accepted answer, you will need to build for x86, as pointed out by @backtestbroker.com.depending on the app(32/64bit) using the connection you could just installSummary:check your providers with the powershell-command from both 32 and 64bit shell:and you will see which provider your system can usethe long story:\nthe strings can be found with http://live.sysinternals.com/strings.exeeg. on a 64bit System with 32bit drivers installedeven in the upcoming office 2016you will find the strings Microsoft.ACE.OLEDBMicrosoft.ACE.Oledb.12.0the Office 2013 comes also with csi.dllwhich contains the "Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.15.0"and Office 2016which has the "Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.16.0" versionI got this error/exception in Visual Studio 2010 when I changed my build in the Configuration Manager dialog box from "x86" to "Any CPU".  This OLEDB database driver I understand only works in x86 and is not 64bit compatible.  Changing the build configuration back to x86 solved the problem for me.The first thing you need to check is your build configuration of your application. If you have built your project under x86 platform, then in order to\nresolve you issue you should install the following packages on your\nmachine: In order to use the \'Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0\' provider you must\ninstall the Microsoft Access Database Engine 2010 Redistributable\nfirst, this installation is available at:\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=13255 . After the installation has complete, try running you application, if this\nsolves the issue great, if not, continue to step 2.This next step is an unexplained workaround, which works for Office\n2010, even though it is the Data Connectivity Components of Office 2007.  I am not quite sure why this works, but it does and this has been proven to work in almost all cases. You need to install the 2007 Office System Driver: Data Connectivity Components, this installation is available at:\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/download/en/confirmation.aspx?id=23734 .After this installation is complete, try running your application, this should resolve the issue.If you are trying to run an application built under x64 or AnyCPU\nplatform, I would recommend first validating that it runs as expected\nunder the x86 platform.  In the event that it does not run under that\nx86 platform, perform the steps in the first part and validate that\nit runs as expected.I did read that the MS Access drivers including the OLEDB Database\ndriver works only under the x86 platform and is incompatible under\nthe x64 or AnyCPU platform.  But this appears to be untrue. I\nvalidated my application was running when building x86, then I\ninstalled the Access Database Engine using the passive flag.  After these 2 steps I managed to run my application after building in\nx64 or AnyCPU build configuration.  This appeared to solve my issue.Note: The order of the steps seems to make a difference, so please follow accordingly.For all those still affected by this.I\'ve been getting the error......as described by the OP, Shailesh Sahu.I have 64bit Windows 7.My problem is within PowerShell scripts, but is using a connection string, similar to the OP\'s post, so hopefully my findings can be applied to C#, PowerShell and any other language relying on the "Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB" driver.I followed instructions on this MS forum thread: http://goo.gl/h73RmII first tried installing the 64bit version, then installing the 32bit version of the AccessDatabaseEngine.exe from this page\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13255But still no joy.I then ran the code below in PowerShell (from SQL Panda\'s site http://goo.gl/A3Hu96)...which gave me this result (I\'ve removed other data sources for brevity)...As you can see, I have Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.15.0 (fifteen) not Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0 (twelve)So, I amended my connection string to 15 and it worked.So, a quick PowerShell snippet to demonstrate how to soft-code the version...amended to pick the latest ACE version, if more than oneHopefully, anyone finding this can now check to see what OLEDB version is installed and use the appropriate version number.If you\'re using 64-bit but still having problem even after installing AccessDatabaseEngine, see this post, it solved the problem for me.i.e. You need to install this AccessDatabaseEngineI installed the MS drivers and it still didn\'t work for me.  Then I found this blog post that solved the issue.  Read it there, else use these two images (linked from that post) as the TLDR sumamary:If the installed "AccessDatabaseEngine" still does not help, below is solution:You need to change the Active Solution Platform from "Any CPU" to "x86". OLEDB Provider is Not Registered on the Local MachineFrom CodeProject.comsyp_dino,The solution for me as you suggested for the "Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0\' provider is not registered on the local machine" error is to change the Active Solution Platform from "Any CPU" to "x86". When I performed those steps, rebuilt the solution, grabbed the EXE and placed in on the network, everything worked smoothly on the Windows 7 64 bit machine.   If you are debugging a web project, just make sure IIS Express is running either in 32 or 64 bits depending on your project settings.Goto Tools > Options > Projects and Solutions > Web Projectsand from there check (or uncheck) the \'Use 64 bit version of IIS Express...\'You need to change the Solution Platform from "Any CPU" to "x86" or "x64" based on the bitness of office installation.The steps are given below:Right click on the Solution File in Solution Explorer:\nClick on the Active Platform Drop down, if x86 is already there then select that, else click on New.\nSelect x86 or x64 from the new platform dropdown:\nCompile and run your application.I followed the instructions set out by others; installing this patch, installing that patch as well as the Microsoft Access Database Engine 2010.My issue was that I\'m using the same library (linq2sql) in 2 sites on my machine; 1 works and 1 doesn\'t.Eventually I found that I had to "enable 32 bit applications" in the advanced settings of the apppool for my non-working site.Everything works fine now.I have similar issue when we are reading Excel file.History of the problem:We recently migrated our application from 32-bit to 64-bit because of the memory requirement. For that we migrated our windows 7 from 32-bit to 64-bit. But still we installed 32-bit office on our machines.because, of this we had this issue while importing Excel data into application.Solution,I downloaded 64-bit version of the http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13255 and installed with argument as,AccessDatabaseEngine_x64.exe /passiveWithout any code change my issue get resolved.Note:On 64-bit OS and 64-bit office, my functionality was working fine without this fix. This fix is only required while our application is 64-bit running on 64-bit OS which is having 32-bit office installed on it.also can try these stepsIn the SQL Server,\n1.Open one data base\n2.Clic in the option \'Server Obtect\'\n3.Clic in \'Linked Servers\'\n4.Clic in \'Providers\'\n5.Clic Rigth in \'Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0\' \n6.Uncheck all the options and closeI had the same issue but in this case microsoft-ace-oledb-12-0-provider was already installed on my machine and working fine for other application developed.The difference between those application and the one with I had the problem was the Old Applications were running on "Local IIS" whereas the one with error was on "IIS Express(running from Visual Studio").\nSo what I did was-I was able to fix this by following the steps in this article: http://www.mikesdotnetting.com/article/280/solved-the-microsoft-ace-oledb-12-0-provider-is-not-registered-on-the-local-machineThe key point for me was this:When debugging with IIS, by default, Visual Studio uses the 32-bit version. You can change this\n  from within Visual Studio by going to Tools \xc2\xbb Options \xc2\xbb Projects And\n  Solutions \xc2\xbb Web Projects \xc2\xbb General, and choosing"Use the 64 bit version of IIS Express for websites and projects"After checking that option, then setting the platform target of my project back to "Any CPU" (i had set it to x86 somewhere in the troubleshooting process), i was able to overcome the error.I had Microsoft Access Database Engine 2010 Redistributable already installed on my machine but was still receiving the Microsoft ACE OLEDB Provider error. Then I recalled that I had upgraded to Office 2016 recently, so, may be I should try reinstalling Microsoft Access Database Engine 2010 Redistributable. And that fixed the problem on my machine. So, if you have upgraded to different version of MS Office or even repaired/reinstalled your MS Office then try reinstalling Microsoft Access Database Engine 2010 Redistributable before wasting time with finding other fixes. Good luck!Just download & install the following Access DB engine (X86 or X64: as per your machine configuration) and see the magic :) https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=13255Remember to install AccessDatabaseEngine on server for web application.1.) Verify your connection string with ConnectionStrings.com. 2.) Make sure you have the correct database engine installed. These were the two database engines that helped me.  Microsoft Access Database Engine 2010 Redistributable2007 Office System Driver: Data Connectivity Components3.) There could be an issue with your build target platform being "Any CPU", it may need to be "X86" (Properties, Build, Platform Target).I had this issue when attempting to import data from an excel file (xlsx) into a SQL Server DB using SSMS 2014.The 2007 Office System Driver: Data Connectivity Components install did the trick for me.If you get this error when trying to use ACE from an ASP.NET application, the most likely cause is that you have installed either one of the 32-bit versions. By default, IIS on a 64-bit operating system will run applications in a 64-bit worker process. 64-bit processes cannot load 32-bit DLLs. When a call is made to the ACE provider, the 64 bit process will attempt to locate a 64-bit DLL. If it doesn\'t exist, you get the error message that brought you here.In this case you have two options. First, you can install the 2010 64-bit version. If you have the 2007 32-bit version installed, you can simply install the 2010 64-bit version alongside it. If you have the 32-bit version of 2010 installed, you need to uninstall it and download and install the 64-bit 2010 version instead. You cannot have both the 32- and 64-bit versions of the 2010 provider installed at the same time. If you are performing the installation on your development machine, you may also be constrained by the bit-ness of any existing Office installations.The second option is to change the application pool in IIS to enable 32-bit applications. If you are using the full version of IIS, you can use the management tool to do this (Control Panel \xc2\xbb Administrative Tools \xc2\xbb Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager).For more understanding please refer below linkI received this error when importing data from an Excel file into MS-SQL.\nThe provider was already installed (64-bit) and this surprised me why it didn\'t work.\nSo all I did was locate the Import/Export application used here i.e. the .EXE.\nAnd I found it at C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SQL Server\\130\\DTS\\Binn\\DTSWizard.exeI then ran the .exe directly to perform the data import. And it worked!//Read .xls  file// Now install AccessDatabaseEngine.exe from  "http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=23734" linkIt will work 100%It depends with the office you have installed, if you have x64 bit office then you must compile the application as a x64 to allow it to run, so if you want it to run on x36 then you must install office x86 to accept, i tried all the solutions above but none worked until when i realised i had office x64bit and so i built the application as x64 and worked
