What is the best way (and I presume simplest way) to place the cursor at the end of the text in a input text element via JavaScript - after focus has been set to the element?I faced this same issue (after setting focus through RJS/prototype) in IE.\nFirefox was already leaving the cursor at the end when there is already a value for the field. IE was forcing the cursor to the beginning of the text.The solution I arrived at is as follows:This works in both IE7 and FF3There\'s a simple way to get it working in most browsers.However, due to the *quirks of a few browsers, a more inclusive answer looks more like thisUsing jQuery (to set the listener, but it\'s not necessary otherwise)Using Vanilla JS (borrowing addEvent function from this answer)Chrome has an odd quirk where the focus event fires before the cursor is moved into the field; which screws my simple solution up.  Two options to fix this:Also, @vladkras pointed out that some older versions of Opera incorrectly calculate the length when it has spaces. For this you can use a huge number that should be larger than your string.Try this, it has worked for me:For the cursor to be move to the end, the input has to have focus first, then when the value is changed it will goto the end.  If you set .value to the same, it won\'t change in chrome.After hacking around with this a bit, I found the best way was to use the setSelectionRange function if the browser supports it; if not, revert to using the method in Mike Berrow\'s answer (i.e. replace the value with itself).I\'m also setting scrollTop to a high value in case we\'re in a vertically-scrollable textarea. (Using an arbitrary high value seems more reliable than $(this).height() in Firefox and Chrome.)I\'ve made it is as a jQuery plugin. (If you\'re not using jQuery I trust you can still get the gist easily enough.)I\'ve tested in IE6, IE7, IE8, Firefox 3.5.5, Google Chrome 3.0, Safari 4.0.4, Opera 10.00.It\'s available on jquery.com as the PutCursorAtEnd plugin. For your convenience, the code for release 1.0 is as follows:This function works for me in IE9, Firefox 6.x, and Opera 11.xI\'ve tried the following with quite great success in chromeQuick rundown:It takes every input field with the class focus on it, then stores the old value of the input field in a variable, afterwards it applies the empty string to the input field.Then it waits 1 milisecond and puts in the old value again.Simple. When editing or changing values, first put the focus then set value.Still the intermediate variable is needed, (see var val=)\nelse the cursor behaves strange, we need it at the end.For all browsers for all cases:Timeout required if you need to move cursor from onFocus event handlerIn jQuery, that\'s  Taking some of the answers .. making a single-line jquery.If the input field just needs a static default value I usually do this with jQuery:This seems to work in all browsers.I just found that in iOS, setting textarea.textContent property will place the cursor at the end of the text in the textarea element every time. The behavior was a bug in my app, but seems to be something that you could use intentionally.This problem is interesting. The most confusing thing about it is that no solution I found solved the problem completely.+++++++ SOLUTION +++++++You need a JS function, like this:You need to call this guy in the onfocus and onclick events.IT WORKS ON ALL DEVICES AN BROWSERS!!!!Set the cursor when click on text area to the end of text...\nVariation  of this code is...ALSO works! for  Firefox, IE, Safari, Chrome..In server-side code:In Javascript:While this may be an old question with lots of answers, I ran across a similar issue and none of the answers were quite what I wanted and/or were poorly explained. The issue with selectionStart and selectionEnd properties is that they don\'t exist for input type number (while the question was asked for text type, I reckon it might help others who might have other input types that they need to focus). So if you don\'t know whether the input type the function will focus is a type number or not, you cannot use that solution.The solution that works cross browser and for all input types is rather simple:That way the cursor is at the end of the input element. \nSo all you\'d do is something like this (using jquery, provided the element selector that one wishes to focus is accessible via \'data-focus-element\' data attribute of the clicked element and the function executes after clicking on \'.foo\' element):Why does this work? Simply, when the .focus() is called, the focus will be added to the beginning of the input element (which is the core problem here), ignoring the fact, that the input element already has a value in it. However, when the value of an input is changed, the cursor is automatically placed at the end of the value inside input element. So if you override the value with the same value that had been previously entered in the input, the value will look untouched, the cursor will, however, move to the end.If you set the value first and then set the focus, the cursor will always appear at the end.Here is the fiddle to test \nhttps://jsfiddle.net/5on50caf/1/I tried the suggestions before but none worked for me (tested them in Chrome), so I wrote my own code - and it works fine in Firefox, IE, Safari, Chrome...In Textarea:In Javascript:Here\xe2\x80\x99s a jsFiddle demo of my answer.
