This seems like something that should be pretty straight forward, but I have been stuck page faulting this problem for a while now, so here goes.Having a look on the PHP documentation , the following two methods of the DateTime object would both seem to solve my problem:Both these methods are marked in the doco as being available in version >= 5.3 (and, not surprisingly, if I try to call them I find they don\'t exist). I can\'t find any specific documentation for 5.2.8 so I am not sure if there are equivalent methods in my version.  I have Googled the problem and found an eclectic range of solutions, none of which answer my very simple requirements:For some context, I have the following code:Apparently there is no comparison operator on this guy.  EDIT: Apparently my assumptions  were completely false (thanks Milen for illustrating this so effectively).  There is a comparison operator and it works just fine thanks.  Sometimes I really miss a compiler.  The bug is in the code above, I am sure you will find it much faster than I did :).I look forward to my embarrassment at the simplicity of your solution.EDIT: And sure enough, embarrassment ensues ...The following seems to confirm that there are comparison operators for the DateTime class:You can also compare epoch seconds : Source : http://laughingmeme.org/2007/02/27/looking-at-php5s-datetime-and-datetimezone/\n(quite interesting article about DateTime)From official documentation:As of PHP 5.2.2, DateTime objects can be compared using comparison operators.For PHP versions before 5.2.2 (actually for any version) you can use diff.If you want to compare dates and not time, you could use this:This may help you.
