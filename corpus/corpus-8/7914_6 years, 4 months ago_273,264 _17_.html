In Java, I want to convert this:To this:This is what I have so far:But it doesn\'t work right.  What are these %3A and %2F formats called and how do I convert them?This does not have anything to do with character encodings such as UTF-8 or ASCII. The string you have there is URL encoded. This kind of encoding is something entirely different than character encoding.Try something like this:Note that a character encoding (such as UTF-8 or ASCII) is what determines the mapping of characters to raw bytes. For a good intro to character encodings, see this article.The string you\'ve got is in application/x-www-form-urlencoded encoding.Use URLDecoder to convert it to Java String.This has been answered before (although this question was first!):"You should use java.net.URI to do this, as the URLDecoder class does x-www-form-urlencoded decoding which is wrong (despite the name, it\'s for form data)."Basically:will give you:%3A and %2F are URL encoded characters. Use this java code to convert them back into : and /I use apache commonsThe default charset is UTF-8You can select your method wisely :)
