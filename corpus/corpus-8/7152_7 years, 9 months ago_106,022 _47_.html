this one\'s a quickie:What are the allowed characters in both cookie name and value? Are they same as URL or some common subset?Reason I\'m asking is that I\'ve recently hit some strange behavior with cookies that have - in their name and I\'m just wondering if it\'s something browser specific or if my code is faulty.this one\'s a quickie:You might think it should be, but really it\'s not at all!What are the allowed characters in both cookie name and value?According to the ancient Netscape cookie_spec the entire NAME=VALUE string is:a sequence of characters excluding semi-colon, comma and white space.So - should work, and it does seem to be OK in browsers I\'ve got here; where are you having trouble with it?By implication of the above:What isn\'t mentioned, because Netscape were terrible at writing specs, but seems to be consistently supported by browsers:either the NAME or the VALUE may be empty stringsif there is no = symbol in the string at all, browsers treat it as the cookie with the empty-string name, ie Set-Cookie: foo is the same as Set-Cookie: =foo.when browsers output a cookie with an empty name, they omit the equals sign. So Set-Cookie: =bar begets Cookie: bar.commas and spaces in names and values do actually seem to work, though spaces around the equals sign are trimmedcontrol characters (\\x00 to \\x1F plus \\x7F) aren\'t allowedWhat isn\'t mentioned and browsers are totally inconsistent about, is non-ASCII (Unicode) characters:so in practice you cannot use non-ASCII characters in cookies at all. If you want to use Unicode, control codes or other arbitrary byte sequences, the cookie_spec demands you use an ad-hoc encoding scheme of your own choosing and suggest URL-encoding (as produced by JavaScript\'s encodeURIComponent) as a reasonable choice.In terms of actual standards, there have been a few attempts to codify cookie behaviour but none thus far actually reflect the real world.RFC 2109 was an attempt to codify and fix the original Netscape cookie_spec. In this standard many more special characters are disallowed, as it uses RFC 2616 tokens (a - is still allowed there), and only the value may be specified in a quoted-string with other characters. No browser ever implemented the limitations, the special handling of quoted strings and escaping, or the new features in this spec.RFC 2965 was another go at it, tidying up 2109 and adding more features under a \xe2\x80\x98version 2 cookies\xe2\x80\x99 scheme. Nobody ever implemented any of that either. This spec has the same token-and-quoted-string limitations as the earlier version and it\'s just as much a load of nonsense.RFC 6265 is an HTML5-era attempt to clear up the historical mess. It still doesn\'t match reality exactly but it\'s much better then the earlier attempts\xe2\x80\x94it is at least a proper subset of what browsers support, not introducing any syntax that is supposed to work but doesn\'t (like the previous quoted-string).In 6265 the cookie name is still specified as an RFC 2616 token, which means you can pick from the alphanums plus:In the cookie value it formally bans the (filtered by browsers) control characters and (inconsistently-implemented) non-ASCII characters. It retains cookie_spec\'s prohibition on space, comma and semicolon, plus for compatibility with any poor idiots who actually implemented the earlier RFCs it also banned backslash and quotes, other than quotes wrapping the whole value (but in that case the quotes are still considered part of the value, not an encoding scheme). So that leaves you with the alphanums plus:In the real world we are still using the original-and-worst Netscape cookie_spec, so code that consumes cookies should be prepared to encounter pretty much anything, but for code that produces cookies it is advisable to stick with the subset in RFC 6265.In ASP.Net you can use System.Web.HttpUtility to safely encode the cookie value before writing to the cookie and convert it back to its original form on reading it out.This will stop ampersands and equals signs spliting a value into a bunch of name/value pairs as it is written to a cookie.I think it\'s generally browser specific. To be on the safe side, base64 encode a JSON object, and store everything in that. That way you just have to decode it and parse the JSON. All the characters used in base64 should play fine with most, if not all browsers.Newer rfc6265 published in April 2011:If you look to @bobince answer you see that newer restriction more strict.you can not put ";" in the value field of a cookie, the name that will be set is the string until the ";" in most browsers...There are 2 versions of cookies specifications\n 1. Version 0 cookies aka Netscape cookies,\n 2. Version 1 aka RFC 2965 cookies\nIn version 0 The name and value part of cookies are  sequences of characters, excluding the semicolon, comma, equals sign, and whitespace, if not used with double quotes\n version 1 is a lot more complicated you can check it here\nIn this version specs for name value part is almost same except name can not start with $ sign Sorry, I couldn\'t add to the accepted answer, but I just ran into another interesting issue with IE and Edge.Cookies that have names with more than 1 period seem to be silently dropped.\nSo\nThis works: cookie_name_a=valueawhile this will get droppedcookie.name.a=valueaHere it is, in as few words as possible. Focus on characters that need no escaping: For cookies:For urlsFor cookies and urls ( intersection )That\'s how you answer. Note that for cookies, the = has been removed because it is\n  usually used to set the cookie value.For urls this the = was kept. The intersection is obviously without. Turns out escaping still occuring and unexpected happening, especially in a Java cookie environment where the cookie is wrapped with double quotes if it encounters the last characters. So to be safe, just use A-Za-z1-9. That\'s what I am going to do. Years ago MSIE 5 or 5.5 (and probably both) had some serious issue with a "-" in the  HTML block if you can believe it.  Alhough it\'s not directly related, ever since we\'ve stored an MD5 hash (containing letters and numbers only) in the cookie to look up everything else in server-side database.
