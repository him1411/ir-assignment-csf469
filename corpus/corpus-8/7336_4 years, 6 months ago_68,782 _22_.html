I have my first node.js app (runs fine locally) - but I am unable to deploy it via heroku (first time w/ heroku as well). The code is below. SO doesn\'t let me write so much code, so I would just say that the running the code locally as well within my network shows no issue.Any idea ?Heroku dynamically assigns your app a port, so you can\'t set the port to a fixed number. Heroku adds the port to the env, so you can pull it from there. Switch your listen to this:.listen(process.env.PORT || 5000)That way it\'ll still listen to port 5000 when you test locally, but it will also work on Heroku.You can check out the Heroku docs on Node.js here.I had same issue while using yeoman\'s angular-fullstack generated project and removing the IP parameter worked for me.I replaced this codewith The error happens when Heroku failed to bind the port or hostname at server.listen(port, [host], [backlog], [callback]).What Heroku requires is .listen(process.env.PORT) or .listen(process.env.PORT, \'0.0.0.0\')So more generically, to support other environments, use this:In my case, I was using example from https://hapijs.com/To fix the problem I replacedwith It\'s worth mentioning that if your code doesn\'t specify a port, then it shouldn\'t be a web process and probably should instead be a worker process instead. So, change your Procfile to read (with your specific command filled in):worker YOUR_COMMANDand then also run on CLI: $ heroku scale worker=1In my case, I was using Babel with the babel-plugin-transform-inline-environment-variables plugin. Apparently, Heroku does not set the PORT env variable when doing a deployment, so process.env.PORT will be replaced by undefined, and your code will fallback to the development port which Heroku does not know anything about.I had same issue I could resolved issue with replace \'localhost\' with IP which is \'0.0.0.0\'
