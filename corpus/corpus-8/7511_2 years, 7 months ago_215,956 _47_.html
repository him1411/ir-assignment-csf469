I have recently installed Laravel 5 via composer. I tried creating a new controller using artisan and I get the following error:bootstrap/../vendor/autoload.php. Failed to open stream: No such file or directory. The "vendor" folder does not exist. Am I missing something?Run composer with --no-scripts This shall fix the issue. I tried this on Mac and Linux.Which OS you are using ?\nFor Windows :\nGo to Command Promptset path to www/{ur project}For me : www/laravel5Then type this command :  composer installIt will automatically install all dependency in vendor/Run composer install in your root project folder (or php composer.phar install).Turns out I didn\'t enable openssl in my php.ini so when I created my new project with composer it was installed from source. I changed that and ran now the vendor folder was created.Did you create a new project or did you clone an existing project?If you cloned an existing project it\'s very important to runThat way all the dependencies that are missing will be installed.But if you create a new project you should run this command to make a new project using composerJust run this inside the directory where you installed your projectI encountered the same problem. It occurred because composer was not able to install the dependencies specified in composer.json file.\ntry running If this does not solve the problem, make sure\nthe following php modules are installed\nphp-mbstring\nphp-domTo install this extensions run the following in terminalonce the installation is completetry running the command in your project root folderWhen the new project created the laravel require to load vendors to autoload the libraries , \nWe use composer update to Composer is a  dependency manager allows you to delegate responsibility for managing your dependencies to a third party.Following this below step solved my problem. You may tryJust run the following commands,Orgo to your project folder via cmd. run the following commandit will install missing vendor folder and files in your project. but in some cases it gives error like " Your configuration does not allow connection to bla bla bla.." in cmd.for that go to your composer.json file, change "secure-http": true to "secure-http": falsebut in some cases (as was in my case) you may not find such line in your file. for that do the following action:change "config": {\n        "preferred-install": "dist"\n    }to and run again composer update command.hope this will solve problem of many persons. :)Just setup a new project using composer instead of laravel like this:Before you carry out the following instructions you need to make sure you have composer installed globally on your machine;\nOpen you Mac terminal and run the following command:once composer is installed globally run the following command after you are in the directory of the project:once completed in it update and install all the required packages.I added composer.lock file to .gitignore, after commit that file to repository error is gone :)I also had that error. But none of the above solved the issue. So i uninstalled and again installed the composer. Then i did composer update. and the problem was fixed.I got this when I did composer update instead of composer install.In my case I had to enable another extension, namely php_mbstring.dll in the php.ini file before it could work. It\'s listed under extension=php_mbstring.dll. Find it in the php.ini file and remove the semi-colon (;) in front of it and save the file.After this run install composer again in the root directory of your Laravel applcication and is should work.
