Why is it so hard to do this in Java? If you want to have any kind of module system you need to be able to load jars dynamically. I\'m told there\'s a way of doing it by writing your own ClassLoader, but that\'s a lot of work for something that should (in my mind at least) be as easy as calling a method with a jar file as its argument.Any suggestions for simple code that does this?The reason it\'s hard is security.  Classloaders are meant to be immutable; you shouldn\'t be able to willy-nilly add classes to it at runtime.  I\'m actually very surprised that works with the system classloader.  Here\'s how you do it making your own child classloader:Painful, but there it is.The following solution is hackish, as it uses reflection to bypass encapsulation, but it works flawlessly:You should take a look at OSGi, e.g. implemented in the Eclipse Platform. It does exactly that. You can install, uninstall, start and stop so called bundles, which are effectively JAR files. But it does a little more, as it offers e.g. services that can be dynamically discovered in JAR files at runtime.Or see the specification for the Java Module System.How about the JCL class loader framework? I have to admit, I haven\'t used it, but it looks promising.Usage example:Here is a version that is not deprecated. I modified the original to remove the deprecated functionality.The best I\'ve found is org.apache.xbean.classloader.JarFileClassLoader which is part of the XBean project.Here\'s a short method I\'ve used in the past, to create a class loader from all the lib files in a specific directoryThen to use the classloader, just do: If you are working on Android, the following code works:The solution proposed by jodonnell is good but should be a little bit enhanced. I used this post to develop my application with success. Firstly we have to addor you will not able to load resource (such as spring/context.xml) stored into the jar.your jars into the parent class loader or you will not able to understand who is loading what.see also Problem reloading a jar using URLClassLoaderHowever, OSGi framework remain the best way.I personally find that java.util.ServiceLoader does the job pretty well. You can get an example here.
