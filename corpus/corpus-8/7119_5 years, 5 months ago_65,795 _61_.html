I understand how this construct works:But I don\'t understand why else is used as the keyword here, since it suggests the code in question only runs if the for block does not complete, which is the opposite of what it does! No matter how I think about it, my brain can\'t progress seamlessly from the for statement to the else block. To me, continue or continuewith would make more sense (and I\'m trying to train myself to read it as such).I\'m wondering how Python coders read this construct in their head (or aloud, if you like). Perhaps I\'m missing something that would make such code blocks more easily decipherable?It\'s a strange construct even to seasoned Python coders. When used in conjunction with for-loops it basically means "find some item in the iterable, else if none was found do ...". As in:But anytime you see this construct, a better alternative is to either encapsulate the search in a function:Or use a list comprehension:It is not semantically equivalent to the other two versions, but works good enough in non-performance critical code where it doesn\'t matter whether you iterate the whole list or not. Others may disagree, but I personally would avoid ever using the for-else or while-else blocks in production code. See also [Python-ideas] Summary of for...else threadsA common construct is to run a loop until something is found and then to break out of the loop. The problem is that if I break out of the loop or the loop ends I need to determine which case happened. One method is to create a flag or store variable that will let me do a second test to see how the loop was exited.For example assume that I need to search through a list and process each item until a flag item is found and then stop processing. If the flag item is missing then an exception needs to be raised.Using the Python for...else construct you haveCompare this to a method that does not use this syntactic sugar:In the first case the raise is bound tightly to the for loop it works with. In the second the binding is not as strong and errors may be introduced during maintenance.There\'s an excellent presentation by Raymond Hettinger, titled Transforming Code into Beautiful, Idiomatic Python, in which he briefly addresses the history of the for ... else construct. The relevant section is "Distinguishing multiple exit points in loops" starting at 15:50 and continuing for about three minutes. Here are the high points:So, if the question is, "Why don\'t they change this keyword?" then Cat Plus Plus probably gave the most accurate answer \xe2\x80\x93 at this point, it would be too destructive to existing code to be practical. But if the question you\'re really asking is why else was reused in the first place, well, apparently it seemed like a good idea at the time.Personally, I like the compromise of commenting # no break in-line wherever the else could be mistaken, at a glance, as belonging inside the loop. It\'s reasonably clear and concise. This option gets a brief mention in the summary that Bjorn linked at the end of his answer:For completeness, I should mention that with a slight change in\n  syntax, programmers who want this syntax can have it right now:* Bonus quote from that part of the video: "Just like if we called lambda makefunction, nobody would ask, \'What does lambda do?\'"Because they didn\'t want to introduce a new keyword to the language. Each one steals an identifier and causes backwards compatibility problems, so it\'s usually a last resort.I read it something like:If still on the conditions to run the loop, do stuff, else do something else.The easiest way I found to \'get\' what the for/else did, and more importantly, when to use it, was to concentrate on where the break statement jumps to. The For/else construct is a single block. The break jumps out of the block, and so jumps \'over\' the else clause. If the contents of the else clause simply followed the for clause, it would never be jumped over, and so the equivalent logic would have to be provided by putting it in an if. This has been said before, but not quite in these words, so it may help somebody else. Try running the following code fragment. I\'m wholeheartedly in favour of the \'no break\' comment for clarity.I think documentation has a great explanation of  else, continue[...] it is executed when the loop terminates through exhaustion of the list (with for) or when the condition becomes false (with while), but not when the loop is terminated by a break statement."Source: Python 2 docs: Tutorial on control flowI read it like "When the iterable is exhausted completely, and the execution is about to proceed to the next statement after finishing the for, the else clause will be executed." Thus, when the iteration is broken by break, this will not be executed.Since the technical part has been pretty much answered, my comment is just in relation with the confusion that produce this recycled keyword.Being Python a very eloquent programming language, the misuse of a keyword is more notorious. The else keyword perfectly describes  part of the flow of a decision tree, "if you can\'t do this, (else) do that". It\'s implied in our own language.Instead, using this keyword with while and for statements creates confusion. The reason, our career as programmers has taught us that the else statement resides within a decision tree; its logical scope, a wrapper that conditionally return a path to follow. Meanwhile, loop statements have a figurative explicit goal to reach something. The goal is met after continuous iterations of a process. if / else indicate a path to follow. Loops follow a path until the "goal" is completed.The issue is that else is a word that clearly define the last option in a condition. The semantics of the word are both shared by Python and Human Language. But the else word in Human Language is never used to indicate the actions someone or something will take after something is completed. It will be used if, in the process of completing it, an issue rises (more like a break statement).At the end, the keyword will remain in Python. It\'s clear it was mistake, clearer when every programmer tries to come up with a story to understand its usage like some mnemonic device. I\'d have loved if they have chosen instead the keyword then. I believe that this keyword fits perfectly in that iterative flow, the payoff after the loop.It resembles that situation that some child has after following every step in assembling a toy: And THEN what Dad?I agree, it\'s more like an \'elif not [condition(s) raising break]\'.I know this is an old thread, but I am looking into the same question right now,  and I\'m not sure anyone has captured the answer to this question in the way I understand it.For me, there are three ways of "reading" the else in For... else or While... else statements, all of which are equivalent, are:So, essentially, the "else" in a loop is really an "elif ..." where \'...\' is (1) no break, which is equivalent to (2) NOT [condition(s) raising break].I think the key is that the else is pointless without the \'break\', so a for...else includes:So, essential elements of a for...else loop are as follows, and you would read them in plainer English as:As the other posters have said, a break is generally raised when you are able to locate what your loop is looking for, so the else: becomes "what to do if target item not located".ExampleYou can also use exception handling, breaks, and for loops all together.ResultExampleSimple example with a break being hit.ResultExampleSimple example where there no break, no condition raising a break, and no error are encountered.ResultYou could think of it like,\nelse as in the rest of the stuff, or the other stuff, that wasn\'t done in the loop.The else keyword can be confusing here, and as many people have pointed out, something like nobreak, notbreak is more appropriate.In order to understand for ... else ... logically, compare it with try...except...else, not if...else..., most of python programmers are familiar with the following code:Similarly, think of break as a special kind of Exception:The difference is python implies except break and you can not write it out, so it becomes:Yes, I know this comparison can be difficult and tiresome, but it does clarify the confusion.Codes in else statement block will be executed when the for loop was not be broke.From the docs:  break and continue Statements, and else Clauses on LoopsLoop statements may have an else clause; it is executed when the loop terminates through exhaustion of the list (with for) or when the condition becomes false (with while), but not when the loop is terminated by a break statement. This is exemplified by the following loop, which searches for prime numbers:(Yes, this is the correct code. Look closely: the else clause belongs to the for loop, not the if statement.)When used with a loop, the else clause has more in common with the else clause of a try statement than it does that of if statements: a try statement\xe2\x80\x99s else clause runs when no exception occurs, and a loop\xe2\x80\x99s else clause runs when no break occurs. For more on the try statement and exceptions, see Handling Exceptions.The continue statement, also borrowed from C, continues with the next iteration of the loop:
