How can I set the value of this?You cannot due to security reasons.Imagine:You don\'t want the websites you visit to be able to do this, do you? =)You can\'t.The only way to set the value of a file input is by the user to select a file.This is done for security reasons. Otherwise you would be able to create a Javascript that automatically uploads a specific file from the clients computer.Not an answer to your question (which others have answered), but if you want to have some edit functionality of an uploaded file field, what you probably want to do is:You can\'t. And it\'s a security measure. Imagine if someone writes a JS that sets file input value into some sensitive data file?You sort of can! Just set the input type="file" on display: none; with css, \nthen trigger it with another button using JQuery.
