I\'m setting up a new app using AngularJS as the frontend. Everything on the client side is done with HTML5 pushstate and I\'d like to be able to track my page views in Google Analytics.If you\'re using ng-view in your Angular app you can listen for the $viewContentLoaded event and push a tracking event to Google Analytics.Assuming you\'ve set up your tracking code in your main index.html file with a name of var _gaq and MyCtrl is what you\'ve defined in the ng-controller directive.UPDATE: \nfor new version of google-analytics use this oneWhen a new view is loaded in AngularJS, Google Analytics does not count it as a new page load. Fortunately there is a way to manually tell GA to log a url as a new pageview._gaq.push([\'_trackPageview\', \'<url>\']); would do the job, but how to bind that with AngularJS?Here is a service which you could use:When you define your angular module, include the analytics module like so:UPDATE:You should use the new Universal Google Analytics tracking code with:Just a quick addition. If you\'re using the new analytics.js, then:Additionally one tip is that google analytics will not fire on localhost. So if you are testing on localhost, use the following instead of the default create (full documentation)I\'ve created a service + filter that could help you guys with this, and maybe also with some other providers if you choose to add them in the future.Check out https://github.com/mgonto/angularytics and let me know how this works out for you.Merging the answers by wynnwu and dpineda was what worked for me.Setting the third parameter as an object (instead of just $location.path()) and using $routeChangeSuccess instead of $stateChangeSuccess did the trick.Hope this helps.I\'ve created a simple example on github using the above approach.https://github.com/isamuelson/angularjs-googleanalyticsIf someone wants to implement using directives then, identify (or create) a div in the index.html (just under the body tag, or at same DOM level)and then add the following code in the directiveThe best way to do this is using Google Tag Manager to fire your Google Analytics tags based on history listeners. These are built in to the GTM interface and easily allow tracking on client side HTML5 interactions . Enable the built in History variables and create a trigger to fire an event based on history changes. In your index.html, copy and paste the ga snippet but remove the line ga(\'send\', \'pageview\');I like to give it it\'s own factory file my-google-analytics.js with self injection:If you\'re using ui-router you can subscribe to the $stateChangeSuccess event like this:For a complete working example see this blog postUse GA \'set\' to ensure routes are picked up for Google realtime analytics. Otherwise subsequent calls to GA will not show in the realtime panel.Google strongly advises this approach generally instead of passing a 3rd param in \'send\'.\nhttps://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/single-page-applicationsI am using AngluarJS in html5 mode. I found following solution as most reliable:Use angular-google-analytics library. Initialize it with something like:After that, add listener on $stateChangeSuccess\' and send trackPage event.At any moment, when you have your user initalized you can inject Analytics there and make call:I am using ui-router and my code looks like this:This way I can track different states. Maybe someone will find it usefull.For those of you using AngularUI Router instead of ngRoute can use the following code to track page views.Developers creating Single Page Applications can use autotrack, which includes a urlChangeTracker plugin that handles all of the important considerations listed in this guide for you. See the autotrack documentation for usage and installation instructions.Merging even more with Pedro Lopez\'s answer,I added this to my ngGoogleAnalytis module(which I reuse in many apps):in this case, I have a  tag in my index link:it\'s useful when using html5 mode on angular.js v1.3 (remove the replace() function call if your base tag doesn\'t finish with a slash /)I personally like to set up my analytics with the template URL instead of the current path. This is mainly because my application has many custom paths such as message/:id or profile/:id. If I were to send these paths, I\'d have so many pages being viewed within analytics, it would be too difficult to check which page users are visiting most.I now get clean page views within my analytics such as user-profile.html and message.html instead of many pages being profile/1, profile/2 and profile/3. I can now process reports to see how many people are viewing user profiles.If anyone has any objection to why this is bad practise within analytics, I would be more than happy to hear about it. Quite new to using Google Analytics, so not too sure if this is the best approach or not.If you are looking for full control of Google Analytics\'s new tracking code, you could use my very own Angular-GA. It makes ga available through injection, so it\'s easy to test. It doesn\'t do any magic, apart from setting the path on every routeChange. You still have to send the pageview like here.Additionaly there is a directive ga which allows to bind multiple analytics functions to events, like this:
