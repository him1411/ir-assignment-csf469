I\'m trying to use async, await from scratch on Babel 6, but I\'m getting regeneratorRuntime is not defined..babelrc filepackage.json file.js fileUsing it normally without the async/await works just fine. Any ideas what I\'m doing wrong?babel-polyfill is required. You must also install it in order to get async/await working.package.json.babelrc.js with async/await (sample code)In the startup fileIf you are using webpack you need to put it as the first entry as per @Cemen comment:If you want to run tests with babel then use:Besides polyfill, I use babel-plugin-transform-runtime. The plugin is described as:Externalize references to helpers and builtins, automatically polyfilling your code without polluting globals. What does this actually mean though? Basically, you can use built-ins such as Promise, Set, Symbol etc as well use all the Babel features that require a polyfill seamlessly, without global pollution, making it extremely suitable for libraries.It also includes support for async/await along with other built-ins of ES 6. In .babelrc, add the runtime pluginAlternatively, if you don\'t need all the modules babel-polyfill provides, you can just specify babel-regenerator-runtime in your webpack config:When using webpack-dev-server with HMR, doing this reduced the number of files it has to compile on every build by quite a lot. This module is installed as part of babel-polyfill so if you already have that you\'re fine, otherwise you can install it separately with npm i -D babel-regenerator-runtime.Check this project: https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-envUse the following as your babel configuration:Then your app should be good to go in the last 2 versions of Chrome browser.You can also set Node as the targets or fine-tune the browsers list according to https://github.com/ai/browserslistI really like babel-preset-env\'s philosophy: tell me which environment you want to support, do NOT tell me how to support them. It\'s the beauty of declarative programming.I\'ve tested async await and they DO work. I don\'t know how they work and I really don\'t want to know. I want to spend my time on my own code and my business logic instead. Thanks to babel-preset-env, it liberates me from the Babel configuration hell.It works if you set the targets to Chrome. But it might not work for other targets, please refer to: https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env/issues/112If using babel-preset-stage-2 then just have to start the script with --require babel-polyfill.In my case this error was thrown by Mocha tests.Following fixed the issuemocha \\"server/tests/**/*.test.js\\" --compilers js:babel-register --require babel-polyfillYou\'re getting an error because async/await use generators, which are an ES2016 feature, not ES2015. One way to fix this is to install the babel preset for ES2016 (npm install --save babel-preset-es2016) and compile to ES2016 instead of ES2015:As the other answers mention, you can also use polyfills (though make sure you load the polyfill first before any other code runs). Alternatively, if you don\'t want to include all of the polyfill dependencies, you can use the babel-regenerator-runtime or the babel-plugin-transform-runtime.New Answer Why you follow my answer ?Ans: Because I am going to give you a answer with latest Update version npm project . 04/14/2017If your Use this version or more UP version of Npm and all other ...\nSO just need to change : webpack.config.jsAfter change webpack.config.js files Just add this line to top of your code .Now check everything is ok.
