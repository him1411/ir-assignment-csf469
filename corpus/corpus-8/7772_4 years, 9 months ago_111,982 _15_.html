I saw some method in java declared as:What\'s the meaning of @Nullable here? Does it mean the input could be null? \nWithout the annotation, the input can still be null, so I guess that\'s not just it?ThanksIt makes it clear that the method accepts null values, and that if you override the method, you should also accept null values.It also serves as a hint for code analyzers like FindBugs. For example, if such a method dereferences its argument without checking for null first, FindBugs will emit a warning.This annotation is commonly used to eliminate NullPointerExceptions. @Nullable is often says that this parameter might be null. Good example of such behaviour can be found in Google Guice. In this lightweight dependency injection framework you tell that this dependency might be null. If you would try to pass null and without annotation the framework would refuse to do it\'s job.What is more @Nullable might be used with @NotNull annotation. Here you can find some tips how to use them properly. Code inspection in IntelliJ checks the annotations and helps to debug the code.Different tools may interpret the meaning of @Nullable differently. For example, the Checker Framework and FindBugs handle @Nullable differently.An element annotated with @Nullable claims null value is perfectly valid to return (for methods), pass to (for parameters) and hold (for local variables and fields).An element annotated with @NotNull claims null value is forbidden to return (for methods), pass to (for parameters) and hold (for local variables and fields).There is a covariance-contravariance relationship between @Nullable and @NotNull when overriding/implementing methods with annotated declaration or parameters.Overriding/implementing methods with an annotated declaration:Overriding/implementing methods with annotated parameters:Example:Here getThreadUserContext method has to return an instance of TransactionParms. Bu that instance can be Null
