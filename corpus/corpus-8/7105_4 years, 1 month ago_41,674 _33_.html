In the following markdown code I want item 3 to start with list number 3. But because of the code block in between markdown starts this list item as a new list. Is there any way to prevent that behaviour?Desired output:Produced output:\nCode block\nProduces:item 2\nCode block\nNotice how in Macmade\'s solution, you can see an extra line of code above the "Code block". Here are two better solutions:Indent the code block by an extra 4 spaces (so usually 8, in this nested list example, 12). This will put the code in a <pre> element. On SO, you can even specify syntax highlight with a\n<!-- language: lang-js --> indented by 4 spaces (+1 here due to the nested list).item 2item 3Or, just put the Code block within backticks and indent by 4 spaces (here, 1 extra because of the nested list). You\'ll get a regular indented text paragraph, with a <code> element inside it. This one you can\'t syntax-highlight:item 2Code blockitem 3Note: you can click "edit" on this answer to see the underlying Markdown code. No need to save ;)As an extension to existing answers. For those trying to continue a numbered list after something other than a code block. For example a second paragraph. Just indent the second paragraph by at least 1 space. Markdown:Output:twothreeIf you use tab to indent the code block it will shape the entire block into one line. To avoid this you need to use html ordered list.  Code blockMacmade\'s solution doesn\'t work for me anymore on my Jekyll instance on Github Pages anymore but I found this solution on an issue for the kramdown github repo. For OP\'s example it would look like this:Solved my issues handily.Put the list numbers in parentheses instead of followed by a period. (1) item 1\n(2) item 2\n\ncode block\n\n(3) item 3I solved this problem on Github separating the indented sub-block with a newline, for instance, you write the item 1, then hit enter twice (like if it was a new paragraph), indent the block and write what you want (a block of code, text, etc).
