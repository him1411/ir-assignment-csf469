I\'ve got the following function which compiled cleanly previously but generates a warning with Xcode 8."Expression of type "UIViewController?" is unused".Why is it saying this and is there a way to remove it?The code executes as expected.popViewController(animated:) returns UIViewController?, and the compiler is giving that warning since you aren\'t capturing the value. The solution is to assign it to an underscore:Before Swift 3, all methods had a "discardable result" by default. No warning would occur when you did not capture what the method returned.In order to tell the compiler that the result should be captured, you had to add @warn_unused_result before the method declaration. It would be used for methods that have a mutable form (ex. sort and sortInPlace). You would add @warn_unused_result(mutable_variant="mutableMethodHere") to tell the compiler of it.However, with Swift 3, the behavior is flipped. All methods now warn that the return value is not captured. If you want to tell the compiler that the warning isn\'t necessary, you add @discardableResult before the method declaration.If you don\'t want to use the return value, you have to explicitly tell the compiler by assigning it to an underscore:Motivation for adding this to Swift 3:The UIKit API appears to be behind on this, not adding @discardableResult for the perfectly normal (if not more common) use of popViewController(animated:) without capturing the return value. When life gives you lemons, make an extension:Note that adding something like @discardableResult func pop(animated: Bool) -> UIViewController? will result in the same warning you are trying to avoid.With the extension you can now write:Edit: Added popToRoot too.In Swift 3, ignoring the return value of a function that has a declared return value results in a warning.One way to opt out of this is to mark the function with the @discardableResult attribute. Since you don\'t have control over this function, that won\'t work.The other method to get rid of the warning is to assign the value to _. This tells the compiler you know the method returns a value but you don\'t want to retain it in memory.Although it work correctly if kept as it is but the number of warning increases.The solution is to simply replace it with underscore ( _ ) though it seems to be ugly.Another way is you can unwrapped the self.navigationController? value and call the popViewController function.
