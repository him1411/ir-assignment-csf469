I am trying to follow along Michael Hartl\'s Rails tutorial but I\'ve run across an error. I signed up on Github and issued a new SSH key and made a new repository. But when I enter the next line into the terminal I get the following error:Just wondered if anybody else has run across this problem?TL;DR you should just update the existing remote:Long version:As the error message indicates, there is already a remote configured with the same name. So you can either add the new remote with a different name or update the existing one if you don\'t need it:To add a new remote, called for example github instead of origin (which obviously already exists in your system), do the following:Remember though, everywhere in the tutorial you see "origin" you should replace it with "github". For example $ git push origin master should now be $ git push github master.However, if you want to see what that origin which already exists is, you can do a $ git remote -v. If you think this is there by some error, you can update it like so:In Short,Worked !Cheers!For those of you running into the ever so common error "fatal: remote origin already exists.", or when trying to remove origin and you get "error: could not remove config section remote.origin", what you need to do is to set the origin manually. Window\'s POSH~Git for Windows PowerShell (and GitHub for Windows\' app) has a problem with this.I ran into this, like I do so often, again when setting up my octopress.  So, here\'s how I got it working. First, check your remotes:You\'ll first note that my origin has no url.  Any attempt to remove it, rename it, etc all fails.So, change the url manually:Then you can confirm it worked by running git remote -v again:This has fixed dozens of git repos I\'ve had issues with, GitHub, BitBucket GitLab, etc.You can see what remote repositories you are configured to connect to viaThat will return a list in this format:That might help you figure out what the original \'origin\' pointed to.If you want to keep the remote connection that you see with the -v, but still want to follow the Rails tutorial without having to remember \'github\' (or some other name) for your tutorial\'s repo, you can rename your other repository with the command:as in:You should then be able to resume your tutorial.First do a:then and voila! Worked for me!In the special case that you are creating a new repository starting from an old repository that you used as template (Don\'t do this if this is not your case). Completely erase the git files of the old repository so you can start a new one:And then restart a new git repository as usual:If you need to check which remote repos you have connected with your local repos, theres a cmd:Now if you want to remove the remote repo (say, origin) then what you can do is:That error message indicates that you already have a remote in your git directory.\nIf you are satisfied with that remote, your can push your code. If not or if you can\'t push just:Voil\xc3\xa0 !if you already add project for another storage, like you upload to github and then you upload to bitbucket then it shows this type of Error.How to remove Error: delete git-hub file in your project and then repeat the following steps...The concept of remote is simply the URL of your remote repository.The origin is an alias pointing to that URL. So instead of writing the whole URL every single time we want to push something to our repository, we just use this alias and run:git push -u origin masterTelling to git to push our code from our local master branch to the remote origin repository. Whenever we clone a repository, git creates this alias for us by default. Also whenever we create a new repository, we just create it our self. Whatever the case it is, we can always change this name to anything we like, running this:Since it is stored on the client side of the git application (on our machine) changing it will not affect anything in our development process, neither at our remote repository. Remember, it is only a name pointing to an address.The only thing that changes here by renaming the alias, is that we have to declare this new name every time we push something to our repository. git push -u my-remote-alias masterObviously a single name can not point to two different addresses. That\'s why you get this error message. There is already an alias named origin at your local machine. To see how many aliases you have and what are they, you can initiate this command:This will show you all the aliases you have plus the corresponding URLs.You can remove them as well if you like running this:Happy coding.It can also happen if you run the command in directory without git initialized. If that\'s the case run first:for using git you have to be rootif not then use sudo for removing origin : git remote remove originfor adding origin : git remote add origin http://giturl
