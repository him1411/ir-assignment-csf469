It keeps inserting tabs which later messes up my code.  How can I make it stop doing this? Obviously, it is not just when I hit the tab key, but other times as well.  I want it to use 4 spaces. Go to the Preferences menu under Settings and select Language/Tab Settings, depending on your version. Earlier versions use Tab Settings. Later versions use Language. Click the Replace with Space check box.  Set the size to 4.\nSee docs: http://npp-community.tuxfamily.org/documentation/notepad-user-manual/settings/preferencesIn my Notepad++ 7.2.2, the Preferences section it\'s a bit different.The option is located at: Settings / Preferences / Language / Replace by space as in the Screenshot.
