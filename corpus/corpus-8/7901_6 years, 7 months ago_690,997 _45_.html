I have following divHow to align the image so as to be located in the middle and center of div ?JSFiddleSeems to me that you also wanted that image to be vertically centered within the container. (I didn\'t see any answer that provided that)Working Fiddle:HTMLCSSNote: this solution is good to align any element within any element.\nfor IE7, when applying the .Centered class on block elements, you will have to use another trick to get the inline-block working. (that because IE6/IE7 dont play well with inline-block on block elements)This can also be done using the Flexbox layout:STATIC SIZE\nDYNAMIC SIZE\nI found the example in this article, which does a great job explaining the how to use layout.Basically, setting right and left margin to auto will cause the image to center align.I still had some issues with other solution presented here. Finally this worked best for me:css3:You can read more about that approach at this page.This would be a simpler approachsetting the img to display:inline-block while having set the superior div to text-align:center will do the job tooEDIT: to those folks who are playing with display:inline-block >>> don\'t forget that e.g. two divs likereally have no spaces between them (as seen here).Just basic to avoid these (inline block inherent) gaps between them. These gaps can be seen between every two words I\'m writing right now! :-) So .. hope this helps some of you.I\'ve tried many approaches but only this one works for multiple inline elements inside a container div. Here is code to align everything in div at middle.Sample code is here: https://jsfiddle.net/yogendrasinh/2vq0c68m/ Try this minimal code:And CSS:many answer suggests to use margin:0 auto but this works only when the element you trying to  make centered is not floating on left or right, that is float css attribute isn\'t set. In order to do this apply display attribute to table-cell and then apply margin of left and right to auto so your style will look like style="display:table-cell;margin:0 auto;"HTML:CSS:For center horizontally Just putAnother method:For center vertically Just put:This worked for me:Well, we are in 2016... why not use flexbox?\nIt\'s also responsive. Enjoy.\nUse positioning. The following worked for me...With zoom to the center of the image (image fills the div):Without zoom to the center of the image (image does not fill the div):You can take a look on this solution: Centering horizontally and vertically an image in a boxA simple way would be creating separate styles for both the div and the image and then position them independently. Say if I want to set my image position to 50%, then I would have code which looks like the following....this did the trick for me.  \'Note: do not have a css class assocaited to \'BrandImage\' in this caseCSS:Modify height value for your need.
