I am aware of the availability of Context.getApplicationContext() and View.getContext(), through which I can actually call Context.getPackageName() to retrieve the package name of an application.They work if I call from a method to which a View or an Activity object is available, but if I want to find the package name from a totally independent class with no View or Activity, is there a way to do that (directly or indirectly)?An idea is to have a static variable in your main activity, instantiated to be the package name.  Then just reference that variable.You will have to initialize it in the main activity\'s onCreate() method:Global to the class:Then..You can then access it via Main.PACKAGE_NAME.If you use the gradle-android-plugin to build your app, then you can useto retrieve the package name from any scope, incl. a static one.If with the word "anywhere" you mean without having an explicit Context (for example from a background thread)  you should define a class in your project like:Then in your manifest you need to add this class to the Name field at the Application tab. Or edit the xml and putand then from anywhere you can callHope it helps.If you use gradle build, use this: BuildConfig.APPLICATION_ID to get the package name of the application.Create a java module to be initially run when starting your app. This module would be extending the android Application class and would initialize any global app variables and also contain app-wide utility routines - Of course, this could include logic to obtain the package name from the android system; however, the above is smaller, faster and cleaner code than obtaining it from android.Be sure to place an entry in your AndroidManifest.xml file to tell android to run your application module before running any activities -Then, to obtain the package name from any other module, enterUsing an application module also gives you a context for modules that need but don\'t have a context.You can get your package name like so:Here are the options:
