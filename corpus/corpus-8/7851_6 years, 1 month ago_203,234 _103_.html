I am trying to set up FTP on Amazon Cloud Server, but without luck...\nI search over net and there is no concrete steps how to do it...Since there is no steps on web, can someone help me finding it or write it here?I usually use dedicated server or shared hosting, but I am not that good with those Cloud servers...I found those commands to run:But I don\'t know where to write them...Help?Jaminto did a great job of answering the question, but I recently went through the process myself and wanted to expand on Jaminto\'s answer.I\'m assuming that you already have an EC2 instance created and have associated an Elastic IP Address to it.\nSSH to your EC2 server.  Type:This should install vsftpd.\nNext, you\'ll need to open up the FTP ports on your EC2 server.  Log in to the AWS EC2 Management Console and select Security Groups from the navigation tree on the left.  Select the security group assigned to your EC2 instance.  Then select the Inbound tab, then click Edit:Add two Custom TCP Rules with port ranges 20-21 and 1024-1048.  For Source, you can select \'Anywhere\'.  If you decide to set Source to your own IP address, be aware that your IP address might change if it is being assigned via DHCP.Edit your vsftpd conf file by typing:Disable anonymous FTP by changing this line:to Then add the following lines to the bottom of the vsftpd.conf file:Your vsftpd.conf file should look something like the following - except make sure to replace the pasv_address with your public facing IP address:To save changes, press escape, then  type :wq, then hit enter.Restart vsftpd by typing:You should see a message that looks like:\nIf this doesn\'t work, try:If you take a peek at /etc/vsftpd/user_list, you\'ll see the following:This is basically saying, "Don\'t allow these users FTP access."  vsftpd will allow FTP access to any user not on this list.So, in order to create a new FTP account, you may need to create a new user on your server.  (Or, if you already have a user account that\'s not listed in /etc/vsftpd/user_list, you can skip to the next step.)Creating a new user on an EC2 instance is pretty simple.  For example, to create the user \'bret\', type:Here\'s what it will look like:At this point, your FTP users are not restricted to their home directories. That\'s not very secure, but we can fix it pretty easily.  Edit your vsftpd conf file again by typing:Un-comment out the line:It should look like this once you\'re done: Restart the vsftpd server again like so:All done!vsftpd doesn\'t automatically start when your server boots.  If you\'re like me, that means that after rebooting your EC2 instance, you\'ll feel a moment of terror when FTP seems to be broken - but in reality, it\'s just not running!.  Here\'s a handy way to fix that:Alternatively, if you are using redhat, another way to manage your services is by using this nifty graphic user interface to control which services should automatically start:Now vsftpd will automatically start up when your server boots up.* NOTE: Iman Sedighi has posted a more elegant solution for restricting users access to a specific directory.  Please refer to his excellent solution posted as an answer *You might want to create a user and restrict their FTP access to a specific folder, such as /var/www.  In order to do this, you\'ll need to change the user\'s default home directory:In this specific example, it\'s typical to give the user permissions to the \'www\' group, which is often associated with the /var/www folder:  To enable passive ftp on an EC2 server, you need to configure the ports that your ftp server should use for inbound connections, then open a list of available ports for the ftp client data connections.  I\'m not that familiar with linux, but the commands you posted are the steps to install the ftp server, configure the ec2 firewall rules (through the AWS API), then configure the ftp server to use the ports you allowed on the ec2 firewall.So this step installs the ftp client (VSFTP)> yum install vsftpdThese steps configure the ftp clientbut the other two steps are easier done through the amazon console under EC2 Security groups.  There you need to configure the security group that is assigned to your server to allow connections on ports 20,21, and 1024-1048Great Article... worked like a breeze on Amazon Linux AMI.Two more useful commands:To change the default FTP upload folderStep 1: Step 2: Create a new entry at the bottom of the page:To apply read, write, delete permission to the files under folder so that you can manage using a FTP deviceThanks @clone45 for the nice solution. But I had just one important problem with Appendix b of his solution. Immediately after I changed the home directory to var/www/html then I couldn\'t connect to server through ssh and sftp because it always shows following errors or in FileZilla I received this error:But I could access the server through normal FTP connection.If you encountered to the same error then just undo the appendix b of @clone45 solution by set the default home directory for the user:But when you set user\'s default home directory then the user have access to many other folders outside /var/www/http. So to secure your server then follow these steps:1- Make sftponly group\nMake a group for all users you want to restrict their access to only ftp and sftp access to var/www/html. to make the group:2- Jail the chroot\nTo restrict access of this group to the server via sftp you must jail the chroot to not to let group\'s users to access any folder except html folder inside its home directory. to do this open /etc/ssh/sshd.config in the vim with sudo.\nAt the end of the file please comment this line:And then add this line below that:So we replaced subsystem with internal-sftp. Then add following lines below it:After adding this line I saved my changes and then restart ssh service by:3- Add the user to sftponly group\nAny user you want to restrict their access must be a member of sftponly group. Therefore we join it to sftponly by:\nsudo usermod -G sftponly username4- Restrict user access to just var/www/html\nTo restrict user access to just var/www/html folder we need to make a directory in the home directory (with name of \'html\') of that user and then mount /var/www to /home/username/html as follow:5- Set write access \nIf the user needs write access to /var/www/html, then you must jail the user at /var/www which must have root:root ownership and permissions of 755. You then need to give /var/www/html ownership of root:sftponly and permissions of 775 by adding following lines:6- Block shell access\nIf you want restrict access to not access to shell to make it more secure then just change the default shell to bin/false as follow:In case you have ufw enabled, remember add ftp:It took me 2 days to realise that I enabled ufw.It will not be ok until you add your user to the group www by the following commands:This solves the permission problem.Set the default path by adding this:Don\'t forget to update your iptables firewall if you have one to allow the 20-21 and 1024-1048 ranges in.Do this from /etc/sysconfig/iptables Adding lines like this:-A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 20:21 -j ACCEPT-A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 1024:1048 -j ACCEPTAnd restart iptables with the command:sudo service iptables restartI\'ve simplified clone45 steps:Open the ports as he mentionedThis is a great write-up.  Note that you will probably need to add the user you created to the "FTP" usergroup:> gpasswd -a <usr> ftpI followed clone45\'s answer all the way to the end. A great article! Since I needed the FTP access to install plug-ins to one of my wordpress sites, I changed the home directory to /var/www/mysitename. Then I continued to add my ftp user to the apache(or www) group like this:After this I still saw this error on WP\'s plugin installation page: "Unable to locate WordPress Content directory (wp-content)". Searched and found this solution on a wp.org Q&A session: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/unable-to-locate-wordpress-content-directory-wp-content and added the following to the end of wp-config.php:After this my WP plugin was installed successfully.maybe worth mentioning in addition to clone45\'s answer: The vsftpd version that comes with Ubuntu 12.04 Precise does not\n  permit chrooted local users to write by default. By default you will\n  have this in /etc/vsftpd.conf:In order to allow local users to write, you need to add the following parameter:Note:\nIssues with write permissions may show up as following FileZilla errors:References:\nFixing Write Permissions for Chrooted FTP Users in vsftpd\nVSFTPd stopped working after updateFileZila is good FTP tool to setup with Amazon Cloud. You need to do these step only 1 time, later it will upload content to the same IP address and same site.
