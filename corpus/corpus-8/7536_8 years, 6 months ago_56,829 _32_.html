I\'m getting married on April 4th, 2009. My future wife has agreed to let me have actual code on top of the wedding cake. Woot!There isn\'t very much room, four, maybe five lines (it\'s only a 6" cake because the main cake is a bunch of cupcakes).Any language is okay, Java, JavaScript, XML.A lot of the people attending the wedding have coded before, so they\'ll "get it".My name is \'Robert\' and her name is \'Tiffany\', some sort of creative use of those names would be cool.What code would you have on your wedding cake?More code cakes (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6)You can keep it simple also, and just have: I don\'t even think you need to say more than that. It\'s simple and gets the point across. :)What\'s a wife ? :)Pesto:It\'s a subclass of girlfriend that has unlimited access to your private members but doesn\'t make good use of it, hogs all available resources, and spawns child processes that you aren\'t allowed to kill off.A nice little marital crontab:I\'d simply have On Error Resume NextOK, so I\'ve got no idea about SQL, but someone with knowledge must be able to knock something up with the rather appropriate keywords like SELECT, JOIN, UNION, LIKE etc.while( true ) love++;It isn\'t technically code but I would put simply:F1Be careful when trying to cast a girlfriend as a wife. There are several interfaces supported by iGirlFriend that aren\'t supported by iWife.What about some Python?Don\'t have an answer for you wedding cake, but your 40th anniversary cake code should be in Ruby...[fetches coat]Y = \xce\xbbf\xc2\xb7(\xce\xbbx\xc2\xb7f (x x)) (\xce\xbbx\xc2\xb7f (x x))In case you don\'t get this one it is essentially saying that Tiffany is the perfect complement to Robert.Or if that\'s too long:girlfriend attacks you: \n    save -vs- marriage...roll:2\nYou are now marred.abort();Only joking of course ;)If I was you, I would think about what a big, stinky nerd I was being and not go through with this :). Leave coding at home on your wedding day, your wife (and all the guests) will thank you.I had the following on my grooms cake back in 2006.  I think they changed their tab sizes halfway through it though.alt text http://i42.tinypic.com/bi9fma.jpg
