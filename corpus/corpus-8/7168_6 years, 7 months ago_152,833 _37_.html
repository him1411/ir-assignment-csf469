I\'ve been trying to re-implement an HTML5 image uploader like the one on the Mozilla Hacks site, but that works with WebKit browsers. Part of the task is to extract an image file from the canvas object and append it to a FormData object for upload.The issue is that while canvas has the toDataURL function to return a representation of the image file, the FormData object only accepts File or Blob objects from the File API.The Mozilla solution used the following Firefox-only function on canvas:...which isn\'t available on WebKit browsers. The best solution I could think of is to find some way to convert a Data URI into a File object, which I thought might be part of the File API, but I can\'t for the life of me find something to do that.Is it possible? If not, any alternatives?Thanks.After playing around with a few things, I managed to figure this out myself.First of all, this will convert a dataURI to a Blob:From there, appending the data to a form such that it will be uploaded as a file is easy:BlobBuilder and ArrayBuffer are now deprecated, here is the top comment\'s code updated with Blob constructor:This one works in iOS and Safari.You need to use Stoive\'s ArrayBuffer solution but you can\'t use BlobBuilder, as vava720 indicates, so here\'s the mashup of both.Thanks to @Stoive and @vava720 I combined the two in this way, avoiding to use the deprecated BlobBuilder and ArrayBufferFirefox has canvas.toBlob() and canvas.mozGetAsFile() methods. But other browsers does not. We can get dataurl from canvas and then convert dataurl to blob object.Here is my dataURLtoBlob() function. It\'s very short.Use this function with FormData to handle your canvas or dataurl.for example:Also, you can create a HTMLCanvasElement.prototype.toBlob method for non gecko engine browser.Now canvas.toBlob() works for all modern browsers not only firefox.\nfor example:The evolving standard looks to be canvas.toBlob() not canvas.getAsFile() as Mozilla hazarded to guess.I don\'t see any browser yet supporting it :(Thanks for this great thread!Also, anyone trying the accepted answer should be careful with BlobBuilder as I\'m finding support to be limited (and namespaced):Were you using another library\'s polyfill for BlobBuilder?My preferred way is canvas.toBlob()But anyhow here is yet another way to convert base64 to a blob using fetch ^^,can be used without the try catch. Thankx to check_ca. Great work. The original answer by Stoive is easily fixable by changing the last line to accommodate Blob:make it simple :DHere is an ES6 version of Stoive\'s answer:Usage: toDataURL gives you a string and you can put that string to a hidden input.I had exactly the same problem as Ravinder Payal, and I\'ve found the answer. Try this:
