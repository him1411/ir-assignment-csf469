Is checking for key existence in HashMap always necessary?I have a HashMap with say a 1000 entries and I am looking at improving the efficiency.\nIf the HashMap is being accessed very frequently, then checking for the key existence at every access will lead to a large overhead. Instead if the key is not present and hence an exception occurs, I can catch the exception. (when I know that this will happen rarely). This will reduce accesses to the HashMap by half.This might not be a good programming practice, but it will help me reduce the number of accesses. Or am I missing something here?[Update] I do not have null values in the HashMap.Do you ever store a null value? If not, you can just do:Otherwise, you could just check for existence if you get a null value returned:You won\'t gain anything by checking that the key exists. This is the code of HashMap:Just check if the return value for get() is different from null.This is the HashMap source code.Resources :Better way is to use containsKey method of HashMap . Tomorrow soembody will add null to the map , you should differentiate between key there and key has null value.Do you mean that you\'ve got code like if(map.containsKey(key)) doSomethingWith(map.get(key))all over the place ? Then you should simply check whether map.get(key) returned null and that\'s it.\nBy the way, HashMap doesn\'t throw exceptions for missing keys, it returns null instead. The only case where containsKey is needed is when you\'re storing null values, to distinguish between a null value and a missing value, but this is usually considered bad practice.I usually use the idiomThis means you only hit the map twice if the key is missingJust use containsKey() for clarity. It\'s fast and keeps the code clean and readable. The whole point of HashMaps is that the key lookup is fast, just make sure the hashCode() and equals() are properly implemented.
