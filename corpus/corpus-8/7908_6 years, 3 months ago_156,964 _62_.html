I\'m running Eclipse\'s Helios EE bundle on Linux, to which I added the subversive plugins, the m2e maven integration and the mylin connector for Trac. For the last couple of weeks I\'ve been trying to install updates, and every time I get back a message likeThe latest one wasWhat does it all mean and how do I fix that? If Eclipse has been able to contact the repositories to check for new files why isn\'t it able to download those files from those some repositories? Or does the error message mean something entirely different?Go to Help → Install new software → Here uncheck \xe2\x80\x9cContact all update sites during install to find required software\xe2\x80\x9d Eclipse will prompt that the content isn\'t authorized or something like that. just ignore and continue. then everything will be OK.At least this trick resolved my problems similar like this:An error occurred while collecting items to be installed session\n  context was:(profile=epp.package.jee,\n  phase=org.eclipse.equinox.internal.p2.engine.phases.Collect, operand=,\n  action=).

A comment by Richard Shu there describes several available solutions:As Mauro said: "you have to remove and re-add the Eclipse Project Update\n  site, so that its metadata are re-calculated."  - works as workaroundAnother workaround I found, is to edit the pre-defined URL link by adding\n  just a trailing \xe2\x80\x9c/\xe2\x80\x9d to the update site URL.The third workaround I discoverd accidentaly is to do nothing, but to\n  uncheck the \'Contact all update sites during install to find required software\'\n  before checking the URL link.Option #2 worked for me. I went to Window > Preferences > Install/Update > Available Software Sites, then for each enabled site I added a / to the end of the URL (if it wasn\'t there already), then clicked Reload.What you most likely has encountered is a bug in Eclipse. Luckily the solution is simple enough, remove the update site and install it again. Me helped the following solution:It was taken from this link Devon Hillard\'s Digital SanctuaryThe updates that Eclipse has found have dependencies that need to be downloaded during the installation but which cannot currently be found. This may be a temporary network problem or some repo server being down (if you\'re lucky). But unfortunately, sometimes this simply means that the dependencies are not contained in the repositories that Eclipse is trying to download them from, at least that is what i have encountered every now and then (not annoyingly often though).So either the failure is temporary and you should try again or you are out of luck and may have to use a manual installation procedure (download and unpack in plugins folder).Maybe you can increase your success rate by adding the repositories that supposedly contain the artifacts in the \'Available Software Sites\' dialogue.I\'m not 100% sure of that though. In fact, I would like to find a \'perfect\' answer to this question myself.What usually works quite well is installing plugins via the Eclipse Marketplace.Oh and sometimes this helps: Uncheck some options (like OSGI in your case).I am trying to make an update for Spring STS 3.6.3 to the version 3.6.4 in Eclipse Luna (4.4.1) and I tried the following solution and it worked for me:Simple!!!!!!!!Right click on eclipse folder and go to properties.\nUncheck checkbox "read only" if checked.\napply changes.click oK.after go to  Help>Install new software>Uncheck \xe2\x80\x9cContact all update sites during install to find required software\xe2\x80\x9d.On Juno (Build id: 20130225-0426), exporting update sites from \'Available software Sites", fixing the trailing "/" in the exported xml as described above, removing all sites and importing the fixed xml worked for me.\nDescribed hereEclipse Kepler (at least) allows to specifically reload a software site in the Preferences > Install/Update > Available Software Sites dialog.It is a cleaner / simpler solution than the workaround explained above (add trailing slash) and it worked for me...Note: a link to this dialog is also available in the Install New Software dialog.I had the same issue with the bellow error:And the solution is to disable Oracle Enterprise Pack for eclipseHow to disable this package see the picture bellow:\nNone of the other answers worked for me (Windows 10, Eclipse Neon). Running Eclipse as Administrator fixed it.I had the same problem but while doing updates. I solved it by For Eclipse Neon I had the mentioned error for Mylyn.To make it work I had to enable the Mylyn Sites that were disabled in the Available Software Sites preference pane. They were unnamed (empty name) but recognizable by their Location column.After saving, updating Mylyn and restarting eclipse, the Available Software Sites looked like this:\nThe workaround I found, is to edit the pre-defined URL link by adding just a trailing \xe2\x80\x9c/\xe2\x80\x9d to the update site URL.Option #2 worked for me. I went to Window > Preferences > Install/Update > Available Software Sites, then for each enabled site I added a / to the end of the URL (if it wasn\'t there already), then clicked Reload.In my case, the only solution was a manual installation (the plugin\'s page explained how to install it from the Eclipse\'s Help menu and, as an alternative, were to unpack the zip manually).Tried to install Google App Engine SDK, and received similar errors.\nNone of the answers worked for me.\nI noticed download hangs around 999K, while the full download was about 100MB.  Somehow after trying for the sixth or seventh time, the problem fixed itself :)\nSo if none of these work for you..  try at least several times, maybe server is overloaded :)Updating from Kepler SR1 to Kepler SR2 solved this for me. \nI\'ve just installed over the existing installation, so none of my settings were harmed.Win8.1, 64bitIn the end, something does have to be removed.  I would like to add to the other answers: be sure to check for conflicts.  For me, the EMF (Eclipse Modeling Framework) had somehow gotten out of hand as I had multiple versions listed in windows/preferences.  Removing the conflict allowed for my updates to proceed as normal.In my case I was getting the above mentioned errors only for a particular update site and eclipse-java-mars-R. Other update sites were allowing me to update, and, using other versions of Eclipse I was able to install from the update site which was causing problems for my Java Mars R Eclipse.Deleting the cache folder in /Users/myname/.eclipse/org.eclipse.oomph.p2 solved the problem (my coworker, not me, came up with this solution)I just got it when installing Maven support in Eclipse for Java EE developers Helios. Solution was just to run Eclipse as Administrator, update went fine afterIn my case I was selecting Work with: --All Available Sites--Choosing instead only one specific site from the list did the trick (Neon.2 64bit on Windows)I had the same problem on windows 10.\nMy eclipse version was installed from an exe, downloaded from eclipse site.What solved for me was to use the zip version instead:\nhttp://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/Me helped the following solution:Go to Help->Software Updates, then select the Available Software tab and click the Manage Sites button\nUse the Export button to export the sites to a bookmarks.xml file\nOpen the bookmarks.xml file in your favorite text editor, and add a trailing \xe2\x80\x9c/\xe2\x80\x9d to any of the site urls which are missing the \xe2\x80\x9c/\xe2\x80\x9d or remove on the end. Save the changes.\nBack in the Manage Sites window within Eclipse, select all of the sites and click the Remove button\nNow, click Import and load in the edited bookmarks.xml fileFor Oxygen, see Eclipse Community Forums:"In my case Oxygen had update URL for Buidship as:\nhttp://download.eclipse.org/buildship/updates/e46/releases/2.x Note: that e46 is Neon version per https://github.com/eclipse/buildship/blob/master/docs/user/Installation.mdonce I updated URL to Oxygen version (e47):\nhttp://download.eclipse.org/buildship/updates/e47/releases/2.x update was successful"As Mauro said: "you have to remove and re-add the Eclipse Project Update site, so that its metadata are re-calculated." - works as workaround
