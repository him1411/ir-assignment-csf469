How can I remove duplicate values from a multi-dimensional array in PHP?Example array:Here is another way. No intermediate variables are saved. We used this to de-duplicate results from a variety of overlapping queries.Since 5.2.9 you can use array_unique() if you use the SORT_REGULAR flag like so:This makes the function compare elements for equality as if $a == $b were being used, which is perfect for your case.OutputKeep in mind, though, that the documentation states:array_unique() is not intended to work on multi dimensional arrays.I had a similar problem but I found a 100% working solution for it.Another way. Will preserve keys as well.The user comments on the array_unique() documentation have many solutions to this. Here is one of them:kenrbnsn at rbnsn dot com\n  27-Sep-2005 12:09Yet another Array_Unique for multi-demensioned arrays. I\'ve only tested this on two-demensioned arrays, but it could probably be generalized for more, or made to use recursion.This function uses the serialize, array_unique, and unserialize functions to do the work.This is from http://ca3.php.net/manual/en/function.array-unique.php#57202.If "remove duplicates" means "remove duplicates, but let one there", a solution might be to apply the array_unique(...) on the "identifier column" first and then to remove in the original array all the keys, that have been removed from the column array:The result is:if you need to eliminate duplicates on specific keys, such as a mysqli id, here\'s a simple funcitonBonus Points\nYou can pass an array of keys and add an outer foreach, but it will be 2x slower per additional key.if you have an array like this:(users is the name of the array)and you want to delete duplicates...then:can be a solution :PAn easy to read solution, probably not the most efficient:Just use SORT_REGULAR option as second parameter.An alternative to serialize and unique\n\n*/If you have an array like thisand you want to get arrays like this:ora following code can helpI\'ve given this problem a lot of thought and have determined that the optimal solution should follow two rules.With that in mind and given all of PHP\'s quirks, below is the solution I came up with. Unlike some of the other answers, it has the ability to remove elements based on whatever key(s) you want. The input array is expected to be numeric keys.The only drawback is that the keys are not in order when the iteration completes. This isn\'t a problem if you\'re subsequently using only foreach loops, but if you need to use a for loop, you can put $input = array_values($input); after the above to renumber the keys.As people are saying array_unique() is very slow, here is a snippet I use for one level multidimensional array.Reference first user contributed note of array_unique() function page in php.netLots of person asked me how to make Unique multidimensional array. I have taken reference from your comment and it helps me.First of All, Thanks to @jeromegamez @daveilers for your solution. But every time i gave the answer, they asked me how this \'serialize\' and \'unserialize\' works. That\'s why i want to share the reason of this with you so that it will help more people to understand the concept behind this. I am explaining why we use \'serialize\' and \'unserialize\' in steps :Step 1: Convert the multidimensional array to one-dimensional arrayTo convert the multidimensional array to a one-dimensional array, first generate byte stream representation of all the elements (including nested arrays) inside the array. serialize() function can generate byte stream representation of a value. To generate byte stream representation of all the elements, call serialize() function inside array_map() function as a callback function. The result will be a one dimensional array no matter how many levels the multidimensional array has.Step 2: Make the values uniqueTo make this one dimensional array unique, use array_unique() function.Step 3: Revert it to the multidimensional arrayThough the array is now unique, the values looks like byte stream representation. To revert it back to the multidimensional array, use unserialize() function.Thanks again for all this.
