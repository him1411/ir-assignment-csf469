How do I check which version of sbt I\'m running?I have the bash file set up that uses sbt-launch.jar, and it works, but    only shows the "project version" (0.1) and   does nothing.This prints the sbt version used in your current project, or if it is a multi-module project for each module.You may also want to use sbt about that (copying Mark Harrah\'s comment):The about command was added recently to try to succinctly print the\n  most relevant information, including the sbt version.Running the command, "sbt sbt-version" will simply output your current directory and the version number.In SBT 0.13 and above, you can use the sbtVersion task (as pointed out by @steffen) or about command (as pointed out by @mark-harrah)There\'s a difference how the sbtVersion task works in and outside a SBT project. When in a SBT project, sbtVersion displays the version of SBT used by the project and its subprojects.It\'s set in project/build.properties:The same task executed outside a SBT project shows the current version of the executable itself.When you\'re outside, the about command seems to be a better fit as it shows the sbt version as well as Scala\'s and available plugins.You may want to run \'help about\' to read its documentation:For the sbtVersion setting, the inspect command can help.The version setting that people seem to expect to inspect to know the SBT version is to set The version/revision of the current module.When used in a SBT project the tasks/settings may show different outputs.You can use sbt about
