What is the 'instanceof' operator used for? I learned that Java has the instanceof operator. Can you elaborate where it is used and what are its advantages?Basically, you check if an object is an instance of a specific class.\nYou normally use it, when you have a reference or parameter to an object that is of a super class or interface type and need to know whether the actual object has some other type (normally more concrete).Example:Note that if you have to use that operator very often it is generally a hint that your design has some flaws. So in a well designed application you should have to use that operator as little as possible (of course there are exceptions to that general rule).instanceof is used to check if an object is an instance of a class, an instance of a subclass, or an instance of a class that implements a particular interface.Read more from the Oracle language definition here.instanceof can be used to determine the actual type of an object:Yet a design using instanceof is usually considered as a bad design. In a good design, if an object of actual type C is supposed to be used as an object of type A then you are not supposed to know if this object is actually an object of type C or D! Otherwise it means you treat C and D differently even though they have some common parameters.Therefore, avoid using instanceof as possible as you can and use polymorphism the way it should be, using the proper interfaces.instanceof is a keyword that can be used to test if an object is of a specified type.Example :Here is my source.
