I have a very simple jQuery Datepicker calendar:and of course in the HTML...Today\'s date is nicely highlighted for the user when they bring up the calendar, but how do I get jQuery to pre-populate the textbox itself with today\'s date on page load, without the user doing anything?  99% of the time, the today\'s date default will be what they want.Update: There are reports this no longer works in Chrome.This is concise and does the job:You must FIRST call datepicker() > then use \'setDate\' to get the current date.OR chain your setDate method call after your datepicker initialization, as noted in a comment on this answer It will NOT work with just NOTE : Acceptable setDate parameters are described hereseemed to work, but there might be a better way out there..The setDate() method sets the date and updates the associated control. Here is how:DemoAs mentioned in documentation, setDate() happily accepts the JavaScript Date object, number or a string:The new date may be a Date object or a string in the current date\n  format (e.g. \'01/26/2009\'), a number of days from today (e.g. +7) or a\n  string of values and periods (\'y\' for years, \'m\' for months, \'w\' for\n  weeks, \'d\' for days, e.g. \'+1m +7d\'), or null to clear the selected\n  date.In case you are wondering, setting defaultDate property in the constructor does not update the associated control.Set to today:Set to yesterday:And so on with any number of days before or after today\'s date.See jQuery UI \xe2\x80\xba Methods \xe2\x80\xba setDate.The solution is:Thanks grayghost!This code will assure to use your datepicker\'s format:No need to re-apply format, it uses the datepicker predefined-one by you on datepicker initialization (if you have assigned it!) ;)This one worked for me.David K Egghead\'s code worked perfectly, thank you!I also managed to trim it a little and it also worked:In order to set the datepicker to a certain default time (the current date in my case) on loading, AND then have the option to choose another date the syntax is :Just thought I\'d add my two cents. The picker is being used on an add/update form, so it needed to show the date coming from the database if editing an existing record, or show today\'s date if not. Below is working fine for me:Try this To pre-populate date, first you have to initialise datepicker, then pass setDate parameter value.Source: http://www.kelvinluck.com/assets/jquery/datePicker/v2/demo/datePickerDefaultToday.htmlAssign the prettyDate to the necessary control.You\'ve got 2 options:OPTION A)  Marks as "active" in your calendar, only when you click in the input.Js:Css:OPTION B) Input by default with today.\nYou\'ve to populate first the datepicker .This works better for me as sometimes I have troubles calling .datepicker(\'setDate\', new Date()); as it messes if if i have the datepicker already configured with parameters.
