I want to cp a directory but I do not want to overwrite any existing files even it they are older than the copied files. And I want to do it completely noniteractive as this will be a part of a Crontab Bash script. Any ideas?Taken from the man page:Example:Is what you want. See the man page.Consider using rsync.But this will update files if differ.As per commentswill ignore existing files completely.For people that find that don\'t have an \'n\' option (like me on RedHat) you can use cp -u to only write the file if the source is newer than the existing one (or there isn\'t an existing one).[edit] As mentioned in the comments, this will overwrite older files, so isn\'t exactly what the OP wanted. Use ceving\'s answer for that.This will work on RedHat:Updating and not overwriting is something different.Below answer is only for case of single file: I use linux alpine and cp -n not working (and false | cp -i ... too) so solution working in my case that i found is:In above example we check if env.js file exists and if not we copy env.example.js as env.js.
