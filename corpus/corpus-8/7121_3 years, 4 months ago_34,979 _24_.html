In Visual Studio 2013 I started getting the following error when trying to open C# files:I was having no issues all morning until I closed and re-opened a C# solution I was working on when this error started. I checked and this error happens when I open any C# project on this computer. I also tried opening the same project from my other computer and it works fine, so this is not a project error.I have not changed any VS settings, and I was just trying to open the package manager when this presented itself.I am at a loss and Dr. Google is not of much help thus far. After a reboot and some more research I found this post from a blog. The error described is not the same error I am seeing, however, it was close enough to warrant a try.Follow the steps:Open the folder: %LocalAppData%\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\12.0\\Rename the ComponentModelCache folderVisual studio will recreate the folder and all will be well with the world (or at least VS). I love a simple solution, and I hope its of use to anybody else who runs into this issue!I had a same problem  I did small change for Jake AnswerAnd it start to workIt happened to me again then this time I tried Web Essentials 2013.5 then Its start to work. Hope this will help you.Running windows 8.1, VS2013.3 and was able to find the folder.  Using the find function in 8.1 did not find the folder, but looking into the %APPDATA% folder I was directed to a Roaming folder.  Then by going one level up I did see the local folder in AppData.The final path where I was able to find the folder was the same as mentioned above.\nC:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\12.0Renaming the folder did work.I\'m afraid that answer is not necessarily correct. In my Windows 8.1 + Visual Studio 2013 for Web (12.0.30723.00 Update 3), there was no ComponentModelCache folder.Instead, what I did is ran all updates for VS2013 and then went to Control Panel/Programs and Features and performed a repair. Voila, that worked and I think may be a better overall solution.Yes I had this same problem with VS2013 and WIndows 7. Renamed folder C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\12.0I had this problem,Now I use Windows 8.1 and VS Express 2013 for web.\nRenaming the folder didn\'t help as it didn\'t change when I re-started VS.\nRepairing the programme didn\'t help nor did restarting the computer.What worked for me was just a basic uninstall & reinstall, sometimes a bit of common sense is needed :)Installing Web Essentials 2013 for VS 2013 as suggested here Project does not load after installing visual studio 2013 update 2 in Sagar S.\'s solution, worked for me with VS 2013 Update 4.Turning off a plugin called "Visual Assist" solved it for me.
