Does anybody know of a way to list up the "loaded plugins" in Vim?\nI know I should be keeping track of this kind of stuff myself but\nit would always be nice to be able to check the current status.Not a VIM user myself, so forgive me if this is totally offbase. But according to what I gather from the following VIM Tips site: The problem with :scriptnames, :commands, :functions, and similar Vim commands, is that they display information in a large slab of text, which is very hard to visually parse.To get around this, I wrote Headlights, a plugin that adds a menu to Vim showing all loaded plugins, TextMate style. The added benefit is that it shows plugin commands, mappings, files, and other bits and pieces.If you use Vundle, :PluginList.This lists the path of all plugins loaded when a file is opened with Vim.
