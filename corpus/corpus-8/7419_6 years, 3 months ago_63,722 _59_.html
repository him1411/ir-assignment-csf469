I can see that Ctrl+left/right jumps to the beginning/end of line. How to change this to Cmd+left/right arrow?In order to get Alt+left/right arrow working correctly for word jumping follow this article.Add in iTerm2 the following Profile Shortcut KeysHere is a visual for those who need itTo jump between words and start/end of lines in iTerm2 follow these steps:Move cursor one word leftMove cursor one word rightMove cursor to beginning of lineMove cursor to end of lineDelete wordDelete lineUndoDon\'t forget to remove the previous bindings:I see there\'s a lot of good answers already, but this should provide the closest to native OSX functionality as possible in more than just your shell. I verified that this works in ZSH, Bash, node, python -i, iex and irb/pry sessions (using rb-readline gem for readline, but should work for all).Open the iTerm preferences \xe2\x8c\x98+, and navigate to the Profiles tab (the Keys tab can be used, but adding keybinding to your profile allows you to save your profile and sync it to multiple computers) and keys sub-tab and enter the following:Delete all characters left of the cursor\xe2\x8c\x98+\xe2\x86\x90Delete Send Hex Codes:0x15 More compatible, but functionality sometimes is to delete the entire line rather than just the characters to the left of the curser. I personally use this and then overwrite my zsh bindkey for ^U to delete only stuff to the left of the cursor (see below).or0x18 0x7f Less compatible, doesn\'t work in node and won\'t work in zsh by default, see below to fix zsh (bash/irb/pry should be fine), performs desired functionality when it does work.Delete all characters right of the cursor\xe2\x8c\x98+fn+\xe2\x86\x90Delete or \xe2\x8c\x98+Delete\xe2\x86\x92 Send Hex Codes: 0x0bDelete one word to left of cursor\xe2\x8c\xa5+\xe2\x86\x90Delete Send Hex Codes:0x1b 0x08 Breaks in Elixir\'s IEX, seems to work fine everywhere elseor0x17 Works everywhere, but doesn\'t stop at normal word breaks in IRB and will instead delete until it sees a literal space.Delete one word to right of cursor\xe2\x8c\xa5+fn\xe2\x86\x90Delete or \xe2\x8c\xa5+Delete\xe2\x86\x92 Send Hex Codes: 0x01b 0x64Move cursor to the front of line\xe2\x8c\x98+\xe2\x86\x90 Send Hex Codes: 0x01Move cursor to the end of line\xe2\x8c\x98+\xe2\x86\x92 Send Hex Codes: 0x05Move cursor one word left\xe2\x8c\xa5+\xe2\x86\x90 Send Hex Codes: 0x1b 0x62Move cursor one word right\xe2\x8c\xa5+\xe2\x86\x92 Send Hex Codes: 0x1b 0x66Undo\xe2\x8c\x98+z Send Hex Codes: 0x1fRedo typically not bound in bash, zsh or readline, so we can set it to a unused hexcode which we can then fix in zsh\xe2\x87\xa7+\xe2\x8c\x98+Z or \xe2\x8c\x98+y Send Hex Codes: 0x18 0x1fNow how to fix any that don\'t workFor zsh, you can setup binding for the not yet functional \n\xe2\x8c\x98+\xe2\x86\x90Delete and \xe2\x87\xa7+\xe2\x8c\x98+Z/\xe2\x8c\x98+y by running:I\'m unable to find a solution for adding redo in bash or readline, so if anyone know a solution for either of those, please comment below and I\'ll try to add them in.For anyone looking for the lookup table on how to convert key sequences to hex, I find this table very helpful.Follow the tutorial you listed above for setting up your key preferences in iterm2.  To set cmd-left to line start, create the new shortcut key.  Choose "Send escape sequence" as the action, and "[H" (without quotes" in the text field below that.  For line end, use "[F".Just to help out anyone that is having the same issue but specifically using Zsh shell with iTerm 2. It turns out that Zsh doesn\'t read /etc/inputrc properly, and so fails to understand any key bindings you set up through the preferences!To fix this, you need to add some key bindings to your .zshrc file, such as:Note the backslashes in the example above before the "e", the linked article does not show them, so add them into your .zshrc file when adding bindings.In iTerm 3.0.12 you can switch to Natural Text Editing preset:  For quick reference of anyone who wants to go to the end of line or start of line in iTerm2, the above link\n http://hackaddict.blogspot.com/2007/07/skip-to-next-or-previous-word-in-iterm.html\nnotes that in iTerm2:The old fashion emacs bindings can still work in iterm2 and os x terminal:Preferences -> Profiles -> Keys (sub tab in profiles)This should enable alt-f and alt-b for moving words by words. (Still ctrl-a and ctrl-e always work as usual)If set as meta those old bindings will work while some iterm2 bindings unavailable.For me, the following combination worked:\n\n| Key       Action                 Esc+    End result |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| \xe2\x8c\x98\xe2\x86\x90   Send Escape Sequence   a       Send ^[ a  |\n| \xe2\x8c\x98\xe2\x86\x92   Send Escape Sequence   e       Send ^[ e  |\nbind -p will show a list of bound escaped keys in your shell, that might help giving you more ideas / search terms.
