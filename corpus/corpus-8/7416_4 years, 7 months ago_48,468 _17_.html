Angular.js uses several directives prefixed with ng like below:ng (base directive)I was wondering if anyone knew what ng stood for because I couldn\'t find it in the docs. Is it an acronym for something?The prefix ng stands for "Angular;" all of the built-in directives that ship with Angular use that prefix. Similarly, it is recommended that you do not use the ng prefix on your own directives in order to avoid possible name collisions in future versions of Angular.From the FAQ:Why is this project called "AngularJS"? Why is the namespace called "ng"?Because HTML has Angular brackets and "ng" sounds like "Angular".I guess there are not many Star Trek fans among you. "ng" stands for Next Generation, as Angular is the next generation of HTML. "Enhanced" HTML I would say xD.I thought they took an arbitrary subsection of the Angular name and used it as the name space: aNGularPlus "NG" does not sound like Angular; no matter which way you say it. NG stands for "Next Generation". It is used in many applications as a suffix, specially in Linux. Example: syslog-ng and Aircrack-ng. According to the AngularJS Miscellaneous FAQ:Why is this project called "AngularJS"? Why is the namespace called "ng"?\nBecause HTML has Angular brackets and "ng" sounds like "Angular".ng is a short pronounse of Angular. Programmers don\'t like to code long names, so they keep it short and that makes it a bit more cryptic. If you look at Assembler you know what I mean with ADD, JMP etc. JQuery is the name, the \'$\' is what you use. Angular is the name, ng is what you use.
