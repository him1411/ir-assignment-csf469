What is the best way to convert seconds into (Hour:Minutes:Seconds:Milliseconds) time?Let\'s say I have 80 seconds, are there any specialized classes/techniques in .NET that would allow me to convert those 80 seconds into (00h:00m:00s:00ms) format like to DateTime or something?For .Net <= 4.0 Use the TimeSpan class.(As noted by Inder Kumar Rathore) For .NET > 4.0 you can use(From Nick Molyneux) Ensure that seconds is less than TimeSpan.MaxValue.TotalSeconds to avoid an exception.For .NET > 4.0 you can useor if you want date time format then you can also do thisFor more you can check Custom TimeSpan Format StringsIf you know you have a number of seconds, you can create a TimeSpan value by calling TimeSpan.FromSeconds: You can then obtain the number of days, hours, minutes, or seconds.  Or use one of the ToString overloads to output it in whatever manner you like.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.timespan.fromseconds.aspxThe TimeSpan constructor allows you to pass in seconds. Simply declare a variable of type TimeSpan amount of seconds. Ex:I\'d suggest you use the TimeSpan class for this.Outputs:In VB.NET, but it\'s the same in C#:I did some benchmarks to see what\'s the fastest way and these are my results and conclusions. I ran each method 10M times and added a comment with the average time per run.If your input milliseconds are not limited to one day (your result may be 143:59:59.999), these are the options, from faster to slower:If your input milliseconds are limited to one day (your result will never be greater then 23:59:59.999), these are the options, from faster to slower:In case your input is just seconds, the methods are slightly faster. Again, if your input seconds are not limited to one day (your result may be 143:59:59):And if your input seconds are limited to one day (your result will never be greater then 23:59:59):As a final comment, let me add that I noticed that string.Format is a bit faster if you use D2 instead of 00.Why do people need TimeSpan AND DateTime if we have DateTime.AddSeconds()?The date is arbitrary.\ntotalSeconds can be greater than 59 and it is a double.\nThen you can format your time as you want using DateTime.ToString():This does not work if totalSeconds < 0 or > 59://Test
