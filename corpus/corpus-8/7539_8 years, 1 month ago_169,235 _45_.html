I am used to Emacs, but I am trying out Vim to see which one I like better. One thing that I like about Emacs is the ability to run a terminal inside Emacs. Is this possible inside of Vim? I know that you can execute commands from Vim, but I would like to be able to run a terminal inside of a tab.I would definitely recommend screen for something like this. Vim is a text editor, not a shell.I would use Ctrl+AS to split the current window horizontally, or in Ubuntu\'s screen and other patched versions, you can use Ctrl+A|(pipe) to split vertically. Then use Ctrl+ATab (or equivalently on some systems, Ctrl+ACtrl+I which may be easier to type) to switch between the windows. There are other commands to change the size and arrangement of the windows.Or a less advanced use of screen is just to open multiple full-screen windows and toggle between them. This is what I normally do, I only use the split screen feature occasionally.The GNU Screen Survival Guide question has a number of good tips if you\'re unfamiliar with its use.Check out Conque Shell (also on GitHub).  Lets you run any interactive program inside vim, not just a shell.I\'m not sure exactly what you\'re trying to achieve (I\'ve never used Emacs), but you can run commands in Vim by typing:And if you want to type in several commands, or play around in a shell for a while, you can always use:Once the command or shell terminates, you\'ll be given the option to press Enter to return to your editor windowVim is intentionally lightweight and lacking in the ability to do non-editorish type things, just as running a full-blown shell inside a Vim pane/tab, but as mentioned above there are third-party addons such as vim-shell that allow you to do that sort of thing.Typically if I want to switch between Vim and my shell (Bash), I just hit CTRL+Z to pause the Vim process, play around in my shell, then type \'fg\' when I want to go back to Vim - keeping my editor and my shell nice and separate.The way that I get around this is to pause Vim with Ctrl + Z, play in the terminal, then return to Vim with the command fg.:sh then ctrl+d to get back in (bash)Update:You could map ctrl+d in vim to run :sh, which allows you to toggle between bash and vim quickly.noremap <C-d> :sh<cr>This question is rather old, but for those finding it, there\'s a new possible solution: Neovim contains a full-fledged, first-class terminal emulator, which does exactly what ConqueTerm tried to. Simply run :term <your command here>. <C-\\><C-n> will exit term mode back to normal-mode. If you\'re like me and prefer that escape still exit term mode, you can add this to your nvimrc:And then hitting ESC twice will exit terminal mode back to normal-mode, so you can manipulate the buffer that the still-running command is writing to.Though keep in mind, as nvim is under heavy development at the time I\'m posting this answer, another way to exit terminal mode may be added. As Ctrl+\\Ctrl+n switches to normal mode from almost any mode, I don\'t expect that this answer will become wrong, but be aware that if it doesn\'t work, this answer might be out of date.https://github.com/neovim/neovimI know that I\'m not directly answering the question, but I think it\'s a\ngood approach. Nobody has mentioned tmux (or at least not as a\nstandalone answer). Tmux is a terminal multiplexor like screen. Most\nstuff can be made in both multiplexors, but afaik tmux it\'s more easily\nto configure. Also tmux right now is being more actively developed than\nscreen and there\'s quite a big ecosystem around it, like tools that help\nthe configuration, ecc.Also for vim, there\'s another plugin: ViMUX, that helps a lot in\nthe interaction between both tools. You can call commands with::call VimuxRunCommand("ls")That command creates a small horizontal split below the current pane vim\nis in.It can also let you run from a prompt in case you don\'t want to run the\nwhole command:<Leader>vp :VimuxPromptCommand<CR>As it weren\'t enought, there are at least 6 \'platform specific plugins\':Here is a nice "use case": Tests on demand using Vimux and Turbux with Spork and GuardNo, you cannot:http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/tips.html#shell-windowYou might want to take a look at the :sh command (see :help sh in Vim).Various commandsSomeone already suggested https://github.com/Shougo/vimshell.vim, but they didn\'t mention why. Consequently, when I came away from this question I wasted a lot of other time trying the other (much higher ranked) options. Shougo/vimshell is the answer. Here\'s why:In addition to being a terminal emulator, VimShell allows you to navigate through terminal output in normal and visual mode. Thus, if a command you run results in output that you\'d like to copy and paste using the keyboard only...VimShell covers this. None of the other options mentioned, including the :terminal command in NeoVim do this. Neovim\'s :terminal comes close, but falls short in at least the following ways  as of 2/18/2017: Moves the cursor to the end of the buffer, instead of at the last keeping it in the same spot like VimShell does. Huge waste of time.Doesn\'t support modifiable = 1 see a discussion on this at Github, so helpful plugins like vim-easymotion can\'t be used. Doesn\'t support the display of line numbers like Vimshell does. Don\'t waste time on the other options, including Neovim\'s :terminal. Go with VimShell.Only way I know of is by using vim-shell, a third-party patch.I use this now, you may can try. VimShellTry vterm, which is a pretty much full feature shell inside vim. It is slightly buggy with its history and clear functions, and still in development, but it still is pretty good
