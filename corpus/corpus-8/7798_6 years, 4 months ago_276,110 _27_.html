Is there a way to create an instance of a particular class given the class name (dynamic) and pass parameters to its constructor.Something like:Where "MyAttributeValue" is an argument to the constructor of MyClass.Yes, something like:That will only work for a single string parameter of course, but you can modify it pretty easily.Note that the class name has to be a fully-qualified one, i.e. including the namespace. For nested classes, you need to use a dollar (as that\'s what the compiler uses). For example:To obtain the Class object for that, you\'d need Class.forName("foo.Outer$Nested").You can use Class.forName() to get a Class object of the desired class.Then use getConstructor() to find the desired Constructor object.Finally, call newInstance() on that object to get your new instance.You can use reflectionsIf class has only one empty constructor (like Activity or Fragment etc, android classes):when using (i.e.) getConstructor(String.lang) the constructor has to be declared public.\nOtherwise a NoSuchMethodException is thrown.if you want to access a non-public constructor you have to use instead (i.e.) getDeclaredConstructor(String.lang).You want to be using java.lang.reflect.Constructor.newInstance(Object...)You can also invoke methods inside the created object.You can create object instant by invoking the first constractor and then invoke the first method in the created object. Very Simple way to create an object in Java using Class<?> with constructor argument(s) passing:Case 1:-\nHere, is a small code in this Main class:And, here is the Base class structure:Case 2:- You, can code similarly for constructor with multiple argument and copy constructor. For example, passing 3 arguments as parameter to the Base constructor will need the constructor to be created in class and a code change in above as:And here the Base class should somehow look like:Note:- Don\'t forget to handle the various exceptions which need to be handled in the code.If anyone is looking for a way to create an instance of a class despite the class following the Singleton Pattern, here is a way to do it.This only works for classes that implement singleton pattern using a private constructor.Another helpful answer. How do I use getConstructor(params).newInstance(args)?In my case, my class\'s constructor takes Webdriver as parameter, so used below code:
