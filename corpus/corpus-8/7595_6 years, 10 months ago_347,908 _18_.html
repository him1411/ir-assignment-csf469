How can we center a popup window opened via javascript window.open function on the center of screen variable to the currently selected screen resolution ?SINGLE/DUAL MONITOR FUNCTION (credit to http://www.xtf.dk - thank you!)UPDATE: It will also work on windows that aren\'t maxed out to the screen\'s width and height now thanks to @Frost!If you\'re on dual monitor, the window will center horizontally, but not vertically... use this function to account for that.Usage Example:CREDIT GOES TO: http://www.xtf.dk/2011/08/center-new-popup-window-even-on.html (I wanted to just link out to this page but just in case this website goes down the code is here on SO, cheers!)try it like this:Source: http://www.nigraphic.com/blog/java-script/how-open-new-window-popup-center-screenDue to the complexity of determining the center of the current screen in a multi-monitor setup, an easier option is to center the pop-up over the parent window. Simply pass the parent window as another parameter: It works very well in Firefox.\nJust change the top variable to any other name and try againIf you want to center it on the frame you are currently in, I would recommend this function:Similar to Crazy Tim\'s answer, but doesn\'t use window.top. This way, it will work even if the window is embedded in an iframe from a different domain.My recommendation is to use top location 33% or 25% from remaining space, and not 50% as other examples posted here, \nmainly because of the window header,\nwhich look better and more comfort to the user, complete code:\n    \n    \n    \n        \ncheck out this line:\nvar top = (screen.height - h) / 4;  // for 25% - devide by 4  |  for 33% - devide by 3You can use css to do it, just give the following properties to the element to be placed in the center of the popupHere is an alternate version of the aforementioned solution...Note: you have to use Math.round for getting the exact integer of width and height.
