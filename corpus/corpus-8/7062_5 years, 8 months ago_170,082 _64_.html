First -- I do not believe this is a duplicate issue. I\'ve searched for same or similar problems on SO extensively, and due to the nature of troubleshooting before asking, I believe this problem is unique. Facebook cannot grasp my og:image files and I have tried every usual solution. I\'m beginning to think it might have something to do with https://...I am at the end of my rope. If I said how much time myself and others have spent on this, you\'d be shocked. The issue is that this is an online store. We absolutely, positively cannot NOT have images. We have to. We have ten or so other sites... This is the only one with og:image problems. It\'s also the only one on https, so we thought maybe that was the problem. But we can\'t find any precedent anywhere on the web for that. These are the meta-tags:In case you want it, here\'s a link to one of our product pages that we\'ve been working on. [Link shortened to try to curb this getting into search results for our site]: http://rockn.ro/114EDIT ---- Using the "see what facebook sees" scraper tool, we were able to see the following: We tested all links it found for a single page. All were perfectly valid images. EDIT 2 ----We tried a test and added a subdomain to the NONSECURE website (from which images are actually visible through facebook). Subdomain was http://img.[nonsecuresite].com. We then put all images into the main subdomain folder and referenced those. It would not pull those images into FB. However, it would still pull any images that were referenced on the nonsecure main domain. POSTED WORKAROUND ----Thanks to Keegan, we now know that this is a bug in Facebook. To workaround, we placed a subdomain in a different NON-HTTPS website and dumped all images in it. We referenced the coordinating http://img.otherdomain.com/[like-image.jpg] image in og:image on each product page. We then had to go through FB Linter and run EVERY link to refresh the OG data. This worked, but the solution is a band-aid workaround, and if the https issue is fixed and we go back to using the natural https domain, FB will have cached the images from a different website, complicating matters. Hopefully this information helps to save someone else from losing 32 coding hours of their life. I ran into the same problem and reported it as a bug on the Facebook developer site. It seems pretty clear that og:image URIs using HTTP work just fine and URIs using HTTPS do not. They have now acknowledged that they are "looking into this."The bug can be seen here:\nhttps://developers.facebook.com/bugs/260628274003812Some properties can have extra metadata attached to them. These are specified in the same way as other metadata with property and content, but the property will have extra :The og:image property has some optional structured properties:A full image example:So you need to change og:image property for your HTTPS URLs to og:image:secure_urlEx:HTTPS META TAG FOR IMAGE:HTTP META TAG FOR IMAGE:Source: http://ogp.me/#structured <-- You can visit this site for more information.Hope this helps you.EDIT: Don\'t forget to ping facebook servers after updating your codes - URL LinterI don\'t know, if it\'s only with me but for me og:image does not work and it picks my site logo, even though facebook debugger shows the correct image.But changing og:image to og:image:url worked for me. Hope this helps anybody else facing similar issue.Got here from Google but this wasn\'t much help for me. It turned out that there is a minimum aspect ratio of 3:1 required for the logo. Mine was almost 4:1. I used Gimp to crop it to exactly 3:1 and voila - my logo is now shown on FB.I had the same error and nothing of previous have helped, so I tried to follow original documentation of Open Graph Protocol and I added prefix attribute to my html tag and everything became awesome.tl;dr \xe2\x80\x93 be patientI ended up here because I was seeing blank images served from a https site. The problem was quite a different one though:When content is shared for the first time, the Facebook crawler will scrape and cache the metadata from the URL shared. The crawler has to see an image at least once before it can be rendered. This means that the first person who shares a piece of content won\'t see a rendered image[https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/best-practices/#precaching]While testing, it took facebook around 10 minutes to finally show the rendered image. So while I was scratching my head and throwing random og tags at facebook (and suspecting the https problem mentioned here), all I had to do was wait.As this might really stop people from sharing your links for the first time, FB suggests two ways to circumvent this behavior: \na) running the OG Debugger on all your links: the image will be cached and ready for sharing after ~10 minutes or b) specifying og:image:width and og:image:height. (Read more in the above link)Still wondering though what takes them so long ...I ran into the same issue and then I noticed that I had a different domain for the og:urlOnce I made sure that the domain was the same for og:url and og:image it worked.Hope this helps.Don\'t forget to refresh servers through : Facebook DebuggerAnd click on "Collect new info"I can see that the Debugger is retrieving 4 og:image tags from your URL.The first image is the largest and therefore takes longest to load. \nTry shrink that first image down or change the order to show a smaller image first.I had similar problems.  I removed the property="og:image:secure_url" and now it will scrub with just og:image.  Sometimes, less is moreIn addition, this problem also occurs when you add a user generated story (where you do not use og:image). For example:The above will only work with http and not with https. If you use https, you will get an error that says:\nAttached image () failed to uploadI discovered another scenario that can cause this issue. I went through all the steps described in the question and the answers, still the problem remained.I checked my images and found that some of my posts had way too large thumbnail images in og:image in the range of several thousand pixels and several megabytes. This happened due to the recent migration from WP to Jekyll, I optimized my images with gulp, but used the original images in og:image by mistake. Facebook gives us the following recommendations as of today: Use images that are at least 1200 x 630 pixels for the best display on\n  high resolution devices. At the minimum, you should use images that\n  are 600 x 315 pixels to display link page posts with larger images.\n  Images can be up to 8MB in size.So there is an upper limit of 8MB.As I accidentally found, transparent blank image comes with response header indicating possible cause of the problem.For example, in my case it was Invalid image extension for URL: https://[mydomain]/[myfilename].jpgThe real issue in my case was related to prerender.io.As it turns out, if image is requested via prerender, it\'s converted to HTML. Something like this:It\'s either bug in prerender itself, or it\'s supposed to be configured in your proxy to not use prerender for *.jpg requests (even if they are requested by Facebook bot).It\'s really hard to notice this, as prerender is used only on certain user-agent headers.From what I observed, I see that when your website is public and even though the image url is https, it just works fine.After several hours of testing and trying things... I solved this problem as simple as possible.\nI notice that they use "test pages" inside Facebook Developers Page that contains only the "og" tags and some text in the body tag that referals this og tags.So what have i done?I created a second view in my application, containing this same things they use.And how i know is Facebook that is accessing my page so i can change the view? They have a unique User Agent: "facebookexternalhit/1.1"
