How to connect to a AWS instance through ssh?I have:Went to my console and created environment variables:\nTold AWS API to use this keypair and saved the keypair to file:\nStarted an AWS Ubuntu 9 instance using this keypair:\nAttempted to establish a ssh connection to the instance:\nWhat could be the problem and how to make it work?For Ubuntu instances:For other instances, you might have to use ec2-user instead of ubuntu.Most EC2 Linux images I\'ve used only have the root user created by default.See also: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBro0TEAd7gNow it\'s:Canonical\'s releases use the user \'ubuntu\' by default for anyone landing here with a ubuntu image that is coming up with the same problem.If you\'re using a Bitnami image, log in as \'bitnami\'.Seems obvious, but something I overlooked.For my ubuntu images, it is actually ubuntu user and NOT the ec2-user ;)Ubuntu 10.04 with openSSH this is the exact usage:for example:above example was taken directly from the AWS tutorial for connecting to a Linux/UNIX machine at:\nhttp://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/GettingStartedGuide/It will also complain if the pem file permissions are too open. chmod the file to 600 to fix that.I was also running into this - turns out I was using a community-created AMI - and the default username was niehter root, nor was it ect-user or ubuntu. In fact, I had no idea what it was - till I tried \'root\' and the server kindly asked me to login as xxx where xxx is whatever it tells you.-cheers!use... don\'t use the 600 permission otherwise you might overwrite your key accidently.this worked for me:to delete the old keys stored on the workstation\nalso works with  instead of then doing the same ssh again it worked:on ubuntu instances the username is: ubuntu\non Amazon Linux AMI the username is: ec2-userI didn\'t have to re-create the instance from an image.For Debian EC2 instances, the user is admin.You need have your private key in your local machineYou need to know the IP address or DNS name of your remote machine or server, you can get this from AWS consoleIf you are a linux userIf you are a windows userIn my case (Mac OS X), the problem was the file\'s break type. Try this:1.- Open the .pem file with TextWrangler2.- At Bottom of app, verify if the Break Type is "Windows(CRLF)". Its ec2-user for Amazon Linux AMI\'s and ubuntu for Ubuntu images. \nAlso, RHEL 6.4 and later    ec2-user\nRHEL 6.3 and earlier    root\nFedora  ec2-user\nCentos  rootJust adding to this list.  I was having trouble this morning with a new user just added to an AWS EC2 instance.  To cut to the chase, the problem was selinux (which was in enforcing mode), together with the fact that my user home dir was on a new EBS attached volume.  Somehow I guess selinux doesn\'t like that other volume.  Took me a while to figure out, as I looked through all the other usual ssh issues (/etc/ssh/sshd_config was fine, of course no password allowed, permissions were right, etc.)The fix?For now (until I understand how to allow a user to ssh to a different volume, or somehow make that volume a bona fide home dir point):That\'s it. Now my new user can log in, using his own id_rsa key.Had the same issue. Permission denied (publickey) when trying to login in with \'ec2-user\' or with \'root\'.Googled the AMI number of the machine image and it had the SSH login information right their on the Debian wiki page.Hope this helps.If you are using EBS, you can also try to mount the EBS Volume on a running instance. Then mount it on that running instance and see what\'s going on in /home. You can see things like is the user ubuntu or ec2-user ? or does it have the right public keys under ~/.ssh/authorized_keysPermission for ec2-keypair.pem should be 400chmod 400 ec2-keypair.pemIf you are running AWS image from Bitnami. The username would be bitnami. Cheers!see my debug and look at the last one: **There are 2 steps to be connected:  Chmod 400 on your private key, like this the others cannot access to your key:To connect to your instance in SSH, you need to know the public IP address of your instance : Hope it helps !
