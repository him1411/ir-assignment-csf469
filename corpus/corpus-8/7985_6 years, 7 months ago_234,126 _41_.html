I have a Users model which needs an :email column (I forgot to add that column during the initial scaffold).  I opened the migration file and added t.string :email, did rake db:migrate, and got a NoMethodError. Then I added the line again rake db:migrate, again NoMethodError.  Am I missing a step here?Edit: here\'s the migration file.If you have already run your original migration (before editing it), then you need to generate a new migration (rails generate migration add_email_to_users email:string will do the trick). Then do a rake db:migrate and it\'ll run the new migration.If you have not yet run the original migration you can just edit it, like you\'re trying to do. Your migration code is almost perfect: you just need to remove the add_column line completely (that code is trying to add a column to a table, before the table has been created, and your table creation code has already been updated to include a t.string :email anyway).Use this command at rails console\nrails generate migration add_fieldname_to_tablename fieldname:stringand rake db:migrate to run this migrationYou can also dorake db:rollbackif you have not added any data to the tables.Then edit the migration file by adding the email column to it and then call rake db:migrateThis will work if you have rails 3.1 onwards installed in your system. Much simpler way of doing it is change let the change in migration file be as it is.\nuse $rake db:migrate:redo.This will roll back the last migration and migrate it again.To add a column I just had to follow these steps :  rails generate migration add_fieldname_to_tablename fieldname:stringAlternativerails generate migration addFieldnameToTablenameOnce the migration is generated, then edit the migration and define all the attributes you want that column added to have.Note: Table names in Rails are always plural (to match DB conventions). Example using one of the steps mentioned previously- rails generate migration addEmailToUsersrake db:migrateOr Run this command: rake db:schema:loadWarning/NoteBear in mind that, running rake db:schema:load automatically wipes all data in your tables.When I\'ve done this, rather than fiddling the original migration, I create a new one with just the add column in the up section and a drop column in the down section.You can change the original and rerun it if you migrate down between, but in this case I think that\'s made a migration that won\'t work properly.As currently posted, you\'re adding the column and then creating the table.If you change the order it might work.  Or, as you\'re modifying an existing migration, just add it to the create table instead of doing a separate add column.You could rollback the last migration  byor rollback this specific migration byand edit the file, then run rake db:mirgate again.You can also do this ..\n  rails g migration add_column_to_users email:stringthen rake db:migrate\n  also add :email attribute in your user controller ;for more detail check out http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.htmlYou can also force to table columns in table using force: true, if you table is already exist.example:
