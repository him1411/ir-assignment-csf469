I have been looking all over for this but I can\'t seem to find it.  I know how to dismiss the keyboard using Objective-C but I have no idea how to do that using Swift? Does anyone know?========================================================================Edit: Here is another way to do this task if you are going to use this functionality in multiple UIViewControllers:Now in every UIViewController, all you have to do is call this function:This function is included as a standard function in my repo which contains a lot of useful Swift Extensions like this one, check it out: https://github.com/goktugyil/EZSwiftExtensionsAn answer to your question on how to dismiss the keyboard in Xcode 6.1 using Swift below:(Source of this information).You can callon any instance of a UIResponder, such as a UITextField. If you call it on the view that is currently causing the keyboard to be displayed then the keyboard will dismiss.for Swift 3 it is very simpleif you want to hide keyboard on pressing RETURN key but in second case you will also need to pass delegate from all textFields to the ViewController in the Main.StoryboardDash\'s answer is correct and preferred. A more "scorched earth" approach is to call view.endEditing(true). This causes view and all its subviews to resignFirstResponder. If you don\'t have a reference to the view you\'d like to dismiss, this is a hacky but effective solution.Note that personally I think you should have a reference to the view you\'d like to have resign first responder. .endEditing(force: Bool) is a barbaric approach; please don\'t use it.Swift 3:\nEasiest way to dismiss keyboard:![ how to disable the keyboard..][1]In storyboard: Swift 3:Extension with Selector as parameter to be able to do additional stuff in the dismiss function and cancelsTouchesInView to prevent distortion with touches on other elements of the view.Usage:This one liner resigns Keyboard from all(any) the UITextField in a UIViewI found the best solution included the accepted answer from @Esqarrouth, with some adjustments:The line tap.cancelsTouchesInView = false was critical: it ensures that the UITapGestureRecognizer does not prevent other elements on the view from receiving user interaction. The method dismissKeyboard() was changed to the slightly less elegant dismissKeyboardView(). This is because in my project\'s fairly old codebase, there were numerous times where dismissKeyboard() was already used (I imagine this is not uncommon), causing compiler issues. Then, as above, this behaviour can be enabled in individual View Controllers:You can also add a tap gesture recognizer to resign the keyboard. :D Another possibility is to simply add a big button with no content that lies underneath all views you might need to touch.\nGive it an action named:The problem with a gesture recognizer was for me, that it also caught all touches I wanted to receive by the tableViewCells.As a novice programmer it can be confusing when people produce more skilled and unnecessary responses...You do not have to do any of the complicated stuff shown above!...Here is the simplest option...In the case your keyboard appears in response to the textfield - Inside your touch screen function just add the resignFirstResponder function. As shown below - the keyboard will close because the First Responder is released (exiting the Responder chain)...Swift 3To follow @modocache\'s recommendation to avoid calling view.endEditing(), you could keep track of the text field that became first responder, but that is messy and error-prone. An alternative is to call resignFirstResponder() on all text fields in the viewcontroller. Here\'s an example of creating a collection of all text fields (which in my case was needed for validation code anyway):With the collection available, it\'s a simple matter to iterate through all of them:So now you can call dismissKeyboard() in your gesture recognizer (or wherever is appropriate for you). Drawback is that you must maintain the list of UITextFields when you add or remove fields.Comments welcome. If there is a problem with calling resignFirstResponder() on controls that aren\'t first responder, or if there\'s an easy and guaranteed non-buggy way to track the current first responder, I\'d love to hear about it!I worked out on uisearchbar . See mine.I prefer this one-liner:Just put that in the override viewDidLoad function in whichever subclassed UIViewController you want it to occur, and then put the following code in a new empty file in your project called "UIViewController+dismissKeyboard.swift":I got you famIf you have other views that should receive the touch as well you have to set \ncancelsTouchesInView = falseLike this:If you use a scroll view, It could be much simpler.Just select Dismiss interactively in storyboard.I found this simple solution:\n1. Add UITapGestureRecognizer to your view Controller\n2. Add IBAction to your UITapGestureRecognizer\n3. Finally you can resign the first responderFor Swift3Register an event recogniser in viewDidLoadthen we need to add the gesture into the view in same viewDidLoad.Then we need to initialise the registered  methodTo build off of the correct answer I always use the following extension:This way, in case the class I am trying to cancel the editing in does not have a view property or is not a subclass of UIView I can just call UIApplication.endEditing().Here\'s a succinct way of doing it:Try this,It\'s Working
