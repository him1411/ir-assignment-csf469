I\'m currently trying to learn Numpy and Python. Given the following array:Is there a function that returns the dimensions of a (e.g.a is a 2 by 2 array)?size() returns 4 and that doesn\'t help very much. It is .shape:ndarray.shape\n  Tuple of array dimensions.Thus:Also works if the input is not a numpy array but a list of listsBy convention, in Python world, the shortcut for numpy is np, so:In Numpy, dimension, axis/axes, shape are related and sometimes similar concepts:In Mathematics/Physics, dimension or dimensionality is informally defined as the minimum number of coordinates needed to specify any point within a space. But in Numpy, according to the numpy doc, it\'s the same as axis/axes:In Numpy dimensions are called axes. The number of axes is rank.the nth coordinate to index an array in Numpy. And multidimensional arrays can have one index per axis.describes how many data (or the range) along each available axis.You can use .shapeThe shape method requires that a be a Numpy ndarray. But Numpy can also calculate the shape of iterables of pure python objects:
