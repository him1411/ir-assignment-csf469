Does anyone know of a free decompiler that can decompile an entire Jar file instead of a single class? I have a problem with sub classes like name$1.class name$2.class name.classJavaDecompiler can do a good job with a jar: since 0.2.5, All files, in JAR files, are displayed.See also the question "How do I \xe2\x80\x9cdecompile\xe2\x80\x9d Java class files?".The JD-Eclipse doesn\'t seem to have changed since late 2009 though (see Changes).\nSo its integration with latest Eclipse (3.8, 4.2+) might be problematic.JD-Core is actively maintained.Both are the result of the fantastic work of (SO user) Emmanuel Dupuy.First of all, it\'s worth remembering that all Java archive files (.jar/.war/etc...) are all basically just fancy.zip files, with a few added manifests and metadata.Second, to tackle this problem I personally use several tools which handle this problem on all levels:The advantage of all the aforementioned, is that I do not need to hold any other external tool which clutters my work environment. Everything I will ever need from one of those files can be handled inside my IDE or diffed with other files natively.If you happen to have both a bash shell and jad:I might be a tiny, tiny bit off with that, but it should work more or less as advertised.  You should end up with $JAR.tmp containing your decompiled files.I have had reasonable success with a tool named (frustratingly) "JD: Java Decompiler".I have found it better than most decompilers when dealing with classes compiled for Java 5 and higher. Unfortunately, it can still have some hiccups where JAD would normally succeed.Something like:maybe?Insert the following into decompile.jar.shReady to use, just type dj your.jar and you will get your.jar.src folder with sources. Use -d option for debug mode.You extract it and then use jad against the dir.A jar file is just a zip file with jar extension. You should be able to unzip(winzip) a jar just like a zip file. Note: This solution only works for Mac and *nix users.I also tried to find Jad with no luck. My quick solution was to download MacJad that contains jad. Once you downloaded it you can find jad in [where-you-downloaded-macjad]/MacJAD/Contents/Resources/jad.
