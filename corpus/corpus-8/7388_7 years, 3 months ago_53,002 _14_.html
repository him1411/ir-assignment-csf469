What is the difference between collection routes and member routes in Rails?For example,versusI don\'t understand.A member route will require an ID, because it acts on a member. A collection route doesn\'t because it acts on a collection of objects. Preview is an example of a member route, because it acts on (and displays) a single object. Search is an example of a collection route, because it acts on (and displays) a collection of objects.Theo\'s answer is correct. For documentation\'s sake, I\'d like to also note that the two will generate different path helpers.member {get \'preview\'} will generate:collection {get \'search\'} will generate:Note plurality!1)  :collection - Add named routes for other actions that operate on the collection. Takes a hash of #{action} => #{method}, where method is :get/:post/:put/:delete, an array of any of the previous, or :any if the method does not matter. These routes map to a URL like /users/customers_list, with a route of customers_list_users_url.map.resources :users, :collection => { :customers_list=> :get }2) :member - Same as :collection, but for actions that operate on a\n    specific member.map.resources :users, :member => { :inactive=> :post }it treated as /users/1;inactive=> [:action => \'inactive\', :id => 1]
