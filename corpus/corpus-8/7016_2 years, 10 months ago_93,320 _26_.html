Does swift have a trim method on String? For example:Here\'s how you remove all the whitespace from the beginning and end of a String. (Example tested with Swift 2.0.)(Example tested with Swift 3.0.)Hope this helps.Put this code on a file on your project, something likes Utils.swift:So you will be able to do this:Swift 3.0 SolutionSo you will be able to do this:In Swift 3.0And you can callYou can use the trim() method in a Swift String extension I wrote https://bit.ly/JString.Yes it has, you can do it like this:CharacterSet is actually a really powerful tool to create a trim rule with much more flexibility than a pre defined set like .whitespacesAndNewlines has.For Example:Truncate String to Specific LengthIf you have entered block of sentence/text and you want to save only specified length out of it text. Add the following extension to ClassUse In Swift3 XCode 8 FinalNotice that the CharacterSet.whitespaces is not a function anymore!(Neither is NSCharacterSet.whitespaces)Taken from this repo of mine: https://github.com/goktugyil/EZSwiftExtensions/commit/609fce34a41f98733f97dfd7b4c23b5d16416206Another similar way:Use: I created this function that allows to enter a string and returns a list of string trimmed by any character as didn\'t found a way to do this in swift (compiles and work perfectly in swift 2.0)
