Possible Duplicate:\n  Round a double to 2 significant figures after decimal point I am dealing with lot of double values in my application, is there is any easy way to handle the formatting of decimal values in Java?Is there any other better way of doing it than What i want to do basically is format double values like No, there is no better way.Actually you have an error in your pattern. What you want is:Note the "00", meaning exactly two decimal places.If you use "#.##" (# means "optional" digit), it will drop trailing zeroes - ie new DecimalFormat("#.##").format(3.0d); prints just "3", not "3.00".An alternative is to use String.format:output:You could also use System.out.format (same method signature), or create a java.util.Formatter which works in the same way.
