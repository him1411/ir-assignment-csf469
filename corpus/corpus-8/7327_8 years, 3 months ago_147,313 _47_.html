How can I get the MIME type from a file extension?UPDATEFor up-to-date mapping with additions from many contributors, see this GitHub repository:https://github.com/samuelneff/MimeTypeMapI\'ve found many mime types my application uses are not in the default Windows registry and others are in the registry but not in the list included with IIS.  I\'ve compiled a list from these locations and added a few others that we use.EDIT: See most up-do-date version with contributions here, including an efficient and deterministic two-way mapping.The NuGet package is also available.   Say hello to the System.Web.MimeMapping class that is part of the BCL in .NET Framework 4.5:ReferenceUpdate\nIf you need to add custom mappings you probably can use reflection to add mappings to the BCL MimeMapping class, it uses a custom dictionary that exposes this method, so you should invoke the following to add mappings (never tested tho, but should prob. work):You can use this  helper function:Just to make Shimmy\'s answer more clear:System.Web.dll v4.5You can find that information in the registry. For instance, the MIME type for .pdf file can be found in the key HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\.pdf, in the value "Content Type" :I\'ve written a program to fetch and convert the Apache mime.types file to a C# Dictionary<string, string> keyed by file extension. It\'s here.The actual output is this file (but you might want to grab it and run it again in case the Apache file has been updated since I last ran this).I like the work that Samuel Neff did, but not the idea and overhead of creating a dictionary every time.I restructured things as a switch case.  Yes you can\'t iterate over it but in my case I only ever use it to quickly look up a value.  Especially because it is done in a web service, the last thing I want is a bunch of overhead as the application prepares its structures.  The compiler will turn this into a hashed lookup and so it will be very fast.a combination of both solutions presented here:Most of the solutions are working but why take so efforts while we also can get mime type very easily.\nIn System.Web assembly there is method for getting the mime type from file name.\neg:\n string mimeType = MimeMapping.GetMimeMapping(filename);hope that may helps you.Thanks in advance.Regards,Arun SharmaInspired by Samuel\'s answer, I wrote an improved version:The resulting source code is over 30K characters so I can\'t post it here, check it on Github.You could use the table provided from Apache\'s httpd. It should be trivial to map this into a function, dictionary, list, etc.Also, as seen here, extension->mime type is not necessarily a function. There may be multiple common MIME types per file extension, so you should look at the requirements of your application, and see why you care about MIME types, what you want "to do" with them, etc. Can you use file extensions to key the same behavior? Do you need to read the first few bytes of a file to determine its MIME type as well?If you do not want to add additional dependencies and still want version-independent requests, you can mix this answer on how to get the MIME-Type in different .NET versions with this answer on conditional builds for multiple .NET Framework versions.First thing I did was editing my project file. After the last build definition, I added the property group as stated in the second answer:Now I provided a different implementations for the MimeExtensionHelper from the first answer, with an additional one for all clients from .NET 4.5 or later simply calling System.Web.MimeMapping.GetMimeMapping:Also in the versions prior to .NET 4.5, the static MimeMapping class hosts an static instance called _mappingDictionary (of type MimeMapping.MimeMappingDictionaryBase) which you can request from Reflection in order to add new MIME-Types that may not yet be supported.It is always not necessary that the mime type calculated by the extention of the file will be always right.lets say i can save a file with .png extention but the fileformat i can set as "ImageFormat.jpeg".So in this case the file which you will be calculating, will give a different result... it may result in big size file than the original.If you are working with images then you can use the imagecodecInfo and ImageFormat.Bryan Denny\'s post above is not working for me since not all extensions have a "Content Type" sub-key in the registry. I had to tweak the code as follows:Now it works fine for me for all registered file types and un-registered or generic file types (like JPG, etc).I have compiled a list of reputable sources for mime type and content type values that are keyed solely on file extension (currently).  The nuget package is here https://www.nuget.org/packages/FTTLib.dll/ and source is here https://github.com/brondavies/filetypetranslator/This library is designed to have:This helper class returns mime type (content type), description and icons for any file name:Usage:FileExtension handle the file extension and not the Mime. The user can change the file extension, so check the Mime. The codes examples associate Mime by file extension, this is wrong and does not work.Need to get the contenttype file and check if the table Mime contetType this file according to the file extension. Now, how to get the ContentType of the file?Using FileUpload is thus: FileUpload.PostedFile.ContentType;\nNow if I already have the file, as caught your ContentType?
