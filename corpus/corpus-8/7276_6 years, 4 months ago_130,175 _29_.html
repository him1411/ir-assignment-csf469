I am trying to achieve a dropBox sync and need to compare the dates of two files. One is on my dropBox account and one is on my iPhone. I came up with the following, but I get unexpected results. I guess I\'m doing something fundamentally wrong when comparing the two dates. I simply used the > < operators, but I guess this is no good as I am comparing two NSDate strings. Here we go:This gave me the following (random & wrong) output:or this one which happens to be correct:Let\'s assume two dates:Then the following comparison will tell which is earlier/later/same:Please refer to the NSDate class documentation for more details.You can refer the StackOverflow Documenation of NSDate here: NSDateLate to the party, but another easy way of comparing NSDate objects is to convert them into primitive types which allows for easy use of \'>\' \'<\' \'==\' etceg.timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate converts the date into seconds since the reference date (1 January 2001, GMT).  As timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate returns a NSTimeInterval (which is a double typedef), we can use primitive comparators.NSDate has a compare function.compare: Returns an NSComparisonResult value that indicates the temporal ordering of the receiver and another given date.Parameters: anotherDate\nThe date with which to compare the receiver.\nThis value must not be nil. If the value is nil, the behavior is undefined and may change in future versions of Mac OS X.Return Value:In Swift, you can overload existing operators:Then, you can compare NSDates directly with <, >, and == (already supported).You want to use the NSDate compare:, laterDate:, earlierDate:, or isEqualToDate: methods.  Using the < and > operators in this situation is comparing the pointers, not the datesThis returns the earlier of the receiver and anotherDate. If both are same, the receiver is returned.Some date utilities, including comparisons IN ENGLISH, which is nice:The implementation:You should use :to compare dates. There is no operator overloading in objective C.I have encounter almost same situation, but in my case I\'m checking if number of days differenceUseful when you need to compare NSDate in Days/Month/Year unit Why don\'t you guys use these NSDate compare methods:You can compare two date by this method alsoI have tried it hope it works for you   Use this simple function for date comparison
