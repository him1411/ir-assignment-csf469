I have a downloaded module repo, I want to install it locally, not globally in another directory? What is an easy way to do this?From the npm-link documentation:In the local module directory:In the directory of the project to use the module:Or in one go using relative paths:This is equivalent to using two commands above under the hood.you just provide one <folder> argument to npm install, argument should  to the local folder instead of the package name:Since asked and answered by the same person, I\'ll add a npm link as an alternative.from docs:This is handy for installing your own stuff, so that you can work on it and test it iteratively without having to continually rebuild.[Edit] As of NPM 2.0, you can declare local dependencies in package.json
