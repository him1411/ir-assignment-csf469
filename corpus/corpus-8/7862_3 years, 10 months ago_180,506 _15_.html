I\'m trying to make a tetris game and I\'m getting "Shape is not an enclosing class" when I try to create an objectI\'m using inner classes for each shape. Here\'s part of my codeWhat am I doing wrong ?ZShape is not static so it requires an instance of the outer class.The simplest solution is to make ZShape and any nested class static if you can.I would also make any fields final or static final that you can as well.Suppose RetailerProfileModel is your Main class and RetailerPaymentModel is an inner class within it. You can create an object of the Inner class outside the class as follows:What I would suggest is not converting the non-static class to a static class because in that case, your inner class can\'t access the non-static members of outer class.Example :So, in such case, you can do something like:No need to make the nested class as static but it must be publicIn case if Parent class is singleton use following way:where getInstance() will return parent class singleton object.I have encountered the same problem.\nI solved by creating an instance for every inner public Class.\nas for you situation, i suggest you use inheritance other than inner classes.then you can new Shape();\nand visit ZShape through shape.zShape;
