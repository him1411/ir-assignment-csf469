In CSS3 font-face, there are multiple font types included like ttf, eot, woff, svg and cff.Why should we use all of these types?If they are special to different browsers, why is the number of them greater than the number of the major web browsers?In short, font-face is very old, but only recently has been supported by more than IE.eot is needed for Internet Explorers that are older than IE9 - they invented the spec, but eot is a horrible format that strips out much of the font features.ttf and otf are normal old fonts, but some people got annoyed that this meant anyone could download and use them.At about the same time, iOS on the iPhone and iPad implemented svg fonts.Then, woff was invented which has a mode that stops people pirating the font. This is the preferred format.If you don\'t want to support IE 8 and lower, and iOS 4 and lower, and android 4.3 or earlier, then you can just use WOFF (and WOFF2, a more highly compressed WOFF, for the newest browsers that support it.)Support for woff can be checked at http://caniuse.com/woff\nSupport for woff2 can be checked at http://caniuse.com/woff2 Woff is a compressed (zipped) form of the TrueType - OpenType font. It is small and can be delivered over the network like a graphic file. Most importantly, this way the font is preserved completely including rendering rule tables that very few people care about because they use only Latin script.Take a look at [dead URL removed]. \nThe font you see is an experimental web delivered smartfont (woff) that has thousands of combined characters making complex shapes. The underlying text is simple Latin code of romanized Singhala. (Copy and paste to Notepad and see).Only woff can do this because nobody has this font and yet it is seen anywhere (Mac, Win, Linux and even on smartphones by all browsers except by IE. IE does not have full support for Open Types).WOFF 2.0, based on the Brotli compression algorithm and other improvements over WOFF 1.0 giving more than 30 % reduction in file size, is supported in Chrome, Opera, and Firefox.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Open_Font_Format\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotlihttp://sth.name/2014/09/03/Speed-up-webfonts/ has an example on how to use it.Basically you add a src url to the woff2 file and specify the woff2 format. It is important to have this before the woff-format: the browser will use the first format that it supports.
