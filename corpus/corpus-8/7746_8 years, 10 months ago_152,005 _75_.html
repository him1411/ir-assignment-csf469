I have a problem when I try to center the div block "products" because I don\'t know in advance the div width.  Anybody have a solution?Update: The problem I have is I don\'t know how many products I\'ll display, I can have 1, 2 or 3 products, I can center them if it was a fixed number as I\'d know the width of the parent div, I just don\'t know how to do it when the content is dynamic.Update 27 Feb 2015: My original answer keeps getting voted up, but now I normally use @bobince\'s approach instead.My original post for historical purposes:You might want to try this approach.Here\'s the matching style:JSFiddleThe idea here is that you contain the content you want to center in two divs, an outer one and an inner one.  You float both divs so that their widths automatically shrink to fit your content.  Next, you relatively position the outer div with it\'s right edge in the center of the container.  Lastly, you relatively position the inner div the opposite direction by half of its own width (actually the outer div\'s width, but they are the same).  Ultimately that centers the content in whatever container it\'s in.You may need that empty div at the end if you depend on your "product" content to size the height for the "product_container".An element with \xe2\x80\x98display: block\xe2\x80\x99 (as div is by default) has a width determined by the width of its container. You can\'t make a block\'s width dependent on the width of its contents (shrink-to-fit).(Except for blocks that are \xe2\x80\x98float: left/right\xe2\x80\x99 in CSS 2.1, but that\'s no use for centering.)You could set the \xe2\x80\x98display\xe2\x80\x99 property to \xe2\x80\x98inline-block\xe2\x80\x99 to turn a block into a shrink-to-fit object that can be controlled by its parent\'s text-align property, but browser support is spotty. You can mostly get away with it by using hacks (eg. see -moz-inline-stack) if you want to go that way.The other way to go is tables. This can be necessary when you have columns whose width really can\'t be known in advance. I can\'t really tell what you\'re trying to do from the example code\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x89there\'s nothing obvious in there that would need a shrink-to-fit block\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x89but a list of products could possibly be considered tabular.[PS. never use \xe2\x80\x98pt\xe2\x80\x99 for font sizes on the web. \xe2\x80\x98px\xe2\x80\x99 is more reliable if you really need fixed size text, otherwise relative units like \xe2\x80\x98%\xe2\x80\x99 are better. And \xe2\x80\x9cclear: ccc both\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x89a typo?]JSFiddleMost browsers support the display: table; CSS rule. This is a good trick to center a div in a container without adding extra HTML nor applying constraining styles to the container (like text-align: center; which would center all other inline content in the container), while keeping dynamic width for the contained div:HTML:CSS:Update (2015-03-09):The proper way to do this today is actually to use flexbox rules. Browser support is a little bit more restricted (CSS table support vs flexbox support) but this method also allows many other things, and is a dedicated CSS rule for this type of behavior:HTML:CSS:I found a more elegant solution, combining "inline-block" to avoid using float and the hacky clear:both. It still requires nested divs tho, which isnt very semantic but it just works...Hope it helps!Button one: anything of type display: block will assume the full parents width. True. Bad example.Button 2: going for display: inline-block will lead to automatic (rather than full) width. You can then center using text-align: center on the wrapping block. Probably the easiest, and most widely compatible, even with \xe2\x80\x98vintage\xe2\x80\x99 browsers...Button 3:\nNo need to put anything on the wrap. So perhaps this is the most elegant solution. Also works vertically. (Browser support for transtlate is good enough (\xe2\x89\xa5IE9) these days...).Btw: Also a great way for vertically centering blocks of unknown height (in connection with absolute positioning).Button 4:\nAbsolute positioning. Just make sure to reserve enough height in the wrapper, since noone else will (neither clearfix nor implicit...)Button 5:\nLastly: float (which brings also block-level elements to dynamic width) and a relative shift. Although I\'ve never seen this in the wild. Perhaps there are disadvantages...By default, div elements are displayed as block elements, so they have 100% width, making centering them meaningless.  As suggested by Arief, you must specify a width and you can then use auto when specifying margin in order to center a div.Alternatively, you could also force display: inline, but then you\'d have something that pretty much behaves like a span instead of a div, so that doesn\'t make a lot of sense.This will center an element such as an Ordered List, or Unordered List, or any element.\nJust wrap it with a Div with the class of outerElement and give the inner element the class of innerElement. The outerelement class accounts for IE, old Mozilla, and most newer browsers.   If the target element is absolutely positioned, you can center it by moving it 50% in one direction (left: 50%) and then transforming it 50% in the opposition direction (transform:translateX(-50%)). This works without defining the target element\'s width (or with width:auto). The parent element\'s position can be static, absolute, relative, or fixed.use css3 flexbox with  justify-content:center;I\'m afraid the only way to do this without explicitly specifying the width is to use (gasp) tables.Slight variation on Mike M. Lin\'s answerIf you add overflow: auto; ( or hidden ) to div.product_container, then you don\'t need div.clear.This is derived from this article -> http://www.quirksmode.org/css/clearing.htmlHere is modified HTML:And here is modified CSS:The reason, why it\'s better without div.clear (apart that it feels wrong to have an empty element) is Firefox\'es overzealous margin assignment.If, for example, you have this html:then, in Firefox (8.0 at the point of writing), you will see 11px margin before product_container.  What\'s worse, is that you will get a vertical scroll bar for the whole page, even if the content fits nicely into the screen dimensions.Try this new css and markupHere is modified HTML:And here is modified CSS:If you dont provide "overflow:hidden" for ".product_container"   the "outer-center" div will overlap other nearby contents to the right of it. Any links or buttons to the right of "outer-center" wont work. Try background color for "outer-center" to understand the need of "overflow :hidden"  I found interesting solution, I was making slider and had to center slide controls and I did this and works fine. You can also add relative position to parent and move child position vertical. Take a look http://jsfiddle.net/bergb/6DvJz/CSS:HTML:Do display:table; and set margin to autoImportant bit of code:No matter how many elements you got now it will auto align in centerExample in code snippet:Crappy fix, but it does work...CSS:HTML:Simple fix that works in old browsers (but does use tables, and requires a height to be set):}\n   use span istead of the inner divsI know this question is old, but I\'m taking a crack at it. Very similar to bobince\'s answer but with working code example. Make each product an inline-block. Center the contents of the container. Done.http://jsfiddle.net/rgbk/6Z2Re/See also: Center inline-blocks with dynamic width in CSSmy solution was:add this css to your product_container class
