I want to be able to access properties from a JSON string within my Java action method. The string is available by simply saying myJsonString = object.getJson(). Below is an example of what the string can look like:In this string every JSON object contains an array of other JSON objects. The intention is to extract a list of IDs where any given object possessing a group property that contains other JSON objects. I looked at Google\'s Gson as a potential JSON plugin. Can anyone offer some form of guidance as to how I can generate Java from this JSON string?I looked at Google\'s Gson as a potential JSON plugin. Can anyone offer some form of guidance as to how I can generate Java from this JSON string?Google Gson supports generics and nested beans. The [] in JSON represents an array and should map to a Java collection such as List or just a plain Java array. The {} in JSON represents an object and should map to a Java Map or just some JavaBean class.You have a JSON object with several properties of which the groups property represents an array of nested objects of the very same type. This can be parsed with Gson the following way:Fairly simple, isn\'t it? Just have a suitable JavaBean and call Gson#fromJson().Bewaaaaare of Gson! It\'s very cool, very great, but the second you want to do anything other than simple objects, you could easily need to start building your own serializers (which isn\'t that hard).Also, if you have an array of Objects, and you deserialize some json into that array of Objects, the true types are LOST! The full objects won\'t even be copied! Use XStream.. Which, if using the jsondriver and setting the proper settings, will encode ugly types into the actual json, so that you don\'t loose anything. A small price to pay (ugly json) for true serialization. Note that Jackson fixes these issues, and is faster than GSON.Oddly, the only decent JSON processor mentioned so far has been GSON.Here are more good choices:EDIT (Aug/2013):One more to consider:Or with Jackson:If, by any change, you are in an application which already uses http://restfb.com/ then you can do:etc.If you use any kind of special maps with keys or values also of special maps, you will find it\'s not contemplated by the implementation of google.What\'s wrong with the standard stuff?  Employee.javaLoadFromJSON.javaGive boon a try:https://github.com/RichardHightower/boonIt is wicked fast:https://github.com/RichardHightower/json-parsers-benchmarkDon\'t take my word for it... check out the gatling benchmark.https://github.com/gatling/json-parsers-benchmark(Up to 4x is some cases, and out of the 100s of test. It also has a index overlay mode that is even faster. It is young but already has some users.)It can parse JSON to Maps and Lists faster than any other lib can parse to a JSON DOM and that is without Index Overlay mode. With Boon Index Overlay mode, it is even faster. It also has a very fast JSON lax mode and a PLIST parser mode. :) (and has a super low memory, direct from bytes mode with UTF-8 encoding on the fly).It also has the fastest JSON to JavaBean mode too. It is new, but if speed and simple API is what you are looking for, I don\'t think there is a faster or more minimalist API. Depending on the input JSON format(string/file) create a jSONString. Sample Message class object corresponding to JSON can be obtained as below:Message msgFromJSON = new ObjectMapper().readValue(jSONString, Message.class);
