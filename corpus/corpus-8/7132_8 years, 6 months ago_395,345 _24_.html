How do I read and parse an XML file in C#?XmlDocument to read an XML from string or from file.orthen find a node below it ie like thisorthen read the text inside that node like thisor read an attributeAlways check for null on Attributes["something"] since it will be null if the attribute does not exist.Reference: LINQ to XML at MSDNHere\'s an application I wrote for reading xml sitemaps:Code on Paste Bin \nhttp://pastebin.com/yK7cSNeYThere are lots of way, some:Linq to XML.Also, VB.NET has much better xml parsing support via the compiler than C#.  If you have the option and the desire, check it out.You can either:Examples are on the msdn pages providedCheck out XmlTextReader class for instance.You could use a DataSet to read XML strings.Posting this for the sake of information. You can avoid the first statement and just specify the path name in constructor of XmlTextReader. There are different ways, depending on where you want to get. \nXmlDocument is lighter than XDocument, but if you wish to verify minimalistically that a string contains XML, then regular expression is possibly the fastest and lightest choice you can make. For example, I have implemented Smoke Tests with SpecFlow for my API and I wish to test if one of the results in any valid XML - then I would use a regular expression. But if I need to extract values from this XML, then I would parse it with XDocument to do it faster and with less code. Or I would use XmlDocument if I have to work with a big XML (and sometimes I work with XML\'s that are around 1M lines, even more); then I could even read it line by line. Why? Try opening more than 800MB in private bytes in Visual Studio; even on production you should not have objects bigger than 2GB. You can with a twerk, but you should not. If you would have to parse a document, which contains A LOT of lines, then this documents would probably be CSV. I have written this comment, because I see a lof of examples with XDocument. XDocument is not good for big documents, or when you only want to verify if there the content is XML valid. If you wish to check if the XML itself makes sense, then you need Schema.I also downvoted the suggested answer, because I believe it needs the above information inside itself. Imagine I need to verify if 200M of XML, 10 times an hour, is valid XML. XDocument will waste a lof of resources.prasanna venkatesh also states you could try filling the string to a dataset, it will indicate valid XML as well.
