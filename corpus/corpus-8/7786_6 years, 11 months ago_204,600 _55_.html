What is the most elegant way to get ISO 8601 formatted presentation of current moment, UTC? It should look like: 2010-10-12T08:50Z.Use SimpleDateFormat to format any Date object you want:Using a new Date() as shown above will format the current time.For systems where the default Time Zone is not UTC:  The SimpleDateFormat instance may be declared as a global constant if needed frequently, but beware that this class is not thread-safe. It must be synchronized if accessed concurrently by multiple threads.  EDIT: I would prefer Joda Time if doing many different Times/Date manipulations...\nEDIT2: corrected: setTimeZone does not accept a String (corrected by Paul)Java 8:Pre Java 8:From the docs:\'R\'    Time formatted for the 24-hour clock as "%tH:%tM"\n  \'F\'    ISO 8601  complete date formatted as "%tY-%tm-%td".java.time makes it simple since Java 8.  And thread safe.Result: 2015-04-14T11:07:36.639ZYou may be tempted to use lighter Temporal such as Instant or LocalDateTime,\n  but they lacks formatter support or time zone data.\n  Only ZonedDateTime works out of the box.By tuning or chaining the options / operations of ZonedDateTime and DateTimeFormatter, you can easily control the timezone and precision, to a certain degree:Result: 2015-04-14T11:07:00+01:00[Europe/Paris]Refined requirements, such as removing the seconds part, must still be served by custom formats or custom post process.For Java 6 & 7, you may consider back-ports of java.time such as ThreeTen-Backport, which also has an Android port.\n  Both are lighter than Joda, and has learned from Joda\'s experience - esp. considering that java.time is designed by Joda\'s author.use JodaTime The ISO 8601 calendar system is the default implementation within Joda-Time  Here is the doc for JodaTime Formatter Edit:If you don\'t want to add or if you don\'t see value of adding above library you could just use in built SimpleDateFormat class to format the Date to required ISO formatas suggested by @Joachim SauerDateFormatUtils from Apache commons-lang3 have useful constants, for example: DateFormatUtils.ISO_DATETIME_FORMATIf you don\'t want to include Jodatime (as nice as it is)which returns a string of:which is slightly different to the original request but is still ISO-8601.ISO 8601 may contains seconds \nsee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Timesso the code should be Update: The Joda-Time project is now in maintenance mode, with the team advising migration to the java.time classes. For Java 6 & 7, see the ThreeTen-Backport project, further adapted for Android in the ThreeTenABP project.Using the Joda-Time library\xe2\x80\xa6This is thread-safe. Joda-Time creates new immutable objects rather than changing existing objects.If you truly intended to ask for a format without seconds, resolving to minutes, then use one of the many other built-in formatters in Joda-Time.For Java 8 and later, Joda-Time continues to work. But the built-in java.time framework supplants Joda-Time. So migrate your code from Joda-Time to java.time as soon as is convenient.See this correct Answer for java.time, by Sheepy.For Java version 7You can follow Oracle documentation: \nhttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.htmlX - is used for ISO 8601 time zoneYou could use Java\'s SimpleDateFormat with the following pattern yyyy-MM-dd\'T\'HH:mm:ssXXX for ISO 8601.Sample Code: (lists out for all the available time zones)You could use:TimeZone.getDefault()for the default vm timezone. More hereYou might notice the date time for few time zones that end with \'Z\'. These time zones have offset of \'0\' from GMT.More info can be found here.As of Java 8 you can simply do:Here\'s a whole class optimized so that invoking "now()" doesn\'t do anything more that it has to do.Still, joda-time does only support the extended format:\n"2015-12-09T00:22:42.930Z"\nnot the basic:\n"20151209T002242.930Z"\n...we might be better off testing a list of formats with java SimpleDateFormat.I did it in Android using Calendar and SimpleDateFormat. The following method returns a Calendar with the "GMT" TimeZone (This is the universal time zone). Then you can use the Calendar class to set the hour between differents time zones, using the method setTimeZone() of the Calendar class.REMEMBER: \nThe Date class doesn\'t know about the TimeZone existence. By this reason, if you debug one date,you always see the date for your current timezone.I do believe the easiest way is to first go to instant and then to string like: Which will result in:2017-09-08T12:56:45.331ZTry This,Its For  ISO 8601 format
