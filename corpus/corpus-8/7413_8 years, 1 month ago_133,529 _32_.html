If I have a lot of functions on startup do they all have to be under one single:or can I have multiple such statements?You can have multiple ones, but it\'s not always the neatest thing to do. Try not to overuse them, as it will seriously affect readability. Other than that , it\'s perfectly legal. See the below:http://www.learningjquery.com/2006/09/multiple-document-readyTry this out:You\'ll find that it\'s equivalent to this, note the order of execution:It\'s also worth noting that a function defined within one $(document).ready block cannot be called from another $(document).ready block, I just ran this test:output was:You can use multiple. But you can also use multiple functions inside one document.ready as well:Yes you can easily have multiple blocks. Just be careful with dependencies between them as the evaluation order might not be what you expect.Yes it is possible to have multiple $(document).ready() calls. However, I don\'t think you can know in which way they will be executed. (source)Yes it is possible but you can better use a div #mydiv and use bothYes, it\'s perfectly ok.but avoid doing it without a reason. For example I used it to declare global site rules seperately than indivual pages when my javascript files were generated dynamically but if you just keep doing it over and over it will make it hard to read.Also you can not access some methods from another \n    jQuery(function(){}); call\nso that\'s another reason you don\'t wanna do that.With the old window.onload though you will replace the old one every time you specified a function.Yes you can.Multiple document ready sections are particularly useful if you have other modules haging off the same page that use it. With the old window.onload=func declaration, every time you specified a function to be called, it replaced the old.Now all functions specified are queued/stacked (can someone confirm?) regardless of which document ready section they are specified in.I think the better way to go is to put switch to named functions (Check this overflow for more on that subject). \nThat way you can call them from a single event. Like so:That way you can load them in a single ready function.});This will output the following to your console.log:This way you can reuse the functions for other events. Check this fiddle for working versionIt\'s legal, but sometimes it cause undesired behaviour. As an Example I used the MagicSuggest library and added two MagicSuggest inputs in a page of my project and used seperate document ready functions for each initializations of inputs. The very first Input initialization worked, but not the second one and also not giving any error, Second Input didn\'t show up. So, I always recommend to use one Document Ready Function. You can even nest document ready functions inside included html files. Here\'s an example using jquery:File: test_main.htmlFile: test_embed.htmlConsole output:Browser shows:test_embed.html
