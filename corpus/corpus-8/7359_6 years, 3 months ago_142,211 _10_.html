How can I print all global variables/local variables? Is that possible in gdb?Type info variables to list "All global and static variable names".Type info locals to list "Local variables of current stack frame" (names and values), including static variables in that function.Type info args to list "Arguments of the current stack frame" (names and values).In case you want to see the local variables of a calling function use select-frame before info localsE.g.:In addition, since info locals does not display the arguments to the function you\'re in, useFor example:argc and argv won\'t be shown by info locals. The message will be "No locals."Reference: info locals command.
