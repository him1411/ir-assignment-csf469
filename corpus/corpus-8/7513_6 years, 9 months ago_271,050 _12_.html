Suppose I have:test[i] gets me ith line of the array (eg [1, 2]). How can I access the ith column? (eg [1, 3, 5]). Also, would this be an expensive operation?Similarly, lets you access rows.  This is covered in Section 1.4 (Indexing) of the NumPy reference.  This is quick, at least in my experience.  It\'s certainly much quicker than accessing each element in a loop.And if you want to access more than one column at a time you could do:this command gives you a row vector, if you just want to loop over it, it\'s fine, but if you want to hstack with some other array with dimension 3xN, you will haveValueError: all the input arrays must have same number of dimensionswhilegives you a column vector, so that you can do concatenate or hstack operation.e.g.You could also transpose and return a row:Then you can select the 2nd - 4th column this way:
