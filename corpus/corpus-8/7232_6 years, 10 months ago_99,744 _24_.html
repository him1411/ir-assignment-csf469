I\'m trying to extract a certain (the fourth) field from the column-based, \'space\'-adjusted text stream. I\'m trying to use the cut command in the following manner: cat text.txt | cut -d " " -f 4Unfortunately, cut doesn\'t treat several spaces as one delimiter. I could have piped through awkawk \'{ printf $4; }\' or sedsed  -E "s/[[:space:]]+/ /g"to collapse the spaces, but I\'d like to know if there any way to deal with cut and several delimiters natively?Try:From the tr man page:As you comment in your question, awk is really the way to go. To use cut is possible together with tr -s to squeeze spaces, as kev\'s answer shows.Let me however go through all the possible combinations for future readers. Explanations are at the Test section.Given this file, let\'s test the commands:This reads the fields sequentially. By using _ we indicate that this is a throwaway variable as a "junk variable" to ignore these fields. This way, we store $myfield as the 4th field in the file, no matter the spaces in between them.This catches three groups of spaces and no spaces with ([^ ]*[ ]*){3}. Then, it catches whatever coming until a space as the 4th field, that it is finally printed with \\1.After becoming frustrated with the too many limitations of cut, I wrote my own replacement, which I called cuts for "cut on steroids".cuts provides what is likely the most minimalist solution to this and many other related cut/paste problems.One example, out of many, addressing this particular question:cuts supports:and much more.  None of which is provided by standard cut.See also: https://stackoverflow.com/a/24543231/1296044Source and documentation (free software): http://arielf.github.io/cuts/With versions of cut I know of, no, this is not possible. cut is primarily useful for parsing files where the separator is not whitespace (for example /etc/passwd) and that have a fixed number of fields. Two separators in a row mean an empty field, and that goes for whitespace too.This Perl one-liner shows how closely Perl is related to awk:However, the @F autosplit array starts at index $F[0] while awk fields start with $1
