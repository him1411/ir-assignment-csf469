I was trying to get a list of all python and html files in a directory with the command find Documents -name "*.{py,html}".Then along came the man page:Braces within the pattern (\xe2\x80\x98{}\xe2\x80\x99) are not considered to be special (that is, find . -name \'foo{1,2}\' matches a file named foo{1,2}, not the files foo1 and foo2.As this is part of a pipe-chain, I\'d like to be able to specify which extensions it matches at runtime (no hardcoding).  If find just can\'t do it, a perl one-liner (or similar) would be fine.Edit: The answer I eventually came up with include all sorts of crap, and is a bit long as well, so I posted it as an answer to the original itch I was trying to scratch.  Feel free to hack that up if you have better solutions.Use -o, which means "or":Edit: Sorry, just re-read the question... you\'d need to build that command line programmatically, which isn\'t that easy.Are you using bash (or Cygwin on Windows)?  If you are, you should be able to do this:which might be easier to build programmatically.Edit: Applied @artbristol comment to the answer. Some editions of find, mostly on linux systems, possibly on others aswell support -regex and -regextype options, which finds files with names matching the regex.for exampleshould do the trick in the above example.\nHowever this is not a standard POSIX find function and is implementation dependent.You could programmatically add more -name clauses, separated by -or:Or, go for a simple loop instead:I had a similar need.  This worked for me:simple but works :)My default has been:find -type f | egrep -i "*.java|*.css|*.cs|*.sql"Like the less process intencive find execution by Brendan Long and Stephan202 et al.:find Documents \\( -name "*.py" -or -name "*.html" \\)This will find all .c or .cpp files on linuxYou don\'t need the escaped parenthesis unless you are doing some additional mods.  Here from the man page they are saying if the pattern matches, print it.  Perhaps they are trying to control printing.  In this case the -print acts as a conditional and becomes an "AND\'d" conditional.  It will prevent any .c files from being printed.But if you do like the original answer you can control the printing.  This will find all .c files as well.I needed to remove all files in child dirs except for some files. The following worked for me (three patterns specified):This works on AIX korn shell.This is looking for *.cbl or *.dms which are 1 day old, in current directory only, skipping the sub-directories.
