I would like to get the keys of a JavaScript object as an array, either in jQuery or pure JavaScript.Is there a less verbose way than this?Use Object.keys.This is an ES5 feature. This means it works in all modern browsers but will not work in legacy browsers. The ES5-shim has a implementation of Object.keys you can stealYou can use jQuery\'s $.map.Of course, Object.keys() is the best way to get an Object\'s keys. If it\'s not available in your environment, it can be trivially shimmed using code such as in your example (except you\'d need to take into account your loop will iterate over all properties up the prototype chain, unlike Object.keys()\'s behaviour).However, your example code...jsFiddle....could be modified. You can do the assignment right in the variable part.jsFiddle.Of course, this behaviour is different to what Object.keys() actually does (jsFiddle). You could simply use the shim on the MDN documentation.I don\'t know about less verbose but I was inspired to coerce the following onto one line by the one-liner request, don\'t know how Pythonic it is though ;)
