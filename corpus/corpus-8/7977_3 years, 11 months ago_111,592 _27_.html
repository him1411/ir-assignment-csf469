I use the following line in an initializer to autoload code in my /lib directory during development:config/initializers/custom.rb: (from Rails 3 Quicktip: Auto reload lib folders in development mode)It works great, but it\'s too inefficient to use in production- Instead of loading libs on each request, I just want to load them on start up. The same blog has another article describing how to do this:config/application.rb: However, when I switch to that, even in development, I get NoMethodErrors when trying to use the lib functions.Example of one of my lib files:lib/extensions.rb:Calling Time.milli_stamp will throw NoMethodErrorI realize others have answered similar questions on SO but they all seem to deal with naming conventions and other issues that I didn\'t to have to worry about before- My lib classes already worked for per-request loading, I just want to change it to per-startup loading. What\'s the right way to do this?I think this may solve your problem:in config/application.rb:and keep the right naming convention in lib.in lib/foo.rb:in lib/foo/bar.rb:if you really wanna do some monkey patches in file like lib/extensions.rb, you may manually require it:in config/initializers/require.rb:P.S. Rails 3 Autoload Modules/Classes by Bill Harding.And to understand what does Rails exactly do about auto-loading?\nread Rails autoloading \xe2\x80\x94 how it works, and when it doesn\'t by Simon Coffey.Though this does not directly answer the question, but I think it is a good alternative to avoid the question altogether.To avoid all the autoload_paths or eager_load_paths hassle, create a "lib" or a "misc" directory under "app" directory. Place codes as you would normally do in there, and Rails will load files just like how it will load (and reload) model files.This might help someone like me that finds this answer when searching for solutions to how Rails handles the class loading ... I found that I had to define a module whose name matched my filename appropriately, rather than just defining a class:In file lib/development_mail_interceptor.rb (Yes, I\'m using code from a Railscast :))works, but it doesn\'t load if I hadn\'t put the class inside a module.Use config.to_prepare to load you monkey patches/extensions for every request in development mode.end
