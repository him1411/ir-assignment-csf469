After adding log4j to my application I get the following output every time I execute my application:It seems this means a configuration file is missing.\nWhere should this config file be located and what is a good start content? I\'m using plain java for developing a desktop application. So no webserver etc...Log4j by default looks for a file called log4j.properties or log4j.xml on the classpath. \nYou can control which file it uses to initialize itself by setting system properties as described here (Look for the "Default Initialization Procedure" section). For example:Will cause log4j to look for a file called customName on the classpath.If you are having problems I find it helpful to turn on the log4j.debug:It will print to System.out lots of helpful information about which file it used to initialize itself, which loggers / appenders got configured and how etc. The configuration file can be a java properties file or an xml file. Here is a sample of the properties file format taken from the log4j intro documentation page:While setting up log4j properly is great for "real" projects you might want a quick-and-dirty solution, e.g. if you\'re just testing a new library.If so a call to the static methodwill setup basic logging to the console, and the error messages will be gone.If you just get rid of everything (e.g. if you are in tests)As per Apache Log4j FAQ page:Why do I see a warning about "No appenders found for logger" and "Please configure log4j properly"?This occurs when the default configuration files log4j.properties and log4j.xml can not be found and the application performs no explicit configuration. log4j uses Thread.getContextClassLoader().getResource() to locate the default configuration files and does not directly check the file system. Knowing the appropriate location to place log4j.properties or log4j.xml requires understanding the search strategy of the class loader in use. log4j does not provide a default configuration since output to the console or to the file system may be prohibited in some environments.Basically the warning No appenders could be found for logger means that you\'re using log4j logging system, but you haven\'t added any Appenders (such as FileAppender, ConsoleAppender, SocketAppender, SyslogAppender, etc.) into your configuration file or the configuration file is missing.There are three ways to configure log4j: with a properties file (log4j.properties), with an XML file and through Java code (rootLogger.addAppender(new NullAppender());).If you\'ve property file present (e.g. when installing Solr), you need to place this file within your classpath directory.Here are some command suggestions in Linux how to determine your classpath value:or from Java: System.getProperty("java.class.path").Below is a basic XML configuration file for log4j in XML format:If you\'re using Tomcat, you may place your log4j.properties into: /usr/share/tomcat?/lib/ or /var/lib/tomcat?/webapps/*/WEB-INF/lib/ folder.For the reference, Solr default log4j.properties file looks like:Why can\'t log4j find my properties file in a J2EE or WAR application?The short answer: the log4j classes and the properties file are not within the scope of the same classloader.Log4j only uses the default Class.forName() mechanism for loading classes. Resources are handled similarly. See the documentation for java.lang.ClassLoader for more details.So, if you\'re having problems, try loading the class or resource yourself. If you can\'t find it, neither will log4j. ;)See also:Find a log4j.properties or log4j.xml online that has a root appender, and put it on your classpath.will log to the console. I prefer logging to a file so you can investigate afterwards.although for verbose logging applications 100KB usually needs to be increased to 1MB or 10MB, especially for debug.Personally I set up multiple loggers, and set the root logger to warn or error level instead of debug.You can set the location of your log4j.properties from inside your java app by using:More information is available here: https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/manual.htmlYou can set up the log level by using setLevel().The levels are useful to easily set the kind of informations you want the program to display.For example:The set of possible levels are:TRACE,DEBUG,INFO,WARN,ERROR andFATALAccording to Logging Services manualAnother way to do it without putting the property file on the classpath, is to set the property from the java code directly. Here is the sample code.}To enable -Dlog4j.debug, I go to System, Advanced system settings, Environment variables and set system variable _JAVA_OPTIONS to -Dlog4j.debug.What are you developing in? Are you using Apache Tomcat?I have a properties like this in a Java app of mine.I\'ve created file log4j.properties in resources folder next to hibernate.cfg.xml file and filled it with text below:now I got rid of warnings and errorsSimply, create log4j.properties under src/main/assembly folder. Depending on if you want log messages to be shown in the console or in the file you modify your file. The following is going to show your messages in the console. As explained earlier there are 2 approaches First one is to just add this line to your main method:Second approach is to add this standard log4j.properties file to your classpath:While taking second approach you need to make sure you initialize the file properly.Eg.Make sure you create required folder to store log files.Try to set debug attribut in log4j:configuration node to true.It prints out information as the configuration file is read and used to configure the log4j environment. You may be got more details to resolve your problem.My log4j got fixed by below property file:If we are using apache commons logging wrapper on top of log4j, then we need to have both the jars available in classpath. Also, commons-logging.properties and log4j.properties/xml should be available in classpath. We can also pass implementation class and log4j.properties name as JAVA_OPTS either using -Dorg.apache.commons.logging.Log=<logging implementation class name> -Dlog4j.configuration=<file:location of log4j.properties/xml file>. Same can be done via setting JAVA_OPTS in case of app/web server.It will help to externalize properties which can be changed in deployment.Call this method
