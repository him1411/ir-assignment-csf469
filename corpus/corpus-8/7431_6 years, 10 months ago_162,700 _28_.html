I have problems with setting up/locating my output files in Xcode4 (beta 5). They are placed somewhere in ~/Library/Developer/ugly_path/.... I can\'t even select "show in finder" on my products. It is the same for a simple C project, Foundation tool and even Cocoa bundle. A Debugging works fine.Could you please point me out where and how to set up / build output directories? (I know it sounds dumb, I\'ve been coding in Xcode3 for months, but I can\'t figure it out in Xcode4 beta).Thanks a lot.From the Xcode menu on top, click preferences, select the locations tab, look at the build location option.You have 2 options:Update:\nOn xcode 4.6.2 you need to click the advanced button on the right side below the derived data text field. Build Location select legacy.If you build from command line, you can set output directory in the following way:In Xcode 5: Xcode menu > Preferences... item > Locations tab > Locations sub-tab > Advanced... button > Custom option.Then choose, e.g., Relative to Workspace.If you have Xcode 4 Build Location setting set to "Place build products in derived data location (recommended), it should be located in ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData. This directory will have your project in there as a directory, the project name will be appended with a bunch of generated letters so look carefully.Keep derived data but use the DSTROOT to specify the destination. Use DEPLOYMENT_LOCATION to force deployment. Use the undocumented DWARF_DSYM_FOLDER_PATH to copy the dSYM over too. This allows you to use derived data location from xcodebuild and not have to do wacky stuff to find the app.You can always find the build directory by looking in the build log viewer, and copying the path there into a terminal window.I use this to analyze my iOS .app bundles before they get installed to make sure no stray files are being included.For anyone who wants to find the build directory from a script but does not want to change it, run the following to get a list of all the build settings that point to a folder in DerivedData:If you run custom targets and schemes, please put them there as well:Look at the output to locate the setting output that you want and then:The last part cuts the string at the equal sign and then trims the whitespace at the beginning.If you use the new Xcode4 Workspaces, you can change the Derived Data Location under File -> Workspace settings...You can configure the output directory using the CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR environment variable.Source: http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/DeveloperTools/Reference/XcodeBuildSettingRef/0-Introduction/introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003931-CH1-SW1Another thing to check before you start playing with Xcode preferences is:Select your target and go to Build Settings > Packaging > Wrapper ExtensionThe value there should be: appIf not double click it and type "app" without the qoutes.This was so annoying. Open your project, click on Target, Open Build Phases tab. Check your Copy Bundle Resources for any red items.
