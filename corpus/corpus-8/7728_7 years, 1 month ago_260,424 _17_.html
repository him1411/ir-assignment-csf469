How to pass parameters to Thread.ThreadStart() method in C#?Suppose I have method called \'download\'Now I have created one thread in the main method:error method type expected.How can I pass parameters to ThreadStart with target method with parameters?The simplest is justThe advantage(s) of this (over ParameterizedThreadStart) is that you can pass multiple parameters, and you get compile-time checking without needing to cast from object all the time.Look at this example:You are first creating a thread by passing delegate to worker method and then starts it with a Thread.Start method which takes your object as parameter.So in your case you should use it like this:But your \'download\' method still needs to take object, not string as a parameter. You can cast it to string in your method body.You want to use the ParameterizedThreadStart delegate for thread methods that take parameters. (Or none at all actually, and let the Thread constructor infer.)Example usage:You could also delegate like so...You can encapsulate the thread function(download) and the needed parameter(s)(filename) in a class and use the ThreadStart delegate to execute the thread function.How about this: (or is it ok to use like this?)here is the perfect way...
