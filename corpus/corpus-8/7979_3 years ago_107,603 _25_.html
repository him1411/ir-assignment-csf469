I know how to programmatically do it, but I\'m sure there\'s a built-in way... Every language I\'ve used has some sort of default textual representation for a collection of objects that it will spit out when you try to concatenate the Array with a string, or pass it to a print() function, etc.  Does Apple\'s Swift language have a built-in way of easily turning an Array into a String, or do we always have to be explicit when stringifying an array?If the array contains strings, you can use the String\'s join method:In Swift 2:This can be useful if you want to use a specific separator (hypen, blank, comma, etc).Otherwise you can simply use the description property, which returns a string representation of the array:Hint: any object implementing the Printable protocol has a description property. If you adopt that protocol in your own classes/structs, you make them print friendly as wellIn Swift 3 With Swift 3, according to your needs, you may choose one of the following blocks of code.Swift 2.0 Xcode 7.0 beta 6 onwards uses joinWithSeparator() instead of join():joinWithSeparator is defined as an extension on SequenceTypeSwift 3 Mine works on NSMutableArray with componentsJoinedByStringResult will be >>>  Mani Singh iOS DeveloperIn Swift 2.2 you may have to cast your array to NSArray to use componentsJoinedByString(",")In the spirit of functional programming \xf0\x9f\xa4\x96The Swift equivalent to what you\'re describing is string interpolation. If you\'re thinking about things like JavaScript doing "x" + array, the equivalent in Swift is "x\\(array)".As a general note, there is an important difference between string interpolation vs the Printable protocol. Only certain classes conform to Printable. Every class can be string interpolated somehow. That\'s helpful when writing generic functions. You don\'t have to limit yourself to Printable classes.You can print any object using the print functionor use \\(name) to convert any object to a string.Example:To change an array of Optional/Non-Optional StringsHere flatMap skips the nil values in the array and appends the other values to give a joined string.Create extension for an Array:FOR SWIFT 3:
