In Rails, what is the difference between attr_accessor and attr_accessible? From my understanding, using attr_accessor is used to create getter and setter methods for that variable, so that we can access the variable like Object.variable or Object.variable = some_value.I read that attr_accessible makes that specific variable accessible to the outside world.\nCan someone please tell me whats the differenceattr_accessor is a ruby method that makes a getter and a setter. attr_accessible is a Rails method that allows you to pass in values to a mass assignment: new(attrs) or update_attributes(attrs). Here\'s a mass assignment:You can imagine that the order might also have a discount code, say :price_off. If you don\'t tag :price_off as attr_accessible you stop malicious code from being able to do like so:Even if your form doesn\'t have a field for :price_off, if it\'s in your model it\'s available by default. This means a crafted POST could still set it. Using attr_accessible white lists those things that can be mass assigned.Many people on this thread and on google explain very well that attr_accessible specifies a whitelist of attributes that are allowed to be updated in bulk (all the attributes of an object model together at the same time)\nThis is mainly (and only) to protect your application from "Mass assignment" pirate exploit.This is explained here on the official Rails doc : Mass Assignmentattr_accessor is a ruby code to (quickly) create setter and getter methods in a Class. That\'s all.Now, what is missing as an explanation is that when you create somehow a link between a (Rails) model with a database table, you NEVER, NEVER, NEVER need attr_accessor in your model to create setters and getters in order to be able to modify your table\'s records.This is because your model inherits all methods from the ActiveRecord::Base Class, which already defines basic CRUD accessors (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for you.\nThis is explained on the offical doc here Rails Model and here Overwriting default accessor (scroll down to the chapter "Overwrite default accessor")Say for instance that: we have a database table called "users" that contains three columns "firstname", "lastname" and "role" :SQL instructions :I assumed that you set the option config.active_record.whitelist_attributes = true in your config/environment/production.rb to protect your application from Mass assignment exploit. This is explained here : Mass AssignmentYour Rails model will perfectly work with the Model here below :However you will need to update each attribute of user separately in your controller for your form\'s View to work :Now to ease your life, you don\'t want to make a complicated controller for your User model.\nSo you will use the attr_accessible special method in your Class model :So you can use the "highway" (mass assignment) to update :You didn\'t add the "role" attributes to the attr_accessible list because you don\'t let your users set their role by themselves (like admin). You do this yourself on another special admin View.Though your user view doesn\'t show a "role" field, a pirate could easily send a HTTP POST request that include "role" in the params hash. The missing "role" attribute on the attr_accessible is to protect your application from that.You can still modify your user.role attribute on its own like below, but not with all attributes together.Why the hell would you use the attr_accessor?Well, this would be in the case that your user-form shows a field that doesn\'t exist in your users table as a column.For instance, say your user view shows a "please-tell-the-admin-that-I\'m-in-here" field.\nYou don\'t want to store this info in your table. You just want that Rails send you an e-mail warning you that one "crazy" ;-) user has subscribed.To be able to make use of this info you need to store it temporarily somewhere.\nWhat more easy than recover it in a user.peekaboo attribute ?So you add this field to your model :So you will be able to make an educated use of the user.peekaboo attribute somewhere in your controller to send an e-mail or do whatever you want.ActiveRecord will not save the "peekaboo" attribute in your table when you do a user.save because she don\'t see any column matching this name in her model.attr_accessor is a Ruby method that gives you setter and getter methods to an instance variable of the same name. So it is equivalent toattr_accessible is a Rails method that determines what variables can be set in a mass assignment. When you submit a form, and you have something like MyModel.new params[:my_model] then you want to have a little bit more control, so that people can\'t submit things that you don\'t want them to. You might do attr_accessible :email so that when someone updates their account, they can change their email address. But you wouldn\'t do attr_accessible :email, :salary because then a person could set their salary through a form submission. In other words, they could hack their way to a raise. That kind of information needs to be explicitly handled. Just removing it from the form isn\'t enough. Someone could go in with firebug and add the element into the form to submit a salary field. They could use the built in curl to submit a new salary to the controller update method, they could create a script that submits a post with that information. So attr_accessor is about creating methods to store variables, and attr_accessible is about the security of mass assignments.attr_accessor is ruby code and is used when you do not have a column in your database, but still want to show a field in your forms. The only way to allow this is to attr_accessor :fieldname and you can use this field in your View, or model, if you wanted, but mostly in your View.Let\'s consider the following exampleHere we have used attr_reader (readable attribute) and attr_writer (writable attribute) for accessing purpose. But we can achieve the same functionality using attr_accessor. In short, attr_accessor provides access to both getter and setter methods.So modified code is as belowattr_accessible allows you to list all the columns you want to allow Mass Assignment. The opposite of this is attr_protected which means this field I do NOT want anyone to be allowed to Mass Assign to. More than likely it is going to be a field in your database that you don\'t want anyone monkeying around with. Like a status field, or the like.attr_accessor is getter, setter method. \nwhereas attr_accessible is to say that particular attribute is accessible or not. that\'s it. I wish to add we should use Strong parameter instead of attr_accessible to protect from mass asignment.Cheers!A quick & concise difference overview :attr_accessor is an easy way to create read and write accessors in\n  your class. It is used when you do not have a column in your database,\n  but still want to show a field in your forms. This field is a\n  \xe2\x80\x9cvirtual attribute\xe2\x80\x9d in a Rails model.virtual attribute \xe2\x80\x93 an attribute not corresponding to a column in the database.attr_accessible is used to identify attributes that are accessible\n  by your controller methods  makes a property available for\n  mass-assignment.. It will only allow access to the attributes that you\n  specify, denying the rest.
