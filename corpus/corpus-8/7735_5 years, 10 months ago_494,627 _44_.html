I am having a problem with BLOB fields in my MySQL database - when uploading files larger than approx 1MB I get an error Packets larger than max_allowed_packet are not allowed.Here is what i\'ve tried:In MySQL Query Browser I ran a show variables like \'max_allowed_packet\' which gave me 1048576. Then I execute the query set global max_allowed_packet=33554432 followed by show variables like \'max_allowed_packet\' - it gives me 33554432 as expected.But when I restart the MySQL server it magically goes back to 1048576. What am I doing wrong here?Bonus question, is it possible to compress a BLOB field?Change in the my.ini or ~/.my.cnf file by including the single line under [mysqld] section in your file:then restart the MySQL service and you are done.See the documentation for further information.The max_allowed_packet variable can be set globally by running a query.However, if you do not change it in the my.ini file (as dragon112 suggested), the value will reset when the server restarts, even if you set it globally.To change the setting for everyone until the server restarts: One of my junior developers was having a problem modifying this for me so I thought I would expand this in greater detail for linux users:1) open terminal2) ssh root@YOURIP3) enter root password4) nano /etc/my.cnf  (if command is not recognized do this first or try vi then repeat: yum install nano )5) add the line: max_allowed_packet=256M (obviously adjust size for whatever you need) under the [MYSQLD] section. He made a mistake of putting it at the bottom of the file first so it did not work.6) Control + O (save)  then ENTER (confirm) then Control + X (exit file)7) service mysqld restart8) You can check the change in the variables section on phpmyadminI think some would also want to know how to find the my.ini file on your PC. For windows users, I think the best way is as follows:I got this answer from http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=68516If getting this error while performing a backup, max_allowed_packet can be set in the my.cnf particularly for mysqldump.I kept getting this error while performing a mysqldump and I did not understand because I had this set in my.cnf under the [mysqld] section. Once I figured out I could set it for [mysqldump] and I set the value, my backups completed without issue.For those running wamp mysql serverWamp tray Icon -> MySql -> my.iniScroll down to the end until u findAdd the line of packet_size in betweenCheck whether it worked with this queryFollowing all instructions, this is what I did and worked:So, as we can see, the max_allowed_packet has been changed outside from my.ini.Lets leave the session and check again: Conclusion, after SET GLOBAL max_allowed_packet=1073741824, the server will have the new max_allowed_packet until it is restarted, as someone stated previously.This error come because of your data contain larger then set value.Just write down the max_allowed_packed=500M\nor you can calculate that 500*1024k and use that instead of 500M if you want.Now just restart the MySQL.Many of the answerers spotted the issue and already gave the solution.I just want to suggest another solution, which is changing the Glogal variable value from within the tool Mysql Workbench. That is ofcourse IF you use Workbench running locally on server (or via SSH connection)You just connect to your instance and go on menu:Server -> Options File -> Networking -> max_allowed_packedYou set the desired value and then you need to restart MySql Service.If you want upload big size image or data in database. Just change the data type to \'BIG BLOB\'.
