After hours of reading about and experimenting with DNS records I can access my Google app engine app via these URLs:What does not work:I want to be able to serve my app directly off my domain and not a subdomain. I\'ve seen apps that do this. Is there any way to do this without a URL redirect?Thanks,\nMark[Update April 2016] This answer is now outdated, custom naked domain mapping is supported, see Lawrence Mok\'s answer.I have figured it out!First off: it is impossible to link something like mydomain.com with your appspot app. This is considered a naked domain, which is not supported by Google App Engine (anymore). Strictly speaking, the answer to my question has to be "impossible". Read on...All you can do is add subdomains pointing to your app, e.g myappid.mydomain.com. The key to get your top level domain linked to your app is to realize that www is a subdomain like any other!myappid.mydomain.com is treated exactly the same as www.mydomain.com!Here are the steps:Now you have www.mydomain.com linked to your app.I wished this would have been more obvious in the documentation...Good luck![update 2015-09-28] Now Google lets you add custom domains (including naked domains) and setup SSL without the need of Google Apps. For details refer to here: https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/using-custom-domains-and-ssl?hl=enI just discovered today (as of 2014-04-11) a new custom domain settings page is available from Google Developers Console: 1. Go to https://console.developers.google.com/project\n 2. Click on your project\n 3. On the left click "App Engine"\n 4. Click "Settings"There you go! You can configure custom domain without the need of Google App account![Update April 2016] This answer is now outdated, custom naked domain mapping is supported, see Lawrence Mok\'s answer.See http://www.google.com/support/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=91077 for the details.  Once you have signed up for Google Apps for Your Domain:You can\'t use a naked domain, though, such as whatever.com (but www.whatever.com does work), because:Due to recent changes, Google App Engine no longer supports mapping\n  your app to a naked domain. If your domain registrar supports URL\n  redirects, you can redirect from http://yourdomain.com to your app,\n  which can be served from domains like http://www.yourdomain.com or\n  http://appid.yourdomain.com.as specified at http://www.google.com/support/a/bin/answer.py?answer=91080If like me you have seen this message while trying to add \'www\' as a subdomain inorder to get your own domain working: \'Already used, please remove previous\n  mapping first  . \'The above process mentioned in other answers has changed slightly if you are using Google Apps for your domain.You must now do this as well:Google Apps -> Service Settings -> Sites. Click \'Web address mapping\' and remove the \'www\' mapping which has been added by default to Sites.Then you can add the \'www\' subdomain for your App engine appsee this link:http://groups.google.com/group/google-appengine/web/deleting-existing-www-mapping-from-google-appsAnother solution which is given by Google is URL forwarding: http://www.google.com/support/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en-in&answer=61057Google does offer naked domain redirection.Google does not provide an IP for us to set A record. If it would we could use naked domains.There is another option, by setting A record to foreign web server\'s IP and that server could make an http redirect from e.g domain.com to www.domain.com (check out GiDNS)I know all these steps and actually the following is the short and fantastic way.1 - Go to appengine.google.com, open your app2 - Administration > Versions > Add Domain... (your domain has to be linked to your Google Apps account, follow the steps to do that including the domain verification.)3 - Go to www.google.com/a/yourdomain.com4 - Dashboard > your app should be listed here. Click on it.5 - myappid settings page > Web address > Add new URL6 - Simply enter www and click Add7 - Using your domain hosting provider\'s web interface, add a CNAME for www for your domain and point to ghs.googlehosted.com8 - Now you have www.mydomain.com linked to your app.Now that I\'ve done that all, I can go to my appengine app successfully using my custom domain. For example http://cic.mx and http://www.cic.mx both take me to my app. But URL changes to -myappid-.appspot.com and I don\'t want it to happen !Has anyone solved this issue? I\'m using a php app on the appengine, with a wordpress instance.Just managed to sort this finally after hours. The www subdomain was pointing to Sites, but the front end wasn\'t showing me that.After taking the plunge and setting the CNAME to gwh.google.com, and enabling / disabling Sites a couple of times (see the comment from Rodrigo Moraes on http://groups.google.com/group/google-appengine/web/deleting-existing-www-mapping-from-google-apps) I was able to set the Sites address to use the www subdomain.I was then able to change it away from using the www subdomain, at which point the appengine app allowed me to specify the www subdomain.That is one dirty fix - basically turning on and off Sites until it works!When you go to "Application Settings -> Add Domain" It will ask to select login account, probably you are already on gmail account so it will show gmail account as well, but you should use Google Apps account where you have mapped your custom domain.You can redirect forward or mask your domain name in godaddy but I don\'t know about other hosting sites.Have a look on this linkHere is a tutorial from Google about mapping your App on custom domain: https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/domain?hl=FR It should be the latest update. But please note these 2 things:1- You may not find you App in the new developer console, then the only workaround for that is download your source code, create a new app from the new developer console and deploy it.2- You find your App on the developer console, but under the Compute menu you may not find the App Engine Settings as mentioned in the tutorial, then you have to proceed the same as i explained in the first point (create another application)I hope this helps !You must try like this, Application Settings > Add Domain...
