I had the following page (deadlink: http://www.workingstorage.com/Sample.htm ) that has a footer that I can\'t make sit at the bottom of the page.The CSS is inherited and befuddles me; I can\'t seem to change it properly to put a minimum height on the content or make the footer go to the bottom.Make the body 100% of your page, with a min-height of 100% too.The footer is then given negative margin-top:From IE7 onwards you can simply useSee caniuse for support. A very simple approach which works great cross browser is this:http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/keeping-footers-at-the-bottom-of-the-pageI\'ve developed quite an easy method to stick the Footer at the bottom, but as most common methods, you will need to tweak it to fit your Footer\'s height.\nVIEW DEMOThis method below uses a "trick" by placing an ::after pseudo-element on the body, and set it to have the exact height of the footer, so it will occupy the exact same space the footer does, so when the footer is absolute positioned over it, it would appear like the footer is really taking up space and eliminate the negative affects of it\'s absolute positioning (for example, going over the body\'s content)A simple solution that i use, works from IE8+Give min-height:100% on html so that if content is less then still page takes full view-port height and footer sticks at bottom of page. When content increases the footer shifts down with content and keep sticking to bottom.JS fiddle working Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/3L3h64qo/2/I\'ve used this to stick my footer to the bottom and it worked for me:HTMLThat\'s the only modification you have to do in the HTML, add that div with the "allButFooter" class. I did it with all the pages, those that were so short, I knew the footer wouldn\'t stick to the bottom, and also pages long enough that I already knew I had to scroll. I did this, so I could see that it works ok in the case that a page\'s content is dynamic. CSSThe "allButFooter" class has a min-height value that depends on the viewport\'s height (100vh means 100% of the viewport height) and the footer\'s height, that I already knew was 40px.That\'s all I did, and it worked perfectly for me. I haven\'t tried it in every browser, just Firefox, Chrome and Edge, and the results were as I wanted. The footer sticks to the bottom, and you don\'t have to mess with z-index, position, or any other properties. The position of every element in my document was the default position, I didn\'t change it to absolute or fixed or anything.Working with responsive designHere\'s something I would like to clear out. This solution, with the same Footer that was 40px high didn\'t work as I expected when I was working in a responsive design using Twitter-Bootstrap. I had to modify the value I was substracting in the function:This is probably because Twitter-Bootstrap comes with its own margins and paddings, so that\'s why I had to adjust that value.I hope this is of some use for you guys! At least, it\'s a simple solution to try, and it doesn\'t involve making big changes to the whole document.One thing to be wary of is mobile devices, since they implement the idea of the viewport in an \'unusual\' way:http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/UsingtheViewport/UsingtheViewport.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006509-SW25As such, using position: fixed; (as i\'ve seen recommended in other places) usually isn\'t the way to go. Of course, it depends upon the exact behaviour you\'re after.What I\'ve used, and has worked well on desktop and mobile, is:withThis is known as a sticky footer. A google search for it comes up with a lot of results. A CSS Sticky Footer is the one I\'ve used successfully. But there are more.Yet, another really simple solution is this one:jsFiddleThe trick is to use a display:table for the whole document and display:table-row with height:0 for the footer.Since the footer is the only body child that has a display as table-row, it is rendered at the bottom of the page.My jquery method, this one puts the footer at the bottom of the page if the page content is less than the window height, or just puts the footer after the content otherwise:Also, keeping the code in it\'s own enclosure before other code will reduce the time it takes to reposition the footer.I have myself been looking into this problem. I have seen quite a few solutions and each of them had issues, often involving some magic numbers.So using best practices from various sources I came up with this solution:http://jsfiddle.net/vfSM3/248/The thing I wanted to achieve specifically here was to get the main content to scroll between footer and header inside green area.here is a simple css:here is my two cents. In comparisson to other solutions, one does not need to add extra containers. Therefor this solution is a bit more elegant. Beneath the code example i\'ll explain why this works.So the first thing we do, is make the biggest container( html ) 100%. The html page is as big as the page itself. Next we set the body height, it can be bigger than the 100% of the html tag, but it should at least be as big, therefore we use min-height 100%. We also make the body relative. Relative means you can move the block element around relative from its original position. We don\'t use that here though. Because relative has a second use. Any absolute element is either absolute to the root (html) or to the first relative parent/grandparent. That\'s what we want, we want the footer to be absolute, relative to the body, namely the bottom. The last step is to set the footer to absolute and bottom:0, which moves it to the bottom of the first parent/grandparent that is relative ( body ofcourse ).Now we still have one problem to fix, when we fill the complete page, the content goes beneath the footer. Why? well, because the footer is no longer inside the "html flow", because it is absolute. So how do we fix this? We will add padding-bottom to the body. This makes sure the body is actually bigger than it\'s content. I hope i made a lot clear for you guys. Just set the html, body, and the other rows except the footer to 100%.\ne.g \nthe css becomes This is how i solved the same issueYou can use http://ryanfait.com/sticky-footer/ , I have used in my many projects and never got any single issue :)for your reference, Code are in snippet A very simple flex solution that do not assume fixed heights or changing position of elements.HTMLCSSBrowser SupportAll major browsers, except IE11 and below.Make sure to use Autoprefixer for appropriate prefixes.Do thisYou can also read about flex it is supported by all modern browsersUpdate: I read about flex and tried it. It worked for me. Hope it does the same for you. Here is how I implemented.Here main is not the ID it is the  divHere you can read more about flex https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/Do keep in mind it is not supported by older versions of IE.All CSS methods I have come across are too rigid. Also, setting the footer to fixed is not an option if that\'s not part of the design. Tested on:Assuming this layout:Use the following jQuery function:What that does is set the min-height for #content to the window height - the height of the footer what ever that might be at the time.Since we used min-height, if #content height exceeds the window height, the function degrades gracefully and does not any effect anything since it\'s not needed.See it in action:Same snippet on JsFiddleWe can take this further and make this function adapt to dynamic viewer height resizing like so:I know this is old but one "hack" I\'ve used when the footer falls under a float div like the image below is to use an empty table with a width of 100% at the bottom of the page.
