Not sure what I\'m doing wrong here. I installed the Android SDK Manager, and am now trying to install a platform like the Android Dev website suggests. Once I clicked install I got an error stating that the Manager could not create a temp folder within the Android directory. So I created it. Now I\'m getting this error:Downloading SDK Platform Android 2.3,\n  API 9, revision 1 File not found:\n  C:\\Program Files\n  (x86)\\Android\\android-sdk-windows\\temp\\android-2.3_r01-linux.zip\n  (Access is denied)There is also a little message under the progress bar that says "Done. Nothing was installed."I\'m running Windows 7 Ultimate, in case that\'s of any use.When you launch SDK manager, try right clicking on the .exe and selecting "Run As Administrator".Also, some anti-virus programs have been known to interfere with SDK Manager I was getting a similar permission issue and SDK Manager could not download and install new components. Error message was (I\'m running Android Studio (I/O Preview) 0.2.9)"Unable to create C:\\Program Files\n  (x86)\\Android\\android-studio\\sdk\\temp"Although solution was infact what @william-tate\'s answer says, I could not run the \'SDK Manager\' directly. It fails with message:Failed to execute tools\\android.bat\n  The system cannot find the file specified.Instead I ran the \'tools\\android.bat\' as Administrator, which in turn launched SDK Manager with same permissions which fixed the issue. Hope this helps for someone who faces the issue I faced.In Mac OS X (tried with Android Studio), do the following in TerminalThis launches SDK manager as admin. Now update/install the packages from SDK manager and it\'ll work.For Android Studio, selecting "Run As Administrator" while starting Android Studio helps.In my case I had to specify proxy settings in Tools->Options.I had same problem when I try to install it on my pc (Win7, 64-bit system). I had an error message shown in figure below. But when I check my local folder \'C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\sdk\', the Android SDK is already there. Somehow Android studio could not see/link it. So please check first whether you can find the Android SDK in the local folder. If yes, just follow the next steps. Hopefully it helps. I had a similar issue - very slow xml downloads followed by an empty package list.  The SDK, it seems, was trying to use legacy Java installation. Setting the JAVA_HOME to the 1.6 jdk did the trick.In my case I was using Windows 7 with the 64-bit OS.  We installed the 64-bit Java SE and 64-bit ADT Bundle.  With that set up, we couldn\'t get the SDK manager to work correctly (specifically, no downloads allowed and it didn\'t show all the API download options).  After trying all of the above answers and from other posts, we decided to look into the Java set up and realized it might the 64-bit configuration that\'s giving the ADT bundle grief (I vaguely recall seeing/reading this issue before).So we uninstalled Java 64-bit and reinstalled the 32-bit, and then used the 32-bit ADT bundle, and it worked correctly.  The system user was already an admin, so we didn\'t need to "Run as Administrator"For those running SDK Manager in Eclipse, selecting "Run As Administrator" while starting Eclipse.exe helps.If you use SDK Manager in Eclipse:Option 1: Right-click on eclipse.exe and select "Run As Administrator".Option 2: If you don\'t want to start Eclipse.exe as Administrator just install/copy Eclipse installation files from "C:\\program files\\Eclipse ADT Bundle\\" to some unprotected folder, like "D:\\android\\". Run "D:\\android\\eclipse\\eclipse.exe", select menu item "Window => Preferences => Android" and change "SDK Location" to "D:\\android\\sdk\\". After that you\'ll be able to install new packages in Android SDK Manager.go to sdk folder and right click on SDK manager and run with administrator and enjoy installing.To go along with what v01d said:Using Android Studio for Mac OS X, the SDK folder could also be at /Users/{user}/Library/Android/sdk, where {user} is your username.To find out where the partial SDK installation is, go to Configure > SDK Manager in Android Studio, then click edit at the top. This should pop up a window and show the location.Copy this path and paste it front of the cd command in a terminal. Finally execute sudo ./android sdk to launch the standalone SDK manager.EDIT (July 14, 2016):The "android" binary file could also be at /Users/{user}/Library/Android/sdk/tools.In windows 8:Solution for macOShttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPnu3Nrd1u0&feature=youtu.beWhy it\'s happening?\ndue to lock icon on some folder(not having read/write  access) in\n"/yourpath/android-studio-SDK" Sort and sweet solution\n-Open Terminal (Ctrl +alt +t)\n-copy pest sudo chown -R $USER: $HOME\n-wait for a while.....\n-now Try again to update your SDK Happy Coding :)The Access denied is because Windows doesn\'t give the default write and modify permission to the files in its install drive viz. c: \nTo resolve this issue I usually use a separate drive or in your case, you need to set the access rights to the specific folder in the options\nright click -> options > security -> edit\n
