If I have some text in a String, how can I copy that to the clipboard so that the user can paste it into another window (for example, from my application to Notepad)?You can use System.Windows.Forms.Clipboard.SetText(...).System.Windows.Forms.Clipboard.SetText (Winforms) or System.Windows.Clipboard.SetText (WPF)I wish calling SetText were that easy but there are quite a few gotchas that you have to deal with. You have to make sure that the thread you are calling it on is running in the STA. It can sometimes fail with an access denied error then work seconds later without problem - something to do with the COM timing issues in the clipboard. And if your application is accessed over Remote Desktop access to the clipboard is sketchy. We use a centralized method to handle all theses scenarios instead of calling SetText directly.@Stecy: Here\'s our centralized code:The StaHelper class simply executes some arbitrary code on a thread in the Single Thread Apartment (STA) - required by the clipboard.Then we have a specific class for setting text on the clipboard. Creating a DataObject manually is required in some edge cases on some versions of Windows/.NET. I don\'t recall the exact scenarios now and it may not be required in .NET 3.5.Usage looks like this:WPF: System.Windows.Clipboard (PresentationCore.dll)Winforms: System.Windows.Forms.ClipboardBoth have a static SetText method.This works for me:You want to do:But it causes an error saying it must be in a single thread of ApartmentState.STA.So let\'s make it run in such a thread. The code for it:After calling copy_to_clipboard(), the string is copied into the clipboard, so you can Paste or Ctrl + V and get back the string as String to be copied to the clipboard.Using the solution showed in this question, System.Windows.Forms.Clipboard.SetText(...), results in the exception:Current thread must be set to single thread apartment (STA) mode before OLE calls can be madeTo prevent this, you can add the attribute:toIn Windows Forms, if your string is in a textbox, you can easily use this:Clipboard.SetText is what you want.Use try-catch, even if it has an error it will still copy.If you use a message box to capture the exception, it will show you error, but the value is still copied to clipboard.
