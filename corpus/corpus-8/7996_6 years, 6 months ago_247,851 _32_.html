MySQL has an OPTIMIZE TABLE command which can be used to reclaim unused space in a MySQL install.  Is there a way (built-in command or common stored procedure) to run this optimization for every table in the database and/or server install, or is this something you\'d have to script up yourself?You can use mysqlcheck to do this at the command line.One database:All databases:I made this \'simple\' script:To run it, simply paste it in any SQL IDE connected to your database.Notice: this code WON\'T work on phpmyadmin.It runs a show tables statement and stores it in a prepared statement. Then it runs a optimize table in the selected set.You can control which tables to optimize by setting a different value in the var @c.Following example php script can help you to optimize all tables in your databaseDo all the necessary procedures for fixing all tables in all the databases with a simple shell script:for all databases:For one Database optimization:You can optimize/check and repair all the tables of database, using mysql client.First, you should get all the tables list, separated with \',\':Now, when you have all the tables list for optimization:From command line:then type passwordThe MySQL Administrator (part of the MySQL GUI Tools) can do that for you on a database level.Just select your schema and press the Maintenance button in the bottom right corner.Since the GUI Tools have reached End-of-life status they are hard to find on the mysql page. Found them via Google: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/gui-tools/5.0.htmlI don\'t know if the new MySQL Workbench can do that, too.And you can use the mysqlcheck command line tool which should be able to do that, too.From phpMyAdmin and other sources you can use:Then you can copy & paste the result to a new query or execute it from your own source.If you want to analyze, repair and optimize all tables in all databases in your MySQL server, you can do this in one go from the command line. You will need root to do that though.Once you run that, you will be prompted to enter your MySQL root password. After that, it will start and you will see results as it\'s happening.Example output:If you don\'t know the root password and are using WHM, you can change it from within WHM by going to: \nHome > SQL Services > MySQL Root PasswordThis bash script will accept the root password as option and optimize it one by one, with status output:A starter bash script to list and run a tool against the DBs... my 2cents: start with table with highest fragmentation
