Is it possible to view Androidmanifest.xml file?I just changed the extension of the apk file to zip. This zip file contains the Androidmanifest.xml file. But I am unable view the contents of Androidmanifest.xml. It is fully encrypted.How can I view the Androidmanifest.xml file?Yes you can view XML files of an Android APK file. There is a tool for this: android-apktoolIt is a tool for reverse engineering 3rd\n  party, closed, binary Android appsHow to do this on your Windows System:Now copy the APK file also in that directory and run the following command in your command prompt:This will create a directory "HelloWorld" in your current directory. Inside it you can find the AndroidManifest.xml file in decrypted format, and you can also find other XML files inside the "HelloWorld/res/layout" directory. Here HelloWorld.apk is your Android APK file.See the below screen shot for more information:\nYou can directly use aapt l -a name.apk command to see the manifest.xml. This link might help http://elinux.org/Android_aapt(This will also dump the resource table.)In this thread, Dianne Hackborn tells us we can get info out of the AndroidManifest using aapt.I whipped up this quick unix command to grab the version info:aapt d xmltree com.package.apk AndroidManifest.xmlwill dump the AndroidManifest.xml from the specified APK. It\'s not in XML form, but you can still read it.aapt (Android Asset Packaging Tool) is a built in tool that comes with the Android SDK.Android Studio can now show this. Go to Build > Analyze APK... and select your apk. Then you can see the content of the AndroidManifset file. Google has just release a cross-platform open source tool for inspecting APKs (among many other binary Android formats):ClassyShark is a standalone binary inspection tool for Android developers. It can reliably browse any Android executable and show important info such as class interfaces and members, dex counts and dependencies. ClassyShark supports multiple formats including libraries (.dex, .aar, .so), executables (.apk, .jar, .class) and all Android binary XMLs: AndroidManifest, resources, layouts etc.The AXMLParser and APKParser.jar can also do the job, you can see the link. AXMLParserThere is an online tool that lets you upload an APK It decompiles it and finally lets you to download a zip with all sources, manifest XML file and so on decompiled, all of that without having to install any program on your computer:\nhttp://www.javadecompilers.com/apkAlso if you wish just to check on some params you can, by their UIYou can use this command : save to file AndroidManifest.txtThis is an old thread, but I thought I would mention, of your phone has root, you can view it directly on your phone using the root explorer app.  You don\'t even have to extract it to see.
