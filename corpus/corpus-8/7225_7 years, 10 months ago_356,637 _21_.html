I picked up the following demo off the web from https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/pthreads/But when I compile it on my machine (running Ubuntu Linux 9.04) I get the following error:This doesn\'t make any sense to me, because the header includes pthread.h, which should have the pthread_create function. Any ideas what\'s going wrong?Both answers to this question so far are incorrect.\nFor Linux the correct command is:In general, libraries should follow sources and objects on command line, and -lpthread is not an "option", it\'s a library specification. On a system with only libpthread.a installed, will fail to link.For Linux use:-pthread tells the compiler to link in the pthread library as well as configure the compilation for threads.Using the -lpthread option only causes the pthread library to be linked - the pre-defined macros don\'t get defined.Bottom line: you should use the -pthread option.in eclipse properties->c/c++Build->setting->GCC C++ linker->libraries in top part add "pthread"Acutally, it gives several examples of compile commands used for pthreads codes are listed in the table below, if you continue reading the following tutorial:https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/pthreads/#CompilingYou need to use the option -lpthread with gcc.you need only Add "pthread"  in  proprieties=>C/C++ build=>GCC C++ Linker=>Libraries=> top part "Libraries(-l)".\nthats it Compile it like this : gcc demo.c -o demo -pthreadIn Anjuta, go to the Build menu, then Configure Project. \nIn the Configure Options box, add:Hope it\'ll help somebody too...Sometimes, if you use multiple library, check the library dependency.\n(e.g. -lpthread -lSDL... <==> ... -lSDL -lpthread)
