This question already has an answer here:I had issues finding a good solid tutorial on how to setup ADB for Mac. How can I add ADB to Mac OS X in such a way that it can be used in the terminal?Unlike Set up adb on Mac OS X, the intention of this question is to have a tutorial with all of the required installation steps to get ADB on OS X.This is the easiest way and will provide automatic updates.Install homebrewInstall adb Start using adbThis is the easiest way to get a manual installation of ADB and Fastboot. Delete your old installation (optional) Navigate to https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html and click on the SDK Platform-Tools for Mac link. Go to your Downloads folderUnzip the tools you downloadedMove them somewhere you won\'t accidentally delete themAdd platform-tools to your pathRefresh your bash profile (or restart your terminal app)Start using adbDelete your old installation (optional) Download the Mac SDK Tools from the Android developer site under "Get just the command line tools". Make sure you save them to your Downloads folder.Go to your Downloads folderUnzip the tools you downloadedMove them somewhere you won\'t accidentally delete themRun the SDK ManagerUncheck everything but Android SDK Platform-tools (optional)Add platform-tools to your pathRefresh your bash profile (or restart your terminal app)Start using adbIf you\'ve already installed Android Studio --Add the following lines to the end of ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc (if using Oh My ZSH):Restart Terminal and you\'re good to go. \xf0\x9f\x91\x8dAnaloguously to the two options (homebrew / manual) posted by @brismuth, here\'s the MacPorts way:Install the Android SDK:Run the SDK manager:As @brismuth suggested, uncheck everything but Android SDK Platform-tools (optional)Install the packages, accepting licenses. Close the SDK Manager.Add platform-tools to your path; in MacPorts, they\'re in /opt/local/share/java/android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools.  E.g., for bash:Refresh your bash profile (or restart your terminal/shell):Start using adb:Note that if you use Android Studio and download through its SDK Manager, the SDK is downloaded to ~/Library/Android/sdk by default, not ~/.android-sdk-macosx.I would rather add this as a comment to @brismuth\'s excellent answer, but it seems I don\'t have enough reputation points yet.You must download Android SDK from this link.You can really put it anywhere, but the best place at least for me was right in the YOUR USERNAME folder root.Then you need to set the path by copying the below text, BUT edit your username into the path, copy the text into TERMINAL by hitting COMMAND + SPACEBAR type TERMINAL. \nexport PATH = ${PATH}:/Users/**YOURUSERNAME**/android-sdk/platform-tools/Verify ADB works by hitting COMMAND + SPACEBAR and type TERMINAL, and type ADB. There you go. You have ADB setup on MAC OS X. It works on latest MAC OS X 10.10.3.
