I know how to make 2 divs float side by side, simply float one to the left and the other to the right. But how to do this with 3 divs or should I just use tables for this purpose?Just give them a width and float: left;, here\'s an example:The modern way is using the CSS3 flexbox.It is same way as you do for the two divs, just float the third one to left or right too.float them all leftmake sure a width is specified that they can all fit in their container (either another div or the window), otherwise they will wrapthat code that someone posted up there, it did the trick!!!\nwhen i paste it just before closing the Container DIV, it helps clear all subsequent DIVs from overlapping with the DIVs i\'ve created side-by-side at the top!tadaa!! :)Float all three divs to the left. Like here:I usually just float the first to the left, the second to the right. The third automatically aligns between them then.the advantage of this way is you can set each column width independant of the other as long as you keep it under 100%, if you use 3 x 30% the remaining 10% is split as a 5% divider space between the collumnsyou can float: left for all of them and set the width to 33.333%try to add "display: block" to the styleI prefer this method, floats are poorly supported in older versions of IE (really?...)UPDATED :\nOf course, to use this technique and due to the absolute positioning you need to enclose the divs on a container and do a postprocessing to define the height of if, something like this: Not the most amazing thing in the world, but at least doesn\'t break on older IEs. Float each div and set clear;both for the row. No need to set widths if you dont want to. Works in Chrome 41,Firefox 37, IE 11Click for JS FiddleHere\'s how I managed to do something similar to this inside a <footer> element:CSS:@Leniel this method is good but you need to add width to all the floating div\'s. I would say make them equal width or assign fixed width. Something likeyou may assign class names to each div rather than adding inline style, which is not a good practice.Be sure to use a clearfix div or clear div to avoid following content remains below these div\'s. You can find details of how to use clearfix div hereI didn\'t see the bootstrap answer, so for what\'s it\'s worth:let Bootstrap figure out the percentages.\nI like to clear both, just in case.
