So my application is very basic but I\'m new, new to the Xcode platform. The application basically calculates acceleration by inputting Initial and final velocity and time and then use a formula to calculate acceleration. However, since the values in the text boxes are string, I am unable to convert them to integers.Basic Idea, note that this only works in Swift 1.x (check out ParaSara\'s answer to see how it works in Swift 2.x):Update Answer for swift 2.0 : toInt() method is given a error. Because,In Swift 2.x, the .toInt() function was removed from String. In replacement, Int now has an initializer that accepts a String:myString.toInt() -  convert the string value into int .Swift 3.x If you have an integer hiding inside a string, you can convertby using the integer\'s constructor, like this:As with other data types (Float and Double) you can also convert by using NSString:Xcode 8.3.2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Swift 3.1Required extensions, structs and initializers:You wanna use NSNumberFormatter().numberFromString(yourNumberString). It\'s great because it returns an an optional that you can then test with an "if let" to determine if the conversion was successful. \neg. //Xcode 8.1 and swift 3.0We can also handle it by Optional Binding, SimplySwift 3The simplest and more secure way is:Avoid invalid values setting keyboard type to number pad:i have made a simple program, where you have 2 txt field you take input form the user and add them to make it simpler to understand please find the code below. hope this helps.About int() and Swift 2.x: if you get a nil value after conversion check if you try to convert a string with a big number (for example: 1073741824), in this case try:Swift 3.0Use this Function:Usage: let myNumber = getNumber(number: myString)if the myString has a number it returns the number else it returns 0Use this:ORMake your UITextField KeyboardType as DecimalTab from your XIB or storyboard, and remove any if condition for doing any calculation, ie.Because keyboard type is DecimalPad there is no chance to enter other 0-9 or .Hope this help !!This works for me   Latest swift3 this code is simply to convert string to intfor Alternative solution. You can use extension a native type. You can test with playground. "2".add(1)My solution is to have a general extension for string to int conversion.for Swift3.x
