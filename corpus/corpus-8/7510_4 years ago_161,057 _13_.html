I received this error upon upgrading from AngularJS 1.0.7 to 1.2.0rc1. The ngRoute module is no longer part of the core angular.js file. If you are continuing to use $routeProvider then you will now need to include angular-route.js in your HTML:API ReferenceYou also have to add ngRoute as a dependency for your application:If instead you are planning on using angular-ui-router or the like then just remove the $routeProvider  dependency from your module .config() and substitute it with the relevant provider of choice (e.g. $stateProvider). You would then use the ui.router dependency:adding to scotty\'s answer:Option 1:\nEither include this in your JS file: Option 2:\nor just use the URL to download \'angular-route.min.js\' to your local.and then (whatever option you choose) add this \'ngRoute\' as dependency.explained:\nvar app = angular.module(\'myapp\', [\'ngRoute\']);Cheers!!!In my case it was because the file was minified with wrong scope. Use Array!Coffee syntax:
