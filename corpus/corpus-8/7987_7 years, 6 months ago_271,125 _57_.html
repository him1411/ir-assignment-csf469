How do I determine the exact browser and version using JavaScript?As the name implies, this will tell you the  name and version number supplied by the browser.It is handy for sorting test and error results, when you are testing new code on multiple browsers.I recommend using the tiny javascript library Bowser, yes no r. It is based on the navigator.userAgent and quite well tested for all browsers including iphone, android etc.https://github.com/ded/bowserYou can use simply say: This is something I wrote to get client infoHere\'s how to detect browsers in 2016, including Microsoft Edge, Safari 10 and detection of Blink:The beauty of this approach is that it relies on browser engine properties, so it covers even derivative browsers, such as Yandex or Vivaldi, which are practically compatible with the major browsers whose engines they use. The exception is Opera, which relies on user agent sniffing, but today (i.e. ver. 15 and up) even Opera is itself only a shell for Blink.It is usually best to avoid browser-specific code where possible. The JQuery $.support property is available for detection of support for particular features rather than relying on browser name and version.In Opera for example, you can fake an internet explorer or firefox instance.A detailed description of JQuery.support can be found here: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.support/Now deprecated according to jQuery.We strongly recommend the use of an external library such as Modernizr\n  instead of dependency on properties in jQuery.support.When coding websites, I always make sure, that basic functionality like navigation is also accessible to non-js users. This may be object to discussion and can be ignored if the homepage is targeted to a special audience.This tells you all the details about your browser and the version of it.    All the information about web browser is contained in navigator object. The name and version are there.Source: javascript browser detectionSince Internet Explorer 11 (IE11+) came out and is not using the tag name of MSIE anymore I came up with a variance of an older detection function:Sadly, IE11 no longer has MSIE in its navigator.userAgent: As to why you want to know which browser you\'re using, it\'s because every browser has its own set of bugs, and you end up implementing browser and version specific workarounds, or tell the user to use a different browser!Note, however, that both will not necessarily reflect the truth. Many browsers can be set to mask as other browsers. So, for example, you can\'t always be sure if a user is actually surfing with IE6 or with Opera that pretends to be IE6.This little library may help you. But be aware that browser detection is not always the solution.Here is how I do custom CSS for Internet Explorer:In my JavaScript file:And then in my CSS file, y define each different style:If you want a function that returns the browser as well as the version, here is an improvement from the original answer:With this, it also stores the result locally, so this check is not necessary to run every time.You could use the jQuery library to detect the browser version.Example:jQuery.browser.versionHowever, this only makes sense if you are also using other functions of jQuery. Adding an entire library just to detect the browser seems like overkill to me.More information:\nhttp://api.jquery.com/jQuery.browser/(you have to scroll down a bit)you can more read\nHow to detect Safari, Chrome, IE, Firefox and Opera browser?Instead of hardcoding web browsers, you can scan the user agent to find the browser name:I\'ve tested this on Safari, Chrome, and Firefox. Let me know if you found this doesn\'t work on a browser.You can even modify this to get the browser version if you want. Do note there are better ways to get the browser versionSample output:I know I\'m WAY late to this question, but figured I\'d throw my snippets up here. A lot of the answers here are OK, and, as one points out, it\'s generally best to use feature detection rather than rely on the userAgent string. However, if you are going to go that route, I\'ve written a complete snippet, as well as an alternate jQuery implementation to replace the depricated $.browser.My first snippet simply adds four properties to the navigator object: browser, version, mobile, & webkit.jsFiddleThis is what I\'m using:info properties:https://jsfiddle.net/oriadam/ncb4n882/Not exactly what you want, but close to it:The variables will contain the appropriate version or false if it is not available.I\'d appreciate it if someone using Chrome could find out if you can use window.chrome in a similar way to window.opera.Some times we need simple method to check if the browser is IE or not. This is how it could be:or simplified siva\'s method:MSIE v.11 check:other IE browsers contain MSIE string in their userAgent property and could be catched by it.I found something interesting and quicker way.\nIE supports navigator.systemLanguage which returns "en-US" where other browsers return undefined.I make this small function, hope it helps.
