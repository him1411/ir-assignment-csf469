How do you animate the change of background color of a view on Android? For example: I have a view with a red background color. The background color of the view changes to blue. How can I do a smooth transition between colors?If this can\'t be done with views, an alternative will be welcome.I ended up figuring out a (pretty good) solution for this problem!You can use a TransitionDrawable to accomplish this. For example, in an XML file in the drawable folder you could write something like:Then, in your XML for the actual View you would reference this TransitionDrawable in the android:background attribute.At this point you can initiate the transition in your code on-command by doing:Or run the transition in reverse by calling:See Roman\'s answer for another solution using the Property Animation API, which wasn\'t available at the time this answer was originally posted.You can use new Property Animation Api for color animation:For backward compatibility with Android 2.x use Nine Old Androids library from Jake Wharton. The getColor method was deprecated in Android M, so you have two choices:If you use the support library, you need to replace the getColor calls with:if you don\'t use the support library, you need to replace the getColor calls with:Depending on how your view gets its background color and how you get your target color there are several different ways to do this.The first two uses the Android Property Animation framework.Use a Object Animator if:The object animator works by calling view.setBackgroundColor which replaces the defined drawable unless is it an instance of a ColorDrawable, which it rarely is. This means that any extra background properties from a drawable like stroke or corners will be removed.Use a Value Animator if:Use a Transition drawable if:I have had some performance issues with Transition drawables that runs while I am opening a DrawerLayout that I haven\'t been able to solve, so if you encounter any unexpected stuttering you might have run into the same bug as I have. You will have to modify the Value Animator example if you want to use a StateLists drawable or a LayerLists drawable, otherwise it will crash on the final GradientDrawable background = (GradientDrawable) view.getBackground(); line.Object Animator:View definition:Create and use a ObjectAnimator like this.You can also load the animation definition from a xml using a AnimatorInflater like XMight does in Android objectAnimator animate backgroundColor of LayoutValue Animator:View definition:Drawable definition:Create and use a ValueAnimator like this:Transition drawable:View definition:Drawable definition:Use the TransitionDrawable like this:You can reverse the animations by calling .reverse() on the animation instance.There are some other ways to do animations but these three is probably the most common. I generally use a ValueAnimator.You can make an object animator. For example, I have a targetView and I want to change your background color:If you want color animation like this,this code will help you:Another easy way to achieve this is to perform a fade using AlphaAnimation.This is the method I use in a Base Activity to change background. I\'m using GradientDrawables generated in code, but could be adapted to suit.update: In case anyone runs in to same issue I found, for some reason on Android <4.3 using setCrossFadeEnabled(true) cause a undesirable white out effect so I had to switch to a solid colour for <4.3 using @Roman Minenok ValueAnimator method noted above. Here\'s a nice function that allows this:I\'ve found that the implementation used by ArgbEvaluator in the Android source code does best job in transitioning colors. When using HSV, depending on the two colors, the transition was jumping through too many hues for me. But this method\'s doesn\'t.If you are trying to simply animate, use ArgbEvaluator with ValueAnimator as suggested here:However, if you are like me and want to tie your transition with some user gesture or other value passed from an input, the ValueAnimator is not of much help (unless your are targeting for API 22 and above, in which case you can use the ValueAnimator.setCurrentFraction() method). When targeting below API 22, wrap the code found in ArgbEvaluator source code in your own method, as shown below:And use it however you wish.
