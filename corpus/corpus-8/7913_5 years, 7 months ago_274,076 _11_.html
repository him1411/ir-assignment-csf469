I use a JSON library called JSONObject (I don\'t mind switching if I need to). I know how to iterate over JSONArrays, but when I parse JSON data from Facebook I don\'t get an array, only a JSONObject, but I need to be able to access an item via its index, such as JSONObject[0] to get the first one, and I can\'t figure out how to do it.Maybe this will help:for my case i found iterating the names() works wellI will avoid iterator as they can add/remove object during iteration and also for clean code use a for loop. less line simple code.First put this somewhere:Or if you have access to Java8, just this:Then simply iterate over the object\'s keys and values:I made a small recursive function that goes through the entire json object and saves the key path and its value.With Java 8 and lambda, cleaner:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html#forEachRemaining-java.util.function.Consumer-
