I just can\'t seem to get localization to work. I have a class library. Now I want to create resx files in there, and return some values based on the thread culture. How can I do that?Run this code:It should print "Hello".Now, add a new resource file, named "strings.fr.resx" (note the "fr" part; this one will contain resources in French). Add a string resource with the same name as in strings.resx, but with the value in French (Name="Hello", Value="Salut"). Now, if you run the following code, it should print Salut:What happens is that the system will look for a resource for "fr-FR". It will not find one (since we specified "fr" in your file"). It will then fall back to checking for "fr", which it finds (and uses).The following code, will print "Hello":That is because it does not find any "en-US" resource, and also no "en" resource, so it will fall back to the default, which is the one that we added from the start.You can create files with more specific resources if needed (for instance strings.fr-FR.resx and strings.fr-CA.resx for French in France and Canada respectively). In each such file you will need to add the resources for those strings that differ from the resource that it would fall back to. So if a text is the same in France and Canada, you can put it in strings.fr.resx, while strings that are different in Canadian french could go into strings.fr-CA.resx.It\'s quite simple, actually. Create a new resource file, for example Strings.resx. Set Access Modifier to Public. Use the apprioriate file template, so Visual Studio will automatically generate an accessor class (the name will be Strings, in this case). This is your default language.Now, when you want to add, say, German localization, add a localized resx file. This will be typically Strings.de.resx in this case. If you want to add additional localization for, say, Austria, you\'ll additionally create a Strings.de-AT.resx.Now go create a string - let\'s say a string with the name HelloWorld. In your Strings.resx, add this string with the value "Hello, world!". In Strings.de.resx, add "Hallo, Welt!". And in Strings.de-AT.resx, add "Servus, Welt!". That\'s it so far.Now you have this generated Strings class, and it has a property with a getter HelloWorld. Getting this property will load "Servus, Welt!" when your locale is de-AT, "Hallo, Welt! when your locale is any other de locale (including de-DE and de-CH), and "Hello, World!" when your locale is anything else. If a string is missing in the localized version, the resource manager will automatically walk up the chain, from the most specialized to the invariant resource.You can use the ResourceManager class for more control about how exactly you are loading things. The generated Strings class uses it as well.In addition @Fredrik M\xc3\xb6rk\'s great answer on strings, to add localization to a form do the following:This MSDN article on Localizing Windows Forms gives some more info on it.Great answer by F.M\xc3\xb6rk. But if you want to update translation, or add new languages once the application is released, you\'re stuck, because you always have to recompile it to generate the resources.dll.Here is a solution to manually compile a resource dll. It uses the resgen.exe and al.exe tools (installed with the sdk).Say you have a Strings.fr.resx resource file, you can compile a resources dll with the following batch:Be sure to keep the original namespace in the file names (here "WpfRibbonApplication1")A fix and elaboration of @Fredrik M\xc3\xb6rk answer.Visual Studio auto-generates a respective Strings class, which is actually placed in Strings.Designer.cs. The class is in the same namespace that you would expect a newly created .cs file to be placed in.This code always prints Hello, because this is the default resource and no language-specific resources are available:Now add a new language-specific resource:The following code prints Salut:What resource is used depends on Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture. It is set depending on Windows UI language setting, or can be set manually like in this example. Learn more about this here.You can add country-specific resources like Strings.fr-FR.resx or Strings.fr-CA.resx.The string to be used is determined in this priority order:Note that language-specific resources generate satellite assemblies.Also learn how CurrentCulture differs from CurrentUICulture here.In addition to @Eric Bole-Feysot answer:Thanks to satellite assemblies, localization can be created based on .dll/.exe files. This way: There is a little known tool called LSACreator (free for non-commercial use or buy option) which allows you to create localization based on .dll/.exe files. In fact, internally (in language project\'s directory) it creates/manages localized versions of resx files and compiles an assembly in similar way as @Eric Bole-Feysot described.In my casein the AssemblyInfo.cs prevented things to work as usual.
