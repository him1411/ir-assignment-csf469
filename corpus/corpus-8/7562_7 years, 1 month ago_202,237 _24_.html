This question already has an answer here:How would I get just the filename without the extension and no path?The following gives me no extension, but I still have the path attached:Most UNIX-like operating systems have a basename executable for a very similar purpose (and dirname for the path):That unfortunately just gives you the file name, including the extension, so you\'d need to find a way to strip that off as well.So, given you have to do that anyway, you may as well find a method that can strip off the path and the extension.One way to do that (and this is a bash-only solution, needing no other executables):That little snippet sets xpath (the file path), xpref (the file prefix, what you were specifically asking for) and xfext (the file extension).Here is an easy way to get the file name from a path:To remove the extension you can use, assuming the file name has only ONE dot (the extension dot):basename and dirname solutions are more convenient. Those are alternative commands:This returns test.old.img like basename.This is salt filename without extension:It returns test.old.And following statement gives the full path like dirname command.It returns /opt/datastores/sda2Some more alternative options because regexes (regi ?) are awesome!Here is a Simple regex to do the job:Example (grep):Example (awk):If you need a more complicated regex:\nFor example your path is wrapped in a string.Total solution with Regexes:This function can give you the  filename with or without extension of a linux filepath even if the filename has multiple "."s in it.\nIt can also handle spaces in the filepath and if the file path is embedded or wrapped in a string.If you have to mess with a windows path you can start with this one:
