I want the user to select a directory where a file that I will then generate will be saved. I know that in WPF I should use the OpenFileDialog from Win32, but unfortunately the dialog requires file(s) to be selected - it stays open if I simply click OK without choosing one. I could "hack up" the functionality by letting the user pick a file and then strip the path to figure out which directory it belongs to but that\'s unintuitive at best. Has anyone seen this done before?You can use the built-in FolderBrowserDialog class for this. Don\'t mind that it\'s in the System.Windows.Forms namespace.If you want the window to be modal over some WPF window, see the question How to use a FolderBrowserDialog from a WPF application.EDIT: If you want something a bit more fancy than the plain, ugly Windows Forms FolderBrowserDialog, there are some alternatives that allow you to use the Vista dialog instead:The Windows API Code Pack-Shell:Note that this dialog is not available on operating systems older than Windows Vista, so be sure to check CommonFileDialog.IsPlatformSupported first.I created a UserControl which is used like this:The xaml source looks like this:and the code-behindI\'m using Ookii dialogs for a while and it work nice for WPF.Here\'s the direct page:http://www.ookii.org/Blog/new_download_ookiidialogsFor Directory Dialog to get the Directory Path, First Add reference System.Windows.Forms, and then Resolve, and then put this code in a button click.(folderpathTB is name of TextBox where I wana put the folder path, OR u can assign it to a string variable too i.e.)And if you wana get FileName/path, Simply do this on Button Click(folderpathTB is name of TextBox where I wana put the file path, OR u can assign it to a string variable too)Note: For Folder Dialog, the System.Windows.Forms.dll must be added to the project, otherwise it wouldn\'t work.The best way to achieve what you want is to create your own wpf based control , or use a one that was made by other people\nwhy ? because there will be a noticeable performance impact when using the winforms dialog in a wpf application (for some reason)\ni recommend this project\n https://opendialog.codeplex.com/\n  or Nuget :  it\'s very MVVM friendly and it isn\'t wraping the winforms dialogI found the below code on below link... and it worked\nSelect folder dialog WPFOokii folder dialog can be found at Nuget.PM> Install-Package Ookii.DialogsAnd, example code is as below.If you only want the Folder Browser from Ooki Dialogs and nothing else then download the Source, cherry-pick the files you need for the Folder browser (hint: 7 files) and it builds fine in .NET 4.5.2. I had to add a reference to System.Drawing. Compare the references in the original project to yours.How do you figure out which files? Open your app and Ookii in different Visual Studio instances. Add VistaFolderBrowserDialog.cs to your app and keep adding files until the build errors go away. You find the dependencies in the Ookii project - Control-Click the one you want to follow back to its source (pun intended).Here are the files you need if you\'re too lazy to do that ...Edit line 197 in VistaFolderBrowserDialog.cs unless you want to include their Resources.Resxthrow new InvalidOperationException(Properties.Resources.FolderBrowserDialogNoRootFolder);Add their copyright notice to your app as per their license.txtThe code in \\Ookii.Dialogs.Wpf.Sample\\MainWindow.xaml.cs line 160-169 is an example you can use but you will need to remove this, from MessageBox.Show(this, for WPF.Works on My Machine [TM]I\'d suggest, to add in the nugget package:Then the way to used it is:Here\'s the documentation:\nhttp://opendialog.codeplex.com/documentationWorks for Files, files with filter, folders, etcI know this is an old question, but a simple way to do this is use the FileDialog option provided by WPF and using System.IO.Path.GetDirectory(filename).None of these answers worked for me (generally there was a missing reference or something along those lines)But this quite simply did:Using FolderBrowserDialog in WPF applicationAdd a reference to System.Windows.Forms and use this code:No need to track down missing packages. Or add enormous classesThis gives me a modern folder selector that also allows you to create a new folderI\'m yet to see the impact when deployed to other machines
