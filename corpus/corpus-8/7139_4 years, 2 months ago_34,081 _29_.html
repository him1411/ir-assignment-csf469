In Visual Studio 2013, Microsoft again presents the menu in UPPERCASE as the default. Can these be modified to be Sentence Case?Yes - in the new Visual Studio 2013 (as in VS 2012), MS reinforced their design decision to make ALL CAPS MENU ITEMS the default. The methods for reverting the menu style are almost the same methods used for Visual Studio 2012, which has been discussed before.\nAs of Visual Studio 2013 Update 4 you can go into Tools > Options > Environment\n and uncheck Turn off upper case in the menu bar \nYou need to create a specific registry key if you want "old-style" menus back. \nSet-ItemProperty -Path HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\12.0\\General -Name SuppressUppercaseConversion -Type DWord -Value 1\n(as a single line).\nREG ADD HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\12.0\\General /v SuppressUppercaseConversion /t REG_DWORD /d 1\n(as a single line).\nthen, create (right click):with the content ofand set it toClose regedit.exe and you\'re done.Fourth Variant: At least one VS Extension (VSCommands for Visual Studio 2013) has been published that enables you (among other things) to switch menu style via config menu from within VS 2013.You may also set it to all-lower-case items (which is, imho, nice):\nswitch to Sentence Case (subtly different from what you get with SuppressUppercaseConversion: the SQL menu gets renamed to Sql)\nor hide it completely (and have it appear on ALT key press or mouse over)\nAfter years Microsoft has changed their mind on this feature. As of Visual Studio 2013 Update 3 RC, an option has been added in Tools -> Options to change to Mixed Case for Menu titles. Obviously this is not for VS 2012 but going forward this option will be there.Here is the notification from Brian Harry of Microsoft....Mixed Case Menus \xe2\x80\x93 I know I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get some feedback on this one :) This is a long standing request by a vocal portion of the VS user base since VS 2012 to change the \xe2\x80\x9cALL CAPS\xe2\x80\x9d menus. In VS 2013 Update 3, we have added a Tools \xe2\x80\x93> Options setting to control whether you see ALL CAPS or Mixed Case. The default is still ALL CAPS but, if you change it, it will persist across upgrades and will roam across your IDE instances using the VS Online roaming settings feature (if you log into VS so it knows who you are). http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2014/07/02/vs-tfs-2013-3-update-3-rc.aspxI have been using the following reg files to enable/disable the lowercasing in Visual Studio 2013:http://erwinmayer.com/dl/VS2013_ALLCAPS_Toggle.zipJust double click on VS2013_ALLCAPS_Disable.reg inside the archive to disable all caps menu titles, and VS2013_ALLCAPS_Enable.reg to re-enable them.You can easily edit the reg files before with a text editor to see what they contain.If you\'re using the "Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop" version the registry key should be added in:So simple! You can go to Tools -> Options -> Environment -> General tab and check the Turn off uppercase checkbox from the right side and click ok. Visual studio 2013 will automatically turn off uppercasing of the menubar.VS 2013:\nTools→Extensions and Updates→Online,\nType "VSCommands" in search textbox,\nClick DownloadTools→Options→VSCommands→General,\nClick Open-Configuration buttonIDEEnhancements→Main Menu→Change Main Menu Letter Case,\nclick Sentence-Case
