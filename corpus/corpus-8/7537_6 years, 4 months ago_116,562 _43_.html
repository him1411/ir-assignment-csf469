I have deleted some files and git status shows as below.I have committed and pushed. GitHub still shows the deleted files in the repository. How can I delete files in the GitHub repository?If I use git rm, it gives the following.updates all your changes Be very cautious about git rm .; it might remove more than you want.  Of course, you can recover, but it is simpler not to have to do so.Simplest would be:You can\'t use shell wildcards because the files don\'t exist, but you could use (in Bash at least):Or consider:This takes the output of git status, doesn\'t print anything by default (sed -n), but on lines that start # deleted:, it gets rid of the # and the deleted: and prints what is left; xargs gathers up the arguments and provides them to a git rm command.  This works for any number of files regardless of similarity (or dissimilarity) in the names.Another version to ByScripts answer is This will ONLY remove the deleted files from the git.It could be also be used for adding ONLY modified files also.These commands also works on gitbash for windows.Update all changes you made:The deleted files should change from unstaged (usually red color) to staged (green).\nThen commit to remove the deleted files:The best solution if you don\'t care about staging modified files is to use git add -u as said by mshameers and/or pb2q.If you just want to remove deleted files, but not stage any modified ones, I think you should use the ls-files argument with the --deleted option (no need to use regex or other complex args/options) :Yes, git rm <filename> will stage the deleted state of a file, where <filename> could be a glob pattern:Then, you can commit.git commit -a will do this in one go, if you want.You can also use git add -u to stage all the changes, including all the deleted files, then commit.When I have a lot of files I\'ve deleted that are unstaged for commit, you can git rm them all in one show with:As question answerer mentioned, be careful with git rm.You can use After you had delete files manually.You can create a shell script which will remove all your files when run:The script that is created is remove.sh and it contains the full list of git rm commands.Try this:If you want to delete all of them by using "git rm". This is what I do:This query list of all files that have been removed and delete them from your git repository.\nHope it helps.   The built in clean function can also be helpful...Here is how to detect deleted files and stage their deletion as part of the next commit. All the solutions on this thread have different merits. This solution bellow specifically deals with the problem of file names with spaces in them.make sure you test this with git\'s --dry-run option before running it with the following:explanation:This prints out something like\nD "/path to a folder/path to a file"\nwhich happens only when there are spaces in the path namesmatch only lines that start with " D "remove " D " from the front of each stringremove quotes, if anydefine file name variables as {}\nrun file name under git rm enclosed in single quotes in order to make sure that it supports file names with spaces.I had this issue of ghost files appearing in my repo after I deleted them and came across this neat command!git add -AIt\'s essentially the same as git add -a and git add -u combined, but it\'s case sensitive.
