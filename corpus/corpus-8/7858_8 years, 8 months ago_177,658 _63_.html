I\'m trying to add a row to a table and have that row slide into view, however the slidedown function seems to be adding a display:block style to the table row which messes up the layout.Any ideas how to work around this?Here\'s the code:Animations are not supported on table rows.From "Learning jQuery" by Chaffer and SwedbergTable rows present particular\n  obstacles to animation, since browsers\n  use different values (table-row and\n  block) for their visible display\n  property.  The .hide() and .show()\n  methods, without animation, are always\n  safe to use with table rows.  As of\n  jQuery version 1.1.3, .fadeIn() and\n  .fadeOut() can be used as well.You can wrap your td contents in a div and use the slideDown on that. You need to decide if the animation is worth the extra markup.I simply wrap the tr dynamically then remove it once the slideUp/slideDown has complete. It\'s a pretty small overhead adding and removing one or a couple of  tags and then removing them once the animation is complete, I don\'t see any visible lag at all doing it.SlideUp:SlideDown:I have to pay tribute to fletchzone.com as I took his plugin and stripped it back to the above, cheers mate. Here\'s a plug-in that I wrote up for this, it takes a little from Fletch\'s implementation, but mine is used solely to slide a row up or down (no inserting rows).Basic Usage:Pass slide options as individual arguments:Basically, for the slide down animation, the plug-in wraps the contents of the cells in DIVs, animates those, then removes them, and vice versa for the slide up (with some extra steps to get rid of the cell padding). It also returns the object you called it on, so you can chain methods like so:Hope this helps someone.You could try wrapping the contents of the row in a <span> and having your selector be $(\'#detailed_edit_row span\'); - a bit hackish, but I just tested it and it works. I also tried the table-row suggestion above and it didn\'t seem to work.update: I\'ve been playing around with this problem, and from all indications jQuery needs the object it performs slideDown on to be a block element. So, no dice. I was able to conjure up a table where I used slideDown on a cell and it didn\'t affect the layout at all, so I am not sure how yours is set up. I think your only solution is to refactor the table in such a way that it\'s ok with that cell being a block, or just .show(); the damn thing. Good luck.I\'m a bit behind the times on answering this, but I found a way to do it :)I just put a div element inside the table data tags. when it is set visible, as the div expands, the whole row comes down.\nthen tell it to fade back up (then timeout so you see the effect) before hiding the table row again :)Hope this helps someone!Select the contents of the row like this:.contents() - \nGet the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text and comment nodes.Im a newbie to this community. Pl rate my answer. :)You can find this one works fine.Im having a table(<table style=\'display: none;\'></table>) inside the <tr class=\'dummyRow\' style=\'display: none;\'><td></td></tr> content.To slide down the row..Note: row and the content inside row (here it is table) both should be hidden before animation starts.To slide up the row..second parameter(function) is a callback.Simple!!I\'ve gotten around this by using the td elements in the row:Animating the row itself causes strange behaviour, mostly async animation problems.For the above code, I am highlighting a row that gets dragged and dropped around in the table to highlight that the update has succeeded. Hope this helps someone.I want to slide whole tbody and I\'ve managed this problem by combining fade and slide effects.I\'ve done this in 3 stages (2nd and 3rd steps are replaced in case you want to slide down or up)Example of slideUp:I had problems with all the other solutions offered but ended up doing this simple thing that is smooth as butter.Set up your HTML like so:Then set up your javascript like so:Basically, make the "invisible" row 0px high, with a div inside.\nUse the animation on the div (not the row) and then set the row height to 1px.To hide the row again, use the opposite animation on the div and set the row height back to 0px.I liked the plugin that Vinny\'s written and have been using. But in case of tables inside sliding row (tr/td), the rows of nested table are always hidden even after slid up. So I did a quick and simple hack in the plugin not to hide the rows of nested table. Just change the following linetowhich finds only immediate tds not nested ones. Hope this helps someone using the plugin and have nested tables.If you need to slide and fade a table row at the same time, try using these:you can use these methods like:I can be done if you set the td\'s in the row to display none at the same time you start animating the height on the rowThis code works!http://jsfiddle.net/PvwfK/136/});The plug offered by Vinny is really close, but I found and fixed a couple of small issues.For table cells with lots of content (like a nested table with lots of rows), calling slideRow(\'up\'), regardless of the slideSpeed value provided, it\'d collapse the view of the row as soon as the padding animation was done. I fixed it so the padding animation doesn\'t trigger until the slideUp() method on the wrapping  is done.I\'d like to add a comment to #Vinny\'s post but dont have the rep so have to post an answer...Found a bug with your plugin - when you just pass an object in with arguments they get overwritten if no other arguments are passed in. Easily resolved by changing the order the arguments are processed, code below.\nI\'ve also added an option for destroying the row after closing (only as I had a need for it!): $(\'#row_id\').slideRow(\'up\', true); // destroys the rowI did use the ideas provided here and faced some problems. I fixed them all and have a smooth one-liner I\'d like to share.It uses css on the td element. It reduces the height to 0px. That way only the height of the content of the newly created div-wrapper inside of each td element matters.The slideUp is on slow. If you make it even slower you might realize some glitch. A small jump at the beginning. This is because of the mentioned css setting. But without those settings the row would not decrease in height. Only its content would.At the end the tr element gets removed.The whole line only contains JQuery and no native Javascript.Hope it helps.
