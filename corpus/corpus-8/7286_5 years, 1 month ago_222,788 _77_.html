I have PyCharm and I am looking around trying to find git.exe to set it up with my repo. What is the PATH to git.exe?If you\'re using GitHub for Windows, git.exe may not be in your PATH, but you may find it in a location like: C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\GitHub\\PortableGit_<numbersandletters>\\bin\\git.exeThat\'s the situation for me, in Windows 7 + version 1.0 of GitHub for Windows.In Windows 10 and the latest version of GitHub for Windows it appears to be inC:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\GitHub\\PortableGit_<numbersandletters>\\cmd\\git.exe( \\cmd versus \\bin)PS: AppData is a hidden folder by default.If git.exe is indeed in your %PATH% (that is, if you can type a git --version in a DOS windows), then which git.exe will tell you where.\n(provided you did install GoW: Gnu on Windows: 130 unix commands compiled for windows, including which).Jonny Leeds comments below that you also can use where git.exe\n(except with Powershell, for you need to use where.exe git.exe, instead of the PowerShell command where)If not, don\'t forget you can install git wherever you want, with the portable version of msysgit. It is just an archive you unzip in any directory of your choice.Update 2015: use the portable version of "git-for-windows", like:PortableGit-2.4.4.2-3rd-release-candidate-64-bit.7z.exeThen add to %PATH%:You will not only get git.exe, but also 200+ executable for Unix commands! No more GnuOnWindows to install.\nSee more at "Why is it that if you download Git 2.0 from the net, you always get a 1.9.4 installer package?".Note: for GitHub for Windows, to complete S. Kirby\'s answer (upvoted), you can look into:More recently (2017), from Luke McGregor\'s answer, for the new GitHub Desktop:This works for the latest portable git installed, whatever its actual name is, using the 8.3 naming convention.If you use SourceTree, one instance can be found here:You can also install quickly via chocolatey. choco install git which will then make it available on your path without any further work on your part.Just to add to a couple of answers already here:On Windows, you can use the built in "where" instead of "which" (which is for Linux). So, where git will tell you the location of git assuming that it is in the system path.If it is not in the system path, and you want a native (no downloads or installations), reasonable time command to find it, use dir /s git.exeHere are step by step instructions for you to find out: There you go!You can do this with any application, not just GitHub.type in the command line:If you can use the git command it should be in your path?\nthus this should work asuming linux or linux like oselse also asuming linux like osif on windows tell me what version and ill help you default path on windows is\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git for msysgit not sure if the exeutable is named git.exe though.It seems like git.exe can be found in different places depending on how it was installed, the version, and version of Windows.I installed Git-2.6.3-64-bit.exe (cleand install; just git, not the Github Desktop client) on Windows 10 Pro N.\nThis is the default location:%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Git\\mingw64\\bin\\git.exeand%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Git\\binWell I just searched for git.exe on my Windows.\nMany files returned with names like git-something.exe and git-somethingElse.exe.\nOut of those I could find a file with the exact name git.exe.\nI opened the file and could see cmd with various git commands, which made me decide that it\'s the correct one.\nPasted the file\'s path (below) to PyCharm and it worked.PS: I installed Git and GitHub through Windows the GitHub\'s Client Installation.C:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Local\\GitHub\\PortableGit_\\cmd\\git.exe is where my git.exe is located on Windows 10, Git version 2.10.0.0In Windows 7 on GitHub 2.5.3.0 I found it in C:\\Users(user)\\AppData\\Local\\GitHub\\PortableGit_(numbers)\\mingw32\\bin\\git.exethanks to dir /s git.exeAppears to have moved again in the latest version of GH for windows to:Given it now has the version in the folder structure i think it will move every time it auto-updates. This makes it impossible to put into path. I think the best option is to install git separately.If you have msysgit installed, the path would look like c:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\bin\\git.exe on a 64-bit system, otherwise just download and install it, PyCharm doesn\'t come with Git client.First ,you should install github in your PC;\nSecond,you can download the tool \'Everything\';\nThird,open the tool everything ,type git.exe,then you will find the location and copy the location to PyCharm ,and Test,you will see successfully!On windows if you have git installed through cygwin (open up cygwin and type git --version to check) then the path will most likely be something like C:\\cygwin64\\bin\\git.exeIf you\'ve got the PowerShell-based git installation, you can use the Get-Command object to find git:I am working on OSX, and saw this issue. I found xcode disabled git, causing me to agree to the T&Cs again. I fixed by:If you are using Git For Windows then it is located at It is nice to have in mind that Git For Windows offers Git CMD, a command prompt with the PATH already set. Git CMD is available as a shortcut in among other options.Usinggit.exe location:C:\\Users\\<.username>\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Git\\cmd\\git.exeSuggestion: while Installing, copy the git pathOn Windows 10:I installed git from - https://git-for-windows.github.io/.After installation i found it at C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\git.exeI\'m very surprised to see that no one mentioned using the --exec-path switch.git --exec-pathC:\\Program Files\\Git\\mingw64/libexec/git-coreI hope this helps someone.In windows 8 I found its path as below:C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\bin\\git.exeI found it atI have downloaded stub from https://desktop.github.com\nAfter installation of the git from the stub, git.exe is stored in the following location.C:\\Users\\**User Name**\\AppData\\Local\\GitHub\\PortableGit_****Some No/characters***\\cmd\\git.exeIn Windows 10 64 bit, I feel the exe file is now stored in cmd folder rather than bin folder.If you\'ve downloaded the latest version try looking in the CMD folder. git.exe should be in there and should work. You may have to input it\'s path manually with File>Settings>Version Control>GitI am using Windows 10, Pycharm 2016.1.2 and here is the path that i found Github.exe at:   (please note that the bold part is variable and you should replace it with applicable values...)C:\\Users**Salman**\\AppData\\Local\\GitHub\\PortableGit_c2ba306e536fdf878271f7fe636a147ff37326ad\\bin\\git.exeLocating and setting Git PathThe location for git.exe will vary depending on what Git-software you have installed! The git.exe file is located inside your Git-software installation directory, usually inside a folder called bin.\nSome examples of standard locations:\nSoftware    Standard location\nGit         C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\bin\nSmartGit    C:\\Program Files (x86)\\SmartGit\\git\\bin\\git.exe\nGitHub For Windows  C:\\Users\\\'username\'\\AppData\\Local\\GitHub\\PortableGit_\'numbersandletters\'\\cmd\\git.exe-Path Setting for GitSet the git.exe path in the PATH environment variableRight-click My Computer on your desktop or start-menu, and select Properties.\nClick the Advanced system settings tab.\nClick the Environment Variables button.\nUnder System Variables, click PATH (can also be called Path) and click Edit.\nPaste the location to your git.exe* and ok.For Windows 10 C:\\Users\\Paul\\AppData\\Local\\GitHub\\PortableGit_624c8416ee51e205b3f892d1d904e06e6f3c57c8\\mingw32\\bin\\git.exe
