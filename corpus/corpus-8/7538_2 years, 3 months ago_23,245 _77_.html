How do I create a shape like this to display on a webpage?  I don\'t want to use images since they would get blurry on scaling  I tried with CSS:That turned out really screwed.And then I tried with SVG:It did get the shape, but the bottom part wasn\'t curved.Is there a way to create this shape so it can be used in an HTML page?You can achieve the double curve easily with an inline SVG and the <path/> element instead of the <polygon/> element which doesn\'t allow curved shapes.The following example uses the <path/> element with:SVG is a great tool to make this kind of shapes with double curves. You can check this post about double curves with an SVG/CSS comparison. Some of the advantages of using SVG in this case are:Browser support for inline SVG goes back to Internet Explorer 9. See canIuse for more information.You can do this within CSS relatively easily using border-radius\' and transforms. Your CSS was just a little bit out.This will be very similar to above but gives it a bit more shape.Your main issue with your CSS code was: So, by \'fixing\' these issues, you would generate:Please also note to save on CSS length, you could re-write your border-radius properties to:this could be enhanced with pseudo elements as shown in this fiddleI found this by Vinay Challuru on codepen.Please note that with the logic here, I was able to create the SVG to nearly any possible build shape/etc. For example, a quick output was:It\'s using an SVG and allows you to alter the shape in multiple ways, having the ability to alter its shape to the desired result:Disclaimer I did not write the above pen, only sourced it.Although this is far from complete, you may also be able to generate this shape using CSS.I should know that SVG should be at the top of this answer, however, I like a challenge and so here is an attempt with SVG.Altering the path values, you would be able to alter the shape of your teardrop design. IMO this shape requires smooth curve-to beziers to ensure continuity of the curve.For the drop in question, \nNote: Red and blue curves are two different quadratic curves.stroke-linejoin="miter", for the pointed top part.AS this shape only uses successive c commands, we can omit it.Here\'s the final snippet:TBH though, accepted answer\'s curves are not quite continuous.Only works in IE 5-8. VML uses different commands than SVG. Eg. it uses v for relative cubic beziers.Note: This snippet won\'t run in IE 5-8 too. You need to create an html file and run it directly in the browser.Or if your viewers\' font supports it, use the Unicode charactersorScale accordingly!I\'d personally use an SVG for this. You can create SVGs in most vector graphics software. I\'d recommend:I have made one below that is a tracing of your shape in Illustrator.This is an option uncovered in this thread so far. The commands used for Canvas drawings are very similar to SVG (and web-tiki deserves the credits for the base idea used in this answer). The shape in question can be created either using canvas\' own curve commands (Quadratic or Bezier) or the Path API. The answer contains examples for all three methods.The browser support for Canvas is quite good.Below is an advanced version with gradient fill and shadows. I have also included a hover effect on the shape to illustrate one drawback of Canvas when compared to SVG. Canvas is raster (pixel) based and hence would look blurred/pixelated when scaled beyond a certain point. The only solution to that would be to repaint the shape on every browser resize which is an overhead.Note: As mentioned in my answere here, the Path API is not yet supported by IE and Safari.Further reading:I also found this on Codepen made by user Ana Tudor using CSS and the box-shadow style and parametric equations. Very simple, very little code. And many browsers support the CSS3 Box-shadow style:As there are a fair few answers here I thought why not add to it with another method. This is using both HTML and CSS to create the teardrop.This will allow you to change the colour of the border and background of the teardrop and also re-size the top part of it.Using a single div we can create a circle with border and border-radius. Then using pseudo elements (:before & :after) we create a CSS triangle more here, this will act as the tip of the teardrop. Using the :before as the border we place :after on top with a smaller size and the desired background colour.Here is a demo of the teardrop with a background colourIt is as simple as putting a background colour onto the div and changing :after bottom-border colour to the same. To change the border you will need to change div border colour and :before background colour too. It is quite easy to do this with SVG by just using an image conversion resource such as http://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-svg, which was used to create the following:If you do choose to use SVG you should read up on paths. I would also suggest an SVG editor.Here are four progressively simpler SVG teardrop shapes:
