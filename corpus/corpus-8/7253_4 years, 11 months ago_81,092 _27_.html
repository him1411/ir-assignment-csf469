Need help on GitHub usage. I wonder if there is a way to communicate with a github.com user i.e. write the user a message when only username/id is given on their GitHub page? Does GitHub have this social feature?Although GitHub removed the private messaging feature, there\'s still an alternative.GitHub host git repositories. If the user you\'re willing to communicate with has ever committed some code, there are good chances you may reach your goal. Indeed, within each commit is stored some information about the author of the change or the one who accepted it.Provided you\'re really dying to exchange with user user_testAs a committer/author, an email should be displayed along with the commit data.Note: Every warning related to unsolicited email should apply there. Do not spam.This method worked in August 2017Github said on April 3rd 2012 :Today we\'re removing two features. They\'ve been gathering dust for a while and it\'s time to throw them out : Fork Queue & Private MessagingSourceFor lazy people, like me, a snippet based on Nikhil\'s solutionBesides the removal of the github messaging service, usage was often not necessary due to many githubbers communicating with- and advocating twitter.The advantage is that there is:It is probably no coincidence that stackoverflow doesn\'t allow private messaging either, to ensure full transparency. The entire messaging issue is thoroughly discussed on meta-stackoverflow here.Here is another way:Browse someone\'s commit history (Click commits which is next to branch to see the whole commit history).Click the commit that with the person\'s username because there might be so many of them.Then you should see the web address has a hash concatenated to the URL.  Add .patch to this commit URL.You will probably see the person\'s email address there.Example: https://github.com/[username]/[reponame]/commit/[hash].patchworking fine this method: Browse someone\'s \'commit\' history (Click commits which is next to branch to see the whole commit history).Click the commit that with the person\'s \'username\' because there might be so many of them.Then you should see the web address has a \'hash\' concatenated to the URL.
