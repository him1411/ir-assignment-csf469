I haven\'t used regular expressions at all, so I\'m having difficulty troubleshooting. I want the regex to match only when the contained string is all numbers; but with the two examples below it is matching a string that contains all numbers plus an equals sign like "1234=4321". I\'m sure there\'s a way to change this behavior, but as I said, I\'ve never really done much with regular expressions.In case it matters, I\'m using C# and .NET2.0.Use the beginning and end anchors.Use "^\\d+$" if you need to match more than one digit.Note that "\\d" will match [0-9] and other digit characters like the Eastern Arabic numerals \xd9\xa0\xd9\xa1\xd9\xa2\xd9\xa3\xd9\xa4\xd9\xa5\xd9\xa6\xd9\xa7\xd9\xa8\xd9\xa9.  Use "^[0-9]+$" to restrict matches to just the Arabic numerals 0 - 9.If you need to include any numeric representations other than just digits (like decimal values for starters), then see @tchrist\'s comprehensive guide to parsing numbers with regular expressions.Your regex will match anything that contains a number, you want to use anchors to match the whole string and then match one or more numbers:The ^ will anchor the beginning of the string, the $ will anchor the end of the string, and the + will match one or more of what precedes it (a number in this case).if you need to tolerate decimal point and thousand marker...update: you will need "-", if the number can go negative.\nupdate: moved "-" to the beginning to avoid matching non-starting "-"It is matching because it is finding "a match" not a match of the full string. You can fix this by changing your regexp to specifically look for the beginning and end of the string.Perhaps my method will help you. ^\\d+$, which is "start of string", "1 or more digits", "end of string" in English.This works with integers and decimal numbers. It doesn\'t match if the number has the coma thousand separator , some strings that matches with this:some strings that doesn\'t:Sorry for ugly formatting.\nFor any number of digits:For one or more digit:Here is my working one:And some testsPositive tests:Negative tests:Checked not only for C#, but also with Java, Javascript and PHPIf you need to check if all the digits are number (0-9) or not,1425 TRUE0142 TRUE0 TRUE1 TRUE154a25 FALSE1234=3254 FALSEAnother way: If you like to match international numbers such as Persian or Arabic, so you can use following expression:To match literal period character use:use beginning and end anchors.While non of the above solutions was fitting my purpose, this worked for me.Example of valid values:\n"3",\n"-3",\n"0",\n"0.0",\n"1.0",\n"0.7",\n"690.7",\n"0.0001",\n"-555",\n"945465464654"Example of not valid values:\n"a",\n"",\n" ",\n".",\n"-",\n"001",\n"00.2",\n"000.5",\n".3",\n"3.",\n" -1",\n"--1",\n"-.1",\n"-0",\n"00099",\n"099"If you want to extract only numbers from a string the pattern "\\d+" should help.Regex for integer and floting point numbers:A number can start with a period (without leading digits(s)),\nand a number can end with a period (without trailing digits(s)).\nAbove regex will recognize both as correct numbers.\nA . (period) itself without any digits is not a correct number.\nThat\'s why we need two regex parts there (separated with a "|").Hope this helps.I think that this one is the simplest one and it accepts European and USA way of writing numbers e.g. USA 10,555.12  European 10.555,12\nAlso this one does not allow several commas or dots one after each other e.g. 10..22 or 10,.22\nIn addition to this numbers like .55 or ,55 would pass. This may be handy.Regex regex = new Regex ("^[0-9]{1,4}=[0-9]{1,4]$")
