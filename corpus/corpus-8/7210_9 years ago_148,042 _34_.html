What is the best way to get a log of commits on a branch since the time it was branched from the current branch? My solution so far is:The documentation for git-diff indicates that git diff A...B is equivalent to git diff $(git-merge-base A B) B. On the other hand, the documentation for git-rev-parse indicates that r1...r2 is defined as r1 r2 --not $(git merge-base --all r1 r2).Why are these different? Note that git diff HEAD...branch gives me the diffs I want, but the corresponding git log command gives me more than what I want.In pictures, suppose this:I would like to get a log containing commits x, y, z.In the context of a revision list, A...B is how git-rev-parse defines it. git-log takes a revision list. git-diff does not take a list of revisions - it takes one or two revisions, and has defined the A...B syntax to mean how it\'s defined in the git-diff manpage. If git-diff did not explicitly define A...B, then that syntax would be invalid. Note that the git-rev-parse manpage describes A...B in the "Specifying Ranges" section, and everything in that section is only valid in situations where a revision range is valid (i.e. when a revision list is desired).To get a log containing just x, y, and z, try git log HEAD..branch (two dots, not three). This is identical to git log branch --not HEAD, and means all commits on branch that aren\'t on HEAD.does exactly what you are asking, when you are in the master branch.I am also very fond of:Which isn\'t exactly what you\'re asking, but is still very useful in the same context.What you want to see is the list of outgoing commits. You can do this usingor Where I assume that "branchName" was created as a tracking branch of "master".Similarly, to see the incoming changes you can use:This is similar to the answer I posted on: Preview a Git pushDrop these functions into your Bash profile:You can use this like:This will work with any branch.Similar to several answers like Alex V\'s and NDavis, but none of them are quite the same.When already in the branch in questionUsing:Which combines several features:Update:This should probably be git diff master, but also this shows the diff, not the commits as the question specified.Throw a -p in there to see some FILE CHANGESMake some aliases:See a branch\'s unique commits:To see the log of the current branch since branching off master:git log master...If you are currently on master, to see the log of a different branch since it branched off master:git log ...other-branch(3dots) but sometimes it shows \'+\' instead of \'=\'I foundmore useful, since you don\'t only get the commit messages but the whole diff. If you are already on the branch you want to see the changes of and (for instance) want to see what has changed to the master, you can use:
