This question already has an answer here:I have a list l:For numbers above 45 inclusive, I would like to add 1; and for numbers less than it, 5.I triedBut it gives me a syntax error. How can I achieve an if â€“ else like this in a list comprehension?Do-something if <condition>, else do-something else.The reason you\'re getting this error has to do with how the list comprehension is performed.Keep in mind the following:Is equivalent to:Where the expression is in a slightly different format (think switching the subject and verb order in a sentence).Therefore, your code [x+1 for x in l if x >= 45] does this:However, this code [x+1 if x >= 45 else x+5 for x in l] does this (after rearranging the expression):And for a reward, here is the comment, I wrote to remember this the first time I did this error:Python\'s conditional expression is a if C else b and can\'t be used as:The right form is:Even though there is a valid form:But that isn\'t the same as that is how you filter by C, but they can be combined:You must put the expression at the beginning of the list comprehension, an if statement at the end filters elements!You can also put the conditional expression in brackets inside the list comprehension:[false,true][condition] is the syntaxYou could move the conditional to:But it\'s starting to look a little ugly, so you might be better off using a normal loop. Note that I used v instead of l for the list variable to reduce confusion with the number 1 (I think l and O should be avoided as variable names under any circumstances, even in quick-and-dirty example code).I just had a similar problem, and found this question and the answers really useful. Here\'s the part I was confused about. I\'m writing it explicitly because no one actually stated it simply in English:The iteration goes at the end. Normally, a loop goes Everyone states the list comprehension part simply as the first answer did, but that\'s actually not what you do in this case. (I was trying to do it that way)In this case, it\'s more like this:Like in [a if condition1 else b for i in list1 if condition2], the two ifs with condition1 and condition2 doing two different things. The part (a if condition1 else b) is from a lambda expression:while the other condition2 is another lambda:Whole list comprehension can be regard as combination of map and filter:
