I want to expand my programming horizons to Linux. A good, dependable basic toolset is important, and what is more basic than an IDE?I could find these SO topics:I\'m not looking for a lightweight IDE. If an IDE is worth the money, then I will pay for it, so it need not be free.My question, then:What good, C++ programming IDE is available for Linux?The minimums are fairly standard: syntax highlighting, code completion (like intellisense or its Eclipse counterpart) and integrated debugging (e.g., basic\nbreakpoints).I have searched for it myself, but there are so many that it is almost impossible to separate the good from the bads by hand, especially for someone like me who has little  C++ coding experience in Linux. I know that Eclipse supports C++, and I really like that IDE for Java, but is it any good for C++ and is there something better?The second post actually has some good suggestions, but what I am missing is what exactly makes the sugested IDE so good for the user, what are its (dis)advantages?Maybe my question should therefore be:What IDE do you propose (given your experiences), and why?When originally writing this answer, I had recently made the switch from Visual Studio (with years of experience) to Linux and the first thing I did was try to find a reasonable IDE. At the time this was impossible: no good IDE existed.And then I realised that the IDE in Linux is the command line with its tools:Depending on your needs, you will then have to install and configure several plugins to make the editor work nicely (that\xe2\x80\x99s the one annoying part). For example, most programmers on Vim will benefit from the YouCompleteMe plugin for smart autocompletion.Once that\xe2\x80\x99s done, the shell is your command interface to interact with the various tools \xe2\x80\x94 Debuggers (gdb), Profilers (gprof, valgrind), etc. You set up your project/build environment using Make, CMake, SnakeMake or any of the various alternatives. And you manage your code with a version control system (most people use Git). You also use tmux (previously also screen) to multiplex (= think multiple windows/tabs/panels) and persist your terminal session.The point is that, thanks to the shell and a few tool writing conventions, these all integrate with each other. And that way the Linux shell is a truly integrated development environment, completely on par with other modern IDEs. (This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that individual IDEs don\xe2\x80\x99t have features that the command line may be lacking, but the inverse is also true.)I cannot overstate how well the above workflow functions once you\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten into the habit. But some people simply prefer graphical editors, and in the years since this answer was originally written, Linux has gained a suite of excellent graphical IDEs for several different programming languages (but not, as far as I\xe2\x80\x99m aware, for C++). Do give them a try even if\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0like me\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0you end up not using them. Here\xe2\x80\x99s just a small and biased selection:Keep in mind that this list is far from complete.1 I stole that title from dsm\xe2\x80\x99s comment.2 I used to refer to Vim here. And while plain Vim is still more than capable, Neovim is a promising restart, and it\xe2\x80\x99s modernised a few old warts.My personal favorite is the CodeLite 2.x IDE.see: http://www.codelite.orgThe decision to use CodeLite was based on a research regarding the following C++ IDE for Linux:After all I have decided to use CodeLite 2.x.Below I have listed some Pros and Cons regarding the mentioned C++ IDEs. Please note, that this reflects my personal opinion only!EDIT: what a pity that SOF doesn\'t support tables, so I have to write in paragraphs ...Eclipse Galileo with CDT PluginPros:Cons:NetBeans 6.7 (note this is also the base for the SunStudio IDE)Pros:Cons:KDevelop4 (note: I did not much testing on it)Pros:Cons:CodeBlocks 8.02 (note: I did not much testing on it)Pros:Cons:CodeLite 2.x (note: this is my personal favorite)Pros:Cons:Soon you\'ll find that IDEs are not enough, and you\'ll have to learn the GCC toolchain anyway (which isn\'t hard, at least learning the basic functionality). But no harm in reducing the transitional pain with the IDEs, IMO.A quick answer, just to add a little more knowledge to this topic:\nYou must definitely check out NetBeans. Netbeans 6.7 has the following features:  I think it\'s a perfect (and far better) Visual Studio substitution, and a very good tool to learn C/C++.Good Luck!At least for Qt specific projects, the Qt Creator (from Nokia/Trolltech/Digia) shows great promise.could you clarify a little bit more how it was for you, what you had to change. Maybe you could point me in the right direction by providing some links to the information you used.My first source were actually the tools\' man pages. Just typeon the command line ($ here is part of the prompt, not the input).Depending on the platform, they\'re quite well-written and can also be found on the internet. In the case of make, I actually read the complete documentation which took a few hours. Actually, I don\'t think this is necessary or helpful in most cases but I had a few special requirements in my first assignments under Linux that required a sophisticated makefile. After writing the makefile I gave it to an experienced colleague who did some minor tweaks and corrections. After that, I pretty much knew make.I used GVIM because I had some (but not much) prior experience there, I can\'t say anything at all about Emacs or alternatives. I find it really helps to read other peoples\' .gvimrc config file. Many people put it on the web. Here\'s mine.Don\'t try to master all binutils at once, there are too many functions. But get a general overview so you\'ll know where to search when needing something in the future. You should, however, know all the important parameters for g++ and ld (the GCC linker tool that\'s invoked automatically except when explicitly prevented).Also I\'m curious, do you have code completion and syntax highlighting when you code?Syntax highlighting: yes, and a much better one than Visual Studio. Code completion: yes-ish. First, I have to admit that I didn\'t use C++ code completion even in Visual Studio because (compared to VB and C#) it wasn\'t good enough. I don\'t use it often now but nevertheless, GVIM has native code completion support for C++. Combined with the ctags library and a plug-in like taglist this is almost an IDE.Actually, what got me started was an article by Armin Ronacher. Before reading the text, look at the screenshots at the end of it!do you have to compile first before getting (syntax) errors?Yes. But this is the same for Visual Studio, isn\'t it (I\'ve never used Whole Tomato)? Of course, the syntax highlighting will show you non-matching brackets but that\'s about all.and how do you debug (again think breakpoints etc)?I use gdb which is a command-line tool. There\'s also a graphical frontend called DDD. gdb is a modern debugging tool and can do everything you can do in an IDE. The only thing that really annoys me is reading a stack trace because lines aren\'t indented or formatted so it\'s really hard to scan the information when you\'re using a lot of templates (which I do). But those also clutter the stack trace in IDEs.Like I said, I had the \'pleasure\' to set my first steps in the Java programming language using windows notepad and the command line java compiler in high school, and it was, .. wel a nightmare! certainly when I could compare it with other programming courses I had back then where we had decent IDE\'sYou shouldn\'t even try to compare a modern, full-feature editor like Emacs or GVIM to Notepad. Notepad is an embellished TextBox control, and this really makes all the difference. Additionally, working on the command line is a very different experience in Linux and Windows. The Windows cmd.exe is severely crippled. PowerShell is much better./EDIT: I should mention explicitly that GVIM has tabbed editing (as in tabbed browsing, not tabs-vs-spaces)! It took me ages to find them although they\'re not hidden at all. Just type :tabe instead of plain :e when opening a file or creating a new one, and GVIM will create a new tab. Switching between tabs can be done using the cursor or several different shortcuts (depending on the platform). The key gt (type g, then t in command mode) should work everywhere, and jumps to the next tab, or tab no. n if a number was given. Type :help gt to get more help.Not to repeat an answer, but I think I can add a bit more.Slickedit is an excellent IDE.It supports large code-bases well without slowing down or spending all its time indexing. (This is a problem I had with eclipse\'s cdt).  Slickedit\'s speed is probably the nicest thing about it, actually.\nThe code completion works well and there are a large amount of options for things like automatic formatting, beautification and refactoring.\nIt does have integrated debugging.\nIt has plug-in support and fairly active community creating them.\nIn theory, you should be able to integrate well with people doing the traditional makefile stuff, as it allows you to create a project directly from one, but that didn\'t work as smoothly as I would have liked when I tried it.\nIn addition to Linux, there are Mac and Windows versions of it, should you need them.As an old-time UNIX guy, I always use Emacs.  But that has a pretty steep and long learning curve, so I\'m not sure I can recommend it to newcomers.There really isn\'t a "good" IDE for Linux.  Eclipse is not very good for C/C++ (CDT is improving, but is not very useful yet).  The others are missing all the features you are going to be looking for.It really is important to learn how all the individual tools (gcc, make, gdb, etc.) work.  After you do so, you may find the Visual Studio way of doing things to be very limiting.Checkout Netbeans, it\'s written in Java so you\'ll have the same environment regardless of your OS, and it supports a lot more than just C++.I\'m not going to try to convince you, because I think IDEs can be a very personal choice. For me it improves my productivity by being fast, supporting the languages I code in and has the standard features you\'d expect from an IDE.Just a quick follow up for this question...It\'s been a month since I started using Vim as my main \'GUI\'\ntool for programming C++ in Linux. At first the learning\ncurve was indeed a bit steep but after a while and with the\nright options turned on and scripts running I really\ngot the hang of it!I love the way how you can shape Vim to suite your needs;\njust add/change key mappings and Vim is turned into a\nhighly productive \'IDE\'.The toolchain to build and compile a C++ program on Linux is\nalso really intuitive. make and g++ are the tools you\'ll\nuse.The debugger ddd is however not really that good, but\nmaybe that\'s because I haven\'t had the time to master it\nproperly.So to anyone who is, or was looking for a good C++ IDE in\nLinux, just like I was, your best bet lays with the standard\navailable tools in Linux itself (Vim, g++, ddd) and you\nshould really at least try to use them, before looking for\nsonething else...Last but not least, I really want to thank konrad for\nhis answer here, It really helped me find my way in the\nLinux development environment, thank you!I\'m also not closing this question, so people can still\nreact or maybe even add new suggestions or additions to the\nalready really nice answers...I recommend you read The Art Of UNIX Progranmming. It will frame your mind into using the environment as your IDE.Shorter answer is: choosing whatever "editor" you like, then use GDB console or a simple GDB front end to debug your application. The debuggers come with fancy IDEs such as Netbeans sucks for C/C++.  I use Netbeans as my editor, and Insight and GDB console as my debugger.With insight, you have a nice GUI and the raw power of GDB.As soon as you get used to GDB commands, you will start to love it since you can do things you will never be able to do using an GUI. You can use even use Python as your script language if you are using GDB 7 or newer version. Most people here paid more attentions to the "Editors" of the IDEs. However, if you are developing a large project in C/C++, you could easily spend more than 70% of your time on the "debuggers". The debuggers of the fancy IDEs are at least 10 years behind Visual Studio. For instance, Netbenas has very similar interfaces with Visual Studio. But its debugger has a number of disadvantages compared to Visual Studio.The list can be a lot longer.I was so frustrated by the disadvantages of the Netbeans or other similar IDEs, so that I started to learn GDB itself. I found GDB itself are very powerful. GDB does not have all the "disadvantages" mentioned above. Actually, GDB is very powerful, it is even better than Visual Studio in many ways. Here I just show you a very simple example.For instance, you have a array like:When your application stops, and you want to examine the data in IdAndValues. For instance, if you want to find the ordinals and values in the array for a particular "ID", you can create a script like the following:You can use all variables in your application in the current context,  your own variables (in our example, it is $i), arguments passed (in our example, it is $arg0) and all GDB commands (built-in or user defined).Use PrintVal 1 from GDB prompt to print out values for ID "1"By the way, NetBeans does come with a GDB console, but by using the console, you could crash Netbeans. And I believe that is why the console is hidden by default in NetBeansIf you like Eclipse for Java, I suggest Eclipse CDT. \nDespite C/C++ support isn\'t so powerful as is for Java, it still offers most of the features. It has a nice feature named Managed Project that makes working with C/C++ projects easier if you don\'t have experience with Makefiles. But you can still use Makefiles.\nI do C and Java coding and I\'m really happy with CDT. I\'m developing the firmware for a embedded device in C and a application in Java that talks to this device, and is really nice to  use the same environment for both. I guess it probably makes me more productive.I am using "Geany" found good so far, its fast and light weight IDE. Among Geany\xe2\x80\x99s features are:  I love how people completely miss the request in the original question for an IDE.  Linux is NOT an IDE.  That\'s just not what those words mean.  I learned c and c++ using vi and gcc and make, and I\'m not saying they aren\'t adequate tools, but they are NOT an IDE.  Even if you use more elaborate tools like vim or emacs or whatever fancy editor you want, typing commands on a command line is not an IDE.Also, you all know make exists as part of visual studio right?  The idea that an IDE is "limiting" is just silly if you can use the IDE to speed some things, yet are still able to fall back on command line stuff when needed.All that said, I\'d suggest, as several above have, trying Code blocks.  Its got decent code highlighting, a pretty effortless way to create a project, code it, run it, etc, that is the core of a real IDE, and seems fairly stable.  Debugging sucks...I have never seen a decent interactive debugger in any linux/unix variant.  gdb ain\'t it.  If you\'re used to visual studio style debugging, you\'re pretty much out of luck.Anyway, I\'ll go pack my things, I know the one-view-only linux crowd will shout this down and run me out of town in no time.make + vim + gdb = one great IDEI quite like Ultimate++\'s IDE. It has some features that were designed to use with their own library (which, BTW, is quite a nice toolkit if you don\'t want to buy on either GTK+ or QT) but it works perfectly well with general C++ projects. It provides decent code completion, good syntax colouring, integrated debugging, and all other features most modern IDEs support.I really suggest codeblocks. It\'s not as heavy as Eclipse and it\'s got Visual Studio project support.Perhaps the Linux Tools Project for Eclipse could fill your needs?The Linux Tools project aims to bring a full-featured C and C++ IDE to Linux developers. We build on the source editing and debugging features of the CDT and integrate popular native development tools such as the GNU Autotools, Valgrind, OProfile, RPM, SystemTap, GCov, GProf, LTTng, etc. Current projects include LTTng trace viewers and analyzers, an RPM .spec editor, Autotools build integration, a Valgrind heap usage analysis tool, and OProfile call profiling tools.On Linux there are plenty of IDEs: In my experience, the most valuable are Eclipse and Qt Creator.\nBoth provide all "standard" features (i.e., autocompletion, syntax highlightning, debugger, git integration).\nIt is worth noting that Eclipse also provides refactoring functionalities, while Qt Creator provides integration with Valgrind and support for deployment on remote targets.Also the commercial CLion IDE seems preety good (but I\'ve not used it extensively).I hear Anjuta is pretty slick for Gnome users. I played a bit with KDevelop and it\'s nice, but sort of lacking featurewise. Code::Blocks is also very promising, and I like that one best.Sun Studio version 12 is a free download(FREE and paid support available) -- http://developers.sun.com/sunstudio/downloads/thankyou.jsp?submit=%A0FREE+Download%A0%BB%A0.I\'m sure you have code completion and debugging support including plugin support in this IDE.Sun Studio is available for Linux as well as Solaris. \nforums : http://developers.sun.com/sunstudio/community/forums/index.jsp. \nSun Studio Linux forums : http://forum.sun.com/forum.jspa?forumID=855I\'ll be eager to hear your feedback on this tool.BR,\n~AI\'ve previously used Ultimate++ IDE and it\'s rather good. And then I noticed that this simply isn\'t how you work there*, and I threw everything out, spent a few days reading manuals, set up my shell (bash), set up a GVIM environment, learned the GCC/binutils toolchain, make and gdb and lived happily ever after.I\'d mostly agree, but the problem is also one of perception: we forget how difficult it was to become productive in any chose IDE (or other environment).  I find IDE\'s (Visual Studio, NetBeans, Eclipse) amazingly cumbersome in so many ways.As an old-time UNIX guy, I always use Emacs. But that has a pretty steep \n  and long learning curve, so I\'m not sure I can recommend it to newcomers.I\'d second that; use Emacs as my primary editor on both Linux and on MSW (XP2,W2K).\nI would disagree that it has a steep learning curve, but would say that because of the huge number of features it has a long learning curve.  You can be productive within a short time, but if you want you can learn new features of it for years to come.However -- don\'t expect all the features of Emacs to be available on drop-down menus, there is just too much functionality to find it there.As I metioned, I\'ve used GNU Emacs on MSW for years.  And it\'s always worked well with Visual Studio until I "upgraded" to 2008; now it sometimes delays many seconds before refreshing files from disk.   The main reason for editing in the VS window is the "Intellisense" code completion feature.geany I recommendAlthough I use Vim, some of my co-workers use SlickEdit which looks pretty good. I\'m not certain about integrated debugging because we wouldn\'t be able to do that on our particular project anyway.SlickEdit does have good support for navigating large code bases, with cross referencing and tag jumping. Of course it has the basic stuff like syntax highlighting and code completion too.I use Eclipse CDT and Qt Creator (for Qt applications).That\'s my preferences. It\'s a very suggestive question and there is as many answers as there is developers. :)SlickEdit.  I have used and loved SlickEdit since 2005, both on Windows and on Linux.  I also have experience working in Visual Studio (5, 6, 2003, 2005) and just with Emacs and command line.  I use SlickEdit with external makefiles, some of my teammates use SlickEdit, others use Emacs/vi.  I do not use the integrated debugger, integrated version control, integrated build system: I generally find too much integration to be real pain.  SlickEdit is robust (very few bugs), fast and intuitive.  It is like a German car, a driver\'s car.  The newest versions of SlickEdit seem to offer many features that do not interest me, I am a little worried that the product will become bloated and diluted in the future.  For now (I use V13.0) it is great.For me Ultimate++ seems to be the best solution to write cross-os programIf you were using vim for a long time, then you should actually make that as your IDE. There are a lot of addons available. I found several of those as pretty useful, and compiled it here, have a look at it.And a lot more in the vi / vim tips & tricks series over there.
