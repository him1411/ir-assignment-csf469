I would like to concatenate a number of text files into one large file in terminal. I know I can do this using the cat command. However, I would like the filename of each file to precede the "data dump" for that file. Anyone know how to do this?what I currently have:desired output:Was looking for the same thing, and found this to suggest:Output:If there is only a single file then the header will not be printed. Therefore, use -v to always print a header.I used grep for something similar:It does not give you a \'header\', but prefixes every line with the filename.This should do the trick as well:Means:You further can combine searches trough boolean operators like -and or -or. find -ls is nice, too.This should do the trick:or to do this for all text files recursively:This will print the full filename (including path), then the contents of the file. It is also very flexible, as you can use -name "expr" for the find command, and run as many commands as you like on the files.I had a series of files that ended in stats.txt that I wanted to concatenate with the filenames.I did the following and when there is more than one file, the "more" command includes the filename as a header.or for a general caseThis is how I normally handle formatting like that:I generally pipe the cat into a grep for specific information. you can use this simple command instead of using a for loop,Here is a really simple way.  You said you want to cat, which implies you want to view the entire file.  But you also need the filename printed.Try thishead -n99999999 * or head -n99999999 file1.txt file2.txt file3.txtHope that helpsIf you like colors, try this:or:or: (with package \'multitail\' installed)This method will print filename and then file contents:Output:If you want the result in the same format as your desired output you can try:Result: You can put echo -e before and after the cut so you have the spacing between the lines as well:Result:... glomming onto those who\'ve already mentioned head works for some of us:My need is to read the first line; as noted, if you want more than 10 lines, you\'ll have to add options (head -9999, etc).Sorry for posting a derivative comment; I don\'t have sufficient street cred to comment/add to someone\'s comment.I like this option Output looks like this:
