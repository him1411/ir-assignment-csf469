What are the differences between the two data structures ArrayList and Vector, and where should you use each of them?DifferencesUse ArrayLists if there is no specific requirement to use Vectors.SynchronizationIf multiple threads access an ArrayList concurrently then we must externally synchronize the block of code which modifies the list either structurally or simply modifies an element. Structural modification means addition or deletion of element(s) from the list. Setting the value of an existing element is not a structural modification.Collections.synchronizedList is normally used at the time of creation of the list to avoid any accidental unsynchronized access to the list.ReferenceData growthInternally, both the ArrayList and Vector hold onto their contents using an Array. When an element is inserted into an ArrayList or a Vector, the object will need to expand its internal array if it runs out of room. A Vector defaults to doubling the size of its array, while the ArrayList increases its array size by 50 percent.ReferenceAs the documentation says, a Vector and an ArrayList are almost equivalent.  The difference is that access to a Vector is synchronized, whereas access to an ArrayList is not.  What this means is that only one thread can call methods on a Vector at a time, and there\'s a slight overhead in acquiring the lock; if you use an ArrayList, this isn\'t the case.  Generally, you\'ll want to use an ArrayList; in the single-threaded case it\'s a better choice, and in the multi-threaded case, you get better control over locking.  Want to allow concurrent reads?  Fine.  Want to perform one synchronization for a batch of ten writes?  Also fine.  It does require a little more care on  your end, but it\'s likely what you want.  Also note that if you have an ArrayList, you can use the Collections.synchronizedList function to create a synchronized list, thus getting you the equivalent of a Vector.Vector is a broken class that is not threadsafe, despite it being "synchronized" and is only used by students and other inexperienced programmers.ArrayList is the go-to List implementation used by professionals and experienced programmers.Professionals wanting a threadsafe List implementation use a CopyOnWriteArrayList.ArrayList is newer and 20-30% faster. If you don\'t need something explitly apparent in Vector, use ArrayListThere are 2 major differentiation\'s between Vector and ArrayList. Vector is synchronized by default, and ArrayList is not. \nNote : you can make ArrayList also synchronized by passing arraylist object to Collections.synchronizedList() method.\nSynchronized means : it can be used with multiple threads with out any side effect.ArrayLists grow by 50% of the previous size when space is not sufficient for new element, where as Vector will grow by 100% of the previous size when there is no space for new incoming element.Other than this, there are some practical differences between them, in terms of programming effort:When to use which one?Note : even though arraylist grows by 100%, you can avoid this by ensurecapacity() method to make sure that you are allocating sufficient memory at the initial stages itself.Hope it helps.Basically both ArrayList and Vector both uses internal Object Array. ArrayList: The ArrayList class extends AbstractList and implements the List interface and RandomAccess (marker interface). ArrayList supports dynamic arrays that can grow as needed. It gives us first iteration over elements.\nArrayList uses internal Object Array; they are created with an default initial size of 10. When this size is exceeded, the collection is automatically increases to half of the default size that is 15.Vector: Vector is similar to ArrayList but the differences are, it is synchronized and its default initial size is 10 and when the size exceeds its size increases to double of the original size that means the new size will be 20. Vector is the only class other than ArrayList to implement RandomAccess. Vector is having four constructors out of that one takes two parameters Vector(int initialCapacity, int capacityIncrement) capacityIncrement is the amount by which the capacity is increased when the vector overflows, so it have more control over the load factor.Some other differences are:\nArrayList and Vector both implements List interface and maintains insertion order.But there are many differences between ArrayList and Vector classes...ArrayList -Vector -Vector is a legacy class.Vector is slow because it is synchronized i.e. in multithreading environment, it will hold the other threads in runnable or non-runnable state until current thread releases the lock of object.Vector uses Enumeration interface to traverse the elements. But it can use Iterator also.See Also : https://www.javatpoint.com/difference-between-arraylist-and-vectorArrayList Vs Vector:1) Synchronization: ArrayList is non-synchronized which means multiple threads can work on ArrayList at the same time. For e.g. if one thread is performing an add operation on ArrayList, there can be an another thread performing remove operation on ArrayList at the same time in a multithreaded environmentwhile Vector is synchronized. This means if one thread is working on Vector, no other thread can get a hold of it. Unlike ArrayList, only one thread can perform an operation on vector at a time.2) Resize: Both ArrayList and Vector can grow and shrink dynamically to maintain the optimal use of storage, however the way they resized is different. ArrayList grow by half of its size when resized while Vector doubles the size of itself by default when grows.3) Performance: ArrayList gives better performance as it is non-synchronized. Vector operations gives poor performance as they are thread-safe, the thread which works on Vector gets a lock on it which makes other thread wait till the lock is released.4) fail-fast: First let me explain what is fail-fast: If the collection (ArrayList, vector etc) gets structurally modified by any means, except the add or remove methods of iterator, after creation of iterator then the iterator will throw ConcurrentModificationException. Structural modification refers to the addition or deletion of elements from the collection.As per the Vector javadoc the Enumeration returned by Vector is not fail-fast. On the other side the iterator and listIterator returned by ArrayList are fail-fast.5) Who belongs to collection framework really? The vector was not the part of collection framework, it has been included in collections later. It can be considered as Legacy code. There is nothing about Vector which List collection cannot do. Therefore Vector should be avoided. If there is a need of thread-safe operation make ArrayList synchronized as discussed in the next section of this post or use CopyOnWriteArrayList which is a thread-safe variant of ArrayList.There are few similarities between these classes which are as follows:Both Vector and ArrayList use growable array data structure.\nThe iterator and listIterator returned by these classes (Vector and ArrayList) are fail-fast.\nThey both are ordered collection classes as they maintain the elements insertion order.\nVector & ArrayList both allows duplicate and null values.\nThey both grows and shrinks automatically when overflow and deletion happens.
