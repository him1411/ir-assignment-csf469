I have the following code to do this, but how can I do it better? Right now I think it\'s better than nested loops, but it starts to get Perl-one-linerish when you have a generator in a list comprehension. For a start date of 2009-05-30 and an end date of 2009-06-09:Why are there two nested iterations? For me it produces the same list of data with only one iteration:And no list gets stored, only one generator is iterated over. Also the "if" in the generator seems to be unnecessary.After all, a linear sequence should only require one iterator, not two.Maybe the most elegant solution is using a generator function to completely hide/abstract the iteration over the range of dates:NB: For consistency with the built-in range() function this iteration stops before reaching the end_date. So for inclusive iteration use the next day, as you would with range().This might be more clear:Use the dateutil library:This python library has many more advanced features, some very useful, like relative deltas\xe2\x80\x94and is implemented as a single file (module) that\'s easily included into a project.Pandas is great for time series in general, and has direct support for date ranges.You can then loop over the daterange to print the date:It also has lots of options to make life easier. For example if you only wanted weekdays, you would just swap in bdate_range. See http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/timeseries.html#generating-ranges-of-timestampsThe power of Pandas is really its dataframes, which support vectorized operations (much like numpy) that make operations across large quantities of data very fast and easy.EDIT:\nYou could also completely skip the for loop and just print it directly, which is easier and more efficient:This function does more than you strictly require, by supporting negative step, etc. As long as you factor out your range logic, then you don\'t need the separate day_count and most importantly the code becomes easier to read as you call the function from multiple places.Why not try:Numpy\'s arange function can be applied to dates:The use of astype is to convert from numpy.datetime64 to an array of datetime.datetime objects.This is the most human-readable solution I can think of.I have a similar problem, but I need to iterate monthly instead of daily.This is my solutionExample #1OutputExample #2OutputWhat about the following for doing a range incremented by days:For a generic version:Note that .total_seconds() is only supported after python 2.7 If you are stuck with an earlier version you can write your own function:This function has some extra features:error checking in case the end is older than the startShow the last n days from today:Output: Here\'s code for a general date range function, similar to Ber\'s answer, but more flexible:
