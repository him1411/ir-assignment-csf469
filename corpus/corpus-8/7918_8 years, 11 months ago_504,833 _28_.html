Let\'s say I have a classOn a page that is not located at the Item folder, where ItemController resides, I want to create a link to the Login method. So which Html.ActionLink method I should use and what parameters should I pass?Specifically, I am looking for the replacement of the method that has been retired in the recent ASP.NET MVC incarnation. I think what you want is this:This uses the following method ActionLink signature:two arguments have been switched aroundThis uses the following method ActionLink signature:arguments are in the same order as MVC2, however the id value is no longer required:This avoids hard-coding any routing logic into the link.This will give you the following html output, assuming:.\n.I wanted to add to Joseph Kingry\'s answer. He provided the solution but at first I couldn\'t get it to work either and got a result just like Adhip Gupta.  And then I realized that the route has to exist in the first place and the parameters need to match the route exactly.   So I had an id and then a text parameter for my route which also needed to be included too.You might want to look at the RouteLink() method.That one lets you specify everything (except the link text and route name) via a dictionary.I think that Joseph flipped controller and action. First comes the action then the controller. This is somewhat strange, but the way the signature looks.Just to clarify things, this is the version that works (adaption of Joseph\'s example):what about thisIf you want to go all fancy-pants, here\'s how you can extend it to be able to do this:You will need to put this in the System.Web.Mvc namespace:This includes two overrides for Route Values and HTML Attributes, also, all of your views would need to add: @using YourProject.Controllers or you can add it to your web.config <pages><namespaces>Use named parameters for best readability and avoid confusion:With MVC5 i have done it like this and it is 100% working code.... You guys can get an idea from this...This type use:@Html.ActionLink("MainPage","Index","Home")MainPage : Name of the text\nIndex : Action View\nHome : HomeControllerBase Use ActionLink
