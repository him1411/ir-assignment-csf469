I get the error shown below when attempting to install the rmagick gem. I am on Snowleopard 10.6 using RVM, Ruby 1.9.2-head and Rails 3.05. Responses to similar questions recommended installing ImageMagick, which I successfully did. Other suggested installing the "libmagick9-dev library", however, I can not figure out how to do this.I\'m a new developer, and any assistance or directions to an existing explanation or resource is greatly appreciated. Thanks!UPDATE\nIf you\'re a Mac/OS X user I would HIGHLY recommend using Homebrew as your package installer/manager. You can find it HERE. Since originally asking this question I have removed all my prior installs of things like rmagick and imagemagick, and reinstalled them using Homebrew. Super easy with a huge catalog of packages, and updates/uninstalls are a cinch as well!When building native Ruby gems, sometimes you\'ll get an error containing  "ruby extconf.rb". This is often caused by missing development libraries for the gem you\'re installing, or even Ruby itself.Do you have apt installed on your machine? If not, I\'d recommend installing it, because it\'s a quick and easy way to get a lot of development libraries.If you see people suggest installing "libmagick9-dev", that\'s an apt package that you\'d install with:or on centOs:On Mac OS, you can use Homebrew:The new correct way is to install libmagickwand-dev:Then you should be able to install rmagick no problem.UPDATE\nIf you\'re a Mac/OS X user I would HIGHLY recommend using Homebrew as your package installer/manager.

I tried the suggestion of using apt-get by installing the package downloader from Fink Project. I ran the following command in terminal, but it couldn\'t find the libmagick9-dev libary.$ sudo apt-get install libmagick9-dev\n  $ Password:\n  $ Reading Package Lists... Done\n  $ Building Dependency Tree... Done\n  $ E: Couldn\'t find package libmagick9-devI need to bone up on my UNIX command line skills. The original copy of ImageMagick that I installed from source is still on the machine, but I don\'t know where exactly or how to remove it. So much to learn...!imagemagick@6 works for me!See this threadThings change...maybe this will help someone else:sudo apt-get install libmagick9-dev used to work. But with a later version of imagemagick I needed:Ubuntu 15.10Note that if you try to install this gem in ubuntu 15.10, then error can happened:Can\'t install RMagick 2.13.1. Can\'t find Magick-config in ...All you need is preload PATH variable with additional path to ImageMagick lib.PATH="/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ImageMagick-6.8.9/bin-Q16:$PATH"then run gem install rmagicksource of solutionTryFor those who don\'t want to do the build-from-source approach of the (otherwise excellent installer script by John Maddox, the following worked for me when installing on CentOS 6.2. (Adjust your package manager as necessary).Again, this is mainly of interest if you use your distro\'s package manager and would really prefer to keep it sane.In some OS you need to use new libraries: libmagick++4 libmagick++-devYou can use:Important:works on linux mint 13 after making updates:in ubuntu 15.10did the trick for meIf you get an error similar like:You might want to start with this package: sudo apt-get install libgvc5For more details: https://askubuntu.com/a/230958/6506I ran this issue twice on different machine, first time it was resolved by installing the libmagick9-devand second time i have to install the following libraries.On Mac OS X sudo port install ImageMagick turned out to work fine to fix the gem install rmagick problem .   I just didn\'t know that it worked fine because rvm during installation blew away my .bash_profile contents which included MacPort\'s addition of /opt/local/bin to PATH.   I put back /opt/local/bin into PATH in my .bash_profile and then my gem install rmagick then succeeded.I had this problem when I had already installed ImageMagick with macports. I ranTo find where the config file had been stored and then ran to install the gem using bundler. From now on, if you run a command that needs to reference ImageMagick, you can prefix it with that command. For example I had a migration that referenced it, so I ran opt/local/bin/ is the path where my config file was stored. What I did to fix the problem on Ubuntu was Ubuntu:CentOS:MacOS:download and install http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/X112.7.2after:Installing rmagick gem in Ubuntusudo aptitude Install Imagemagick and GraphicsMagick(If not aptitude go & install in s/w center)\nsudo aptitude Install libmagickcore-dev libmagickwand-dev\ngem install rmagick -v 2.13.1For CentOS 5/6 this is what worked for meFor 64 bit do thisAdd the missing dependenciesThen finally rmagickIf you need to start fresh remove other installs first withOn ubuntu, you also have to install imagemagick and libmagickcore-dev like this :Everything is written in the doc.After much digging, I fixed this on debian 8.3 using information here:\nhttps://www.bountysource.com/issues/18142073-can-t-install-gem-on-ubuntu-15-04\nSpecifically:execute this in terminalif its not work than for referenceRemember to ckeck the archive Gemfile.lock after the instalation.\nRemove this archive and execute bundle again.\nIt works for me in linux :D
