I want to copy all files in a directory except some files in a specific sub-directory.\nI have noticed that \'cp\' command didn\'t have a --exclude option.\nSo, how can I achieve this?rsync is fast and easy:Well, if exclusion of certain filename patterns had to be performed by every unix-ish file utility (like cp, mv, rm, tar, rsync, scp, ...), an immense duplication of effort would occur. Instead, such things can be done as part of globbing, i.e. by your shell.Link to manual, search for extglob.Example:So you just put a pattern inside !(), and it negates the match. The pattern can be arbitrarily complex, starting from enumeration of individual paths (as Vanwaril shows in another answer): !(filename1|path2|etc3), to regex-like things with stars and character classes. Refer to the manpage for details.Link to manual, section "filename generation".You can do setopt KSH_GLOB and use bash-like patterns. Or,So x~y matches pattern x, but excludes pattern y. Once again, for full details refer to manpage.Type cp *, hit CtrlX* and just see what happens. it\'s not harmful I promiseWhy use rsync when you can do:This assumes the target directory structure being the same as the source\'s.The easiest way I found, where you can copy all the files excluding files and folders just by adding their names in the parentheses:I assume you\'re using bash or dash.  Would this work?Doing an ls excluding the files you don\'t want, and using that as the first argument for cpExpanding on mvds\xe2\x80\x99s comment, this works for meAnother simpler option is to install and use rsync which has an --exclude-dir option, and can be used for both local and remote files.rsyncand first try it with -n option to see what is going to be copiedThis is a modification of Linus Kleen\'s answer. His answer didn\'t work for me because there would be a . added in front of the file path which cp doesn\'t like (the path would look like source/.destination/file).This command worked for me:find . -type f -not -path \'*/exlude-path/*\' -exec cp --parents \'{}\' \'/destination/\' \\;the --parents command preserves the directory structure.Just move it temporally into a hidden directory (and rename it after, if wanted).One way would be to use find -0 with -prune to find all the files and directories you want to move, then use xargs -0 to copy each one.Edit: forgot to exclude the target path as well (otherwise it would recursively copy).I use a "do while" loop to read the output of the find command.  In this example, I am matching (rather than excluding) certain patterns since there are a more limited number of pattern matches that I want than that I don\'t want.  You could reverse the logic with a -not in front of the -iname flags:I use the above to copy all music type files that are newer on my server than the files on a Western Digital TV Live Hub that I have mounted at /media/wd. I use the above because I have a lot of DVD files, mpegs, etc. that I want to exclude AND because for some reason rsync looks like it is copying, but after I look at the wd device, the files are not there despite no errors during the rsync with this command:
