This question already has an answer here:I would like to add an operator to a class.  I currently have a GetValue() method that I would like to replace with an [] operator.I believe this is what you are looking for:Indexers (C# Programming Guide)The [] operator is called an indexer. You can provide indexers that take an integer, a string, or any other type you want to use as a key. The syntax is straightforward, following the same principles as property accessors.For example, in your case where an int is the key or index:You can also add a set accessor so that the indexer becomes read and write rather than just read-only.If you want to index using a different type, you just change the signature of the indexer.
