How do I convert a vector of doubles to an array of doubles?There\'s a fairly simple trick to do so, since the spec now guarantees vectors store their elements contiguously:What for? You need to clarify: Do you need a pointer to the first element of an array, or an array?If you\'re calling an API function that expects the former, you can do do_something(&v[0], v.size()), where v is a vector of doubles. The elements of a vector are contiguous.Otherwise, you just have to copy each element:Ensure not only thar arr is big enough, but that arr gets filled up, or you have uninitialized values.This is guaranteed to work by the standard, however there are some caveats: in particular take care to only use thearray while thevector is in scope.Vectors effectively are arrays under the skin. If you have  a function:you can call it like this:You should not ever need to convert a vector into an actual array instance.For C++11, I think vector.data() will do the trick.If you have a function, then you probably need this:foo(&array[0], array.size());. If you managed to get into a situation where you need an array then you need to refactor, vectors are basically extended arrays, you should always use them.We can do this using data() method.  C++11 provides this method.
