I\'ve been searching a lot but couldn\'t find a solution. How do you deal with a DateTime that should be able to contain an uninitialized value (equivalent to null)? I have a class which might have a DateTime property value set or not. I was thinking of initializing the property holder to DateTime.MinValue, which then could easily be checked. I guess this is a quite common question, how do you do that?For normal DateTimes,  if you don\'t initialize them at all then they will match DateTime.MinValue, because it is a value type rather than a reference type.You can also use a nullable DateTime, like this:Or the longer form:And, finally, there\'s a built in way to reference the default of any type.  This returns null for reference types, but for our DateTime example it will return the same as DateTime.MinValue:If you\'re using .NET 2.0 (or later) you can use the nullable type:or  then later:And you can check the value with:Or you can use it like:You can read more here:\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b3h38hb0.aspxDateTime? MyDateTime{get;set;}I\'d consider using a nullable types.DateTime? myDate instead of DateTime myDate.You can use a nullable class.You can use a nullable DateTime for this.or the same thing written like this:I always set the time to DateTime.MinValue. This way I do not get any NullErrorException and I can compare it to a date that I know isn\'t set. It is worth pointing out that, while a DateTime variable cannot be null, it still can be compared to null without a compiler error:You can set the DateTime to Nullable. By default DateTime is not nullable. You can make it nullable in a couple of ways. Using a question mark after the type DateTime? myTime or using the generic style Nullable. I have added a couple of links on msdn.Using NullableNullableThat way working as wellPlease note that property PublishDate should be DateTime?Just be warned - When using a Nullable its obviously no longer a \'pure\' datetime object, as such you cannot access the DateTime members directly. I\'ll try and explain.By using Nullable<> you\'re basically wrapping DateTime in a container (thank you generics) of which is nullable - obviously its purpose. This container has its own properties which you can call that will provide access to the aforementioned DateTime object; after using the correct property - in this case Nullable.Value - you then have access to the standard DateTime members, properties etc.So - now the issue comes to mind as to the best way to access the DateTime object. There are a few ways, number 1 is by FAR the best and 2 is "dude why".Using the Nullable.Value property,DateTime date = myNullableObject.Value.ToUniversalTime(); //WorksDateTime date = myNullableObject.ToUniversalTime(); //Not a datetime object, failsConverting the nullable object to datetime using Convert.ToDateTime(),DateTime date = Convert.ToDateTime(myNullableObject).ToUniversalTime(); //works but why...Although the answer is well documented at this point, I believe the usage of Nullable was probably worth posting about. Sorry if you disagree.edit: Removed a third option as it was a bit overly specific and case dependent.Although everyone has already given you the answer , I\'ll mention a way which makes it easy to pass a datetime into a function[ERROR:cannot convert system.datetime? to system.datetime]Now you may pass dte inside the function without any issues.If you are, sometimes, expecting null you could use something like this:In your repository use null-able datetime.I had the same problem as I had to give Null as a parameter for DateTime while performing Unit test for Throws ArgumentNullException.It worked in my case using the following option:Given the nature of a date/time data type it cannot contain a null value, i.e. it needs to contain a value, it cannot be blank or contain nothing. If you mark a date/time variable as nullable then only can you assign a null value to it. So what you are looking to do is one of two things (there might be more but I can only think of two):Assign a minimum date/time value to your variable if you don\'t have a value for it. You can assign a maximum date/time value as well - whichever way suits you. Just make sure that you are consistent site-wide when checking your date/time values. Decide on using min or max and stick with it.Mark your date/time variable as nullable. This way you can set your date/time variable to null if you don\'t have a variable to it.Let me demonstrate my first point using an example. The DateTime variable type cannot be set to null, it needs a value, in this case I am going to set it to the DateTime\'s minimum value if there is no value.My scenario is that I have a BlogPost class. It has many different fields/properties but I chose only to use two for this example. DatePublished is when the post was published to the website and has to contain a date/time value. DateModified is when a post is modified, so it doesn\'t have to contain a value, but can contain a value.Using ADO.NET to get the data from the database (assign DateTime.MinValue is there is no value):You can accomplish my second point by marking the DateModified field as nullable. Now you can set it to null if there is no value for it:Using ADO.NET to get the data from the database, it will look a bit different to the way it was done above (assigning null instead of DateTime.MinValue):I hope this helps to clear up any confusion. Given that my response is about 8 years later you are probably an expert C# programmer by now :)
