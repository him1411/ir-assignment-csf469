I\'m looking for a way to insert a <style> tag into an HTML page with javascript.The best way I found so far:This works in Firefox, Opera and Internet Explorer but not in Google Chrome. Also it\'s a bit ugly with the <br> in front for IE.Does anyone know of a way to create a <style> tag that Or maybeI appreciate any advice on this.Try adding the style element to the head rather than the body.This was tested in IE (7-9), Firefox, Opera and Chrome:I\'m assuming that you\'re wanting to insert a style tag versus a link tag (referencing an external CSS), so that\'s what the following example does:Also, I noticed in your question that you are using innerHTML. This is actually a non-standard way of inserting data into a page. The best practice is to create a text node and append it to another element node.With respect to your final question, you\'re going to hear some people say that your work should work across all of the browsers. It all depends on your audience. If no one in your audience is using Chrome, then don\'t sweat it; however, if you\'re looking to reach the biggest audience possible, then it\'s best to support all major A-grade browsersHere\'s a script which adds IE-style createStyleSheet() and addRule() methods to browsers which don\'t have them:You can add external files viaand dynamically create rules viaAn example that works and are compliant with all browsers :For those already using jQuery, you can use this one-liner:So that\'s it. You can also save a reference to this element to change it later.Here is a variant for dynamically adding a class Oftentimes there\'s a need to override existing rules, so appending new styles to the HEAD doesn\'t work in every case.I came up with this simple function that summarizes all not valid "append to the BODY" approaches and is just more convenient to use and debug (IE8+).Demo: codepen, jsfiddleAll good, but for styleNode.cssText to work in IE6 with node created by javascipt, you need to append the node to the document before you set the cssText;further info @ http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533698%28VS.85%29.aspxThis object variable will append style tag to the head tag with type attribute and one simple transition rule inside that matches every single id/class/element. Feel free to modify content property and inject as many rules as you need. Just make sure that css rules inside content remain in one line (or \'escape\' each new line, if You prefer so).
