I have some python code that have inconsistent indentation, there is a lot of mixture of tabs and spaces to make the matter even worse even space indentation is not preserved.The code works as expected but it\'s difficult to maintain.How can I fix the indentation (like "html tidy" but for python) without breaking the code?Use the reindent.py script that you find in the Tools/scripts/ directory of your Python installation:Change Python (.py) files to use\n  4-space indents and no hard tab\n  characters. Also trim excess spaces\n  and tabs from ends of lines, and\n  remove empty lines at the end of\n  files.  Also ensure the last line ends\n  with a newline.Have a look at that script for detailed usage instructions.If you\'re using Vim, see :h retab.For example, if you simply typeall your tabs will be expanded into spaces.You may want toto make sure that any new lines will not use literal tabs.If you\'re not using Vim,will replace tabs with spaces, assuming tab stops every 8 characters, in file.py (with the original going to file.py.bak, just in case).  Replace the 8s with 4s if your tab stops are every 4 spaces instead.I would reach for autopep8 to do this:Note: E101 and E121 are pep8 indentation (I think you can simply pass --select=E1 to fix all indentation related issues - those starting with E1).You can apply this to your entire project using recursive flag:See also Tool to convert Python code to be PEP8 compliant.Use autopep8autopep8 automatically formats Python code to conform to the PEP 8\n nullstyle guide. It uses the pep8 utility to determine what parts of the\n nullcode needs to be formatted. autopep8 is capable of fixing most of the\n nullformatting issues that can be reported by pep8.Using vim, it shouldn\'t be more involved than hitting Esc, and then typing....on the file you want to change.  That will convert all tabs to 4 spaces.  If you have inconsistent spacing as well, then that will be more difficult.There is also PythonTidy (since you said you like HTMLTidy)\nIt can be found here: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PythonTidy/1.16\nIt can do a lot more than just clean up tabs though.  If you like that type of thing it\'s worth a look.If you\'re lazy (like me), you can also download a trial version of Wingware Python IDE, which has an auto-fix tool for messed up indentation. It works pretty well.\nhttp://www.wingware.com/On most UNIX-like systems, you can also run:from the command line, changing the number if you want to replace tabs with a number of spaces other than 4. You can easily write a shell script to do this with a bunch of files at once, retaining the original file names.The reindent script did not work for me, due to some missing module. Anyways, I found this sed command which does the job perfect for me:Try emacs. It has good support for indentation needed in Python. Please check this link http://python.about.com/b/2007/09/24/emacs-tips-for-python-programmers.htmcheersI have a simple solution for this problem. You can first type ":retab" and then ":retab!", then everything would be finetry Idle, and use ALT+X to find indentation
