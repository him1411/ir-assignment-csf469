I want to force push, for example, my tag 1.0.0 to my remote master branch.I\'m now doing the following:I want to force the push, because all I care about is that the code inside the 1.0.0 tag is pushed to the master branch on the remote repository.What am I doing wrong?When I SSH into my server where my Git repository is and execute git branch -l, I don\'t see the master branch listed either.After running git tag -l from inside the remote Git repository, I see that master is listed, meaning that when I ran the following:It actually pushed the tag and created a tag named master rather than a new branch.I want to basically push the contents of the tag 1.0.0 into the master branch of the remote Git repository.It is probably failing because 1.0.0 is an annotated tag. Perhaps you saw the following error message:error: Trying to write non-commit object  to branch refs/heads/masterAnnotated tags have their own distinct type of object that points to the tagged commit object. Branches can not usefully point to tag objects, only commit objects. You need to \xe2\x80\x9cpeel\xe2\x80\x9d the annotated tag back to commit object and push that instead.There is another syntax that would also work in this case, but it means something slightly different if the tag object points to something other than a commit (or a tag object that points to (a tag object that points to a \xe2\x80\xa6) a commit).These tag peeling syntaxes are described in git-rev-parse(1) under Specifying Revisions.I create the tag like this and then I push it to GitHub:For pushing a single tag: git push <reponame> <tagname>For instance, git push production 1.0.0. Tags are not bound to branches, they are bound to commits.When you want to have the tag\'s content in the master branch, do that locally on your machine. I would assume that you continued developing in your local master branch. Then just a git push origin master should suffice.
