How do I check if a file on my server exists in jQuery or JavaScript?With jQuery:EDIT:Here is the code for checking 404 status, without using jQuerySmall changes and it could check for status HTTP status code 200 (success), instead.A similar and more up-to-date approach.This works for me:i used this script to add alternative imageHTML:http://wap.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onerror.aspSo long as you\'re testing files on the same domain this should work:Please note, this example is using a GET request, which besides getting the headers (all you need to check weather the file exists) gets the whole file.\nIf the file is big enough this method can take a while to complete.The better way to do this would be changing this line: req.open(\'GET\', url, false); to req.open(\'HEAD\', url, false);I was getting a cross domain permissions issue when trying to run the answer to this question  so I went with:              It seems to work great, hope this helps someone!Here\'s how to do it ES7 way, if you\'re using Babel transpiler or Typescript 2:Then inside your other async scope, you can easily check whether url exist:What you\'d have to do is send a request to the server for it to do the check, and then send back the result to you.What type of server are you trying to communicate with?  You may need to write a small service to respond to the request.For a client computer this can be achieved by:This is my program to transfer a file to a specific location and shows alert if it does not existFirst creates the functionAfter using the function as followsAn async call to see if a file exists is the better approach, because it doesn\'t degrade the user experience by waiting for a response from the server. If you make a call to .open with the third parameter set to false (as in many examples above, for example http.open(\'HEAD\', url, false); ), this is a synchronous call, and you get a warning in the browser console.A better approach is:source: https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/This doesn\'t address the OP\'s question, but for anyone who is returning results from a database: here\'s a simple method I used.If the user didn\'t upload an avatar the avatar field would be NULL, so I\'d insert a default avatar image from the img directory.thenJavaScript function to check if a file exists:I use this script to check if a file exists (also it handles the cross origin issue):Note that the following syntax error is thrown when the file being checked doesn\'t contain JSON.Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <Not sure its possible without something serverside going on. It would cause interesting security problems if I could write stuff to interact with your files in javascript. Use PHP for this in my opinion.
