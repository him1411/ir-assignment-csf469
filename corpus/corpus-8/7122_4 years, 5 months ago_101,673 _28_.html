All the ajax calls that are sent from the IE are cached by Angular and I get a 304 response for all the subsequent calls . Though the request is the same, the response is not gonna be the same in my case. I wanna disable this cache. I tried adding the cache attribute to $http.get but still it didnt help. How can this issue be resolved?Instead of disabling caching for each single GET-request, I disable it globally in the $httpProvider: You can either append a unique querystring (I believe this is what jQuery does with the cache: false option) to the request.A perhaps better solution is if you have access to the server, then you can make sure that necessary headers are set to prevent caching. If you\'re using ASP.NET MVC this answer might help.you may add an interceptor .you should remove console.log lines after verifying.I simply added three meta tags into index.html on angular project, and cache issue was solved on IE.The guaranteed one that I had working was something along these lines:I had to merge 2 of the above solutions in order to guarantee the correct usage for all methods, but you can replace common with get or other method i.e. put, post, delete to make this work for different cases.I get it resolved appending datetime as an random number:This only line helped me (Angular 1.4.8):UPD: The problem is IE11 does aggressive caching. When I was looking into Fiddler I noticed that in F12 mode requests are sending "Pragma=no-cache" and endpoint is requested every time I visit a page. But in normal mode endpoint was requested only once at the first time when I visited the page.For Angular 2 and newer, the easiest way to add headers mentioned is to override RequestOptions class used by Http service:And reference it in your module:To avoid caching, one option is to give different URL for the same resource or data. To generate different URL, you can add a random query string to the end of the URL.  This technique works for JQuery, Angular or other type ajax requests.   Solution above will work (make the url unique by adding in the querystring a new param) but I prefer the solution propose [here]: Better Way to Prevent IE Cache in AngularJS?, which handle this at server level as it\'s not specific to IE. I mean, if that resource should not be cached, do it on the server (this as nothing to do with the browser used; it\'s intrisic to the resource).For example in java with JAX-RS do it programatically for JAX-RS v1 or  declativly for JAX-RS v2.I\'m sure anyone will figure out how to do it I have found better solution: Better Way to Prevent IE Cache in AngularJS?For lazy ones here is a solution:This issue is due to the IE caching problem as you said, you can test it in IE debug mode by pressing f12 (this will work fine in debug mode).IE will not take the server data in each time the page calls, it takes the data from cache. To disable this do either of the following://Before (issued one)this.httpService.get(this.serviceUrl + "/eAMobileService.svc/ValidateEngagmentName/" + engagementName , {})//After (working fine)this.httpService.get(this.serviceUrl + "/eAMobileService.svc/ValidateEngagmentName/" + engagementName + "?DateTime=" + new Date().getTime() + \'\', { cache: false })$httpProvider.defaults.headers.common[\'Pragma\'] = \'no-cache\';This is a little bit to old but: Solutions like  is obsolete. Let the server handle the cache or not cache (in the response). The only way to guarantee no caching (thinking about new versions in production) is to change the js or css file with a version number. I do this with webpack. I just added this to View and it started working on IE. Confirmed to work on Angular 2.
