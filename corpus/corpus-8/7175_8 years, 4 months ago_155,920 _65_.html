Using Rails I\'m trying to get an error message like "The song field can\'t be empty" on save. Doing the following:... only displays "Song Rep XYW can\'t be empty", which is not good because the title of the field is not user friendly. How can I change the title of the field itself ? I could change the actual name of the field in the database, but I have multiple "song" fields and I do need to have specific field names.I don\'t want to hack around rails\' validation process and I feel there should be a way of fixing that.Now, the accepted way to set the humanized names and custom error messages is to use locales.Now the humanized name and the presence validation message for the "email" attribute have been changed.Validation messages can be set for a specific model+attribute, model, attribute, or globally.Try this. I found this here.Here is another way to do it.\nWhat you do is define a human_attribute_name method on the model class. The method is passed the column name as a string and returns the string to use in validation messages.The above code is from hereIn your model:In your viewIf you do insteadyou get this error message with the attribute name  if you want to get the error message for one single attribute Yes, there\'s a way to do this whithout the plugin!\nBut I is not as clean and elegant as using the mentioned plugin. Here it is.Assuming it\'s Rails 3 (I don\'t know if it\'s different in previous versions),keep this in your model:and in the view, instead of leavingas it would be when we use the scaffold generator, put:And you will get just the message you especified in the model, without the attribute name.Explanation:So far we are just displaying only one message, always for the first error. If you wanna display all erros you can loop in the hash and show the values.Hope that helped.Rails3 Code with fully localized messages:In the model user.rb define the validationIn config/locales/en.ymlI recommend installing the custom_error_message gem (or as a plugin) originally written by David EasleyIt lets you do stuff like:In the custom validation method use:errors.add(:base, "Custom error message")as add_to_base has been deprecated.errors.add_to_base("Custom error message")Related to the accepted answer and another answer down the list: I\'m confirming that nanamkim\'s fork of custom-err-msg works with Rails 5, and with the locale setup.You just need to start the locale message with a caret and it shouldn\'t display the attribute name in the message.A model defined as:with the following en.yml:item.errors.full_messages will display:instead of the usual Name You can\'t create an item without a nameJust do it the normal way:But display it like this insteadReturnsThe localization method is definitely the "proper" way to do this, but if you\'re doing a little, non-global project and want to just get going fast - this is definitely easier than file hopping. I like it for the ability to put the field name somewhere other than the beginning of the string:Here is another way:If you use this template:You can write you own custom message like this:This way, because of the underscore, the full message becomes " My custom message", but the extra space in the beginning is unnoticeable. If you really don\'t want that extra space at the beginning just add the .lstrip method.The String.lstrip method will get rid of the extra space created by \':_\' and will leave any other error messages unchanged.Or even better, use the first word of your custom message as the key:Now the full message will be "My custom message" with no extra space.If you want the full message to start with a word capitalized like "URL can\'t be blank" it cannot be done. Instead try adding some other word as the key:Now the full message will be "The URL can\'t be blank"One solution might be to change the i18n default error format:Default is format: %{attribute} %{message}If you want to list them all in a nice list but without using the cruddy non human friendly name, you can do this...In your viewWhen you want to override the error message without the attribute name, simply prepend the message with ^ like so:I tried following, worked for me :)1 job.rb2 jobs_controller.rb3 _form.html.erb Here is my code that can be useful for you in case you still need it: \nMy model: Then I have created a helper to show messages:
