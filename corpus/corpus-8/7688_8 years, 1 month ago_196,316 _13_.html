I was working on a git branch and was ready to commit my changes, so I made a commit with a useful commit message. I then absentmindedly made minor changes to the code that are not worth keeping. I now want to change branches, but git gives me,error: You have local changes to "X"; cannot switch branches.I thought that I could change branches without committing. If so, how can I set this up? If not, how do I get out of this problem? I want to ignore the minor changes without committing and just change branches.You need a clean state to change branches. The branch checkout will only be allowed if it does not affect the \'dirty files\' (as Charles Bailey remarks in the comments).Otherwise, you should either:If you want to discard the changes,If you want to keep the changes,well, it should beFollow, If you have made changes to files that Git also needs to change when switching branches, it won\'t let you. To discard working changes, use:Then, you will be able to switch branches.Note that if you\'ve merged remote branches or have local commits and want to go back to the remote HEAD you must do:HEAD alone will only refer to the local commit/merge -- several times I have forgotten that when resetting and end up with "your repository is X commits ahead.." when I fully intended to nuke ALL changes/commits and return to the remote branch.
