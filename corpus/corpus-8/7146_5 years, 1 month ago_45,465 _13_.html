Scenario:This code doesn\'t work, and I cannot find a way to call a trait function like it was inherited. I tried calling self::calc($v), static::calc($v), parent::calc($v), A::calc($v) and the following:Nothing works.  Is there a way to make it work or must I override completely the trait function which is much more complex than this :)Your last one was almost there:The trait is not a class. You can\'t access its members directly. It\'s basically just automated copy and paste...If the class implements the method directly, it will not use the traits version.  Perhaps what you are thinking of is:Because the child classes do not implement the method directly, they will first use that of the trait if there otherwise use that of the parent class.If you want, the trait can use method in the parent class (assuming you know the method would be there) e.g.You can also provide for ways to override, but still access the trait method as follows:You can see it work at http://sandbox.onlinephpfunctions.com/code/e53f6e8f9834aea5e038aec4766ac7e1c19cc2b5An alternative approach if interested - with an extra intermediate class to use the normal OOO way. This simplifies the usage with parent::methodname Using another trait:
