I want my script to be able to take an optional input, e.g. currently my script is but I would like it to say:You could use the default-value syntax:The above will, as described in Bash Reference Manual - 3.5.3 Shell Parameter Expansion [emphasis mine]:If parameter is unset or null, the expansion of word is substituted. Otherwise, the value of parameter is substituted.If you only want to substitute a default value if the parameter is unset (but not if it\'s null, e.g. not if it\'s an empty string), use this syntax instead:Again from Bash Reference Manual - 3.5.3 Shell Parameter Expansion:Omitting the colon results in a test only for a parameter that is unset. Put another way, if the colon is included, the operator tests for both parameter\xe2\x80\x99s existence and that its value is not null; if the colon is omitted, the operator tests only for existence.You can set a default value for a variable like so:Here are some examples of how this works:You can check the number of arguments with $#please don\'t forget, if its variable $1 .. $n \nyou need write to a regular variable to use the substitutionFor optional multiple arguments, by analogy with the ls command which can take one or more files or by default lists everything in the current directory:Does not work correctly for files with spaces in the path, alas. Have not figured out how to make that work yet.It\'s possible to use variable substitution to substitute a fixed value or a command (like date) for an argument. The answers so far have focused on fixed values, but this is what I used to make date an optional argument:Thanks Jesse Glick for your answer. \nTo make it work with spaces, you could use quotes ou backslah. See the example below:This should create two files "toto titi" and \'"titi toto" and then print:
