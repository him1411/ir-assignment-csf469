You need to have something like readonly="readonly" in the object you are working with if you want it not to be editable.\nAnd if you want it to be editable again you won\'t have something like readonly=\'\' (this is not standard if I understood correctly).

Note in example that if select 1 apply the readonly attribute on textbox, otherwise remove the attribute readonly.http://jsfiddle.net/baqxz7ym/2/For jQuery version < 1.9:For jQuery version >= 1.9:
