My understanding is that the [NotMapped] attribute is not available until EF 5 which is currently in CTP so we cannot use it in production.How can I mark properties in EF 4.1 to be ignored?UPDATE: I noticed something else strange. I got the [NotMapped] attribute to work but for some reason, EF 4.1 still creates a column named Disposed in the database even though the public bool Disposed { get; private set; } is marked with [NotMapped]. The class implements IDisposeable of course but I don\'t see how that should matter. Any thoughts?You can use the NotMapped Annotation to instruct Code-First to exclude a particular property[NotMapped] attribute is included in the System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotationsnamespace.You can alternatively do this with Fluent API overriding OnModelCreating function in your DBContext class:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh295847(v=vs.103).aspxThe version I checked is  EF 4.3, which is the latest stable version available when you use NuGet.As of EF 5.0, you need to include the System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema namespace.
