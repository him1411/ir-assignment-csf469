I have a python module installed on my system and I\'d like to be able to see what functions/classes/methods are available in it.   I want to call the doc function on each one. In ruby I can do something like ClassName.methods to get a list of all the methods available on that class. Is there something similar in python?eg. something like:The inspect module. Also see the pydoc module, the help() function in the interactive interpreter and the pydoc command-line tool which generates the documentation you are after. You can just give them the class you wish to see the documentation of. They can also generate, for instance, HTML output and write it to disk.You can use dir(module) to see all available methods/attributes.  Also check out PyDocs.Once you\'ve imported the module, you can just do:... To get the docs on all the functions at once, interactively.  Or you can use:... To simply list the names of all the functions and variables defined in the module.An example with inspect:getmembers returns a list of (object_name, object_type) tuples.You can replace isfunction with any of the other isXXX functions in the inspect module.This will do the trick:However, if you find it annoying to read the returned list, just use the following loop to get one name per line.For completeness\' sake, I\'d like to point out that sometimes you may want to parse code instead of importing it. An import will execute top-level expressions, and that could be a problem.For example, I\'m letting users select entry point functions for packages being made with zipapp. Using import and inspect risks running astray code, leading to crashes, help messages being printed out, GUI dialogs popping up and so on.Instead I use the ast module to list all the top-level functions:Putting this code in list.py and using itself as input, I get:Of course, navigating an AST can be tricky sometimes, even for a relatively simple language like Python, because the AST is quite low-level. But if you have a simple and clear use case, it\'s both doable and safe.Though, a downside is that you can\'t detect functions that are generated at runtime, like foo = lambda x,y: x*y.dir(module) is the standard way when using a script or the standard interpreter, as mentioned in most answers.However with an interactive python shell like IPython you can use tab-completion to get an overview of all objects defined in the module. \nThis is much more convenient, than using a script and print to see what is defined in the module.None of these answers will work if you are unable to import said Python file without import errors. This was the case for me when I was inspecting a file which comes from a large code base with a lot of dependencies. The following will process the file as text and search for all method names that start with "def" and print them and their line numbers.Except dir(module) or help(module) mentioned in previous answers, you can also try:\n - Open ipython \n - import module_name \n - type module_name, press tab. It\'ll open a small window with listing all functions in the python module. \nIt looks very neat. Here is snippet listing all functions of hashlib moduleFor code that you do not wish to parse, I recommend the AST-based approach of @csl above.For everything else, the inspect module is correct:This gives a list of 2-tuples in the form [(<name:str>, <value:function>), ...].The simple answer above is hinted at in various responses and comments, but not called out explicitly.It is not (or at least no longer) proper to use dir(module). The  code should read like this:Or you specify the module you want like this: dir(\'sys\') to produce results from the module name sys. dir() returns errors while dir(\'\') is what you need. *help(\'\') will return help information if available for most functions. eg; help(\'modules\') will return module help info.Thanks for all the down votes. I was using Python3.2.2 and other 3x versions when I posted this. The point was to use (\' stuff \') instead of the previous ( stuff ). But I\'m assuming your all stuck on Python2 or using newer versions for PC not mobile like I was. http://effbot.org/librarybook/sys.htmYou can use the following method to get list all the functions in your module from shell:import module
