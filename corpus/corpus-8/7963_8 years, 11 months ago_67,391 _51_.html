Is there a way to start PowerShell in a specific folder from Windows Explorer, e.g. to right-click in a folder and have an option like "Open PowerShell in this Folder"?It\'s really annoying to have to change directories to my project folder the first time I run MSBuild every day.In Windows Explorer, just go to the Address Bar at the top (keyboard shortcuts: Alt+D or Ctrl+L) and type powershell or powershell_ise and press Enter.

Each key controls the context menu of a different Windows Explorer object.  The first one is the one you asked about:For each of these registry keys, you can add a subkey that will add an "Open PowerShell window here" command to the context menu, just as you have an "Open command window here" context menu.Here is a copy of my OpenPowerShellHere.reg file, which puts the command in the context menu of each of the Explorer objects, the window background, the folder, and the drive icon:So, with your favorite text editor, open a new file named OpenPowerShellHere.reg.

If you want to exclude the command from one of the entry, just comment out the appropriate section with semicolons.  My comments show you each section.After you save the file, run it by double-clicking on it.  When it asks, tell it to proceed.
