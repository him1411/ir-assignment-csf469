Does anyone know how to stop a UIWebView from bouncing vertically? I mean when a user touches their iphone screen, drags their finger downwards, and the webview shows a blank spot above the web page I had loaded?I\'ve looked at the following possible solutions, but none of them worked for me:http://www.iphonedevsdk.com/forum/iphone-sdk-development/996-turn-off-scrolling-bounces-uiwebview.htmlhttp://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=619534How do I stop a UIScrollView from bouncing horizontally?...seems to work fine.It\'ll be accepted to App Store as well.Update: in iOS 5.x+ there\'s an easier way - UIWebView has scrollView property, so your code can look like this:I was looking at a project that makes it easy to create web apps as full fledged installable applications on the iPhone called QuickConnect, and found a solution that works, if you don\'t want your screen to be scrollable at all, which in my case I didn\'t.In the above mentioned project/blog post, they mention a javascript function you can add to turn off the bouncing, which essentially boils down to this:If you want to see more about how they implement it, simply download QuickConnect and check it out.... But basically all it does is call that javascript on page load... I tried just putting it in the head of my document, and it seems to work fine.Well all I did to accomplish this is :Works fine for me... \nAlso, the ticked answer for this question is one that Apple will reject if you use it in\nyour iphone app.In the iOS 5 SDK you can access the scroll view associated with a web view directly rather than iterating through its subviews.So to disable \'bouncing\' in the scroll view you can use:See the UIWebView Class Reference.(However if you need to support versions of the SDK before 5.0, you should follow Mirek Rusin\'s advice.)Warning.  I used setAllowsRubberBanding: in my app, and Apple rejected it, stating that non-public API functions are not allowed (cite: 3.3.1)Swift 3In Swift to disable bouncesBrad\'s method worked for me. If you use it you might want to make it a little safer.If apple changes something then the bounce will come back - but at least your app won\'t crash.On iOS5 only if you plan to let the users zoom the webview contents (e.i.: double tap) the bounce setting isn\'t enough. You need to set also alwaysBounceHorizontal and alwaysBounceVertical properties to NO, else when they zoom-out (another double tap...) to default it will bounce again.I traversed the collection of UIWebView\'s subviews and set their backgrounds to [UIColor blackColor], the same color as the webpage background. The view will still bounce but it will not show that ugly dark grey background.I was annoyed to find out that UIWebView is not a scroll view, so I made a custom subclass to get at the web view\'s scroll view. This suclass contains a scroll view so you can customize the behavior of your web view. The punchlines of this class are:}Then, when you create a custom web view, you can disable bouncing with:This is a great general purpose way to make a web view with customizable scrolling behavior. There are just a few things to watch out for:Came across this searching for an answer and I eventually just lucked on an answer of my own by messing about. I did and it worked.This worked for me, and beautifully too (I am using phonegap with webView)or It looks to me like the UIWebView has a UIScrollView. You can use documented APIs for this, but bouncing is set for both directions, not individually. This is in the API docs.\nUIScrollView has a bounce property, so something like this works (don\'t know if there\'s more than one scrollview):I tried a slightly different approach to prevent UIWebView objects from scrolling and bouncing: adding a gesture recognizer to override other gestures.It seems, UIWebView or its scroller subview uses its own pan gesture recognizer to detect user scrolling. But according to Apple\'s documentation there is a legitimate way of overriding one gesture recognizer with another. UIGestureRecognizerDelegate protocol has a method gestureRecognizer:shouldRecognizeSimultaneouslyWithGestureRecognizer: - which allows to control the behavior of any colliding gesture recognizers.So, what I did wasin the view controller\'s viewDidLoad method:then, the gesture override method: Of course, this delegate method can me more complex in a real application - we may disable other recognizers selectively, analyzing otherGestureRecognizer.view and making decision based on what view it is. And, finally, for the sake of completeness, the method we registered as a pan handler:it can be empty if all we want is to cancel web views\' scrolling and bouncing, or it can contain our own code to implement the kind of pan motions and animations we really want... So far I\'m just experimenting with all this stuff, and it seems to be working more or less as I want it. I haven\'t tried to submit any apps to iStore yet, though. But I believe I haven\'t used anything undocumented so far... If anyone finds it otherwise, please inform me. Here\'s two newer potential solutions. Apparently, you can use jqtouch or pastrykit to disable scrolling. However, I haven\'t got these to work. You might be more competent.turning off vertical scrollingdigging into pastrykitfixed positioning on mobile safariThis link helped me lot.....Its easy.. There is a demo.. (Xcode 5 iOS 7 SDK example) Here is a Universal App example using the scrollview setBounces  function. It is an open source project / example located here: Link to SimpleWebView (Project Zip and Source Code Example) One of the subviews of UIWebView should be a UIScrollView. Set its scrollEnabled property to NO and the web view will have scrolling disabled entirely.Note: this is technically using a private API and thus your app could be rejected or crash in future OS releases. Use @try and respondsToSelectorLook into the bounces property of UIScrollView. Quoth the Apple docs:If the value of the property is YES (the default), the scroll view bounces when it encounters a boundary of the content. Bouncing visually indicates that scrolling has reached an edge of the content. If the value is NO, scrolling stops immediately at the content boundary without bouncing.Make sure you\'re using the right UIScrollView. I\'m not sure what the hierarchy looks like for a UIWebView, but the scroll view could be a parent, not a child, of the UIWebView.To disable UIWebView scrolling you could use the following line of code:In this example, ObjWebview is of type UIWebView.webView.scrollView.scrollEnabled=NO;\nwebView.scrollView.bounces=NO;
