I\'ve been reading up on Microservice Architecture and I am trying to see a difference between it and regular SOA (apart from the services all deployed individually). Can anyone tell me the difference and maybe the pro\'s and con\'s of Microservice Architecture?I guess you could think of the Microservices Architectural Style as a specialisation of SOA. Don\'t forget that one of the accepted views is that all SOA really is, is four sentences:Service compatibility is based on policy-Don Box, Microsoft (pre-.Net 3.0)This brings us to the canonical definition of microservices, from Lewis/Fowler:In short, the microservice architectural style is an approach to\n  developing a single application as a suite of small services, each\n  running in its own process and communicating with lightweight\n  mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These services are built\n  around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully\n  automated deployment machinery. There is a bare minimum of centralised\n  management of these services, which may be written in different\n  programming languages and use different data storage technologies.From this definition, it\'s clear that microservices fulfil at least the first two tenets (with a real emphasis on the second), but it\'s questionable whether they fulfil the third (I don\'t really understand tenet 4 so I won\'t comment). The reason the third tenet may not hold for microservices is that one of the characteristics of microservices is that they are generally exposed over a RESTful API, which, one could argue, does not expose contract and schema at all (over and above the regular HTTP verbiage), as we see from Fowler:a suite of small services, each... communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource APIAnother way in which a microservices style deviates from SOA is with this prescription:These services are... independently deployable by fully automated deployment machineryFollowing the original tenets of SOA does not prevent me from manually copying my service binaries into my production environment, but with the microservices approach, the service deployment and management should be fully automated. The core difference between SOA and microservices lies in the size and scope. As the word "micro" suggests, it has to be significantly smaller than what SOA tends to be. Microservice is a small(er) independently deployable unit. Beware of very small microservice antipattern - nanoservice. A SOA can be either a monolith or it can be comprised of multiple microservices. Martin Fowler says he likes to think SOA to be a superset of microservices.Martin Fowler:\nhttps://youtu.be/2yko4TbC8cI?t=15m53sEdit : Here is another video by Martin Fowler, talking about difference between Microservices and SOA. https://youtu.be/wgdBVIX9ifA?t=13m10sThe term microservices puts a lot of emphasis on the size of the services, a point that most practitioners find to be rather unfortunate.\nStefan Tilkov argues that you should start from the overall application and figure how it can sensibly be carved up.\nSam Newman\'s talk emphasizes that you should derive your microservices based on the DDD notion of Bounded ContextYou might find this interesting: \n Summary of book "Building Microservices"Straight from Oracle\'s post, about differences between SOA and microservices, a brief description of the difference can be summed up in Torsten Winterberg (Oracle ACE Director) words:Microservices are the kind of SOA we have been talking about for the last decade. Microservices must be independently deployable, whereas SOA services are often implemented in deployment monoliths. Classic SOA is more platform driven, so microservices offer more choices in all dimensions.So, SOA is an architectural pattern in which application components provide services to other components. However, in SOA those components can belong to the same application. On the other hand, in microservices these components are suites of independently deployable services.Microservices is the architectural evolution of SOA, driven by DevOps practices. The individually deployable services made it easier to apply Continuous Integration / Continuous DeploymentThere is no difference. The size or deployment approach used is not specified with SOA. Micros-services are a type of SOA pattern when certain normal architectural decisions are made. Decisions include the granularity of the service and the deployment / operational approach. People used to make these decisions in SOA before Martin Fowler created a new name for what used to be normal SOA architecture.  Indeed Sun in 2000 defined services as Autonomous in all aspects, and independently managed. So Micro services are not new, just a new marketing term to create new consulting revenue. Yes, the big software vendors with their over inflated products created the monolithic approach, which was never representative of SOA principles. Its like changing the name of a service to an API, its all about marketing.Quite frankly, after having spent over a decade writing service oriented architectures, I fail to see the real conceptual difference. The concept (and utility) of a service has always been, in my mind, atomic. It is by writing atomic services that you allow for "composition" of larger macro services, which then allows you to orchestrate them into some kind of business processes. There is nothing in the original SOA prescription that ever prevented one from writing services in different programming languages and allow their interaction through means of contractual interface. There is also nothing in the original SOA prescription that ever prevented one to deploy their services independent of each other. The choice of whether to deploy all services under one Tomcat process, or break them into individual Tomcat/Nginx processes and deploying them across different nodes in your cluster is just a matter of semantics. So fundamentally, I personally find no difference between SOA and microservices. Coining a new term does not make it an invention, frankly.Microservices, in short, can be thought of webservices running independently on a web server.\nSome of the key features are the following:So microservice is :The difference between SOA and Microservices is also dependent on your view of what SOA is. For some people, Microservices is the same as the SOA that they are already doing. Microservices is often seen as a sub set of the methods used by SOA.A helpfull overview about the differences is given by Martin Fowler here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgdBVIX9ifA
