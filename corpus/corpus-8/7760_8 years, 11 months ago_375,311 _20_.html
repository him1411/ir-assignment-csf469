I wrote a C# application for a client a couple of years ago, but I no longer have the source code.  All I have is the EXE that I deployed on the client\'s PC.  Is there a way I can generate C# source code from the EXE?Reflector and its add-in FileDisassembler.Reflector will allow to see the source code. FileDisassembler will allow you to convert it into a VS solution.When Red Gate said there would no longer be a free version of .Net Reflector, I started using ILSpy and Telerik\'s JustDecompile. I have found ILSpy to decompile more accurately than JustDecompile (which is still in Beta). Red Gate has changed their decision and still have a free version of .Net Reflector, but now I like ILSpy.From the ILSpy website (http://www.ilspy.net/):ILSpy is the open-source .NET assembly browser and decompiler. Update:April 15, 2012, ILSpy 2.0 was released. New features compared with version 1.0:Update:Reflector is no longer free in general, but they do offer it for free to open source developers:  http://reflectorblog.red-gate.com/2013/07/open-source/But a few companies like DevExtras and JetBrains have created free alternatives:DevExtras CodeReflectJetBrains DotPeekReflector and the File Disassembler add-in from Denis Bauer.  It actually produces source projects from assemblies, where Reflector on its own only displays the disassembled source.ADDED: My latest favourite is JetBrains\' dotPeek.Telerik JustDecompile is free and has a feature to create projects from .NET assemblies.I\'m surprised no one has mentioned Microsoft\'s ildasm. It may not be as pretty as ILSpy or Reflector, but it comes with Visual Studio so many developers already have it.To run it (assuming VS 2013, should be similar for other versions):Now you can navigate the DLL structure. Double-click on class members to see the IL. Use File > Dump to export IL to a file.You want reflector.
