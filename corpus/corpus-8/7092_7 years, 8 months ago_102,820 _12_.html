Is there a way to expand a Python tuple into a function - as actual parameters?For example, here expand() does the magic:I know one could define myfun as myfun((a, b, c)), but of course there may be legacy code.\nThanksmyfun(*tuple) does exactly what you request.Side issue: don\'t use as your identifiers builtin type names such as tuple, list, file, set, and so forth -- it\'s horrible practice and it will come back and byte you when you least expect it,\nso just get into the habit of actively avoiding hiding builtin names with your own identifiers.Note that you can also expand part of argument list:Take a look at the Python tutorial section 4.7.3 and 4.7.4.\nIt talks about passing tuples os arguments.I would also consider using named parameters (and passing a dictionary) over a tuple and passing a sequence. I find the use of positional arguments to be a bad practice when the positions are not intuitive or there are multiple parameters. This is the functional programming method. It lifts the tuple expansion feature out of syntax sugar:apply_tuple = lambda f, t: f(*t)Example usage:curry redefiniton of apply_tuple saves a lot of partial calls in the long run.
