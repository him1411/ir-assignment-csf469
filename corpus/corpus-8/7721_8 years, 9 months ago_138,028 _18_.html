How can I get the filename from a file path in Ruby?For example if I have a path of "C:\\projects\\blah.dll" and I just want the "blah".Is there a LastIndexOf method in Ruby?I haven\'t been a Windows user in a long time, but the Pathname rdoc says it has no issues with directory-name separators on Windows.Try File.basenameReturns the last component of the filename given in file_name, which must be formed using forward slashes (``/\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99) regardless of the separator used on the local file system. If suffix is given and present at the end of file_name, it is removed. In your case:In case the extension is not known (it needs the / separator):Jonathan Lonowski answered perfectly, but there is something that none of the answers mentioned here. Instead of File::extname, you can directly use a \'.*\' to get the file name.But, if you want to get the base file name of any specific extension files, then you need to use File::extname, otherwise not.Jonathon\'s answer is better, but to let you know somelist[-1] is one of the LastIndexOf notations available. As krusty.ar mentioned somelist.last apparently is too.Try this codeUse extnameNote that double quotes strings escape \\\'s.If you have access to ENV variables, scan combined with this little regex (which finds the last but one word, a dot, then the last word of the string) will put the file\'s name into \'filename\':Obviously, you can use scan and the regex on any path name that includes the filename, and __FILE__ is the obvious choice:You can get directory path to current script with:
