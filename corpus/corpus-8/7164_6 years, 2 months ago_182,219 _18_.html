Just upgraded my computer to Mac OS X Lion and went to terminal and typed "make" but it says:\n-bash: make: command not foundWhere did the "make" command go?Have you installed Xcode and the developer tools? I think make, along with gcc and friends, is installed with that and not before. Xcode 4.1 for Lion is free.You need to install Xcode from App Store.Then start Xcode, go to Xcode->Preferences->Downloads and install component named "Command Line Tools".\nAfter that all the relevant tools will be placed in /usr/bin folder and you will be able to use it just as it was in 10.6.It appears you can install the command line tools without getting Xcode from Downloads for Apple Developers.  It required me to login with my apple account.Alternatively, once you install Xcode from the app store, you might notice the command line tools are not installed by default.  Open Xcode, go to preferences, click to the "downloads" tab, and from there you can download and install command line tools.Xcode 4.3.2 didn\'t install "Command Line Tools" by default.  I had to open Xcode Preferences / Downloads / Components Tab.  It had a list of optional components with an "Install" button beside each.  This includes "Command Line Tools" and components to support developing for older versions of iOS.Now "make" is available and you can check by opening terminal and typing:make -vThe result should look like:GNU Make 3.81You may need "make" even if you don\'t need Xcode, such as a Perl developer installing Perl Modules using cpan -i on the commandline.Xcode 5.1 no longer provides command line tools in the Preferences section. You now go to https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action, and select the command line tools version for your OS X release. The installer puts them in /usr/bin.If you installed xcode and upgraded to mountain lion, or you don\'t have the latest command line tools installed, or you have zsh or other shells, you can shortcut to some of the embedded tools in the developer directory with:After upgrading to Mountain Lion using the NDK, I had the following error:Cannot find \'make\' program. Please install Cygwin make package or define the GNUMAKE variable to point to itError was fixed by downloading and using the latest NDKIf you need only make and friends. Try installing the command-line-tools provided by Apple. (Assuming you are not doing any iOS development.)there are specific builds of command line tools for different major OSX versions available from the Downloads for Apple Developers site. Be sure to get the latest release of the version for your OS.
