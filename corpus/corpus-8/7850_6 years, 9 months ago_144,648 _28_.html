I have a simple mysql table:I tried to run following update, but I get only the error 1093:  I searched for the error and found from mysql following page http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/subquery-restrictions.html, but it doesn\'t help me.What shall I do to correct the sql query?The problem is that MySQL, for whatever inane reason, doesn\'t allow you to write queries like this:That is, if you\'re doing an UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE on a table, you can\'t reference that table in an inner query (you can however reference a field from that outer table...)The solution is to replace the instance of myTable in the sub-query with (SELECT * FROM myTable), like thisThis apparently causes the necessary fields to be implicitly copied into a temporary table, so it\'s allowed.I found this solution here.  A note from that article:You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to just SELECT * FROM table in the subquery in real life; I just wanted to keep the examples simple. In reality, you should only be selecting the columns you need in that innermost query, and adding a good WHERE clause to limit the results, too.You can make this in three steps:...orMake a temporary table (tempP) from a subqueryI\'ve introduced a separate name (alias) and give a new name to \'persID\' column for temporary tableIn Mysql, you can not update one table by subquery the same table.You can separate the query in two parts, or doIt\'s quite simple. For example, instead of writing:you should writeor similar.The Approach posted by BlueRaja is slow I modified it as \nI was using to delete duplicates from the table. In case it helps anyone with large tables\nOriginal QueryThis is taking more time:Faster SolutionIf you are trying to read fieldA from tableA and save it on fieldB on the same table, when fieldc = fieldd you might want consider this.Above code copies the value from fieldA to fieldB when condition-field met your condition. this also works in ADO (e.g access )source: tried myselfJust as reference, you can also use Mysql Variables to save temporary results, e.g.:https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/user-variables.html
