It seems to be obvious, but I found myself a bit confused about when to use curly braces for importing a single module in ES6. For example, in the React-Native project I am working on, I have the following file and its content:initialState.js:In the TodoReducer.js, I have to import it without curly braces:If I enclose the initialState in curly braces, I get the following error for the following line of code:Cannot read property todo of undefinedTodoReducer.js:Similar errors also happen to my components with the curly braces. I was wondering when I should use curly braces for a single import, because obviously, when importing multiple component/modules, you have to enclose them in curly braces, which I know.Edit:The SO post at here does not answer my question, instead I am asking when I should or should not use curly braces for importing a single module, or I should never use curly braces for importing a single module in ES6 (this is apparently not the case, as I have seen single import with curly braces required)This is a default import:It only works if A has the default export:In this case it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what name you assign to it when importing:Because it will always resolve to whatever is the default export of A.This is a named import called A:It only works if A contains a named export called A:In this case the name matters because you\xe2\x80\x99re importing a specific thing by its export name:To make these work, you would add a corresponding named export to A:A module can only have one default export, but as many named exports as you\'d like (zero, one, two, or many). You can import them all together:Here, we import the default export as A, and named exports called myA and Something, respectively.We can also assign them all different names when importing:The default exports tend to be used for whatever you normally expect to get from the module. The named exports tend to be used for utilities that might be handy, but aren\xe2\x80\x99t always necessary. However it is up to you to choose how to export things: for example, a module might have no default export at all.This is a great guide to ES modules, explaining the difference between default and named exports.TL;DR: Curly braces are used if you would like to import a non-default export.See Dan Abramovs answer above for more details.Dan Abramov answer above explains about the default exports and named exports.Which to use?Quoting David Herman: ECMAScript 6 favors the single/default export style, and gives the sweetest syntax to importing the default. Importing named exports can and even should be slightly less concise. However in TypeScript named export is favored because of refactoring. Example, if you default export a class and rename it, the class name will change only in that file and not in the other references, with named exports class name will be renamed in all the references. \nNamed exports is also preferred for utilities. Overall use whatever you prefer.AdditionalDefault export is actually a named export with name default, so default export can be imported as:I would say there is also a starred notation for the import ES6 keyword worth to mention.If you try to console log Mix:You will get:When should I use curly braces for ES6 import?The brackets are golden when you need only specific components from the module, which makes smaller footprints for bundlers like webpack.If you think of import as just syntax sugar for node modules, objects, and destructuring, I find it\'s pretty intuitive.
