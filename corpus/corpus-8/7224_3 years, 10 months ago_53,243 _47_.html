I had the OwinStartup configuration code working perfectly and then it stopped working.  Unfortunately I\'m not sure exactly what I did to get it to stop working and am having a really hard time figuring it out.  To make sure I have the basics covered, I doubled checked to make sure the I have the attribute assigned properly and made sure that I don\'t have an appSetting for owin:AutomaticAppStartup that is set to false so I made one set to true to be safe as there was nothing there before.I also tried specifically calling out the appSetting:Before it stopped working I upgraded the Microsoft.Owin.Security NuGet packages to 2.0.2, so I tried reverting them to 2.0.1 (that was a pain) but it didn\'t change anything.  I have WebActivator installed on the project and am using that to bootstrap other things but I\'ve tested that on a fresh WebApplication template and it works there so I don\'t think that is the culprit.I also tried removing my Startup class and using Visual Studio to add a new one using the OWIN Startup Class type in Add New Item and that isn\'t getting called either.  Next I tried adding a second Startup class since I know it will throw an exception if there is more than one OwinStartup attributes defined, but it isn\'t throwing any exception there.Not sure what else to try.  Any thoughts?UpdateTurns out that Resharper removed the reference to Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb when I used it to remove unused references.Make sure you have installed Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb package in the project. This package is needed for startup detection in IIS hosted applications. For more information you can refer to this article. Alternative answer to the original problem discussed - Owin "not firing."  In my case I spent hours thinking it wasn\'t firing due to being unable to set a breakpoint in it.When debugging OWIN startup in visual studioIIS Express - Running "F5" will break on the OWIN startup codeIIS - Running "F5" will not break until after OWIN (and global.asax) code is loaded.  If you attach to W3P.exe you will be able to step into it.I realize you already mentioned this but it\'s an important thing to check and sometimes people (like me) don\'t read the whole question but just jump to the answers...\n\'\nFor people who upgraded from an older MVC version - make sure you don\'t havein your web.config that you didn\'t even know about. It will suppress calling the startupInstead change it to trueSomewhere along the line - when I upgraded to MVC 5 this got added (actually almost ironically it was a year ago tomorrow) and I never even knew what owin was until today when I tried to use it.If you are having trouble debugging the code in the Startup class, I have also had this problem - or I thought I did. The code was firing but I believe it happens before the debugger has attached so you cannot set breakpoints on the code and see what is happening.You can prove this by throwing an exception in the Configuration method of the Startup class.I had a similar issue to this and clearing Temporary ASP.NET Files fixed it. Hope this helps someone.I had the same problem. Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb package was installed but during the installation NuGet was not able to add the dll as a reference for some reason. Make sure your project has that reference. If not you can try to reinstall:I had an error like below on reinstall but somehow it worked:System call failed. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80010100\n  (RPC_E_SYS_CALL_FAILED))DEBUGGING TIPSIf debugging does not work try using IIS Express or try the method below for local IISUsing local IIS For some reason this method enables debugging of this method:Extra tipMaybe doing this will flush a cache:In web.config add the optimizeCompilations attribute with a false value<compilation debug="true" ... optimizeCompilations="false"> Run siteIn my case, the IIS application pool was not set to v4. It was v2.Changed the AppPool to v4 and everything was okay.In my case, my website\'s output path is changed by somebody, the IIS Express even not load OWIN, and the setup class will not be hit of course.  After I set the output path as "bin\\", it works well.I had same problem when I added Owin to an existing web project. I eventually found the problem was due to the following in the web.config file.The remove assembly="*" was causing the problem. When I remove this line the Owin startup code ran. \nI eventually change it to the following and it worked perfectlyI messed around with a lot of the suggestions on this post.I had the following but still could not land on a break point. Throwing an exception proved the code was being entered.Finally out of desperation I looked at project->properties, and then under the WEB section I also checked the NATIVE CODE checkbox (ASP.NET should be already checked).That finally fixed it for me.Note : I am using Visual Studio 2017 Professional.In my  case this Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb package is present in the project.But below two tags are not present in web.config.after adding them it works smoothly.First add the OWIN Auth Class and then enable OWIN:AutomaticAppStartup key in your web.config like \nNow it will fire
