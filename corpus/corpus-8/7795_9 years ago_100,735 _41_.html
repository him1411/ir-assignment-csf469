At work we use WiX for building installation packages. We want that installation of product X would result in uninstall of the previous version of that product on that machine.I\'ve read on several places on the Internet about a major upgrade but couldn\'t get it to work.\nCan anyone please specify the exact steps that I need to take to add uninstall previous version feature to WiX?In the newest versions (from the 3.5.1315.0 beta), you can use the MajorUpgrade element instead of using your own.For example, we use this code to do automatic upgrades. It prevents downgrades, giving a localised error message, and also prevents upgrading an already existing identical version (i.e. only lower versions are upgraded):Finally I found a solution - I\'m posting it here for other people who might have the same problem (all 5 of you):Under product add The following:Under InstallExecuteSequence add:From now on whenever I install the product it removed previous installed versions.Note: replace upgrade Id with your own GUIDThe following is the sort of syntax I use for major upgrades:As @Brian Gillespie noted there are other places to schedule the RemoveExistingProducts depending on desired optimizations. Note the PUT-GUID-HERE must be identical.The Upgrade element inside the Product element, combined with proper scheduling of the  action will perform the uninstall you\'re after. Be sure to list the upgrade codes of all the products you want to remove.Note that, if you\'re careful with your builds, you can prevent people from accidentally installing an older version of your product over a newer one. That\'s what the Maximum field is for. When we build installers, we set UpgradeVersion Maximum to the version being built, but IncludeMaximum="no" to prevent this scenario.You have choices regarding the scheduling of RemoveExistingProducts. I prefer scheduling it after InstallFinalize (rather than after InstallInitialize as others have recommended):This leaves the previous version of the product installed until after the new files and registry keys are copied. This lets me migrate data from the old version to the new (for example, you\'ve switched storage of user preferences from the registry to an XML file, but you want to be polite and migrate their settings). This migration is done in a deferred custom action just before InstallFinalize.Another benefit is efficiency: if there are unchanged files, Windows Installer doesn\'t bother copying them again when you schedule after InstallFinalize. If you schedule after InstallInitialize, the previous version is completely removed first, and then the new version is installed. This results in unnecessary deletion and recopying of files.For other scheduling options, see the RemoveExistingProducts help topic in MSDN. This week, the link is: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa371197.aspxYou might be better asking this on the WiX-users mailing list.WiX is best used with a firm understanding of what Windows Installer is doing. You might consider getting "The Definitive Guide to Windows Installer".The action that removes an existing product is the RemoveExistingProducts action. Because the consequences of what it does depends on where it\'s scheduled - namely, whether a failure causes the old product to be reinstalled, and whether unchanged files are copied again - you have to schedule it yourself.RemoveExistingProducts processes <Upgrade> elements in the current installation, matching the @Id attribute to the UpgradeCode (specified in the <Product> element) of all the installed products on the system. The UpgradeCode defines a family of related products. Any products which have this UpgradeCode, whose versions fall into the range specified, and where the UpgradeVersion/@OnlyDetect attribute is no (or is omitted), will be removed.The documentation for RemoveExistingProducts mentions setting the UPGRADINGPRODUCTCODE property. It means that the uninstall process for the product being removed receives that property, whose value is the Product/@Id for the product being installed.If your original installation did not include an UpgradeCode, you will not be able to use this feature.I used this site to help me understand the basics about WiX Upgrade:http://wix.tramontana.co.hu/tutorial/upgrades-and-modularizationAfterwards I created a sample Installer, (installed a test file), then created the Upgrade installer (installed 2 sample test files). This will give you a basic understanding of how the mechanism works.And as Mike said in the book from Apress, "The Definitive Guide to Windows Installer", it will help you out to understand, but it is not written using WiX.Another site that was pretty helpful was this one:http://www.wixwiki.com/index.php?title=Main_PageI read the WiX documentation, downloaded examples, but I still had plenty of problems with upgrades. Minor upgrades don\'t execute uninstall of the previous products despite of possibility to specify those uninstall. I spent more that a day for investigations and found that WiX 3.5 intoduced a new tag for upgrades. Here is the usage:But the main reason of problems was that documentation says to use the "REINSTALL=ALL REINSTALLMODE=vomus" parameters for minor and small upgrades, but it doesn\'t say that those parameters are FORBIDDEN for major upgrades - they simply stop working. So you shouldn\'t use them with major upgrades.I would suggest having a look at Alex Shevchuk\'s tutorial. He explains "major upgrade" through WiX with a good hands-on example at From MSI to WiX, Part 8 - Major Upgrade.One important thing I missed from the tutorials for a while (stolen from http://www.tramontana.co.hu/wix/lesson4.php) which resulted in the "Another version of this product is already installed" errors:*Small updates mean small changes to one or a few files where the change doesn\'t warrant changing the product version (major.minor.build). You don\'t have to change the Product GUID, either. Note that you always have to change the Package GUID when you create a new .msi file that is different from the previous ones in any respect. The Installer keeps track of your installed programs and finds them when the user wants to change or remove the installation using these GUIDs. Using the same GUID for different packages will confuse the Installer. Minor upgrades denote changes where the product version will already change. Modify the Version attribute of the Product tag. The product will remain the same, so you don\'t need to change the Product GUID but, of course, get a new Package GUID. Major upgrades denote significant changes like going from one full version to another. Change everything: Version attribute, Product and Package GUIDs.I\'m using the latest version of WiX (3.0) and couldn\'t get the above working. But this did work:Note that PUT-GUID-HERE should be the same as the GUID that you have defined in the UpgradeCode property of the Product. Below worked for me. Please make sure that the UpgradeCode in Product is matching to Id in Upgrade.  This is what worked for me, even with major DOWN grade:
