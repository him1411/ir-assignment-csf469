This question already has an answer here:Im using Mac only at work and I need to set JAVA_HOME to proper path of JDK. I downloaded JDK, installed it and now I can\'t find it anywhere. I was looking at the internet for the solution, but there is no folder Libraries/Java.The location has changed from Java 6 (provided by Apple) to Java 7 and onwards (provided by Oracle). The best generic way to find this out is to runThis is the natively supported way to find out both the path to the default Java installation as well as all alternative ones present. If you check out its help text (java_home -h), you\'ll see that you can use this command to reliably start a Java program on OS X (java_home --exec ...), with the ability to explicitly specify the desired Java version and architecture, or even request the user to install it if missing.A more pedestrian approach, but one which will help you trace specifically which Java installation the command java resolves into, goes like this:runif that gives you something like /usr/bin/java, which is a symbolic link to the real location, runOn my system, this outputsand therefrom you can read the Java home directory;if usr/bin/java points to another symbolic link, recursively apply the same approach withAn important variation is the setup you get if you start by installing Apple\'s Java and later install Oracle\'s. In that case Step 2 above will give youand that particular java binary is a stub which will resolve the actual java command to call by consulting the JAVA_HOME environment variable and, if it\'s not set or doesn\'t point to a Java home directory, will fall back to calling java_home. It is important to have this in mind when debugging your setup.Which Mac version are you using? try these paths This link might help - How To Set $JAVA_HOME Environment Variable On Mac OS XHave a look and see if the the JDK is at:Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/\nOr\n/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/Check this earlier SO post:\nJDK on OSX 10.7 LionOn my Mac:btw, did you tried which java?/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Also see Java 7 path on mountain lion
