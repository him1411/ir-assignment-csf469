I\'ve got a load of checkboxes that are by default checked.  My users will probably uncheck a few of the checkboxes (if any) and leave the rest of them checked.  Is there any way to get the checkboxes that are NOT checked in a form post, rather than the ones that are checked?Add a hidden input for the checkbox with a different ID:Before submitting the form, disable the hidden input based on the checked condition:The solution I liked the most so far is to put a hidden input with the same name as the checkbox that might not be checked. I think it works so that if the checkbox isn\'t checked, the hidden input is still successful and sent to the server but if the checkbox is checked it will override the hidden input before it. This way you don\'t have to keep track of which values in the posted data were expected to come from checkboxes.A common technique around this is to carry a hidden variable along with each checkbox. On the server side, we first detect list of hidden variables and for each of the hidden variable, we try to see if the corresponding checkbox entry is submitted in the form data or not. The server side algorithm would probably look like:The above doesn\'t exactly answer the question, but provides an alternate means of achieving similar functionality. My personal favorite is to add a hidden field with the same name that will be used if the check-box is unchecked. But the solution is not as easy as it may seems.If you add this code:The browser will not really care about what you do here. The browser will send both parameters to the server, and the server has to decide what to do with them.PHP for example takes the last value as the one to use (see: Authoritative position of duplicate HTTP GET query keys)But other systems I worked with (based on Java) do it the way around - they offer you only the first value.\n.NET instead will give you an array with both elements insteadI\'ll try to test this with node.js, Python and Perl at sometime.I solved it by using simple (native) javascript:Be careful not to have any spaces or linebreaks between this two input elements!You can use this.previousSibling.previousSibling to get "upper" elements.With PHP you can check the named hidden field for 0 (not set) or 1 (set).you don\'t need to create a hidden field for all checkboxes just copy my code.\nit will change the value of checkbox if not checked the value will assign 0 and if checkbox checked then assign value into 1 You can do some Javascript in the form\'s submit event. That\'s all you can do though, there\'s no way to get browsers to do this by themselves. It also means your form will break for users without Javascript.\nBetter is to know on the server which checkboxes there are, so you can deduce that those absent from the posted form values ($_POST in PHP) are unchecked.I would actually do the following.Have my hidden input field with the same name with the checkbox inputand then when i post I first of all remove the duplicate values picked up in the $_POST array, atfer that display each of the unique values.I got this from a post remove duplicate values from array\n        \n        \n    If you leave out the name of the checkbox it doesn\'t get passed. \nOnly the test_checkbox array."I\'ve gone with the server approach. Seems to work fine - thanks. \xe2\x80\x93 reach4thelasers Dec 1 \'09 at 15:19" I would like to recommend it from the owner. As quoted: javascript solution depends on how the server handler (I didn\'t check it)such as I\'ve tried Sam\'s version first.\nGood idea, but it causes there to be multiple elements in the form with the same name. If you use any javascript that finds elements based on name, it will now return an array of elements.I\'ve worked out Shailesh\'s idea in PHP, it works for me.\nHere\'s my code:You can also intercept the form.submit event and reverse check before submitMost of the answers here require the use of JavaScript or duplicate input controls. Sometimes this needs to be handled entirely on the server-side.I believe the (intended) key to solving this common problem is the form\'s submission input control.To interpret and handle unchecked values for checkboxes successfully you need to have knowledge of the following:By checking whether the form was submitted (a value is assigned to the submission input element), any unchecked checkbox values can be assumed.For example:When using PHP, it\'s fairly trivial to detect which checkboxes were ticked.Initial data could be loaded on each page load, but should be only modified if the form was submitted. Since the names of the checkboxes are known beforehand, they can be traversed and inspected individually, so that the the absence of their individual values indicates that they are not checked.I use this block of jQuery, which will add a hidden input at submit-time to every unchecked checkbox. It will guarantee you always get a value submitted for every checkbox, every time, without cluttering up your markup and risking forgetting to do it on a checkbox you add later. It\'s also agnostic to whatever backend stack (PHP, Ruby, etc.) you\'re using.I see this question is old and has so many answers, but I\'ll give my penny anyway.\nMy vote is for the javascript solution on the form\'s \'submit\' event, as some has pointed out. No doubling the inputs (especially if you have long names and attributes with php code mixed with html), no server side bother (that would require to know all field names and to check them down one by one), just fetch all the unchecked items, assign them a 0 value (or whatever you need to indicate a \'not checked\' status) and then change their attribute \'checked\' to truethis way you will have a $_POST array like this:What I did was a bit different. First I changed the values of all the unchecked checkboxes. To "0", then selected them all, so the value would be submitted.I would prefer collate the $_POSTit minds, if the POST doesn\'t have have the \'checkboxname\'value, it was unckecked so, asign a value.you can create an array of your ckeckbox values and create a function that check if values exist, if doesn`t, it minds that are unchecked and you can asign a valueThis can solely be accomplished with some javascript, as unchecked checkboxes don\'t get transmitted. So you need javascript that e.g. behind the scenes adds hidden fields on unchecking a checkbox. Without javascript this could not be done.Example on Ajax actions is(\':checked\') used jQuery instead of .val();params will get value in TRUE OR FALSE..Checkboxes usually represent binary data that are stored in database as Yes/No, Y/N or 1/0 values. HTML checkboxes do have bad nature to send value to server only if checkbox is checked! That means that server script on other site must know in advance what are all possible checkboxes on web page in order to be able to store positive (checked) or negative (unchecked) values. Actually only negative values are problem (when user unchecks previously (pre)checked value - how can server know this when nothing is sent if it does not know in advance that this name should be sent). If you have a server side script which dynamically creates UPDATE script there\'s a problem because you don\'t know what all checkboxes should be received in order to set Y value for checked and N value for unchecked (not received) ones.Since I store values \'Y\' and \'N\' in my database and represent them via checked and unchecked checkboxes on page, I added hidden field for each value (checkbox) with \'Y\' and \'N\' values then use checkboxes just for visual representation, and use simple JavaScript function check() to set value of if according to selection.use one JavaScript onclick listener and call function check() for each checkboxe on my web page:This way \'Y\' or \'N\' values are always sent to server side script, it knows what are fields that should be updated and there\'s no need for conversion of checbox "on" value into \'Y\' or not received checkbox into \'N\'.NOTE: white space or new line is also a sibling so here I need .previousSibling.previousSibling.value. If there\'s no space between  then only .previousSibling.valueYou don\'t need to explicitly add onclick listener like before, you can use jQuery library to dynamically add click listener with function to change value to all checkboxes in your page:The problem with checkboxes is that if they are not checked then they are not posted with your form. If you check a checkbox and post a form you will get the value of the checkbox in the $_POST variable which you can use to process a form, if it\'s unchecked no value will be added to the $_POST variable.In PHP you would normally get around this problem by doing an isset() check on your checkbox element. If the element you are expecting isn\'t set in the $_POST variable then we know that the checkbox is not checked and the value can be false.But if you have created a dynamic form then you won\'t always know the name attribute of your checkboxes, if you don\'t know the name of the checkbox then you can\'t use the isset function to check if this has been sent with the $_POST variable.There is a better workaround.\nFirst of all  provide name attribute to only those checkboxes that are checked.\nThen on click submit, through a JavaScript function you check all unchecked boxes .\nSo when you submit only those will be retrieved in form collection those who have name property.Advantage:\nNo need to create extra hidden boxes,and manipulate them.@cpburnz got it right but to much code, here is the same idea using less code:  JS:\nHTML (note the field name using an array name):\nAnd for PHP:\njQuery version of @vishnu\'s answer.If you are using jQuery 1.5 or below please use the .attr() function instead of .prop()This solution is inspired by @desw\'s one.If your input names are in "form style", you will lose array index association with your chekbox values as soon as one chekbox is checked, incrementing this "dissociation" by one unit each time a chekbox is checked. This can be the case of a form for inserting something like employees composed by some fields, for instance:In case you insert three employees at once and the first and the second ones are single, you will end up with a 5-element isSingle array, so you won\'t be able to iterate at once through the three arrays in order to, for instance, insert employees in a database.You can overcome this with some easy array postprocessing. I\'m using PHP at the server side and I did this:So this solution is overkill for this question, but it helped me when I had the same checkbox that occurred many times for different rows in a table.  I needed to know the row the checkbox represented and also know the state of the checkbox (checked/unchecked).What I did was to take the name attribute off of my checkbox inputs, give them all the same class, and create a hidden input that would hold the JSON equivalent of the data.HTMLJavascript to run on form submitThe json string will get passed with the form as $_POST["has-permissions-values"].  In PHP, decode the string into an array and you will have an associative array that has each row and the true/false value for each corresponding checkbox.  It is then very easy to walk through and compare to current database values.All answers are great, but if you have multiple checkboxes in a form with the same name and you want to post the status of each checkbox. Then i have solved this problem by placing a hidden field with the checkbox (name related to what i want).then control the change status of checkbox by below jquery code:now on change of any checkbox, it will change the value of related hidden field. And on server you can look only to hidden fields instead of checkboxes.Hope this will help someone have this type of problem. cheer :)You can add hidden elements before submitting form.I prefer to stay with solutions that do not require javascript (and yes, I know there will be some that now categorize me as a luddite) but if you are like me, and you want to be able to display a default / initial setting for a checkbox and then have it hold or update based on the form being submitted, try this (built on a couple of ideas above):Set the variables determining the initial checkbox state and then use server checks to determine the display after each submit of the form.The example below creates an array of arrays (for use in WordPress ; works equally well elsewhere) and then determines the checkbox state using server script without using either hidden fields or javascript.
