Do querystring parameters get encrypted in HTTPS when sent with a request?Yes. The querystring is also encrypted with SSL. Nevertheless, as this article shows, it isn\'t a good idea to put sensitive information in the URL. For example:URLs are stored in web server logs -\n  typically the whole URL of each\n  request is stored in a server log.\n  This means that any sensitive data in\n  the URL (e.g. a password) is being\n  saved in clear text on the serverremember, SSL/TLS operates at the Transport Layer, so all the crypto goo happens under the application-layer HTTP stuff. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:IP_stack_connections.svgthat\'s the long way of saying, "Yes!"The entire transmission, including the query string, the whole URL, and even the type of request (GET, POST, etc.) is encrypted when using HTTPS.I disagree with the advice given here - even the reference for the accepted answer concludes:You can of course use query string parameters with HTTPS, but don\xe2\x80\x99t use them for anything \n  that could present a security problem. For example, you could safely use them to identity\n  part numbers or types of display like \xe2\x80\x98accountview\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98printpage\xe2\x80\x99, but don\xe2\x80\x99t use them for\n  passwords, credit card numbers or other pieces of information that should not be publicly\n  available.So, no they aren\'t really safe...!
