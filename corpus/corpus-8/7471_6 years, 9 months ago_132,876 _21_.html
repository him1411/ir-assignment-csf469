Would this be the best way to sort a hash and return Hash object (instead of Array):In Ruby 2.1 it is simple:Note: Ruby >= 1.9.2 has an order-preserving hash: the order keys are inserted will be the order they are enumerated.  The below applies to older versions or to backward-compatible code.There is no concept of a sorted hash. So no, what you\'re doing isn\'t right.If you want it sorted for display, return a string:or, if you want the keys in order:or, if you want to access the elements in order:but in summary, it makes no sense to talk about a sorted hash. From the docs, "The order in which you traverse a hash by either key or value may seem arbitrary, and will generally not be in the insertion order." So inserting keys in a specific order into the hash won\'t help.I\'ve always used sort_by. You need to wrap the #sort_by output with Hash[] to make it output a hash, otherwise it outputs an array of arrays. Alternatively, to accomplish this you can run the #to_h method on the array of tuples to convert them to a k=>v structure (hash).There is a similar question in "How to sort a Ruby Hash by number value?".No, it is not (Ruby 1.9.x)For big hashes difference will grow up to 10x and moreYou gave the best answer to yourself in the OP: Hash[h.sort] If you crave for more possibilities, here is in-place modification of the original hash to make it sorted:ActiveSupport::OrderedHash is another option if you don\'t want to use ruby 1.9.2 or roll your own workarounds.I had the same problem ( I had to sort my equipments by their name ) and i solved like this:@equipments is a hash that I build on my model and return on my controller. If you call .sort it will sort the hash based on it\'s key value.I liked the solution in the earlier post.I made a mini-class, called it class AlphabeticalHash. It also has a method called ap, which accepts one argument, a Hash, as input: ap variable. Akin to pp (pp variable)But it will (try and) print in alphabetical list (its keys). Dunno if anyone else wants to use this, it\'s available as a gem, you can install it as such: gem install alphabetical_hashFor me, this is simple enough. If others need more functionality, let\nme know, I\'ll include it into the gem.EDIT: Credit goes to Peter, who gave me the idea. :)
