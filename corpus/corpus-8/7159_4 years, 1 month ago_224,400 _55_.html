Given the following code:I want to get the raw SQL query string that the query builder above will generate, so in this example it would be SELECT * FROM users.How do I do this?To output to the screen the last queries ran you can use thisI believe the most recent queries will be at the bottom of the array.You will have something like that:As per Joshua\'s comment below, this is turned off by default now. To use, you\'ll need to enable it manually using:Use the toSql() method on a QueryBuilder instance.DB::table(\'users\')->toSql() would return:select * from `users`This is easier than wiring up an event listener, and also lets you check what the query will actually look like at any point while you\'re building it.You can listen to the \'illuminate.query\' event. Before the query add the following event listener:This will print out something like:If you are trying to get the Log using Illuminate without Laravel use:You could also nock up a quick function like so:EDITupdated versions seem to have query logging disabled by default (the above returns an empty array). To turn back on, when initialising the Capsule Manager, grab an instance of the connection and call the enableQueryLog methodEDIT AGAINTaking the actual question into consideration, you could actually do the following to convert the current single query instead of all previous queries:There is a method in eloquent for getting query string. toSql()in our case,returnis the exact solution that return the SQL query string..Hope this helpful...If you use laravel 5.1 and MySQL you can use this function made by me:As an input parameter you can use either of theseIlluminate\\Database\\Eloquent\\BuilderIlluminate\\Database\\Eloquent\\Relations\\HasManyIlluminate\\Database\\Query\\BuilderDB::QueryLog() only work after you execute the query $builder->get(). if you willing to get the query before execute the query you can use $builder->toSql() method. this is the example how to get the sql and bind it:Simply you can do following stuff using toSql() method,If it\'s not working you can set-up the thing from laravel documentation.Another way to do it isDB::getQueryLog()but if it\'s returns an empty array then by default it\'s disabled visit this,just enable with DB::enableQueryLog() and it will work :)for more info visit Github Issue to know more about it.Hope it helps :)This is the function, I placed in my base model class. Simply pass the query builder object into it and the SQL string will be returned.If you are not using Laravel but using Eloquent package then:\nyou can use clockworkClockwork is a Chrome extension for PHP development, extending Developer Tools with a new panel providing all kinds of information useful for debugging and profiling your PHP applications, including information about request, headers, get and post data, cookies, session data, database queries, routes, visualisation of application runtime and more.but works also in firefoxYou can use this package for get all the queries which are executing when you load your pageI\'ve created some simple functions to get the SQL and bindings from some queries.Usage:Here is the solution I use: Please, read the comments in the code. I know, it is not perfect but for my everyday debugging it is OK. It tries to build the bound query with more-or-less reliability. However, don\'t trust it completely, the database engines escape the values differently which this short function does not implement. So, take the result carefully.composer require "barryvdh/laravel-debugbar": "2.3.*"you\'ll see\nFrom laravel 5.2 and onward. you can use DB::listen to get executed queries.Or if you want to debug a single Builder instance then you can use toSql method.For laravel 5.5.XIf you would like to receive each SQL query executed by your application, you may use the listen method. This method is useful for logging queries or debugging. You may register your query listener in a service provider:Source
