Recently I have seen files with .js.map extension shipped with some JavaScript libraries (like Angular), and that just raised few questions in my head:The .map files are for js and css files that have been minified. They are called SourceMaps. When you minify a file, like the angular.js file, it takes thousands of lines of pretty code and turns it into only a few lines of ugly code. Hopefully, when you are shipping your code to production, you are using the minified code instead of the full, unminified version. When your app is in production, and has an error, the sourcemap will help take your ugly file, and will allow you to see the original version of the code. If you didn\'t have the sourcemap, then any error would seem cryptic at best. Same for CSS files. Once you take a SASS or LESS file and compile it to CSS, it looks nothing like it\'s original form. If you enable sourcemaps, then you can see the original state of the file, instead of the modified state. So, to answer you questions in order:I hope this makes sense. Just wanted to focus on the last part of the question; How source map files are created? by listing the build tools I know that can create source maps.I don\'t know if there are other tools that can create source maps.How can a developer use it?\nI didn\'t find answer for this in the comments, here is how can be used:When the min.js and js.map files are ready...The map file maps the unminified file to the minified file. If you make changes in the unminified file, the changes will be automatically reflected to the minified version of the file.Just to add to how to use map files. I use chrome for ubuntu and if I go to sources and click on a file, if there is a map file a message comes up telling me that I can view the original file and how to do it. For the Angular files that I worked with today I click Ctrl-P \n  and a list of original files comes up in a small window. I can then browse through the list to view the file that I would like to inspect and check where the issue might be.
