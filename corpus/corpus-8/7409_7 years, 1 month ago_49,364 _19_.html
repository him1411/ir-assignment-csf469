I want to convert a string to an object property value, whose name I have as a string. I am trying to do this like so:The problem is this is failing and throwing an Invalid Cast Exception when the property type is a nullable type.  This is not the case of the values being unable to be Converted - they will work if I do this manually (e.g. DateTime? d = Convert.ToDateTime(value);)  I\'ve seen some similiar questions but still can\'t get it to work.Untested, but maybe something like this will work:You have to get the underlying type in order to do that...Try this, I\'ve used it successfully with generics:I use it in a number of places in my code, one example is a helper method I use for converting database values in a typesafe manner:Called using:I wrote a series of blog posts including this at http://www.endswithsaurus.com/2010_07_01_archive.html (Scroll down to the Addendum, @JohnMacintyre actually spotted the bug in my original code which led me down the same path you\'re on now).  I have a couple of small modifications since that post that includes conversion of enum types also so if your property is an Enum you can still use the same method call.  Just add a line in to check for enum types and you\'re off to the races using something like:Normally you\'d have some error checking or use TryParse instead of Parse, but you get the picture.This is a little bit long-ish for an example, but this is a relatively robust approach, and separates the task of casting from unknown value to unknown typeI have a TryCast method that does something similar, and takes nullable types into account.Of course TryCast is a Method with a Type Parameter, so to call it dynamically you have to construct the MethodInfo yourself:Then to set the actual property value:And the extension methods to deal with property.CanAssignValue...I had a similar need, and the answer from LukeH pointed me in the direction. I came up with this generic function to make it easy.Usage is like this:Note the second parameter is just used as a prototype to show the function how to cast the return value, so it doesn\'t actually have to be the destination property. Meaning you can do also do something like this:I did it this way instead of using an out because you can\'t use out with properties. As is, it can work with properties and variables. You could also create an overload to pass the type instead if you wanted.Thanks @LukeH\nI changed a little:
