Is there a good way to do the following?I wrote a simple console app to upload and download files from an FTP server using the ftplib.Each time some data chunks are downloaded, I want to update a text progress bar, even if it\'s just a number.But I don\'t want to erase all the text that\'s been printed to the console. (Doing a "clear" and then printing the updated percentage.)Here\'s an aggregate of many of the answers below that I use regularly. Writing \'\\r\' will move the cursor back to the beginning of the line.This displays a percentage counter:Write a \\r to the console. That is a "carriage return" which causes all text after it to be echoed at the beginning of the line. Something like:which will give you something like: [ ########## ] 100%tqdm: add a progress meter to your loops in a second:It is less than 10 lines of code. The gist here: https://gist.github.com/vladignatyev/06860ec2040cb497f0f3Try the click library written by the Mozart of Python, Armin Ronacher.To create a simple progress bar:This is what it looks like:Customize to your hearts content:Custom look:There are even more options, see the API docs:I realize I\'m late to the game, but here\'s a slightly Yum-style (Red Hat) one I wrote (not going for 100% accuracy here, but if you\'re using a progress bar for that level of accuracy, then you\'re WRONG anyway):Should produce something looking like this:... where the brackets stay stationary and only the hashes increase.This might work better as a decorator. For another day...Check this library: clintit has a lot of features including a progress bar:  this link provides a quick overview of its featuresHere\'s a nice example of a progressbar written in Python: http://nadiana.com/animated-terminal-progress-bar-in-pythonBut if you want to write it yourself. You could use the curses module to make things easier :)[edit]\nPerhaps easier is not the word for curses. But if you want to create a full-blown cui than curses takes care of a lot of stuff for you.[edit]\nSince the old link is dead I have put up my own version of a Python Progressbar, get it here: https://github.com/WoLpH/python-progressbaroutput[ 29% ] ===================and, just to add to the pile, here\'s an object you can useresults in:This would most commonly be considered to be "over the top", but it\'s handy when you\'re using it a lotRun this at the Python command line (not in any IDE or development environment):Works fine on my Windows system.And a lot of tutorials waiting to be googled.I am using progress from reddit. I like it because it can print progress for every item in one line, and it shouldn\'t erase printouts from the program.Edit: fixed linkbased on the above answers and other similar questions about CLI progress bar, I think I got a general common answer to all of them. Check it at https://stackoverflow.com/a/15860757/2254146In summary, the code is this:Looks likePercent: [##########] 99.0%I recommend using tqdm - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tqdm - which makes it simple to turn any iterable or process into a progress bar, and handles all messing about with terminals needed.From the documentation: "tqdm can easily support callbacks/hooks and manual updates. Here\xe2\x80\x99s an example with urllib"NOTE: if you run this in interactive interepter you get extra numbers printed outlol i just wrote a whole thingy for this\nheres the code keep in mind you cant use unicode when doing block ascii i use cp437and you call it like soso it looks like thisWith the great advices above I work out the progress bar. However I would like to point out some shortcomings Every time the progress bar is flushed, it will start on a new line  like this:\n[] 0%\n[#]10%\n[##]20%\n[###]30%  2.The square bracket \']\' and the percent number on the right side shift right as the \'###\' get longer.\n3. An error will occur if the expression \'progress / 10\' can not return an integer.  And the following code will fix the problem above.  Code for python terminal progress barWell here is code that works and I tested it before posting:Pros:Cons:Here\'s my Python 3 solution:\'\\b\' is a backslash, for each character in your string.\nThis does not work within the Windows cmd window.function from Greenstick for 2.7:The python module progressbar is a nice choice.\nHere is my typical code:  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/progressbar2/3.30.2Progressbar2 is a good library for ascii base progressbar for the command line\n    import time\n    import progressbarhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/tqdmtqdm is a alternative of progressbar2 and i think it use in pip3 but i am not sure of thati wrote a simple progressbar:as you can see, it have: length of bar, prefix and suffix, filler, space, text in bar on 100%(oncomp) and bordershere an example:out in progress:out on complete:
