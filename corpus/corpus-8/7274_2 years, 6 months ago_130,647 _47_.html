What\'s the react way of setting focus on a particular text field after the component is rendered?Documentation seems to suggest using refs, e.g:Set ref="nameInput" on my input field in the render function, and then call:But where should I call this? I\'ve tried a few places but I cannot get it to work.You should do it in componentDidMount and refs callback instead. Something like this@Dhiraj\'s answer is correct, but for convenience you can use the autoFocus prop to have an input automatically focus when mounted.As of React 0.15, the most concise method is:If you just want to make autofocus in React, it\'s simple.While if you just want to know where to put that code, answer is in componentDidMount().v014.3In most cases, you can attach a ref to the DOM node and avoid using findDOMNode at all. Read the API documents here: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html#reactdom.finddomnodeThe React docs now have a section for this. https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/more-about-refs.html#the-ref-callback-attributeI just ran into this issue and I\'m using react 15.0.1 15.0.2 and I\'m using ES6 syntax and didn\'t quite get what I needed from the other answers since v.15 dropped weeks ago and some of the this.refs properties were deprecated and removed.In general, what I needed was:I\'m using:I used autoFocus={true} on the first <input /> on the page so that when the component mounts, it will get focus.This took longer and was more convoluted. I\'m keeping out code that isn\'t relevant to the solution for brevity.I need a global state to know if I should set the focus and to disable it when it was set, so I don\'t keep re-setting focus when the components re-render (I\'ll be using componentDidUpdate() to check for setting focus.)This could be designed as you see fit for you application.The component will need to have the resetfocus property set and a callBack to clear the property if it ends up setting focus on itself.Also note, I organized my Action Creators into separate files mostly due to my project is fairly large and I wanted to break them up into more manageable chunks.The general idea is that each form field that could have an error and be focused needs to check itself and if it needs to set focus on itself.There\'s business logic that needs to happen to determine if the given field is the right field to set focus to.  This isn\'t shown because it will depend on the individual application.When a form is submitted, that event needs to set the global focus flag resetFocus to true.  Then as each component updates itself, it will see that it should check to see if it gets the focus and if it does, dispatch the event to reset focus so other elements don\'t have to keep checking.edit \nAs a side note, I had my business logic in a "utilities" file and I just exported the method and called it within each shouldfocus() method.Cheers!This is not longer the best answer.   As of v0.13, this.refs may not available until AFTER componentDidMount() runs, in some odd cases.Just add the autoFocus tag to your input field, as FakeRainBrigand showed above.Ref. @Dave\'s comment on @Dhiraj\'s answer; an alternative is to use the callback functionality of the ref attribute on the element being rendered (after a component first renders):More infoThis is the proper way, how to autofocus. When you use callback instead of string as ref value, it is automaticly called. You got your ref awailable than without the need of touching the DOM using getDOMNodeYou can put that method call inside the render function. Or inside the life cycle method, componentDidUpdateWarning: ReactDOMComponent: Do not access .getDOMNode() of a DOM node; instead, use the node directly. This DOM node was rendered by App.Should be The simplest answer is add the ref="some name" in the input text element and call the below function.Note that none of these answers worked for me with a material-ui TextField component. Per How to set focus to a materialUI TextField? I had to jump through some hoops to get this to work:Updated version you can check hereYou don\'t need getInputDOMNode?? in this case... Just simply get the ref and focus it when component mounted -- componentDidMount...Can also be done in componentDidMount as it gets called just after component is rendered usingI have same problem but I have some animation too, so my colleague suggest to use window.requestAnimationFramethis is ref attribute of my element:Read almost all the answer but didnt see a getRenderedComponent().props.inputSet your text input refsthis.refs.username.getRenderedComponent().props.input.onChange(\'\');
