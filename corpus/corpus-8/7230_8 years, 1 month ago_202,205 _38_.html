How can I quickly determine what the root URL is for my ASP.NET MVC application?  I.e., if IIS is set to serve my application at http://example.com/foo/bar, then I\'d like to be able to get that URL in a reliable way that doesn\'t involve getting the current URL from the request and chopping it up in some fragile way that breaks if I re-route my action.The reason that I need the base URL is that this web application calls another one that needs the root to the caller web application for callback purposes.Assuming you have a Request object available, you can use:If it\'s not available, you can get to it via the context:So none of the ones listed here worked for me, but using a few of the answers, I got something working:Update for ASP.NET Core / MVC 6:ASP.NET Core makes this process a bit more painful, especially if you are deep in your code. You have 2 options to get at the HttpContext1) Pass it in from your controller:then in model:2) Perhaps the cleaner way is to inject it into your class, which starts with registering the types in your Startup:then have it injected for you like this:in either case, here is the updated for .NET Core GetBaseUrl():In Code:MVC3 Razor Syntax:Maybe it is extension or modification of the answers posted here but I use simply the following line and it works:When my path is: http://host/iis_foldername/controller/action\nthen I receive : http://host/iis_foldername/The trick with relying upon IIS is that IIS bindings can be different from your public URLs (WCF I\'m looking at you), especially with multi-homed production machines. I tend to vector toward using configuration to explicitly define the "base" url for external purposes as that tends to be a bit more successful than extracting it from the Request object.The following snippet works nicely for me in MVC4, and doesn\'t need an HttpContext available:For an absolute base URL use this. Works with both HTTP and HTTPS.This is a conversion of an asp.net property to MVC . It\'s a pretty much all singing all dancing get root url method.Declare a helper class:Usage:To use from a controller:To use in a view:In MVC _Layout.cshtml:Thats what we use!This works fine for me (also with a load balancer):Especially if you are using non-standard port numbers, using Request.Url.Authority appears like a good lead at first, but fails in a LB environment.You could have a static method that looks at HttpContext.Current and decides which URL to use (development or live server) depending on the host ID. HttpContext might even offer some easier way to do it, but this is the first option I found and it works fine. You can use the following script in view:For ASP.NET MVC 4 it is a bit different:This is working in ASP .NET MVC 4\n In any controller action you can write:\n1stline gets the whole url+Query String.\n2nd line remove local path & query ,last \'/\' symbol.\n3rd line add \'/\' symbol at last position.in simple html and ASP.NET or ASP.NET MVC if you are using  tag:For MVC 4:Maybe it is a better solution.usingFor url with aplication alias like http://example.com/appAlias/... You can try this:I put this in the head of my _Layout.cshtml
