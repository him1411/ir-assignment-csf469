This question already has an answer here:Why second line of this code in Java throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?While below works:I use Java 7.You need to escape the dot if you want to split on a literal dot:Otherwise you are splitting on the regex ., which means "any character".\nNote the double backslash needed to create a single backslash in the regex.You\'re getting an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException because your input string is just a dot, ie ".", which is an edge case that produces an empty array when split on dot; split(regex) removes all trailing blanks from the result, but since splitting a dot on a dot leaves only two blanks, after trailing blanks are removed you\'re left with an empty array.To avoid getting an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException for this edge case, use the overloaded version of split(regex, limit), which has a second parameter that is the size limit for the resulting array. When limit is negative, the behaviour of removing trailing blanks from the resulting array is disabled:ie, when filename is just a dot ".", calling filename.split("\\\\.", -1)[0] will return a blank, but calling filename.split("\\\\.")[0] will throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.This is because . is a reserved character in regular expression, representing any character.\nInstead, we should use the following statement:"." is a special character in java, so you have to use "\\\\." to escape this character:I hope this helpsI believe you should escape the dot. Try:Otherwise dot is interpreted as any character in regular expressions.
