As far as I know, using & after the command is for running it in the background.Example of & usage: tar -czf file.tar.gz dirname &But how about &&? (look at this example: https://serverfault.com/questions/215179/centos-100-disk-full-how-to-remove-log-files-history-etc#answer-215188)&& lets you do something based on whether the previous command completed successfully - that\'s why you tend to see it chained as do_something && do_something_else_that_depended_on_something. Furthermore, you also have || which is the logical or, and also ; which is just a separator which doesn\'t care what happend to the command before.Some details about this can be found here Lists of Commands in the Bash Manual.On the command line, when you see the typical intent is to execute the command that follows the && only if the first command is successful. This is idiomatic of Posix shells, and not only found in Bash.It prevents the running of the second process if the first fails.Programs return a signal on exiting. They should return 0 if they exit successfully, or greater than zero if they do not. This allows a limited amount of communication between processes.The && is referred to as AND_IF in the posix shell grammar, which is part of an and_or list of commands, which also include the || which is an OR_IF with similar semantics. Both operators have equal precedence and are evaluated left to right (they are left associative) For example, the following:both echo only bar. In the first case, the false is a command that exits with the status of 1which means echo foo does not run (i.e., shortcircuiting echo foo). Then the command echo bar is executed.In the second case, true exits with a code of 0 and therefore echo foo is not executed, then echo bar is executed.A quite common usage for \'&&\' is compiling software with autotools.  For example:Basically if the configure succeeds, make is run to compile, and if that succeeds, make is run as root to install the program.  I use this when I am mostly sure that things will work, and it allows me to do other important things like look at stackoverflow an not \'monitor\' the progress.Sometimes I get really carried away...I do this when for example making a linux from scratch box.&& strings commands together. Successive commands only execute if preceding ones succeed.Similarly, || will allow the successive command to execute if the preceding fails.See Bash Shell Programming.See the example:Shell will try to create directory test and then, only if it was successfull will try create file inside it.So you may interrupt a sequence of steps if one of them failed.command_1 && command_2: execute command_2 only when command_1 is executed successfully.command_1 || command_2: execute command_2 only when command_1 is not successful executed.Feels similar as how an \'if\' condition is executed in a mainstream programming language, like, in if (condition_1 && condition_2){...} condition_2 will be omitted if condition_1 is false and in if (condition_1 || condition_2){...} condition_2 will be omitted if condition_1 is true.\nSee, it\'s the same trick you use for coding :)It\'s to execute a second statement if the first statement ends succesfully. Like an if statement:Its first tries if 1==1, if that is true it checks if 2==2
