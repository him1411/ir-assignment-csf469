I would like to track and update in this thread the latest best (and hopefully the simplest) method to bundle Angular (version 2, 4, ...) for production on a live web server.Please include the Angular version within answers so we can track better when it moves to later releases.ng build --prod --build-optimizer (run in command line when directory is projectFolder, the flag --build-optimizer is still experimental and helps to remove code that you are not reliant on)flag prod bundle for production (see the Angular documentation for the list of option included with the production flag).Compress using Brotli compression the resources using the following command for i in dist/*; do bro --input $i --output $i.br; donebundles are generated by default to projectFolder/dist/ You can get a preview of your application using the ng serve --prod command that starts a local HTTP server such that the application with production files is accessible using http://localhost:4200.For a production usage, you have to deploy all the files from the dist folder in the HTTP server of your choice.npm run bundle  (run in cmd when direcory is projectFolder)bundles are generated to projectFolder / bundles / The best I could do yet :)The Angular2 team published a tutorial for using WebpackI created and placed the files from the tutorial in a small GitHub seed project. So you can quickly try the workflow.Instructions:npm installnpm start. For development. This will create a virtual "dist" folder that will be livereloaded at your localhost address.npm run build. For production. "This will create a physical "dist" folder version    than can be sent to a webserver. The dist   folder is 7.8MB but only    234KB is actually required to load the   page in a web browser. \nThis Webpack Starter Kit offers some more testing features than the above tutorial and seem quite popular.Angular.io have quick start tutorial. I copied this tutorial and extended with some simple gulp tasks for bundling everything to dist folder which can be copied to server and work just like that. I tried to optimize everything to work well on Jenkis CI, so node_modules can be cached and don\'t need to be copied.Source code with sample app on Github: https://github.com/Anjmao/angular2-production-workflowNode: While you always can create your own build process, but I highly recommend to use angular-cli, because it have all needed workflows and it works perfectly now. We are already using it in production and don\'t have any issues with angular-cli at all.This supports:You can add --style=scss for SASS .scss support.You can add --ng4 for using Angular 4 instead of Angular 2.After creating the project, the CLI will automatically run npm install for you. If you want to use Yarn instead, or just want to look at the project skeleton without install, check how to do it here.Inside the project folder:At the current version you need to to specify --aot manually, because it can be used in development mode (although that\'s not practical due to slowness).This also performs AoT compilation for even smaller bundles (no Angular compiler, instead, generated compiler output). The bundles are much smaller with AoT if you use Angular 4 as the generated code is smaller.\nYou can test your app with AoT in development mode (sourcemaps, no minification) and AoT by running ng build --aot.The default output dir is ./dist, although it can be changed in ./angular-cli.json.The result of build step is the following:(Note: <content-hash> refers to hash / fingerprint of the contents of the file that\'s meant to be a cache busting way, this is possible since Webpack writes the script tags by itself)In older versions it also created gzipped versions for checking their size, and .map sourcemaps files, but this is no longer happening as people kept asking to remove these.In certain other occasions, you might find other unwanted files/folders:As of today I still find the Ahead-of-Time Compilation cookbook as the best recipe for production bundling. You can find it here: https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/aot-compiler.htmlMy experience with Angular 2 so far is that AoT creates the smallest builds with almost no loading time. And most important as the question here is about - you only need to ship a few files to production.This seems to be because the Angular compiler will not be shipped with the production builds as the templates are compiled "Ahead of Time". It\'s also very cool to see your HTML template markup transformed to javascript instructions that would be very hard to reverse engineer into the original HTML.I\'ve made a simple video where I demonstrate download size, number of files etc. for an Angular 2 app in dev vs AoT build - which you can see here:https://youtu.be/ZoZDCgQwnmQYou\'ll find the source code used in the video here:https://github.com/fintechneo/angular2-templates"Best" depends on the scenario. There are times when you only care about the smallest possible single bundle, but in large apps you may have to consider lazy loading. At some point it becomes impractical to serve the entire app as a single bundle.In the latter case Webpack is generally the best way since it supports code splitting.For a single bundle I would consider Rollup, or the Closure compiler if you are feeling brave :-)I have created samples of all Angular bundlers I\'ve ever used here: http://www.syntaxsuccess.com/viewarticle/angular-production-buildsThe code can be found here: https://github.com/thelgevold/angular-2-samplesAngular version: 4.1.xYou can deploy your angular application on github using \nangular-cli-ghpagescheck out the link to find how to deploy using this cli.the deployed website will be stored in some branch in github typically gh-pagesuse can clone the git branch and use it like static website in your server Just setup angular 4 with webpack 3 within a minute your development and production ENV bundle will become reday without any issue\njust follow the below github dochttps://github.com/roshan3133/angular2-webpack-starterI was also facing the same issue of getting ready a production ready bundle.\nI added the following line of code in package.jsonand called it using npmnpm run build:prodIt did the trick of giving me the production ready js and its respective map files.
