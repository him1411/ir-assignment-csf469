I have the following codeI would like to get the output:What actually happens:Alternatively, as of Python 2.6, you can use new string formatting (described in PEP 3101):which is especially handy as your strings get more complicated.try using %% to print % sign . If the formatting template was read from a file, and you cannot ensure the content doubles the percent sign, then you probably have to detect the percent character and decide programmatically whether it is the start of a placeholder or not.  Then the parser should also recognize sequences like %d (and other letters that can be used), but also %(xxx)s etc.Similar problem can be observed with the new formats -- the text can contain curly braces.You can\'t selectively escape %, as % always has a special meaning depending on the following character.In the documentation of Python, at the bottem of the second table in that section, it states:Therefore you should use:(please note the expicit change to tuple as argument to %)Without knowing about the above, I would have done:with the knowledge you obviously already had.
