How can you produce the following list with range() in Python?use reversed() function:It\'s much more meaningful. Update:If you want it to be a list (as btk pointed out):Update:If you want to use only range to achieve the same result, you can use all its parameters. range(start, stop, step)For example, to generate a list [5,4,3,2,1,0], you can use the following:It may be less intuitive but as the comments mention, this is more efficient and the right usage of range for reversed list.Use the \'range\' built-in function. The signature is range(start, stop, step).  This produces a sequence that yields numbers, starting with start, and ending if stop has been reached, excluding stop.In Python 3, this produces a non-list range object, which functions effectively like a read-only list (but uses way less memory, particularly for large ranges).You could userange(10)[::-1]which is the same thing asrange(9, -1, -1)and arguably more readable (if you\'re familiar with the commonsequence[::-1]Python idiom).will solve this problem. It will output 8 to 1, and -1 means a reversed listThe requirement in this question calls for a list of integers of size 10 in descending\norder. So, let\'s produce a list in python.Readibility aside, reversed(range(n)) seems to be faster than range(n)[::-1].Just if anyone was wondering :)No sense to use reverse as range method can return reversed list.When you have iteration over n items and want to replace order of list returned by range(start, stop, step) you have to use third parameter of range which identifies step and set it to -1, other parameters shall be adjusted accordingly:So equivalent of range(n) in reverse order would be:i believe this can help,below is Usage:You can do printing of reverse numbers with range() BIF Like , Output will be \n[10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1] range() - range ( start , end , increment/decrement ) \nwhere start is inclusive , end is exclusive and increment can be any numbers and behaves like step For those who are interested in the "efficiency" of the options collected so far...Jaime RGP\'s answer led me to restart my computer after timing the somewhat "challenging" solution of Jason literally following my own suggestion (via comment). To spare the curious of you the downtime, I present here my results (worst-first):Jason\'s answer (maybe just an excursion into the power of list comprehension):martineau\'s answer (readable if you are familiar with the extended slices syntax):Micha\xc5\x82 \xc5\xa0rajer\'s answer (the accepted one, very readable):bene\'s answer (the very first, but very sketchy at that time):The last option is easy to remember using the range(n-1,-1,-1) notation by Val Neekman.Using without [::-1] or reversed -You don\'t necessarily need to use the range function, you can simply do list[::-1] which should return the list in reversed order swiftly, without using any additions.Suppose you have a list call it \na={1,2,3,4,5}\nNow if you want to print the list in reverse then simply use the following code.I know you asked using range but its already answered.Is the correct form. If you useyou wont get a 0 case. For instance, say your 10 isn\'t a magic number and a variable you\'re using to lookup start from reverse. If your n case is 0, reversed(range(0)) will not execute which is wrong if you by chance have a single object in the zero index.
