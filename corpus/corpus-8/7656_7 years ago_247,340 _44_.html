I would like to add a delay/sleep inside a while loop:I tried it like this:Only the first scenario is true: after showing alert(\'hi\'), it will be waiting for 3 seconds then alert(\'hello\') will be displayed but then alert(\'hello\') will be repeatedly constantly. What I would like is that after alert(\'hello\') is shown 3 seconds after alert(\'hi\') then it needs to wait for 3 seconds for the second time alert(\'hello\') and so on.Could anyone please give advice?The setTimeout() function is non-blocking and will return immediately. Therefore your loop will iterate very quickly and it will initiate 3-second timeout triggers one after the other in quick succession. That is why your first alerts pops up after 3 seconds, and all the rest follow in succession without any delay.You may want to use something like this instead:You could also neaten it up, by using a self invoking function, passing the number of iterations as an argument:Try something like this:Another way is to multiply the time to timeout, but note that this is not like sleep. Code after the loop will be executed immediately, only the execution of the callback function is deferred.The first timeout will be set to 3000 * 1, the second to 3000 * 2 and so on.I think you need something like this:Test code:Note: using alerts stalls javascript execution till you close the alert.\nIt might be more code than you asked for, but this is a robust reusable solution.If using ES6, you could use let to achieve this:What let does is declare i for each iteration, not the loop. This way, what is passed to setTimeout is exactly what we want.I would probably use setInteval. Like this,In ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) you can iterate with delay with generator and interval.Generators, a new feature of ECMAScript 6, are functions that can be\n  paused and resumed. Calling genFunc does not execute it. Instead, it\n  returns a so-called generator object that lets us control genFunc\xe2\x80\x99s\n  execution. genFunc() is initially suspended at the beginning of its\n  body.  The method genObj.next() continues the execution of genFunc,\n  until the next yield.\n  (Exploring ES6)\nCode example:\nSo if you are using ES6, that the most elegant way to achieve loop with delay (for my opinion).This will workTry this fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/wgdx8zqq/I do this with Promise.delay and recursion.Just thought I\'d post my two cents here as well. This function runs an iterative loop with a delay. See this jsfiddle. The function is as follows:For example:Would be equivalent to:A modified version of Daniel Vassallo\'s answer, with variables extracted into parameters to make the function more reusable:First let\'s define some essential variables:Next you should define the function you want to run. This will get passed i, the current index of the loop and the length of the loop, in case you need it:Self-executing versionFunctional versionYou can use RxJS interval operator. Interval emits integer every x number of seconds, and take is specify number of times it has to emit numberssSince ES7 theres a better way to await a loop:Reference:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/awaitNote that ES7 is rarely supported today, so you need to transpile with Babel to use it everywhere.TranspiledHere is a function that I use for looping over an array:You use it like this:This script works for most thingsTry this
