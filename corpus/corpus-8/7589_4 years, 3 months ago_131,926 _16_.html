I was wondering what is the correct way to integrate jQuery plugins into my angular app. I\'ve found several tutorials and screen-casts but they seem catered to a specific plugin.For Example:\nhttp://amitgharat.wordpress.com/2013/02/03/an-approach-to-use-jquery-plugins-with-angularjs/\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ozyXwLzFYsShould I create a directive like so - And then in the html call the script and the directive?Thanks aheadYes, you are correct. If you are using a jQuery plugin, do not put the code in the controller. Instead create a directive and put the code that you would normally have inside the link function of the directive.  There are a couple of points in the documentation that you could take a look at. You can find them here:\nCommon Pitfalls Using controllers correctlyEnsure that when you are referencing the script in your view, you refer it last - after the angularjs library, controllers, services and filters are referenced.EDIT: Rather than using $(element), you can make use of angular.element(element) when using AngularJS with jQueryi have alreay 2 situations where directives and services/factories didnt play well.the scenario is that i have (had) a directive that has dependency injection of a service, and from the directive i ask the service to make an ajax call (with $http).in the end, in both cases the ng-Repeat did not file at all, even when i gave the array an initial value.i even tried to make a directive with a controller and an isolated-scopeonly when i moved everything to a controller and it worked like magic.example about this here Initialising jQuery plugin (RoyalSlider) in Angular JS
