I have following working tree stateFile foo/bar.txt is there and I want to get it to the "unchanged state" again (similar to \'svn revert\'):Now it is getting confusing:The same file in both sections, new and modified? What should I do?You did it the wrong way around. You are meant to reset first, to unstage the file, then checkout, to revert local changes.Try this:This worked perfectly for me:// Note dot (.) at the end. And all will be gooddid you tried that? (without a HEAD keyword) I usually revert my changes this way.I find git stash very useful for temporal handling of all \'dirty\' states.
