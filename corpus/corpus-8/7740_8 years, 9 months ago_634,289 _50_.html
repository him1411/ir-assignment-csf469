I just installed SQL Server 2008 Express on my Vista SP1 machine. I previously had 2005 on here and used it just fine with the old SQL Server Management Studio Express. I was able to connect with no problems to my PC-NAME\\SQLEXPRESS instance (no, PC-NAME is not my computer name ;-).I uninstalled 2005 and SQL Server Management Studio Express. I then installed SQL Server 2008 Express on my machine and elected to have it install SQL Server Management Studio Basic.Now, when I try to connect to PC-NAME\\SQLEXPRESS (with Windows Authentication, like I always did), I get the following message:Cannot connect to PC-NAME\\SQLEXPRESS.\nA network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server. The server was not found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance name is correct and that SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections. (provider: SQL Network Interfaces, error: 26 - Error Locating Server/Instance Specified) (Microsoft SQL Server, Error: -1)\nFor help, click: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?ProdName=Microsoft+SQL+Server&EvtSrc=MSSQLServer&EvtID=-1&LinkId=20476When I installed SQL Server 2008, I had it use SQLEXPRESS as the local instance name. As far as I can tell, through SQL Server Configuration Manager, SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections.When I went to the help link it mentions, the help page suggests the following:Well, as far as I can tell, there is no SQL Server Browser service on my system (looked in MMC for one, couldn\'t find one).And the SQL Server Surface Area Configuration tool doesn\'t exist in SQL Server 2008. So good job there with your help documentation, Microsoft ;-).I\'m at a loss for what to do right now. I had a lot of work I was hoping to get done today after upgrading to 2008 (the person I\'m working with got it up and running with no problem and told me it would be easy - he\'s also far better with database stuff that I am). Does anyone have any idea what might be wrong? I\'d really appreciate it. If I can\'t get this working in a few hours, I\'m going back to SQL Server 2005 (if that will even work, gah...).Edit: I have tried turning Windows Firewall off, and that did not help. Also, I noticed that I do not have a "Data" directory under my SQL Server 2008 install directory tree - could I have possibly set something up wrong when I installed it?Please check the ServerName which you provided. It should match with the below shown Name in the UserName textbox, and that name should followed with \\SQLEXPRESS:Start your Local SQL Server ServiceThis will ensure they start up again if you restart your computer.

Somehow, someway, I did not install the Database Engine when I installed SQL Server 2008. I have no idea how I missed that, but that\'s what happened.I know this question is old, but in case it helps anyone make sure the SQL Server Browser is running in the Services MSC. I installed SQL Server Express 2008 R2 and the SQL Server Browser Service was set to Disabled.I\'ve just solved a problem related to this which may help other people.Initially when loading up MSSMSE it had the server as PC_NAME\\SQLEXPRESS and when I tried to connect it gave me Error: 26 - Error Locating Server/Instance Specified, so I went into SQL Server Configuration Manager to check if my SQL Server Browser and SQL Server services were running and set to automatic, only to find that instead of saying SQL Server (SQLEXPRESS) it says SQL Server(MSSQLSERVER).I then tried connecting to PC-NAME\\MSSQLSERVER and this time got SQL Network Interfaces, error: 25 - Connection string is not valid) (MicrosoftSQL Server, Error: 87) The parameter is incorrect so I googled this error and found that somebody had suggested that instead of using PC-NAME\\MSSQLSERVER just use PC-NAME as the Server Name at the server connection interface, and this seems to work.There\'s a link here http://learningsqlserver.wordpress.com/2011/01/21/what-version-of-sql-server-do-i-have/ which explains that MSSQLSERVER is the default instance and can be connected to by using just your hostname.I think this may have arisen because I\'ve had SQL Server 2008 installed at some point in the past.I used (LocalDB)\\MSSQLLocalDB as the server name, I was then able to see all the local databases.Under Configuration Manager and Network Configuration and Protocols for your instance is TCP/IP Enabled? That could be the problem.orFor me, I was only able to get it to work by using "." in the server name field; was banging away for awhile trying different combos of the user name and server name. Note that during install of the server (ie this file: SQLEXPR_x64_ENU.exe) i checked default instance which defaults the name to MSSQLSERVER; the above high voted answers might be best used for separate named (ie when you need more than 1) server instances.both of these videos helped me out:One of the first things that you should check is that the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) is started. You can go to the Services Console (services.msc) and look for SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) to see that it is started. If not, then start the service.You could also do this through an elevated command prompt by typing net start mssqlserver.For me it was a windows firewall issue. Allow incoming connections. Opening port didn\'t work but allow programs did.LinkLink2
