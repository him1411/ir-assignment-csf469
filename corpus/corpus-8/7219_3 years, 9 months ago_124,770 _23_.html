I would like to know how can I apply full screen theme ( no title bar + no actionbar ) to an activity. I am using AppCompat library from support package v7. I\'ve tried to applied android:theme="@android:style/Theme.NoTitleBar.Fullscreen" to my specific activity but it crashed. I think it\'s because my application theme is like this.I also have tried this which only hides title bar but not the action bar. \nMy current workaround is that hiding the actionbar with When you use Theme.AppCompat in your application you can use FullScreenTheme by adding the code below to styles.and also mention in your manifest file.Based on the answer by @nebyan, I found that the action bar is still not hiding.The following code works for me:Using the above xml in style.xml, you will be able to hide the title as well as action bar.Issues arise among before and after versions of Android 4.0 (API level 14)..from here https://developer.android.com/training/system-ui/status.html I created my own solution..I write this code in onResume() method because if you exit from your app and then you reopen it, the action bar remains active! (and so this fix the problem)I hope it was helpful ;)Your "workaround" (hiding the actionBar yourself) is the normal way. But google recommands to always hide the ActionBar when the TitleBar is hidden. Have a look here: https://developer.android.com/training/system-ui/status.htmlYou can follow below step:-AndoridMenifest.xmlStyle.xmlFullImageActivity.javaI hope it will help..Thanks!!To remove title bar in AppCompat:just this ?This theme only works after API 21(included). And make both the StatusBar and NavigationBar transparent.
