I am developing an application where user has to write some information. For this purpose I need a UITextField which is multi-line (in general UITextField is a single line).As I\'m Googling I find a answer of using UITextView instead of UITextfield for this purpose.UITextField is specifically one-line only.Your Google search is correct, you need to use UITextView instead of UITextField for display and editing of multiline text.In Interface Builder, add a UITextView where you want it and select the "editable" box.  It will be multiline by default.Ok I did it with some trick ;) First build a UITextField and increased it\'s size like this :Then build a UITextView exactly in the same area that u made my UITextField, and deleted its background color. Now it looks like that u have a multiple lines TextField !Besides from the multiple line behaviour, the main difference between UITextView and UITextField is that the UITextView does not propose a placeholder. To bypass this limitation, you can use a UITextView with a "fake placeholder."See this SO question for details: Placeholder in UITextView.You can fake a UITextField using UITextView. The problem you\'ll have is that you lose the place holder functionality. If you choose to use a UITextField and need the place holder, do this:In your viewDidLoad set the color and text to placeholders:Then make the placeholder disappear when your UITextView is selected:When the user finishes editing, ensure there\'s a value. If there isn\'t, add the placeholder again:Other features you might need to fake:UITextField\'s often capitalize every letter, you can add that feature to UITableView:UITextField\'s don\'t usually scroll:Yes, a UITextView is what you\'re looking for. You\'ll have to deal with some things differently (like the return key) but you can add text to it, and it will allow you to scroll up and down if there\'s too much text inside. This link has info about making a screen to enter data:create a data entry screenIf you must have a UITextField with 2 lines of text, one option is to add a UILabel as a subview of the UITextField for the second line of text.  I have a UITextField in my app that users often do not realize is editable by tapping, and I wanted to add some small subtitle text that says "Tap to Edit" to the UITextField.use UITextView instead of UITextFieldA supplement to h4xxr\'s answer in the above, an easier way to adjust the height of the UITextField is to select  square border style in the attribute inspectors->Text Field. (By default, the border style of a UITextfield is ellipse.) Reference: Answered Brian in here : How to set UITextField height?There is another option that worked for me:Subclass UITextField and overwrite:In this method you can for example:This code will render the text using as many lines as required if the rect has enough space. You could specify any other attribute depending on your needs. Do not use:which will force one line text rendering
