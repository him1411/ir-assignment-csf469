For homebrew mysql installs, where\'s my.cnf? Does it install one?There is no my.cnf by default.  As such, MySQL starts with all of the default settings.  If you want to create your own my.cnf to override any defaults, place it at /etc/my.cnf.Also, you can run mysql --help and look through it for the conf locations listed.As you can see, there are also some options for bypassing the conf files, or specifying other files to read when you invoke mysql on the command line.The homebrew mysql contains sample configuration files in the installation\'s support-files folder.If you need to change the default settings you can use one of these as a starting point.As @rednaw points out, a homebrew install of MySQL will most likely be in /usr/local so the my.cnf file should not be added to the system /etc folder, so I\xe2\x80\x99ve changed the command to copy the file into /usr/local/etc.If you are using MariaDB rather than MySQL use the following:One way to find out:Nothing really helped me - I could not overwrite settings in a /etc/my.cnf file.\nSo I searched like John suggested https://stackoverflow.com/a/7974114/717251It found another my.cnf in changing this file worked for me! Don\'t forget to restart the launch Agent:On your shell type my_print_defaults --helpAt the bottom of the result, you should be able to see the file from which the server reads the configurations. It prints something like this:I believe the answer is no. Installing one in ~/.my.cnf or /usr/local/etc seems to be the preferred solution.You can find where the my.cnf file has been provided by the specific package, e.g.In addition to verify if that file is read, you can run:which will show you filesystem activity in real-time related to that file.in my system it was as template andas working.
