I need to create a central Git repository but I\'m a little confused...I have created a bare repository (in my git server, machine 2) with:Now I need to push files from my local repository (machine 1) to the bare repository (machine 2). I have access to machine 2 by SSH. The thing is that I think I don\'t understand the concept of a bare repository...What is the right way of storing my code in the bare repository? How can I commit from my local repository to the bare repository?Is the right way of having a central repository to have a bare repository?I\'m a little confused with this subject. Please give me a clue on this.Firstly, just to check, you need to change into the directory you\'ve created before running git init --bare.  Also, it\'s conventional to give bare repositories the extension .git.  So you can doFor Git versions < 1.8 you would doTo answer your later questions, bare repositories (by definition) don\'t have a working tree attached to them, so you can\'t easily add files to them as you would in a normal non-bare repository (e.g. with git add <file> and a subsequent git commit.)You almost always update a bare repository by pushing to it (using git push) from another repository.Note that in this case you\'ll need to first allow people to push to your repository. When inside test_repo.git, do=== community edit ===As commented by prasanthv, this is what you want if you are doing this at work, rather than for a private home project.I\'m adding this answer because after arriving here (with the same question), none of the answers really describe all the required steps needed to go from nothing to a fully usable remote (bare) repo.Note: this example uses local paths for the location of the bare repo, but other git protocols (like SSH indicated by the OP) should work just fine.I\'ve tried to add some notes along the way for those less familiar with git.1. Initialise the bare repo...This creates a folder (repo.git) and populates it with git files representing a git repo. As it stands, this repo is useless - it has no commits and more importantly, no branches. Although you can clone this repo, you cannot pull from it.Next, we need to create a working folder. There are a couple of ways of doing this, depending upon whether you have existing files.2a. Create a new working folder (no existing files) by cloning the empty repoThis command will only work if /path/to/work does not exist or is an empty folder.\nTake note of the warning - at this stage, you still don\'t have anything useful. If you cd /path/to/work and run git status, you\'ll get something like:but this is a lie. You are not really on branch master (because git branch returns nothing) and so far, there are no commits.Next, copy/move/create some files in the working folder, add them to git and create the first commit.The git config commands are only needed if you haven\'t already told git who you are. Note that if you now run git branch, you\'ll now see the master branch listed. Now run git status:This is also misleading - upstream has not "gone", it just hasn\'t been created yet and git branch --unset-upstream will not help. But that\'s OK, now that we have our first commit, we can push and master will be created on the bare repo.At this point, we have a fully functional bare repo which can be cloned elsewhere on a master branch as well as a local working copy which can pull and push.2b. Create a working folder from existing files\nIf you already have a folder with files in it (so you cannot clone into it), you can initialise a new git repo, add a first commit and then link it to the bare repo afterwards.At this point we have our first commit and a local master branch which we need to turn into a remote-tracked upstream branch.Note the -u flag on git push to set the (new) tracked upstream branch.\nJust as before, we now have a fully functional bare repo which can be cloned elsewhere on a master branch as well as a local working copy which can pull and push.All this may seem obvious to some, but git confuses me at the best of times (it\'s error and status messages really need some rework) - hopefully, this will help others.Answering your questions one by one:Bare repository is the one that has no working tree. It means its whole contents is what you have in .git directory.You can only commit to bare repository by pushing to it from your local clone. It has no working tree, so it has no files modified, no changes.To have central repository the only way it is to have a bare repository.You could also ask git to create directory for you:The general practice is to have the central repository to which you push as a bare repo.If you have SVN background, you can relate an SVN repo to a Git bare repo. It doesn\'t have the files in the repo in the original form. Whereas your local repo will have the files that form your "code" in addition.You need to add a remote to the bare repo from your local repo and push your "code" to it.It will be something like:This should be enough:See for more details "GIT: How do I update my bare repo?".\nNotes: It is nice to verify that the code you pushed actually got committed.You can get a log of changes on a bare repository by explicitly setting the path using the --relative option.This will show you the committed changes as if this was a regular git repo.The --bare flag creates a repository that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a working directory. The bare repository is the central repository and you can\'t edit(store) codes here for avoiding the merging error.For example, when you add a file in your local repository (machine 1) and push it to the bare repository, you can\'t see the file in the bare repository for it is always \'empty\'. However, you really push something to the repository and you can see it inexplicitly by cloning another repository in your server(machine 2). Both the local repository in machine 1 and the \'copy\' repository in machine 2 are non-bare.\nrelationship between bare and non-bare repositoriesThe blog will help you understand it. https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository
