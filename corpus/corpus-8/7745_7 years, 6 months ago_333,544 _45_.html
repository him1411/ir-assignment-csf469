I\'ve been using GROUP BY for all types of aggregate queries over the years.  Recently, I\'ve been reverse-engineering some code that uses PARTITION BY to perform aggregations.  In reading through all the documentation I can find about PARTITION BY, it sounds a lot like GROUP BY, maybe with a little extra functionality added in?  Are they two versions of the same general functionality, or are they something different entirely?They\'re used in different places.  group by modifies the entire query, like:But partition by just works on a window function, like row_number:A group by normally reduces the number of rows returned by rolling them up and calculating averages or sums for each row.  partition by does not affect the number of rows returned, but it changes how a window function\'s result is calculated.We can take a simple example we have a table named TableA with the following values .Group By The SQL GROUP BY clause can be used in a SELECT statement to collect\n  data across multiple records and group the results by one or more\n  columns.In more simple words  GROUP BY statement is used in conjunction with\n  the aggregate functions to group the result-set by one or more\n  columns.syntax :We can apply GroupBy in our table Results :In our real table we have 7 rows and when we apply group by id, the server group the results based on idIn simple words here  group by normally reduces the number of rows returned by rolling\n  them up and calculating Sum  for each row.partition bybefore going to partition by let us look at OVER clause As per MSDN definition OVER clause defines a window or user-specified set of rows within a\n  query result set. A window function then computes a value for each row\n  in the window. You can use the OVER clause with functions to compute\n  aggregated values such as moving averages, cumulative aggregates,\n  running totals, or a top N per group results.partition by will  not reduce the number of rows returnedwe can apply partition by in our example tableresult :look at the results it will partition the rows and results all rows not like group by.                    partition by doesn\'t actually roll up the data.  It allows you to reset something on a per group basis.  For example, you can get an ordinal column within a group by partitioning on the grouping field and using rownum() over the rows within that group.  This gives you something that behaves a bit like an identity column that resets at the beginning of each group.PARTITION BY \n  Divides the result set into partitions. The window function is applied to each partition separately and computation restarts for each partition.Found at this link: OVER ClauseIt provides rolled-up data without rolling upi.e. Suppose I want to return the relative position of sales regionUsing PARTITION BY, I can return the sales amount for a given region and the MAX amount across all sales regions in the same row.This does mean you will have repeating data, but it may suit the end consumer in the sense that data has been aggregated but no data has been lost - as would be the case with GROUP BY.As of my understanding Partition By is almost identical to Group By, but with the following differences:That group by actually groups the result set returning one row per group, which results therefore in SQL Server only allowing in the SELECT list aggregate functions or columns that are part of the group by clause (in which case SQL Server can guarantee that there are unique results for each group).Consider for example MySQL which allows to have in the SELECT list columns that are not defined in the Group By clause, in which case one row is still being returned per group, however if the column doesn\'t have unique results then there is no guarantee what will be the output!But with Partition By, although the results of the function are identical to the results of an aggregate function with Group By, still you are getting the normal result set, which means that one is getting one row per underlying row, and not one row per group, and because of this one can have columns that are not unique per group in the SELECT list.So as a summary, Group By would be best when needs an output of one row per group, and Partition By would be best when one needs all the rows but still wants the aggregate function based on a group. Of course there might also be performance issues, see http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/ms-MY/transactsql/thread/0b20c2b5-1607-40bc-b7a7-0c60a2a55fba.PARTITION BY is analytic, while GROUP BY is aggregate.  In order to use PARTITION BY, you have to contain it with an OVER clause.Suppose we have 14 records of name column in tablein group byit will give count in single row i.e 14but in partition byit will 14 rows of increase in countSmall observation. Automation mechanism to dynamically generate SQL using the \'partition by\' it is much simpler to implement in relation to the \'group by\'. In the case of \'group by\', We must take care of the content of \'select\' column.Sorry for My English.
