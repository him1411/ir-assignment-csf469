I want to use the twitter bootstrap icons on my form input submit buttons. The examples on http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/base-css.html#icons mainly show styled hyperlinks. The closest I\'ve come is getting the icon displayed next to the button, but not inside.You can use a button tag instead of inputI think you can use label tags for this purpose. Here is a sample of the twitter bootstrap HTML navbar:Basically you get a label element for the input (type=submit) and then you hide the actual input submit. Users can click on the label element and still get through with the form submission.I think you should try this FontAwesome designed to be use with Twitter Bootstrap.You can add an <a/> with the icon somewhere, and bind a JavaScrit action\nto it, that submits the form.  If necessary, the name and value of the\noriginal submit button\'s name+value can be there in a hidden attribute.  It\'s easy with\njQuery, please allow me to avoid the pure JavaScript version.Suppose that this is the original form:Change it like this:...and then the magical jQuery:Or if you want to make sure that the user can always submit the form --that\'s\nwhat I would do in your shoes--, you can leave the normal submit button in\nthe form, and hide it with jQuery .hide().  It ensures that login still works\nwithout JavaScript and jQuery according to the normal submit button (there are\npeople using links, w3m and similar browsers), but provides\na fancy button with icon if possible.I wanted to the Twitter Bootstrap icons to a basic Rails form and came across this post. After searching around a bit, I figured out an easy way to do it. Not sure if you\'re using Rails, but here\'s the code. The key was to pass a block to the link_to view helper: In case you\'re not using Rails, here is the output HTML for the links with icons (for an edit, delete, and new submit buttons)And here\'s a link to screenshot of the finished result: \nhttp://grab.by/cVXmThere is a new way to do this with bootstrap 3:It\'s on the bootstrap glyphicons page under "how to use":There is one way, how to get (bootstrap\'s) glyphicons into input type="submit". Using css3 multiple background.HTML:and CSS:If multiple backgrounds are overlaping, at the top will be first background at the background: notation.\nSo at the top is background which is indented 16px from left side (16px is width of single glyphicon), at the bottom level is whole glyphicons-halflings.png and at the bottom level (covers whole element) is same background gradient as at the top level.-48px 0px is the cut for search icon (icon-search) but it\'s easy to show any other icon.If someone need a :hover effect, background must be again typed at the same form.I got this to work, but there\'s a few caveats I haven\'t resolved yet.Anyway, this is how it\'s done:Take your average input button:Cut out the icon you want for your submit buttons from the glyphicons sprite file, make sure it\'s a 14x14 px image. Yes, in ideal circumstances you could reuse the sprite, and if anyone figures that out I\'ll be happy to hear how it\'s done. :-)Once you did that, you can write css for your input button like this:Works in Firefox 14, Chrome 21Doesn\'t work in IE 9tl;dr: With a bit of css you can automagically put icons on your submit buttons, but you need to put the icon in a separate file and it won\'t work in Internet Explorer.I think its a solution for your problemUse input-append with add-on classes i guess this better way, works fine for me.
