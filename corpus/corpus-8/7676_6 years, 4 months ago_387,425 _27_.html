I want to set a default value for my html <textarea>. I read from a material that to add default value you have to do something like <textarea>This is default text</textarea>. I did that but it doesn\'t work. What\'s the right thing to do?Here is my jsFiddle example. this works fine:You can use placeholder Attribute, which doesn\'t add a default value but might be what you are looking out for :Check it out here - http://jsfiddle.net/8DzCE/949/\nImportant Note ( As suggested by Jon Brave in the comments ) :Placeholder Attribute does not set the value of a textarea. Rather "The placeholder attribute represents a short hint (a word or short phrase) intended to aid the user with data entry when the control has no value" [and it disappears as soon as user clicks into the textarea]. It will never act as "the default value" for the control. If you want that, you must put the desired text inside the Here is the actual default value, as per other answers hereIf you want to bring information from a database into a textarea tag for editing:\nThe input tag not to display data that occupy several lines: rows no work, tag input is one line.The textarea tag has no value, but work fine with handlebarsWhen I do something like this it has worked for me:Just in case if you are using Angular.js in your project (as I am) and have a ng-model set for your <textarea>, setting the default just inside like:...will not work!You need to set the default value to the textarea\'s ng-model in the respective controller or use ng-init.Example 1 (using ng-init): Example 2 (without using ng-init):Also, this worked very well for me:In this case, $_POST[\'encode\'] came from this:The PHP code was inserted between the  and  tags.Placeholder cannot set the default value for text area. You can use This is the tag if you are using it for database connection. You may use different syntax if you are using other languages than php. e.g.:required command minimizes efforts needed to check empty fields using php.A few notes and clarifications:placeholder=\'\' inserts your text, but it is greyed out (in a tool-tip style format) and the moment the field is clicked, your text is replaced by an empty text field.value=\'\' is not a <textarea> attribute, and only works for <input> tags, ie, <input type=\'text\'>, etc. I don\'t know why the creators of HTML5 decided not to incorporate that, but that\'s the way it is for now.The best method for inserting text into <textarea> elements has been outlined correctly here as: <textarea> Desired text to be inserted into the field upon page load </textarea> When the user clicks the field, they can edit the\ntext and it remains in the field (unlike placeholder=\'\').
