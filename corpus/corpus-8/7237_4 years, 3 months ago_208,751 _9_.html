I\'ve be looking for how to execute this but I can\'t find anything related so far, :( \nI could nest both functions yes but I\'m just wondering if this is possible?\nI\'d like to do this literally:My JS code at the moment:I\'d like to call two functions with just one click, how can I do this in angularJS?\nI thought it\'d be straight forward like in CSS when you add multiple classes...but it\'s not :(You have 2 options :Create a third method that wrap both methods. Advantage here is that you put less logic in your template.Otherwise if you want to add 2 calls in ng-click you can add \';\' after edit($index) like thisng-click="edit($index); open()"See here : http://jsfiddle.net/laguiz/ehTy6/You can call multiple functions with \';\'
