What is the easiest way in Python to replace a character in a string like: Don\'t modify strings.Work with them as lists; turn them into strings only when needed.Python strings are immutable (i.e. they can\'t be modified).  There are a lot of reasons for this.  Use lists until you have no choice, only then turn them into strings.There are three ways. For the speed seekers I recommend \'Method 2\' Method 1Given by this answerWhich is pretty slow compared to \'Method 2\'Method 2 (FAST METHOD)Given by this answerWhich is much faster:Method 3:Byte array:Python strings are immutable, you change them by making a copy.\nThe easiest way to do what you want is probably.The text[1:] return the string in text from position 1 to the end, positions count from 0 so \'1\' is the second character.edit:\nYou can use the same string slicing technique for any part of the stringOr if the letter only appears once you can use the search and replace technique suggested \nbelowStarting with python 2.6 and python 3 you can use bytearrays which are mutable (can be changed element-wise unlike strings):edit: Changed str to sedit2: As Two-Bit Alchemist mentioned in the comments, this code does not work with unicode.Like other people have said, generally Python strings are supposed to be immutable.However, if you are using CPython, the implementation at python.org, it is possible to use ctypes to modify the string structure in memory.Here is an example where I use the technique to clear a string.Mark data as sensitive in pythonI mention this for the sake of completeness, and this should be your last resort as it is hackish.Actually, with strings, you can do something like this:Basically, I\'m "adding"+"strings" together into a new string :).This code is not mine. I couldn\'t recall the site form where, I took it. Interestingly, you can use this to replace one character or more with one or more charectors.\nThough this reply is very late, novices like me (anytime) might find it useful.A very simple way is to do this:Output:
