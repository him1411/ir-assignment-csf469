I have an ASP.NET MVC5 application that worked yesterday and now I am getting this error when I try to build:This project references NuGet package(s) that are missing on this computer.I have the two options checked that allow nuget to automatically download and install missing packages checked / turned ON. I have also tried deleting all of the files in the packages folder and then have nuget re-download them. Also when I open nuget and look for updates it says there are none that need to be installed. I can\'t figure what else to do to move beyond this amazingly annoying issue.In my case, I had to remove the following from the .csproj file:In fact, in this snippet you can see where the error message is coming from.I was converting from MSBuild-Integrated Package Restore to Automatic Package Restore (http://docs.nuget.org/docs/workflows/migrating-to-automatic-package-restore)One solution would be to remove from the .csproj file the following:How?In my case it happened after I moved my solution folder from one location to another, re-organized it a bit and in the process its relative folder structure changed.So I had to edit all entries similar to the following one in my .csproj file fromto(Note the change from ..\\packages\\ to packages\\. It might be a different relative structure in your case, but you get the idea.)I easily solve this problem by right clicking on my solution and then clicking on the Enable NuGet Package Restore option (P.S: Ensure that you have the Nuget Install From Tools--> Extensions and Update--> Nuget Package Manager for Visual Studio 2013. If not install this extention first) Hope it helps.In my case it had to do with the Microsoft.Build.Bcl version.\nMy nuget package version was 1.0.21, but my project files were still pointing to version 1.0.14So I changed my .csproj files from:to:And the build was working again.I had the same issue. In my case installing the Microsoft.Bcl.Build package fixed the problem.If you are using TFSRemove the NuGet.exe and NuGet.targets files from the solution\'s .nuget folder. Make sure the files themselves are also removed from the solution workspace.\n    Retain the NuGet.Config file to continue to bypass adding packages to source control.Edit each project file (e.g., .csproj, .vbproj) in the solution and remove any references to the NuGet.targets file. Open the project file(s) in the editor of your choice and remove the following settings:If you are not using TFSRemove the .nuget folder from your solution. Make sure the folder itself is also removed from the solution workspace.Edit each project file (e.g., .csproj, .vbproj) in the solution and remove any references to the NuGet.targets file. Open the project file(s) in the editor of your choice and remove the following settings:Reference: Migrating MSBuild-Integrated solutions to use Automatic Package RestoreIs it possible that the packages have been restored to the wrong folder? Check that the paths in the csproj files are correct. If they are different it could be caused by the packages now being restored to a different location. This could be caused by a NuGet.Config file being checked in specifying a node like this:The packages are being restored, by the projects are still looking at the old location.These are the steps I used to fix the issue:To add nuget packages to your solution:I had the same issue when i reference the Class library into my MVC web application, the issue was the nuget package version number mismatch between two projects.ex: my class library had log4net of 1.2.3  but my webapp had 1.2.6fix: just make sure both the project have the same version number referenced.I have absolutely no idea what caused this error. Simply shutting down and reopening visual studios stopped this build error.Editing .sln and .csproj is not always that easy or desirable. Once you get the error list you can see what projects have missing packages (also, the References node usually indicate that there are missing assemblies unless packages are source code, resources, images, or just text-based ones). Removing and then adding the packages is not a good idea unless you use the latest version of the package. Otherwise be prepared for surprises, not always pleasant ones.If, say, the package is EntityFramework then from NuGet gallery you get the latest version which at the time of writing this comment it is 6.1.3.So, maybe the safest way to handle the situation is to restore the missing packages one by one. Yes, a bit painful exercise but chasing subtle bugs due to different package version maybe much more unpleasant.Having this said, and let again EntityFramework be the missing package, you can issue the following command in the Package-Manager Console:This will install the correct version, that is 6.0.1, that is the one that is specified in packages.config: For me it worked as I just copied a .nuget folder from a working solution to the existing one, and referenced it\'s content!That\'s can happen when you try to remove postsharp from you project. Ensure you remove lines Loren said.I created a folder named \'.nuget\' in solution root folder\nThen added file \'NuGet.Config\' in this folder with following contentThen created file \'.nuGet.targets\' as below\n\n\n    \n        $(MSBuildProjectDirectory)..\\
