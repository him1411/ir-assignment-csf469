If a finally block throws an exception, what exactly happens?  Specifically, what happens if the exception is thrown midway through a finally block.  Do the rest of statements (after) in this block get invoked?  I am aware that exceptions will propagate upwards. If a finally block throws an exception what exactly happens ?That exception propagates out and up, and will (can) be handled at a higher level. Your finally block will not be completed beyond the point where the exception is thrown.If the finally block was executing during the handling of an earlier exception then that first exception is lost. C# 4 Language Specification ยง 8.9.5: If the finally block throws another exception, processing of the current exception is terminated. For questions like these I usually open up an empty console application project in Visual Studio and write a small sample program:When you run the program you will see the exact order in which catch and finally blocks are executed. Please note that code in the finally block after the exception is being thrown will not be executed (in fact, in this sample program Visual Studio will even warn you that it has detected unreachable code):Additional RemarkAs Michael Damatov pointed out, an exception from the try block will be "eaten" if you don\'t handle it in an (inner) catch block. In fact, in the example above the re-thrown exception does not appear in the outer catch block. To make that even more clear look at the following slightly modified sample:As you can see from the output the inner exception is "lost" (i.e. ignored):If there is an exception pending (when the try block has a finally but no catch), the new exception replaces that one.If there is no exception pending, it works just as throwing an exception outside the finally block.The exception is propagated.The exception propagates up, and should be handled at a higher level. If the exception is not handled at the higher level, the application crashes. The "finally" block execution stops at the point where the exception is thrown. Irrespective of whether there is an exception or not "finally" block is guaranteed to execute. If the "finally" block is being executed after an exception has occurred in the try block,and if that exception is not handledand if the finally block throws an exceptionThen the original exception that occurred in the try block is lost.Great article for DetailsThrowing an exception while another exception is active will result in the first exception getting replaced by the second (later) exception.Here is some code that illustrates what happens:Some months ago i also faced something like this,To solve such problem i made a utility class likeAnd used like thisbut if you want to use paramaters and return types that\'s an other storyThe way the exceptions thrown by CodeA and CodeB are handled is the same.An exception thrown in a finally block has nothing special, treat it as the exception throw by code B.Quick (and rather obvious) snippet to save "original exception" (thrown in try block) and sacrifice "finally exception" (thrown in finally block), in case original one is more important for you:When code above is executed, "Original Exception" propagates up the call stack, and "Finally Exception" is lost.I had to do this for catching an error trying to close a stream that was never opened because of an exception. if the webRequest was created but a connection error happened during the then the finally would catch an exception trying to close up connections it thought was open because the webRequest had been created. If the finally didnt have a try-catch inside, this code would cause an unhandled exception while cleaning up the webRequest from there the code would exit without properly handling the error that happened and therefore causing issues for the calling method. Hope this helps as an exampleIt throws an exception ;) You can catch that exception in some other catch clause.
