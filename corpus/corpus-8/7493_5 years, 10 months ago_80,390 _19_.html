Is it possible to cancel a segue in the prepareForSegue: method?I want to perform some check before the segue, and if the condition is not true (in this case, if some UITextField is empty), display an error message instead of performing the segue.In iOS 6 and later it\xc2\xb4s possible:\nYou have to implement the method in your view controller. You do your validation there, and if it\xc2\xb4s OK then return YES; if it\xc2\xb4s not the return NO; and the prepareForSegue is not call.Note that this method doesn\'t get called automatically when triggering segues programmatically, if you need to perform the check, then you have to call shouldPerformSegueWithIdentifier to determine whether to perform segue.Note: the accepted answer is the best approach if you can target iOS 6. For targeting iOS 5, this answer will do.I don\'t believe it is possible to cancel a segue in prepareForSegue. I would suggest moving your logic to the point that the performSegue message is first sent.If you are using Interface Builder to wire up a segue directly to a control (e.g. linking a segue directly to a UIButton), then you can accomplish this with a bit of refactoring. Wire the segue to the view controller instead of a specific control (delete the old segue link, and then control-drag from the view controller itself to the destination view controller). Then create an IBAction in your view controller, and wire the control to the IBAction. Then you can do your logic (check for empty TextField) in the IBAction you just created, and decide there whether or not to performSegueWithIdentifier programatically.Alternatively, it\'s somewhat bad behavior to offer a button that a user shouldn\'t press. You can leave the segue wired as stands, but start with the button disabled. Then wire the UITextField\'s "editingChanged" to an event on the view control alaIts easy in the swift .As Abraham said, check valid or not in the following function.And, the performSegueWithIdentifier:sender: called by programming can be blocked by overwriting following method. By default, it is not checking valid or not by -shouldPerformSegueWithIdentifier:sender:, we can do it manually.Swift 3:\nfunc shouldPerformSegue(withIdentifier identifier: String, \n                 sender: Any?) -> BoolReturn value true if the segue should be performed or false if it should be ignored.Example:Should Perform Segue for Login RegisterSimilar to Kaolin\'s answer is to leave the seque wired to the control but validate the control based on conditions in the view. If you\'re firing on table cell interaction then you also need to set the userInteractionEnabled property as well as disabling the stuff in the cell.For instance, I\'ve got a form in a grouped table view. One of the cells leads to another tableView that acts as a picker. Whenever a control is changed in the main view I call this methodThe other way is to override method of tableView with willSelectRowAt and return nil if you don\'t want to show the segue. \nshowDetails() - is some bool. In most cases should be implemented in data model being represented in cell with indexPath.
