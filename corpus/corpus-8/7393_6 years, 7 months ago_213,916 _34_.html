I\'m trying to animate the transition between fragments. I got the answer from the following\nAndroid Fragments and animation And my R.anim.slide_in_left But when I tried this it showed  Any ideas? When I checked Honeycomb API reference translate is there. What did I miss?\nIs there any other way to animate the transition between fragments?\nThank you You need to use the new android.animation framework (object animators) with FragmentTransaction.setCustomAnimations as well as FragmentTransaction.setTransition.Here\'s an example on using setCustomAnimations from ApiDemos\' FragmentHideShow.java:and here\'s the relevant animator XML from res/animator/fade_in.xml:Note that you can combine multiple animators using <set>, just as you could with the older animation framework.EDIT: Since folks are asking about slide-in/slide-out, I\'ll comment on that here.You can of course animate the translationX, translationY, x, and y properties, but generally slides involve animating content to and from off-screen. As far as I know there aren\'t any transition properties that use relative values. However, this doesn\'t prevent you from writing them yourself. Remember that property animations simply require getter and setter methods on the objects you\'re animating (in this case views), so you can just create your own getXFraction and setXFraction methods on your view subclass, like this:Now you can animate the \'xFraction\' property, like this:res/animator/slide_in.xml:Note that if the object you\'re animating in isn\'t the same width as its parent, things won\'t look quite right, so you may need to tweak your property implementation to suit your use case.I have done this way:Add this method to replace fragments with Animations:You have to add four animations in anim folder which is associate with resource:enter_from_left.xml:exit_to_right.xml:enter_from_right.xml:exit_to_left.xml:Output:Its Done. Nurik\'s answer was very helpful, but I couldn\'t get it to work until I found this. In short, if you\'re using the compatibility library (eg SupportFragmentManager instead of FragmentManager), the syntax of the XML animation files will be different. If you can afford to tie yourself to just Lollipop and later, this seems to do the trick:Hope this helps.Here\'s a slide in/out animation between fragments:We are using an objectAnimator.Here are the two xml files in the animator subfolder.enter_anim.xmlexit_anim.xmlI hope that would help someone.Android SDK implementation of FragmentTransaction wants an Animator while support library wants an Animation, don\'t ask me why but after strangeluk\'s comment I looked into android 4.0.3 code and support library.\nAndroid SDK uses loadAnimator() and support library uses loadAnimation()For anyone else who gets caught, ensure setCustomAnimations is called before the call to replace/add when building the transaction.
