I want to take two lists and find the values that appear in both.would return [5], for instance.Not the most efficient one, but by far the most obvious way to do it is:if order is significant you can do it with list comprehensions like this:(only works for equal-sized lists, which order-significance implies).Use set.intersection(), it\'s fast and readable.A quick performance test showing Lutz\'s solution is the best:These are the results on my machine:Obviously, any artificial performance test should be taken with a grain of salt, but since the set().intersection() answer is at least as fast as the other solutions, and also the most readable, it should be the standard solution for this common problem.I prefer the set based answers, but here\'s one that works anywayThe easiest way to do that is to use sets:Quick way:Also you can try this,by keeping common elements in a new list. Do you want duplicates? If not maybe you should use sets instead:You can use You can use:Output:Can use itertools.product too.another a bit more functional way to check list equality for list 1 (lst1) and list 2 (lst2) where objects have depth one and which keeps the order is:If you want a boolean value:Using __and__ attribute method also works.or simply
