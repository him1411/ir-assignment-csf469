I have a Homebrew package that I wish to uninstall / remove with all its dependencies, skipping packages whom other packages depend upon.e.g. Uninstall package a which depends on packages b & c, where package d also depends on package c. The result should uninstall both a & b, skipping c.How can I do that?There must be a way to uninstall a package without leaving unnecessary junk behind.It looks like the issue is now solved using an external command called brew rmdeps or brew rmtree.To install and use, issue the following commands:See the above link for more information and discussion.It appears that currently, there\'s no easy way to accomplish this.However, I filed an issue on Homebrew\'s GitHub page, and somebody suggested a temporary solution until they add an exclusive command to solve this.There\'s an external command called brew leaves which prints all packages that are not dependencies of other packages.If you do a logical and on the output of brew leaves and brew deps <package>, you might just get a list of the orphaned dependency packages, which you can uninstall manually afterwards. Combine this with xargs and you\'ll get what you need, I guess (untested, don\'t count on this).EDIT: Somebody just suggested a very similar solution, using join instead of xargs:See the comment on the issue mentioned above for more info.The goal here is to remove the given package and its dependencies without breaking another package\'s dependencies. I use this command:Note: Edited to reflect @alphadogg\'s helpful comment.Using this answer requires that you create and maintain a file that contains the package names you want installed on your system.  If you don\'t have one already, use the following command and delete the package names what you don\'t want to keep installed.Then you can remove all installed, but unwanted packages and any unnecessary dependencies by running the following commandbrew_clean is available here: https://gist.github.com/cskeeters/10ff1295bca93808213dThis script gets all of the packages you specified in brew_packages and all of their dependancies and compares them against the output of brew list and finally removes the unwanted packages after verifying this list with the user.At this point if you want to remove package a, you simply remove it from the brew_packages file then re-run brew_clean brew_packages.  It will remove b, but not c.Based on @jfmercer answer (corrections needed more than a comment).Remove package\'s dependencies (does not remove package):Remove package:Reinstall missing libraries:Tested uninstalling meld after discovering MeldMerge releases.You can just use a UNIX pipe for thisbrew rmtree doesn\'t work at all. From the links on that issue I found rmrec which actually does work. God knows why brew doesn\'t have this as a native command.
