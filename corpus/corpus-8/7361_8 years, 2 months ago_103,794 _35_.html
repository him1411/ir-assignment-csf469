How can I create a list where when you reach the end of the list I am notified so I can load more items?  One solution is to implement an OnScrollListener and make changes (like adding items, etc.) to the ListAdapter at a convenient state in its onScroll method.The following ListActivity shows a list of integers, starting with 40, adding items when the user scrolls to the end of the list.You should obviously use separate threads for long running actions (like loading web-data)  and might want to indicate progress in the last list item (like the market or gmail apps do).Just wanted to contribute a solution that I used for my app.It is also based on the OnScrollListener interface, but I found it to have a much better scrolling performance on low-end devices, since none of the visible/total count calculations are carried out during the scroll operations.Add the following methods to that class:where currentPage is the page of your datasource that should be added to your list, and threshold is the number of list items (counted from the end) that should, if visible, trigger the loading process. If you set threshold to 0, for instance, the user has to scroll to the very end of the list in order to load more items.(optional) As you can see, the "load-more check" is only called when the user stops scrolling. To improve usability, you may inflate and add a loading indicator to the end of the list via listView.addFooterView(yourFooterView). One example for such a footer view:(optional) Finally, remove that loading indicator by calling listView.removeFooterView(yourFooterView) if there are no more items or pages.You can detect end of the list with help of onScrollListener, working code is presented below:Another way to do that (inside adapter) is as following:Be aware that this method will be called many times, so you need to add another condition to block multiple calls of addMoreData().When you add all elements to the list, please call notifyDataSetChanged() inside yours adapter to update the View (it should be run on UI thread - runOnUiThread)At Ognyan Bankov GitHub i found a simple and working solution! It makes use of  the Volley HTTP library that makes networking for Android apps easier and most importantly, faster. Volley is available through the open AOSP repository.The given code demonstrates:For future consistence i forked Bankov\'s repo.Here is a solution that also makes it easy to show a loading view in the end of the ListView while it\'s loading.You can see the classes here:https://github.com/CyberEagle/OpenProjects/blob/master/android-projects/widgets/src/main/java/br/com/cybereagle/androidwidgets/helper/ListViewWithLoadingIndicatorHelper.java\n- Helper to make it possible to use the features without extending from SimpleListViewWithLoadingIndicator.https://github.com/CyberEagle/OpenProjects/blob/master/android-projects/widgets/src/main/java/br/com/cybereagle/androidwidgets/listener/EndlessScrollListener.java\n- Listener that starts loading data when the user is about to reach the bottom of the ListView.https://github.com/CyberEagle/OpenProjects/blob/master/android-projects/widgets/src/main/java/br/com/cybereagle/androidwidgets/view/SimpleListViewWithLoadingIndicator.java\n- The EndlessListView. You can use this class directly or extend from it.May be a little late but the following solution happened very useful in my case.\nIn a way all you need to do is add to your ListView a Footer and create for it addOnLayoutChangeListener.http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ListView.html#addFooterView(android.view.View)For example:This event fires once when a footer becomes visible and works like a charm.The key of this problem is to detect the load-more event, start an async request for data and then update the list. Also an adapter with loading indicator and other decorators is needed. In fact, the problem is very complicated in some corner cases. Just a OnScrollListener implementation is not enough, because sometimes the items do not fill the screen.I have written a personal package which support endless list for RecyclerView, and also provide a async loader implementation AutoPagerFragment which makes it very easy to get data from a multi-page source. It can load any page you want into a RecyclerView on a custom event, not only the next page.Here is the address: https://github.com/SphiaTower/AutoPagerRecyclerManagerBest solution so far that I have seen is in FastAdapter library for recycler views. It has a EndlessRecyclerOnScrollListener. Here is an example usage: EndlessScrollListActivityOnce I used it for endless scrolling list I have realised that the setup is a very robust. I\'d definitely recommend it.I\'ve been working in another solution very similar to that, but, I am using a footerView to give the possibility to the user download more elements clicking the footerView, I am using a "menu" which is shown above the ListView and in the bottom of the parent view, this "menu" hides the bottom of the ListView, so, when the listView is scrolling the menu disappear and when scroll state is idle, the menu appear again, but when the user scrolls to the end of the listView, I "ask" to know if the footerView is shown in that case, the menu doesn\'t appear and the user can see the footerView to load more content. Here the code:Regards.
