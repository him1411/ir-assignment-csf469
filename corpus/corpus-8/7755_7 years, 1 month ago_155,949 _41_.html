Is there a nice easy way to drop all tables from a MySQL database, ignoring any foreign key constraints that may be in there?I found the generated set of drop statements useful, and recommend these tweaks:"RESTRICT and CASCADE are permitted to make porting easier. In MySQL 5.5, they do nothing."Therefore, in order for the drop statements to work if you need:This will disable referential integrity checks - so when you are done performing the drops you need, you will want to reset key checking withFrom http://www.devdaily.com/blog/post/mysql/drop-mysql-tables-in-any-order-foreign-keys:(Note that this answers how to disable foreign key checks in order to be able to drop the tables in arbitrary order. It does not answer how to automatically generate drop-table statements for all existing tables and execute them in a single script. Jean\'s answer does.)Here is SurlyDre\'s stored procedure modified so that foreign keys are ignored:Here\'s a cursor based solution.  Kinda lengthy but works as a single SQL batch:From this answer,execute:This drops tables from the database currently in use. You can set current database using use.Or otherwise, Dion\'s accepted answer is simpler, except you need to execute it twice, first to get the query, and second to execute the query. I provided some silly back-ticks to escape special characters in db and table names.You can do:Then run the generated queries. They will drop every single table on the current database.Here is some help on drop table command.I came up with this modification on Dion Truter\'s answer to make it easier with many tables:This returns the entire thing in one field, so you can copy once and delete all the tables (use Copy Field Content (unquoted) in Workbench). If you have a LOT of tables, you may hit some limits on GROUP_CONCAT(). If so, increase the max len variable (and max_allowed_packet, if necessary).If in linux (or any other system that support piping, echo and grep) you can do it with one line:I know this is an old question, but I think this method is fast and simple.every approach above includes a lot more work than this one AFAICT...Here is an automated way to do this via a bash script:In php its as easy as:Just remember to change YOURDB to the name of your database, and obviously the user/pass.In a Linux shell like bash/zsh:This will generate the commands, then immediately pipe them to a 2nd client instance which will delete the tables.The clever bit is of course copied from other answers here - I just wanted a copy-and-pasteable one-liner (ish) to actually do the job the OP wanted.Note of course you\'ll have to put your credentials in (twice) in these mysql commands, too, unless you have a very low security setup. (or you could alias your mysql command to include your creds.)This is a pretty old post, but none of the answers here really answered the question in my opinion, so I hope my post will help people!I found this solution on another question that works really well for me:That will actually empty all your tables in the database DB_NAME, and not only display the TRUNCATE command line.Hope this helps!A one liner to drop all tables from a given database:Running this will drop all tables from database DATABASE_NAME.And a nice thing about this is that the database name is only written explicitly once.Building on the answer by @Dion Truter and @Wade Williams, the following shell script will drop all tables, after first showing what it is about to run, and giving you a chance to abort using Ctrl-C.I use the following with a MSSQL server:Replace YOUR_DATABASE with the name of your database or remove the entire IF statement (I like the added safety).Best solution for me so farSelect Database -> Right Click -> Tasks -> Generate Scripts - will open wizard for generating scripts. After choosing objects in set Scripting option click Advanced Button. Under "Script DROP and CREATE" select Script DROP.Run script.
