Possible Duplicate:\n  C++: When Has The volatile Keyword Ever Helped You? I have never used it but I wonder why people use it? What does it exactly do? I searched the forum, I found it only C# or Java topics.Consider this code,When this program gets compiled, the compiler may optimize this code, if it finds that the program never ever makes any attempt to change the value of some_int, so it may be tempted to optimize the while loop by changing it from while(some_int == 100) to simply while(true) so that the execution could be fast (since the condition in while loop appears to be true always). (if the compiler doesn\'t optimize it, then it has to fetch the value of some_int (if it\'s not loaded on a register) and compare it with 100, each time which obviously is a little bit slow.)However, sometimes, optimization (of some parts of your program) may be undesirable, because it may be that someone else is changing the value of some_int from outside the program which compiler is not aware of, since it can\'t see it; but it\'s how you\'ve designed it. In that case, compiler\'s optimization would not produce the desired result!So, to ensure the desired result, you need to somehow stop the compiler from optimizing the while loop. That is where the volatile keyword plays its role. All you need to do is this,In others words I would explain this as follows:volatile tells the compiler that, "Hey compiler, I\'m volatile and, you\n  know, I can be changed by some XYZ\n  that you\'re not even aware of. That\n  XYZ could be anything. Maybe some\n  alien outside this planet called\n  program. Maybe some lighting, some\n  form of interrupt, volcanoes, etc can\n  mutate me. Maybe. You never know who\n  is going to change me! So O you\n  ignorant, stop playing an all-knowing\n  god, and don\'t dare touch the code\n  where I\'m present. Okay?"Well, that is how volatile prevents compiler from optimizing code. Now google it to see some sample examples.Quoting from the C++ Standard ($7.1.5.1/8)[..] volatile is a hint to the\n  implementation to avoid aggressive\n  optimization involving the object\n  because the value of the object might\n  be changed by means undetectable by an\n  implementation.[...]Related topic:Does making a struct volatile make all its members volatile?In computer programming, particularly in the C, C++, and C# programming languages, a variable or object declared with the volatile keyword usually has special properties related to optimization and/or threading. Generally speaking, the volatile keyword is intended to prevent the (pseudo)compiler from applying any optimizations on the code that assume values of variables cannot change "on their own."
