In Bash, if VAR="/home/me/mydir/file.c", how do I get "/home/me/mydir"?dirname and basename are the tools you\'re looking for for extracting path components:They\'re not internal Bash commands but they\'re part of the POSIX standard (see dirname, basename) and so should be available on the vast majority of systems that will be running Bash.To avoid dependency with basename and dirnameOn a related note, if you only have the filename or relative path, dirname on its own won\'t help. For me, the answer ended up being readlink.You can then combine the two to get just the directory.If you care target files to be symbolic link, firstly you can check it and get the original file. The if clause below may help you.I was playing with this and came up with an alternative.The part I liked is it was easy to extend backup the tree:Here is a script I used for recursive trimming. Replace $1 with the directory you want, of course.
