I changed several things over the last hour and committed them step by step. But I just realized I\'ve forgot to add a changed file some commits ago.The Log looks like this:Any ideas? :)Use git rebase. Specifically:To "fix" an old commit with a small change, without changing the commit message of the old commit, where OLDCOMMIT is something like 091b73a:You can also use git commit --squash=OLDCOMMIT to edit the old commit message during rebase.See git commit and git rebase. As always, when rewriting git history, you should only fixup or squash commits you have not yet published to anyone else (including random internet users and build servers).with git 1.7, there\'s a really easy way using git rebase:stage your files:create a new commit and re-use commit message of your "broken" commitprepend fixup! in the subject line (or squash! if you want to edit commit (message)):use git rebase -i --autosquash to fixup your commitYou can try a rebase --interactive session to amend your old commit (provided you did not already push those commits to another repo).Sometimes the thing fixed in b.2. cannot be amended to the not-quite perfect commit it fixes, because that commit is buried deeply in a patch series.\n  That is exactly what interactive rebase is for: use it after plenty of "a"s and "b"s, by rearranging and editing commits, and squashing multiple commits into one.Start it with the last commit you want to retain as-is:An editor will be fired up with all the commits in your current branch (ignoring merge commits), which come after the given commit.\n  You can reorder the commits in this list to your heart\'s content, and you can remove them. The list looks more or less like this:The oneline descriptions are purely for your pleasure; git rebase will not look at them but at the commit names ("deadbee" and "fa1afe1" in this example), so do not delete or edit the names.By replacing the command "pick" with the command "edit", you can tell git rebase to stop after applying that commit, so that you can edit the files and/or the commit message, amend the commit, and continue rebasing.
