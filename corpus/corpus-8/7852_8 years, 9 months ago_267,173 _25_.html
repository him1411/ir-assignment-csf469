I have a bunch of log files. I need to find out how many times a string occurs in all files.returnsUsing a pipe I was able to get only files that have one or more occurrences:How can I get only the combined count? (If it returns file4:5, file5:1, file6:2, I want to get back 8.)This works for multiple occurrences per line:will count multiple occurrences in a line  Instead of using -c, just pipe it to wc -l.This will list each occurrence on a single line and then count the number of lines.This will miss instances where the string occurs 2+ times on one line, though.One of the rare useful applications of cat.Something different than all the previous answers:Obligatory AWK solution:Take care if your file names include ":" though.The AWK solution which also handles file names including colons:Keep in mind that this method still does not find multiple occurrences of string on the same line.You can add -R to search recursively (and not use cat) and -I to ignore binary files.Another oneliner using basic command line functions handling multiple occurences per line. Grep only solution which I tested with grep for windows:This solution will count all occurrences even if there are multiple on one line. -r recursively searches the directory, -o will "show only the part of a line matching PATTERN" -- this is what splits up multiple occurences on a single line and makes grep print each match on a new line; then pipe those newline-separated-results back into grep with -c to count the number of occurrences using the same pattern.Here is a faster-than-grep AWK alternative way of doing this, which handles multiple matches of <url> per line, within a collection of XML files in a directory:This works well in cases where some XML files don\'t have line breaks.You can use a simple grep to capture the number of occurrences effectively. I will use the -i option to make sure STRING/StrING/string get captured properly.Command line that gives the files\' name:Command line that removes the file names and prints 0 if there is a file without occurrences:short recursive variant:
