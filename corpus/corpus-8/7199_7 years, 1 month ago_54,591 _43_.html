Is there anyway to copy/paste (desktop\'s) clipboard content to EditView on Android Emulator?  (just for the sake to ease development/test)With v25.3.x of the Android Emulator & x86 Google API Emulator system images API Level 19 (Android 4.4 - Kitkat) and higher, you can simply copy and paste from your desktop with your mouse or keyboard.This feature was announced with Android Studio 2.3 In a terminal, type adb shell input text \'my string here. With some characters escaped like \\$ that\' Note that an alternative method for including spaces in the text is to substitute %s for each space character.I usually send the text I want to copy as an sms message through telnet and then copy the text from the sms message. Here\'s how:Connect through telnet:(5554 is the default port. The title bar of the emulator shows the port that is being used, so you can see if it\'s different).Send message:(You can just make up the senders phone number)This works really well for links as the message is automatically converted into a hyperlink which you can click without having to copy / paste it into the browser.Once the emulator receives the message you can copy it and paste it wherever you like.maybe a little bit tricky, but you could send an sms to the emulator by using the emulator control. then you do not have to retype all the text if it is longer and can copy-paste it in the emulator.another way: connect to emulator via "telnet localhost PORT"\nand then use hardware event sending to send a text input event to the emulator (needs to be UTF-8). look at thisHave you looked at C2DM? chrome2phone and fox2phone can send links and clipboard text and automatically copy it on the phone.\nAlso, try using the adb shell. There\'s a service command (/system/bin/service) which can use services (service call clipboard ...). The transaction codes are 1, 2, and 3, for getClipboardText, setClipboardText, and hasClipboardText respectively.Using Visual Studio Emulator, Here\'s my method.First Mound a virtual sd card:Set up a text file to transfer text:Whenever I need to send text to the clip board.Once set up it pretty easy to repeat. The same method would be applicable to other emulators by you may need to use a different method to push your text file to emulator.(converting comment discussion to answer)only solution on windows: https://github.com/gcb/AdbPastewrote it in a couple hours to work around this problem. I am now back on 100% linux, so feel free to join it as a contributor or maintainer!If you are using Android Studio on a Mac, you may need to provide the full path to the adb executable. To find this path, open:Copy the path to the SDK location. The adb executable will be within a platform-tools directory. For me, this was the path:Now you can run this command:I got tired of this problem so I just made this alias to handle it:Then when you open a new terminal window, typing "ap" will paste whatever is on your clipboard into the emulator\'s actively selected text field.Simply add this to your profile (for most users that\'s ~/.bash_profile for zsh users that\'s ~/.zshrc) to make the alias available everywhere. Alternatively, if you\'re a bash user (the default for MacOS), then you can run the following command in the terminal to set it up for you:Write command: adb devices (it will list the device currently connected)\nSelect Textbox where you want to write text.\nWrite command: adb shell input text "Yourtext" (make sure only one device is connected to run this command)\nDone!Not sure if that\'s useful, but, if you need a long URL from desktop browser to be opened in mobile browser, you can send SMS with that URL and open directly from message app.Made this Windows application that allows users to copy paste to Android emulators or connected devices from a visual interface.\nhttps://github.com/Florin-Birgu/Android-Copy-PasteI came here looking for a solution to the same problem, and ended up writing an Android application to solve this problem. You can download it at http://www.box.net/shared/6203bn441bfltkimajmk. Just give a URL via Preferences menu to point to a place where you can change the Web response easily. The first line of the Web response will be copied to your emulator\'s clipboard for you. More details can be found at http://agilesc.barryku.com/?p=255.For Mac and Linux try this function in your aliases_bash file (located in /etc/aliases_bash for Mac folks, be sure to use sudo vim /etc/aliases_bash)Then in the command line enter:\'Your text to emulator input\' will be input on the emulator text field.Kudos to Eliot for his substitution string for sed.On Linux this will paste text directly from the clipboardAlso it very useful to create global keyboard shortkey with this command for example Ctrl+Shift+Super+V
