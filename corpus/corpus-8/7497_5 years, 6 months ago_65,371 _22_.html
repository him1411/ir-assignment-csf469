I never understood it from the contrived unmarshalling and verbing nouns ( an AddTwo class has an apply that adds two!) examples.I understand that it\'s syntactic sugar, so (I deduced from context) it must have been designed to make some code more intuitive.What meaning does a class with an apply function give? What is it used for, and what purposes does it make code better (unmarshalling, verbing nouns etc)?how does it help when used in a companion object?Mathematicians have their own little funny ways, so instead of saying "then we call function f passing it x as a parameter" as we programmers would say, they talk about "applying function f to its argument x". In mathematics and computer science, Apply is a function that applies\n  functions to arguments.\n   Wikipediaapply serves the purpose of closing the gap between Object-Oriented and Functional paradigms in Scala. Every function in Scala can be represented as an object. Every function also has an OO type: for instance, a function that takes an Int parameter and returns an Int will have OO type of Function1[Int,Int].Since everything is an object in Scala f can now be treated as a reference to Function1[Int,Int] object. For example, we can call toString method inherited from Any, that would have been impossible for a pure function, because functions don\'t have methods:Or we could define another  Function1[Int,Int] object by calling compose method on f and chaining two different functions together:Now if we want to actually execute the function, or as mathematician say "apply a function to its arguments" we would call the apply method on the Function1[Int,Int] object:Writing f.apply(args) every time you want to execute a function represented as an object is the Object-Oriented way, but would add a lot of clutter to the code without adding much additional information and it would be nice to be able to use more standard notation, such as f(args). That\'s where Scala compiler steps in and whenever we have a reference f to a function object and write f (args) to apply arguments to the represented function the compiler silently expands f (args) to the object method call f.apply (args).Every function in Scala can be treated as an object and it works the other way too - every object can be treated as a function, provided it has the apply method. Such objects can be used in the function notation:There are many usage cases when we would want to treat an object as a function. The most common scenario is a factory pattern. Instead of adding clutter to the code using a factory method we can apply object to a set of arguments to create a new instance of an associated class:So apply method is just a handy way of closing the gap between functions and objects in Scala.It comes from the idea that you often want to apply something to an object. The more accurate example is the one of factories. When you have a factory, you want to apply parameter to it to create an object.Scala guys thought that, as it occurs in many situation, it could be nice to have a shortcut to call apply. Thus when you give parameters directly to an object, it\'s desugared as if you pass these parameters to the apply function of that object:It\'s often use in companion object, to provide a nice factory method for a class or a trait, here is an example:From the scala standard library, you might look at how scala.collection.Seq is implemented: Seq is a trait, thus new Seq(1, 2) won\'t compile but thanks to companion object and apply, you can call Seq(1, 2) and the implementation is chosen by the companion object.Here is a small example for those who want to peruse quicklyoutputA greeter-1 is being instantiated with message helloA greeter-2 is being instantiated with message world
