When I clean and then build my solution that has several projects, the output window reports that the build succeeded. However, when I view the Error List Window, it shows me this warning:Found conflicts between different versions of the same dependent assembly that could not be resolved.  These reference conflicts are listed in the build log when log verbosity is set to detailed.    C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MSBuild\\12.0\\bin\\Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targetsWhen I double-click this message, it opens the C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MSBuild\\12.0\\bin\\Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets file but I don\'t understand anything in it.I am using Visual Studio Express 2013 for the Web.How do I find out what\'s wrong and with which DLL and how do I then make the warning go away?While the other responses say this, they don\'t make it explicit, so I will....On VS2013.2, to actually trigger the emission of the cited information, you need to not read the message, which says:C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MSBuild\\12.0\\bin\\Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets(1697,5): warning MSB3277: Found conflicts between different versions of the same dependent assembly that could not be resolved.  These reference conflicts are listed in the build log when log verbosity is set to detailed.This is incorrect (or at least it was for some versions of Visual Studio - it seems to be OK on an up to date VS2015 Update 3 or later). Instead turn it to Diagnostic (from Tools->Options->Project and Solutions->Build and Run, set MSBuild project build output verbosity), whereupon you\'ll see messages such as:There was a conflict between "Newtonsoft.Json, Version=6.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=30ad4fe6b2a6aeed" and "Newtonsoft.Json, Version=6.0.5.17707, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=30ad4fe6b2a6aeed".Then...And yes, for those looking at the detail of the [diagnostic] message, it was news to this ignoramus that there\'s a convention in town whereby all 6.x versions are, internally Assembly Version 6.0.0.0, i.e. only the SemVer Major component goes into the Assembly Version :)Run msbuild Foo.sln /t:Rebuild /v:diag (from C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MSBuild\\12.0\\bin) to build your solution from command line and get a bit more details, then find the .csproj. that logs the warning and check its references and references of other projects that use the same common assembly that differs in version.Edit: You can also set the build verbosity directly in VS2013. Go to Tools > Options menu then go to Projects and Solutions and set MSBuild verbosity to Diagnostic.Edit: Few clarifications as I just got one myself. In my case warning was due to me adding a reference using Resharper prompt as opposed to the Add Reference dialog, which did it versionless even though both v4 and v12 are available to choose from.vsIn the MSBuild log with /v:diag verbosity it looked like the following. giving details which two references conflicted:-I can only support further Ruben\'s answer with a comparison between the two messages displayed:and the message:C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MSBuild\\12.0\\bin\\Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets(1697,5): warning MSB3277: Found conflicts between different versions of the same dependent assembly that could not be resolved.  These reference conflicts are listed in the build log when log verbosity is set to detailed.So, Ruben\'s right\xe2\x80\x94this is just not true. There are no conflicts whatsoever, just a missing assembly. This is especially boring when the project is an ASP.NET application, since the views are compiled on demand, that is, just before displayed for the first time. This is when it becomes necessary to have the assembly available. (There\'s an option to pre-compile the views together with the rest of the code, but this is another story.) On the other hand, if you set the verbosity to Diagnostic you get the following output:C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MSBuild\\12.0\\bin\\Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets(1697,5): warning MSB3245: Could not resolve this reference. Could not locate the assembly "System.Web.Razor, Version=3.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35, processorArchitecture=MSIL". Check to make sure the assembly exists on disk. If this reference is required by your code, you may get compilation errors.As a result, all you need to do is either:More about NuGet gallery here. \nMore about precompiling ASP.NET views here.and how do I then make the warning go away?You are probably going to have to reinstall or upgrade your NuGet packages to fix this.Reiterating one of the comments from @elshev\nRight click on the solution -> Manage NuGet packages for solution -> Under Consolidate you can see if there are different versions of the same package was installed. Update the packages there. The conflict error is resolved.As stated in dotnet CLI issue 6583 the issue should be solved with dotnet nuget locals --clear all command.I could solve this installing Newtonsoft Json in the web project with nugget packagesI found that, sometimes, nuget packages will install (what I\'m guessing are) .NET Core required components or other items that conflict with the already-installed framework. My solution there was to open the project (.csproj) file and remove those references. For example, System.IO, System.Threading and such, tend to be added when Microsoft.Bcl is included via some recently installed NuGet package.\xc2\xa0There\'s no reason for\xc2\xa0specific versions of those in my projects, so I remove the references and the project builds. Hope that helps.You can search your project file for "reference" and remove the conflicts. If they\'re included in System, get rid of them, and\xc2\xa0the build should work. This may not answer all cases of this issue - I\'m making sure you know what worked for me :)Example of what I commented out:If you made any changes to packages -- reopen the sln. This worked for me!I have uninstalled Microsoft ASP.NET MVC nuget.org from manage NuGet Packagaes and again re-installed it. While re-installing it resolved all the conflicts related to razor version. Try it .I changed the  MSBuild verbosity to Diagnostic.but couldn\'t find where the problem was so according to the answers above I had this code in app.config:So I just changed the first System, Version from 4.0.0.0 to 12.0.0.0 and my project worked.As per the other answers, set the output logging level to detailed and search there for conflicts, that will tell you where to look next.In my case, it sent me off in a few directions looking for the source of the references, but in the end it turned out that the problem was one of my portable class library projects, it was targeting the wrong version and was pulling its own version of the references in, hence the conflicts. A quick re-target and the problem was solved.I just ran into this and the problem after switching a package from nuget to locally referenced dlls. The issue was old runtime binding stuff in app.config.Obviously there\'s a lot of different causes and thus a lot of solutions for this problem. To throw mine into the mix, we upgraded an assembly (System.Net.Http) that was previously directly referenced in our Web project to a version managed by NuGet. This removed the direct reference within that project, but our Test project still contained the direct reference. Upgrading both projects to use the NuGet-managed assembly resolved the issue.Run Update-Package command via Package Manager ConsoleThis will fix MSB3277, what it does it reinstall all the packages and all related assemblies they come with to the highest version possible. It is also possible to update just specific package. Or downgrade after update if wanted, this fixed issue for me few times it came up. Depending on how many nuget packages you have, this process may take few minutes.More info on official docs https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/reinstalling-and-updating-packages
