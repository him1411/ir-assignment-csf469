After looking (Googling) on the web for a while I can find nothing that takes a address like:1200 Pennsylvania Ave SE, \nWashington, District of Columbia, 20003and converts it into a clickable link:http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&q=1200+Pennsylvania+Ave+SE,+Washington,+District+of+Columbia,+20003&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=44.118686,114.169922&ie=UTF8&cd=1&geocode=FT5MUQIdIDlp-w&split=0&ll=38.882147,-76.99017&spn=0.01064,0.027874&z=16&iwloc=AjQuery or PHP preferred or just any useful information on this.How about this?https://maps.google.com/?q=1200 Pennsylvania Ave SE, Washington, District of Columbia, 20003I know I\'m very late to the game, but thought I\'d contribute for posterity\'s sake.I wrote a short jQuery function that will automatically turn any <address> tags into Google maps links.See a demo here.I also came across a situation that called for generating embedded maps from the links, and though I\'d share with future travelers:View a full demoFeb, 2016:I needed to do this based on client entered database values and without a lat/long generator. Google really likes lat/long these days. Here is what I learned:1\nThe beginning of the link looks like this:\nhttps://www.google.com/maps/place/2\nThen you put your address:3\nPut the address after the place/4\nThen put a slash at the end. NOTE: The slash at the end was important. After the user clicks the link, Google goes ahead and appends more to the URL and they do it after this slash.Working example for this question:https://www.google.ca/maps/place/1200+Pennsylvania+Ave+SE,+Washington,+DC+20003/I hope that helps. What about this :\nhttp://support.google.com/maps/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=72644On http://www.labnol.org/internet/tools/short-urls-for-google-maps/6604/ they show a short URL that works pretty wellGoogle Maps URLs are pretty unwieldy especially when sending over an IM, tweet or email. MapOf.it provides you a quick way to link to Google Maps by simply specifying the address of the location as a search parameter.http://mapof.it/I used it for a few applications I\'ve designed and it worked like a charm.Also, anyone wanting to manually URLENCODE the address: http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/webservices/index.html#BuildingURLsYou can use that to create specific rules that meet GM standards.the encode ur conver and adds all the extra elements like for spaces and all. so u can easily fetch plane text code from db and use it without worring about the special characters to be addedThe best way is to use this line:Remember to replace the first and second addresses when necessary.You can look at work sampleI had a similar issue where I needed to accomplish this for every address on the site (each wrapped in an address tag). This bit of jQuery worked for me. It\'ll grab each <address> tag and wrap it in a google maps link with the address the tag contains contains!  Working example --> https://jsfiddle.net/f3kx6mzz/1/This is what I found from one of the Google Maps articles: Note: If you\'re using Maps in Lite mode, you won\'t be able to embed a map.\n  Keep in mind that traffic information and some other Maps info might not be available in the embedded map.The C# Replace method usually works for me:I just found this and like to share..Borrowing from Michael Jasper\'s and Jon Hendershot\'s solutions, I offer the following:This solution offers the following benefits over solutions previously offered:Caveat: If your <address> tag contains block-level elements like <p> or <div>, then this JavaScript code will produce in invalid markup (because the <a> tag will contain those block-level elements). But if you\'re just doing stuff like this:Then it\'ll work just fine.With this map tool you can enter an address, click the Find button, zoom in, make a note for yourself or for others to read, and get a short URL link to your map, which you can email or text-message to someone else.Here is a map I made using the address you gave:\nhttp://www.sooeet.com/ses06468The map tool is here:\nhttp://www.sooeet.com/maps/place-marker-map.phpIt does everything you want, and you get latitude and longitude too.use www.linkonmap.com to get quickly a comprehensive link to any world location.
