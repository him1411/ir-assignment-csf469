Take a look at this code:I\'m looking for something like this so that:Is there a function to do this? (because array_push won\'t work this way)Nope, there is no array_push() equivalent for associative arrays because there is no way determine the next key. You\'ll have to usePushing a value into an array automatically creates a numeric key for it.When adding a key-value pair to an array, you already have the key, you don\'t need one to be created for you. Pushing a key into an array doesn\'t make sense. You can only set the value of the specific key in the array.You can use the union operator (+) to combine arrays and keep the keys of the added array. For example:So you could do $_GET += array(\'one\' => 1);. There\'s more info on the usage of the union operator vs array_merge in the documentation at http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-merge.php.Exactly what Pekka said...Alternatively, you can probably use array_merge like this if you wanted:But I\'d prefer Pekka\'s method probably as it is much simpler.I would like to add my answer to the table and here it is :hope that this will help somebodyI was just looking for the same thing and I realized that, once again, my thinking is different because I am old school. I go all the way back to BASIC and PERL and sometimes I forget how easy things really are in PHP.I just made this function to take all settings from the database where their are 3 columns. setkey, item (key) & value (value) and place them into an array called settings using the same key/value without using push just like above.Pretty easy & simple reallySo like the other posts explain... In php there is no need to "PUSH" an array when you are using Key => ValueAND... There is no need to define the array first either. $array=array();Don\'t need to define or push. Just assign $array[$key] = $value; It is automatically a push and a declaration at the same time.I must add that for security reasons, (P)oor (H)elpless (P)rotection, I means Programming for Dummies, I mean PHP.... hehehe I suggest that you only use this concept for what I intended. Any other method could be a security risk. There, made my disclaimer!This is the solution that may useful for uA bit weird, but this worked for meA bit late but if you don\'t mind a nested array you could take this approach:To clarify, \nif you output json_encode($main_array) that will look like [{"Key":"10"}]// prints array[\'key1\'=>"value1", \'key2\'=>"value2"]I wonder why the most simpliest method hasn\'t been posted yet: It\'s the same like merging two arrays together with array_merge.hi i had same problem i find this solution you should use two arrays then combine them bothreference : w3schoolsThe simple way:http://php.net/manual/de/function.parse-str.phpThis works just fine.\ncreates the the key with its value in the array
