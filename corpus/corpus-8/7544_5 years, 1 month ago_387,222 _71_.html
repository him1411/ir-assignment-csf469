Angular does provide some support for a for loop using numbers within its HTML directives:But if your scope variable includes a range that has a dynamic number then you will need to create an empty array each time.In the controllerIn the HTMLThis works, but it is unnecessary since we won\'t be using the range array at all within the loop. Does anyone know of setting a range or a regular for min/max value? Something like:I tweaked this answer a bit and came up with this fiddle.Filter defined as:With the repeat used like this:I came up with an even simpler version, for creating a range between two defined numbers, eg. 5 to 15See demo on JSFiddleHTML:Controller:I came up with a slightly different syntax which suits me a little bit more and adds an optional lower bound as well:which you can use asorNothing but plain Javascript (you don\'t even need a controller):Very useful when mockupingFor those new to angularjs.\nThe index can be gotten by using $index.For example:Which will, when you\'re using Gloopy\'s handy filter, print:\ndo something number 0\ndo something number 1\ndo something number 2\ndo something number 3\ndo something number 4\ndo something number 5\ndo something number 6\ndo something number 7\ndo something number 8\ndo something number 9A short way of doing this would be to use Underscore.js\'s _.range() method. :)http://underscorejs.org/#rangeI use my custom ng-repeat-range directive:and html code is or simplyor even simplyor justSimplest no code solution was to init an array with the range, and use the $index + however much I want to offset by:You can use \'after\' or \'before\' filters in angular.filter module (https://github.com/a8m/angular-filter)HTML:result: \n5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10The code below defines a method range() available to the entire scope of your application MyApp. Its behaviour is very similar to the Python range() method.With one parameter:0, 1, 2,With two parameters:1, 2, 3, 4,With three parameters:-2, -1.5, -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5,JS (in your AngularJS controller)HTML...where myCount is the number of stars that should appear in this location.You can use $index for any tracking operations. E.g. if you want to print some mutation on the index, you might put the following in the div:Using UnderscoreJS:Applying this to $rootScope makes it available everywhere:Very simple one:Set Scope in controllerSet Repeat in Html Template FileAn improvement to @Mormegil\'s solutionusage3 2 1 0 -1 -2 -3-3 -2 -1 0 1 2 30 1 2 30 -1 -2 -3I tried the following and it worked just fine for me:Angular 1.3.6This is jzm\'s improved answer (i cannot comment else i would comment her/his answer because s/he included errors).\nThe function has a start/end range value, so it\'s more flexible, and... it works. This particular case is for day of month:Without any change in your controller, you can use this: Enjoy!Hi you can achieve this using pure html using AngularJS (NO Directive is required!)I whipped this up and saw it might be useful for some. (Yes, CoffeeScript. Sue me.)To use:Can this get any simpler?I\'m wary about filters because Angular likes to re-evaluate them for no good reason all the time, and it\'s a huge bottleneck if you have thousands of them like I do.This directive will even watch for changes in your model, and update the element accordingly.Late to the party. But i ended up just doing this:In your controller:Html:If you want to achieve this in html without any controller or factory.This is the simplest variant: \njust use array of integers....
