This question already has an answer here:I\'m trying to determine if a particular item in an Array of strings is an integer or not.I am .split(" ")\'ing an infix expression in String form, and then trying to split the resultant array into two arrays; one for integers, one for operators, whilst discarding parentheses, and other miscellaneous items. What would be the best way to accomplish this? I thought I might be able to find a Integer.isInteger(String arg) method or something, but no such luck.The most naive way would be to iterate over the String and make sure all the elements are valid digits for the given radix. This is about as efficient as it could possibly get, since you must look at each element at least once. I suppose we could micro-optimize it based on the radix, but for all intents and purposes this is as good as you can expect to get.Alternatively, you can rely on the Java library to have this. It\'s not exception based, and will catch just about every error condition you can think of. It will be a little more expensive (you have to create a Scanner object, which in a critically-tight loop you don\'t want to do. But it generally shouldn\'t be too much more expensive, so for day-to-day operations it should be pretty reliable.If best practices don\'t matter to you, or you want to troll the guy who does your code reviews, try this on for size:Using regular expression is better.It is not good to use NumberFormatException here if you can use if-statement instead.Or you can enlist a little help from our good friends at Apache Commons : StringUtils.isNumeric(String str)Or simplymystring.matches("\\\\d+")though it would return true for numbers larger than an intYou want to use the Integer.parseInt(String) method.As an alternative to trying to parse the string and catching NumberFormatException, you could use a regex; e.g.This is likely to be faster, especially if you precompile and reuse the regex.  However, the catch is that Integer.parseInt(str) will still fail if str represents a number that is outside range of legal int values.You can use Integer.parseInt(str) and catch the NumberFormatException if the string is not a valid integer, in the following fashion (as pointed out by all answers):However, note here that if the evaluated integer overflows, the same exception will be thrown. Your purpose was to find out whether or not, it was a valid integer. So its safer to make your own method to check for validity:You can use Integer.parseInt() or Integer.valueOf() to get the integer from the string, and catch the exception if it is not a parsable int.  You want to be sure to catch the NumberFormatException it can throw.It may be helpful to note that valueOf() will return an Integer object, not the primitive int.
