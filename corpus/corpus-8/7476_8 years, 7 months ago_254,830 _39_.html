Is it possible to simulate key press events programmatically in JavaScript?A non-jquery version that works in both webkit and gecko:If you are ok to use jQuery 1.3.1:What you can do is programmatically trigger keyevent listeners by firing keyevents. It makes sense to allow this from a sandboxed security-perspective. Using this ability, you can then apply a typical observer-pattern. You could call this method "simulating".Below is an example of how to accomplish this in the W3C DOM standard along with jQuery:This example is adapted from: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Creating_and_triggering_eventsIn jQuery:But as of recently, there is no [DOM] way to actually trigger keyevents leaving the browser-sandbox. And all major browser vendors will adhere to that security concept.As for plugins such as Adobe Flash - which are based on the NPAPI-, and permit bypassing the sandbox: these are phasing-out ; Firefox.Detailed Explanation:You cannot and you must not for security reasons (as Pekka already pointed out). You will always require a user interaction in between. Additionally imagine the chance of the browser vendors getting sued by users, as various programmatic keyboard events will have led to spoofing attacks.See this post for alternatives and more details. There is always the flash based copy-and-paste. Here is an elegant  example. At the same time it is a testimony why the web is moving away from plugin vendors.There is a similar security mindset applied in case of the opt-in CORS policy to access remote content programmatically.The answer is:\nThere is no way to programmatically trigger input keys in the sandboxed browser environment under normal circumstances. Bottomline: I am not saying it will not be possible in the future, under special browser-modes and/or privileges towards the end-goal of gaming, or similar user-experiences. However prior to entering such modes, the user will be asked for permissions and risks, similar to the Fullscreen API model. Useful: In the context of KeyCodes, this tool and keycode mapping will come in handy.Disclosure: The answer is based on the answer here.You can use dispatchEvent():I didn\'t test this, but it\'s adapted from the code on dispatchEvent()\'s documentation.  You\'ll probably want to read through that, and also the docs for createEvent() and initKeyEvent().You can create and dispatch keyboard events, and they will trigger appropriate registered event handlers, however they will not produce any text, if dispatched to input element for example.To fully simulate text input you need to produce a sequence of keyboard events plus explicitly set the text of input element. The sequence of events depends on how thoroughly you want to simulate text input.The simplest form would be:Building on the answer from alex2k8,  here\'s a revised version that works in all browsers that jQuery supports (the problem was in missing arguments to jQuery.event.trigger, which is easy to forget when using that internal function).You could even push this further and let it not only simulate the event but actually insert the character (if it is an input element), however there are many cross-browser gotcha\'s when trying to do that. Better use a more elaborate plugin like SendKeys.You can dispatch keyboard events on an element like this This approach support cross-browser changing the value of key code.\nSourceFor those interested, you can, in-fact recreate keyboard input events reliably.  In order to change text in input area (move cursors, or the page via an input character) you have to follow the DOM event model closely: http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#h4_events-inputevents The model should do:Then for each character:Then, optionally for most:This actually changes the text in the page via javascript (without modifying value statements) and sets off any javascript listeners/handlers appropriately.  If you mess up the sequence javascript will not fire in the appropriate order, the text in the input box will not change, the selections will not change or the cursor will not move to the next space in the text area.Unfortunately the code was written for an employer under an NDA so I cannot share it, but it is definitely possible but you must recreate the entire key input "stack" for each element in the correct order.just use CustomEvent4 ex want to simulate ctrl+zHere\'s a library that really helps: https://cdn.rawgit.com/ccampbell/mousetrap/2e5c2a8adbe80a89050aaf4e02c45f02f1cc12d4/tests/libs/key-event.jsI don\'t know from where did it came from, but it is helpful. It adds a .simulate() method to window.KeyEvent, so you use it simply with KeyEvent.simulate(0, 13) for simulating an enter or KeyEvent.simulate(81, 81) for a \'Q\'.I got it at https://github.com/ccampbell/mousetrap/tree/master/tests.This worked for me and it does simulate a keyup for my textaera. if you want it for the entire page just put the KeySimulation() on <body> like this <body onmousemove="KeySimulation()"> or if not onmousemover then onmouseover or onload works too.You should be using some JS lib with support for wrapping DOM Event Model. From withing there, you can fire and test your handlers.
