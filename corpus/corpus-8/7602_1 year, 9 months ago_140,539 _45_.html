I am getting this error: Uncaught Error: Invariant Violation: Element type is invalid: expected\n  a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite\n  components) but got: object.This is my code:my Home.jsx file:In my case (using Webpack) it was the difference between:vsThe second one works while the first caused the error.you need export default or require(path).default    Have you just modularized any of your React components?  If yes, you will get this error if you forgot to specify module.exports, for example:non-modularized previously valid component/code:modularized component/code with module.exports:https://github.com/rackt/react-router/blob/e7c6f3d848e55dda11595447928e843d39bed0eb/examples/query-params/app.js#L4\nRouter is also one of the properties of react-router.\nSo change your modules require code like that:If you want to use ES6 syntax the link use(import), use babel as helper.BTW, to make your code works, we can add {this.props.children} in the App,\nlikeIf you get this error, it might be because you\'re importing link using  import { Link } from \'react-router\'instead, it might be better to use  I believe this is a requirement for the react router version 4In my case, that was caused by wrong comment symbols. This is wrong:This is correct:Notice the curly bracketsAnother possible solution, that worked for me:Currently, react-router-redux is in beta and npm returns 4.x, but not 5.x. But the @types/react-router-redux returned 5.x. So there were undefined variables used.Forcing NPM/Yarn to use 5.x solved it for me.I got this by doing import App from \'./app/\'; expecting it to import ./app/index.js, but it instead imported ./app.json.Just as a quick addition to this.  I was having the same problem and while Webpack was compiling my tests and the application was running fine.  When I was importing my component into the test file I was using the incorrect case on one of the imports and that was causing the same error.Should have beenNote that the import name myComponent depends on the name of the export inside the MyComponent file.In my case, the import was happening implicitly due to a library. I managed to fix it by changingexport class Footoexport default class Foo.In my case, one of the exported child module was not returning a proper react component. const Component = <div> Content </div>;\ninstead of \nconst Component = () => <div>Content</div>;The error shown was for the parent, hence couldn\'t figure out.import Rating from \'src/components/Rating\';vsimport Rating from \'src/components/Rating.js\';the second one worked for me.I ran into this error when I had a .jsx and .scss file in the same directory with the same root name.So, for example, if you have Component.jsx and Component.scss in the same folder and you try to do this:import Component from ./ComponentWebpack apparently gets confused and, at least in my case, tries to import the scss file when I really want the .jsx file.I was able to fix it by renaming the .scss file and avoiding the ambiguity. I could have also explicitly imported Component.jsx
