I\'m trying to figure this out since last week without going any step further. Ok, so I need to apply some constraints programmatically in Swift to a UIView using this code:But Xcode returns this weird output:Can you help me?\nThanks a lotDo you plan to have a squared UIView of width: 100 and Height: 100 centered inside the UIView of an UIViewController? If so, you may try one of the 7 following Swift 3 Auto Layout snippets:Note: activate(_ constraints: [NSLayoutConstraint]) requires iOS 8Note: activate(_ constraints: [NSLayoutConstraint]) requires iOS 8Note: Springs and Struts will be translated into corresponding auto layout constraints at runtime.Note: activate(_ constraints: [NSLayoutConstraint]) requires iOS 8, NSLayoutAnchor requires iOS 9Note: activate(_ constraints: [NSLayoutConstraint]) requires iOS 8, NSLayoutAnchor requires iOS 9It helps me to learn visually, so this is a supplemental answer.Each of the following examples are independent of the others.myView.leading = leadingMargin + 20Method 1: Anchor StyleMethod 2: NSLayoutConstraint Stylewidth = 200\nheight = 100Method 1: Anchor StyleMethod 2: NSLayoutConstraint StylemyView.centerX = centerX\nmyView.centerY = centerYMethod 1: Anchor StyleMethod 2: NSLayoutConstraint StyleIf you want to fill your super view then I suggest the swifty way:Other wise if you need non equal constraints check out NSLayoutAnchor as of iOS 9.  Its often much easier to read that using NSLayoutConstraint directly:The problem, as the error message suggests, is that you have constraints of type NSAutoresizingMaskLayoutConstraints that conflict with your explicit constraints, because new_view.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints is set to true.This is the default setting for views you create in code.  You can turn it off like this:Also, your width and height constraints are weird.  If you want the view to have a constant width, this is the proper way:(Replace 100 by the width you want it to have.)If your deployment target is iOS 9.0 or later, you can use this shorter code:Anyway, for a layout like this (fixed size and centered in parent view), it would be simpler to use the autoresizing mask and let the system translate the mask into constraints:Note that using autoresizing is perfectly legitimate even when you\'re also using autolayout. (UIKit still uses autoresizing in lots of places internally.) The problem is that it\'s difficult to apply additional constraints to a view that is using autoresizing.Updated for Swift 3Type of Constraintsit is a little different in xcode 7.3.1. this is what i come up with You are adding all defined constraints to self.view which is wrong, as width and height constraint should be added to your newView.Also, as I understand you want to set constant width and height 100:100.\nIn this case you should change your code to:This is one way to adding constraints programmatically
