Using plain JavaScript (not jQuery), is there a way I can test to see if an element contains a class?Currently, I\'m doing this:HTML:JS:This results in this output, which is correct:The issue is that if I change the HTML to this......there\'s no longer an exact match, so I get the default output of nothing (""). But I still want the output to be I have class1 because the <div> still contains the .class1 class.Use element.classList .contains method:This works on all current browsers and there are polyfills to support older browsers too. Alternatively, if you work with older browsers and don\'t want to use polyfills to fix them, using indexOf is correct, but you have to tweak it a little:Otherwise you will also get true if the class you are looking for is part of another class name.DEMOjQuery uses a similar (if not the same) method.Applied to the example:As this does not work together with the switch statement, you could achieve the same effect with this code:It\'s also less redundant ;)The easy and effective solution is trying .contains method.In modern browsers, you can just use the contains method of Element.classList :(from CanIUse.com)If you want to use Element.classList but you also want to support older browsers, consider using this polyfill by Eli Grey.Since he wants to use switch(), I\'m surprised no one has put this forth yet:A simplified oneliner:11 indexOf for arrays is not supported by IE (ofcourse). There are plenty of monkey patches to be found on the net for that.This is a little old, but maybe someone will find my solution helpfull:className is just a string so you can use the regular indexOf function to see if the list of classes contains another string.Here\'s a case-insensitive trivial solution:Here is a little snippet If you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to check wether element contains a class, without using jQuery.This accounts for the fact that element might contain multiple class names separated by space.ORYou can also assign this function to element prototype.And trigger it like this (very similar to jQuery\xe2\x80\x99s .hasClass() function):\nI know there a lot of answers but most of these are for additional functions and additional classes. This is the one I personally use; much cleaner and much less lines of code!I\'ve created a prototype method which uses classList, if possible, else resorts to indexOf:Felix\'s trick of adding spaces to flank the className and the string you\'re searching for is the right approach to determining whether the elements has the class or not.To have different behaviour according to the class, you may use function references, or functions, within a map:I would Poly fill the classList functionality and use the new syntax. This way newer browser will use the new implementation (which is much faster) and only old browsers will take the performance hit from the code.https://github.com/remy/polyfills/blob/master/classList.jsIf the element only has one class name you can quickly check it by getting the class attribute.  The other answers are much more robust but this certainly has it\'s use cases.Try this one:I think that perfect solution will be thisin which element is currently the class \'.bar\' ? Here is another solution but it\'s up to you.jsfiddle demoOf course this is only a lookup for 1 simple element <img>(/Image/g) but you can put all in an array like <li> is /LI/g, <ul> = /UL/g etc. This is a bit off, but if you have an event that triggers switch, you can do without classes:You can do.replace(/[0-9]/g, \'\') removes digits from id.It is a bit hacky, but works for long switches without extra functions or loops
