How to center div horizontally, and vertically within the container using flexbox. In below example, I want each number below each other (in rows), which are centered horizontally.http://codepen.io/anon/pen/zLxBoI think you want something like the following.See demo at: http://jsfiddle.net/audetwebdesign/tFscL/Your .flex-item elements should be block level (div instead of span) if you want the height and top/bottom padding to work properly.Also, on .row, set the width to auto instead of 100%.Your .flex-container properties are fine.If you want the .row to be centered vertically in the view port, assign 100% height to html and body, and also zero out the body margins.Note that .flex-container needs a height to see the vertical alignment effect, otherwise, the container computes the minimum height needed to enclose the content, which is less than the view port height in this example.Footnote:\nThe flex-flow, flex-direction, flex-wrap properties could have made this design easier to implement. I think that the .row container is not needed unless you want to add some styling around the elements (background image, borders and so on).A useful resource is: http://demo.agektmr.com/flexbox/Below are two general centering solutions.One for vertically-aligned flex items (flex-direction: column) and the other for horizontally-aligned flex items (flex-direction: row).In both cases the height of the centered divs can be variable, undefined, unknown, whatever. The height of the centered divs doesn\'t matter.Here\'s the HTML for both:CSS (excluding decorative styles)When flex items are stacked vertically:DEMOWhen flex items are stacked horizontally:Adjust the flex-direction rule from the code above.DEMOThe scope of a flex formatting context is limited to a parent-child relationship. Descendants of a flex container beyond the children do not participate in flex layout and will ignore flex properties. Essentially, flex properties are not inheritable beyond the children.Hence, you will always need to apply display: flex or display: inline-flex to a parent element in order to apply flex properties to the child.In order to vertically and/or horizontally center text or other content contained in a flex item, make the item a (nested) flex container, and repeat the centering rules.More details here: How to vertically align text inside a flexbox?Alternatively, you can apply margin: auto to the content element of the flex item.Learn about flex auto margins here: Methods for Aligning Flex Items (see box#56).When a flex container has multiple lines (due to wrapping) the align-content property will be necessary for cross-axis alignment.From the spec:8.4. Packing Flex Lines: the align-content\n  propertyThe align-content property aligns a flex container\xe2\x80\x99s lines within the\n  flex container when there is extra space in the cross-axis, similar to\n  how justify-content aligns individual items within the main-axis.\n  Note, this property has no effect on a single-line flex container.More details here: How does flex-wrap work with align-self, align-items and align-content?Flexbox is supported by all major browsers, except IE < 10. Some recent browser versions, such as Safari 8 and IE10, require vendor prefixes. For a quick way to add prefixes use Autoprefixer.
