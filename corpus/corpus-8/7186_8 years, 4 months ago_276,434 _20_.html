The example I see posted all of the time seems like it\'s suboptimal, because it involves concatenating strings, which seems so not jQuery. It usually looks like this:Is there a better way?Andreas Grech was pretty close... it\'s actually this (note the reference to this instead of the item in the loop):What I\'m doing above is creating a new <option> element and adding it to the options list (assuming options is the ID of a drop down element.PS My javascript is a bit rusty so the syntax may not be perfectSure - make options an array of strings and use .join(\'\') rather than += every time through the loop. Slight performance bump when dealing with large numbers of options...Yes. I\'m still working with strings the whole time. Believe it or not, that\'s the fastest way to build a DOM fragment... Now, if you have only a few options, it won\'t really matter - use the technique Dreas demonstrates if you like the style. But bear in mind, you\'re invoking the browser\'s internal HTML parser i*2 times, rather than just once, and modifying the DOM each time through the loop... with a sufficient number of options. you\'ll end up paying for it, especially on older browsers.Note: As Justice points out, this will fall apart if ImageFolderID and Name are not encoded properly... Or maybe:The fastest way is this:According to this link is the fastest way because you wrap everything in a single element when doing any kind of DOM insertion.I found this to be working from jquery siteOther approach with ES6I use the selectboxes jquery plugin.  It turns your example into:I\'ve read that using document fragments is performant because it avoids page reflow upon each insertion of DOM element, it\'s also well supported by all browsers (even IE 6).I first read about this in CodeSchool\'s JavaScript Best Practices course.Here\'s a comparison of different approaches, thanks go to the author.I hope it helps.\nI usually use functions instead write all code everytime.I have been using jQuery and calling a function to populate drop downs.
