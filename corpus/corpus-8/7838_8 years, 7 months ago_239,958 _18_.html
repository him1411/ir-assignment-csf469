I am using a custum UITableViewCell which has some labels, buttons and imageviews to be displayed. There is one label in the cell whose text is a NSString object and the length of string could be variable. Due to this, I cannot set a constant height to the cell in the UITableViews: heightForCellAtIndex method. The cell\'s height depends on the labels height which can be determined using the NSStrings sizeWithFont method. I tried using it, but it looks like I\'m going wrong somewhere. How can it be fixed?Here is the code used for initializing the cell.textView = [[UILabel alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(55.0,42.0,245.0,ht)]; this is the label whose height and width are going wrong.Your UITableViewDelegate should implement tableView:heightForRowAtIndexPath:You will probably want to use NSString\'s sizeWithFont:constrainedToSize:lineBreakMode: method to calculate your row height rather than just performing some silly math on the indexPath :)If all your rows are the same height, just set the rowHeight property of the UITableView rather than implementing the heightForRowAtIndexPath. Apple Docs:There are performance implications to using tableView:heightForRowAtIndexPath: instead of rowHeight. Every time a table view is displayed, it calls tableView:heightForRowAtIndexPath: on the delegate for each of its rows, which can result in a significant performance problem with table views having a large number of rows (approximately 1000 or more).in a custom UITableViewCell -controller add this In the UITableView -controller add thisThanks to all the posts on this topic, there are some really helpful ways to adjust the rowHeight of a UITableViewCell.Here is a compilation of some of the concepts from everyone else that really helps when building for the iPhone and iPad.  You can also access different sections and adjust them according to the varying sizes of views.I saw a lot of solutions but all was wrong or uncomplet.\nYou can solve all problems with 5 lines in viewDidLoad and autolayout.\nThis for objetive C:For swift 2.0:Now create your cell with xib or into tableview in your Storyboard\nWith this you no need implement nothing more or override. (Don forget number os lines 0) and the bottom label (constrain) downgrade "Content Hugging Priority -- Vertical to 250"\nYou can donwload the code in the next url:\nhttps://github.com/jposes22/exampleTableCellCustomHeightReferences: http://candycode.io/automatically-resizing-uitableviewcells-with-dynamic-text-height-using-auto-layout/To have the dynamic cell height as the text of Label increases, you first need to calculate height,that the text gonna use in -heightForRowAtIndexPath delegate method and return it with the added heights of other lables,images (max height of text+height of other static componenets) and use same height in cell creation.
