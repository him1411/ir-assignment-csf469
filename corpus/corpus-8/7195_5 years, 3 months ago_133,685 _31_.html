I\'m stringyfing an object like {\'foo\': \'bar\'}How can I turn the string back to an object?You need to JSON.parse() the string.JSON.parse is the opposite of JSON.stringify.JSON.stringify and JSON.parse are almost oposites, and "usually" this kind of thing will work:so that obj and obj2 are "the same".However there are some limitations to be aware of.\nOften these issues dont matter as you\'re dealing with simple objects.\nBut I\'ll illustrate some of them here, using this helper function:You\'ll only get ownProperties of the object and lose prototypes:You\'ll lose identity:Functions dont survive:Date objects end up as strings:Undefined values dont survive:Objects that provide a toJSON function may not behave correctly.I\'m sure there are issues with other built-in-types too. (All this was tested using node.js so you may get slightly different behaviour depending on your environment too).When it does matter it can sometimes be overcome using the additional parameters of JSON.parse and JSON.stringify. For example:How about this  This is a safer alternative for eval.Recommended is to use JSON.parse There is an alternative you can do :Json in javascriptWhy is using the JavaScript eval function a bad idea?http://jsbin.com/tidob/1/edit?js,console,outputThe native JSON object includes two key methods.The JSON.parse() method parses a JSON string - i.e. reconstructing the original JavaScript objectvar jsObject = JSON.parse(jsonString);JSON.stringify() method accepts a JavaScript object and returns its JSON equivalent.  var jsonString = JSON.stringify(jsObject);Check this out.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/LD55x/Code:
