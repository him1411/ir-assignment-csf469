I just created sample BB app, which can allow to choose the date.After choosing the date, I need to convert that long value to String, so that I can easily store the date value somewhere in database.\nI am new to Java and Blackberry development.How should I convert this long value to String? Also I want to convert back to long from String. I think for that I can use long l = Long.parseLong("myStr");?See the reference documentation for the String class: String s = String.valueOf(date);If your Long might be null and you don\'t want to get a 4-letter "null" string, you might use Objects.toString, like: String s = Objects.toString(date, null);EDIT:You reverse it using Long l = Long.valueOf(s); but in this direction you need to catch NumberFormatExceptionSimple and works fine :-)This works:very simple,\njust concatenate the long to a string.1.2.Can convert the long into string object, cool shortcut for converting into string...but use of String.valueOf(date); is advisableor
