I have added a field to the sign-up form that is based on a different model, see How do I use nested attributes with the devise model for the gory details. This part is working fine.The problem now is when I save, it is failing in the create action of the registrations controller that is supplied by devise with an Activerecord::UnknownAttributeError on this field (company).I am assuming I need to override the registrations controller, or is there a better/easier way I should be approaching this?In your form are you passing in any other attributes, via mass assignment that don\'t belong to your user model, or any of the nested models?If so, I believe the ActiveRecord::UnknownAttributeError is triggered in this instance.Otherwise, I think you can just create your own controller, by generating something like this:And then tell devise to use that controller instead of the default with:A better and more organized way of overriding Devise controllers and views using namespaces:Create the following folders: Put all controllers that you want to override into app/controllers/my_devise and add MyDevise namespace to controller class names. Registrations example: Change your routes accordingly:Copy all required views into app/views/my_devise from Devise gem folder or use rails generate devise:views, delete the views you are not overriding and rename devise folder to my_devise.This way you will have everything neatly organized in two folders.I believe there is a better solution than rewrite the RegistrationsController. I did exactly the same thing (I just have Organization instead of Company).If you set properly your nested form, at model and view level, everything works like a charm.My User model:My Organization Model:My view : \'devise/registrations/new.html.erb\'You can generate views and controllers for devise customization.UseandIt will copy particular controllers and views from gem to your application.Next, tell the router to use this controller:Very simple methods\nJust go to the terminal and the type followingNext to use custom views now in your route.rb fileYou can add other controllers too. This will make devise to use controllers in users folder and views in users folder.Now you can customize your views as your desire and add your logic to controllers in controllers/users folder. \nEnjoy !You can also make the folder devise in your controllers path and copy/paste the entire devise controller into it.  This requires no additional configuration.So for just the registrations controller it would be app/controllers/devise/registrations_controller.rb and then copy the devise registrations_controller.rb source into it.  You can get it from github https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/master/app/controllers/devise/registrations_controller.rb, or you can track it down in your gem source, or if you use RubyMine when you type in the class line class Devise::RegistrationsController a globe like symbol appears to the left... click on it and it opens the Devise Registration Controller file for you.  Then copy/paste.create the controller registrations and override its inherited class by predefined Devise::RegistrationsController class after this set routes to :
