I\'m trying to connect to my MySQL DB with the Terminal on my Apple (With PHP).Yesterday it worked fine, and now I suddenly get this error (See title). I have no clue how to solve it. I\'ve spend all my free time trying today =(The script works when I use my Browser to run it (I have XAMPP installed), but Terminal refuses to connect to the DB.Her eis the file that I include to connect (Script works when I don\'t include this but then it doesn\'t connect to the DB):That should be right since with my Browser I can connect when I run the script. The command I use is "php scriptname.php".For some reason mysql on OS X gets the locations of the required socket file a bit wrong, but thankfully the solution is as simple as setting up a symbolic link.You may have a socket (appearing as a zero length file) as /tmp/mysql.sock or /var/mysql/mysql.sock but 1 or more apps is looking in the other location for it.Rather than move the socket and have to edit config files and remember to keep edited files local and away from servers where the paths are correct, simply create a symbolic link so your mac finds the required socket, even when it\'s looking in the wrong place!If you have /tmp/mysql.sock but no /var/mysql/mysql.sock then...If you have /var/mysql/mysql.sock but no /tmp/mysql.sock thenYou will need permissions to create the directory and link, so just prefix the commands above with sudo if necessary.Hope this helps. It has sorted this exact issue for me on 3 macs so far.I also had this error, but could only fix it through the suggestion here.To summarize, use:Instead of:The reason is that "localhost" is a special name for the mysql driver making it use the unix socket to connect to mysql instead of the a tcp socket.I was having the same problem and this is how I fixed it:I had this and it didn\'t work:I did this and it worked:Instead of using the mysql server, I connected directly to the Unix Socket. Worked for me.MySQL socket is located, in general, in /tmp/mysql.sock or /var/mysql/mysql.sock, but probably PHP looks in the wrong place.Check where is your socket with:When the updatedb is terminated:Then locate your php.ini:this will output something like:Edit your php.iniChange the lines:where /tmp/mysql.sock is the path to your socket.Save your modifications and exit ESC + SHIFT: xRestart ApacheI am on XAMPP on Mac OS X, and Brian Lowe\'s solution above worked with a slight modification. The mysql.sock file is actually in "/Applications/xampp/xamppfiles/var/mysql/" folder. So had to link it up both in /tmp and /var/mysql. I haven\'t checked which one is used by PHP command line, but this did the fix, so I am happy :-)Mac OS X EL Capitan + MAMP Pro\nDo thisThen do thisHope this saves you some time.The reason is that php cannot find the correct path of mysql.sock.Please make sure that your mysql is running first. Then, please confirm that which path is the mysql.sock located, for example /tmp/mysql.sockthen add this path string to php.ini: Finally, restart Apache.When you face the following issue:PHP throwing error "Warning: mysql_connect() http://function.mysql-connect: 2002 No such file or directory (trying to connect via unix:///tmp/mysql.sock)"Set "mysql.default_socket" value in your /etc/php.ini toThen restart web service in server admin 127.0.0.1 worked for me too. That should be tried before any other configurationFix the looming 2002 socket error \xe2\x80\x93 which is linking where MySQL places the socket and where OSX thinks it should be, MySQL puts it in /tmp and OSX looks for it in /var/mysql the socket is a type of file that allows mysql client/server communication.and thensource: http://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/get-apache-mysql-php-phpmyadmin-working-osx-10-10-yosemite/Another solution is to fix the socket location in the php.ini configuration file like this:Of course, the symlink works too, so its a matter of preference which one you change.When you install php53-mysql using port it returns the following message which is the solution to this problem:i was having the same issue [PDOException]\nSQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] No such file or directory[ErrorException]\nWarning: PDO::__construct(): [2002] No such file or directory (trying to connect via unix:///var/mysql/mysql.sock) in \xe2\x80\xa6htdocs/Symfony/vendor/doctrine-dbal/lib/Doctrine/DBAL/Driver/PDOConnection.php So the solution is to make a symlink to the sock file thus resolving the issue. Do the following to resolve it:$ sudo mkdir /private/var/mysql/$ sudo ln -s /Applications/MAMP/tmp/mysql/mysql.sock /private/var/mysql/mysql.socksource:http://www.reecefowell.com/2012/07/21/symfony2-cli-does-not-connect-to-mysql-while-browser-works-fine/I got the same errors.\nMysql was running as a standalone application before I started phpMyAdmin.I just stopped mysql\nThen\nsudo /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/xampp stop\nsudo /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/xampp startIt worked fineI just had this problem, but it only appeared when loading certain pages (other pages worked fine). It turned out that I was making calls to MySQL after I closed the connection with mysql_close(). So, as @brucenan said: make sure that MySQL is running when you call it.You can do it by simply aliasing the MAMP php on Apple terminal:Example: > phpmamp - vNow you can run something like: > phpmamp scriptname.phpNote: This will be applied only for the current terminal session.Since your might use MAMP, either change your Port to the default 3306 or use 127.0.0.1 in the database.phpOr with the default settings:
