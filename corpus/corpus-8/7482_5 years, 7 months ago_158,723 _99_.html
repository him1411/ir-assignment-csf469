I am using a Samsung galaxy nexus phone (Android 4.0 platform) .I am developing Android app on Ubuntu linux OS. I would like to run my application directly on the Samsung handset device, so I did the following setup steps:in my project AndroidManifest.xml file, add android:debuggable="true" to the <application> elementOn device, Settings > Security enable Unknown sourcesOn device, Settings > Developer options enable USB debuggingOn my computer, create file /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules , the content of the file is:SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="04E8", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev" On my computer, run command chmod a+r /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rulesThen, I open a terminal and execute command adb devices on my computer , I got:Since I did not see my device but only "??????? no permissions", I then run the following commands:But I still get:Why? What am I missing??What works for me is to kill and start the adb server again. On linux: sudo adb kill-server and then sudo adb start-server. Then it will detect nearly every device out of the box.Nothing worked for me until I finally found the answer here:\nhttp://ptspts.blogspot.co.il/2011/10/how-to-fix-adb-no-permissions-error-on.htmlI\'m copying the text here in case it disappears in the future.Create a file named /tmp/android.rules with the following contents (hex vendor numbers were taken from the vendor list page):Run the following commands:Disconnect the USB cable between the phone and the computer.Reconnect the phone.Run adb devices to confirm that now it has permission to access the phone. Please note that it\'s possible to use , USER="$LOGINNAME" instead of , MODE="0666" in the .rules file, substituting $LOGINNAME for your login name, i.e. what id -nu prints.In some cases it can be necessary to give the udev rules file a name that sorts close to the end, such as z51-android.rules.Enter the following commands:adb kill-server \nsudo ./adb start-server\nadb devicesThe issue is your not running adb server as root.  Tried all above, none worked .. finally worked when I switch connected as from MTP to Camera(PTP).In Archlinux this can happen occasionally. The fix: I had the same problem, the solution is as fellow: (by the way, you don\'t have to root your device.)Enjoy.For those using debian, the guide for setting up a device under Ubuntu to create the file "/etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules" does not work. I followed instructions from here. Putting down the same here for reference.Edit this file as superuserFind the text similar to thisThen change the mode to 0666 like belowThis allows adb to work, however we still need to set up the device so it can be recognized. We need to create this file as superuser,and enterthe above line is for HTC, follow @grebulon\'s post for complete list.Save the file and then restart udev as super userConnect the phone via USB and it should be detected when you compile and run a project.There are a lot of bad answers posted to this question ranging from insisting on running adb as root (which should not be touted as the only or even recommended solution) to solving completely unrelated issues.Here is the single shortest and most universal recipe for taking care of permissions for all adb and fastboot devices at once:As for the specific thing that OP did wrong in his question - it was not reloading the udev rules after editing the .rules file. Also OP did not tell which Android build (aka ROM) he had on his phone. The idVendor value is set in software and therefore it depends on the ROM. So the value of 04E8 he used in his original rule would have worked only for devices with Samsung stock ROMs. But this is not a problem for this udev rule - it matches all devices with adb or fastboot interfaces regardless of their VendorID.had the same problem with my Galaxy S3.\nMy problem was that the idVendor value (04E8) was not the right one.\nTo find the right one connect you smartphone to the computer and write in terminal the commandas result i found all conected usb devices with the right id. There must be an line where your smartphone is displayed like:in my case. So the right idVendor Value is "18d1". So the line in the        /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules has to be in my casethan i run on my computer the commandEverithing worked!I know this might be a little late but here is a very good article on how to manually add Android ADB USB Driver. Manually adding Android ADB USB driver in Ubuntu 14.04 LTSEdited to Add Link ContentNote: Make sure that you have connected your Android device in USB Debugging modeOpen terminal (CTRL + ALT + T) and enter command:\nlsusbNow you might get a similar reply to this: \nBus 002 Device 013: ID 283b:1024Note:\nWith reference to this Bus 002 Device 008: ID 283b:1024\n{idVendor}==\xe2\x80\x9d283b\xe2\x80\x9d\n{idProduct}==\xe2\x80\x9d1024\xe2\x80\xb3Now enter the following command:\nsudo gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules\nThis creates the android rules file (51-android.rules) or open the existing one in the specified location (/etc/udev/rules.d)Add a new line to this file:\nSUBSYSTEM==\xe2\x80\x9dusb\xe2\x80\x9d, ATTRS{idVendor}==\xe2\x80\x9d283b\xe2\x80\x9d, ATTRS{idProduct}==\xe2\x80\x9d1024\xe2\x80\xb3, MODE=\xe2\x80\x9d0666\xe2\x80\xb3 Note Edit idVendor & idProduct values with your device values.\nSave and close.Now enter the following command:\nsudo chmod a+rx /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules - grant read/execution permission \nsudo service udev restart - Restart the udev serviceNow we have to add the idVendor to adb_usb.ini. Enter the following commands:\ncd ~/.android\ngedit adb_usb.iniAdd the following value\n0x283bThis is nothing but 0x(idVendor value). So replace the value with. respect to your device value\nSave and close the file.Now enter the following command:\nsudo service udev restartPlug out the Android device and reconnect it again.\nNow enter the following command:\nadb kill-server \nadb devicesThere you go! Your device must be listed. Copied From Manually adding Android ADB USB driver in Ubuntu 14.04 LTSWorked for me.When you restart udev, kill adb server & start adb server goto android sdk installation path & do all on sudo. then run adb devices it will solve permission problem.My device is POSITIVO and my operational system is Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\nSo, my problem was in variable nameI create the file /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules \nand put  SUBSYSTEM=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="1662", MODE="0666"I disconnected device\nand execute:after this i connected the android device in developer mode again and All the provided answers assume that you are able to unplug and reconnect the USB cable. In situations where this is not possible (e.g., when you are remote), you can do the following to essentially do what the suggested udev rules would do on re-plug:Find the device you care about, e.g.:Take note of the bus number it is on and then execute, e.g. for bus 003:Clearly this may be more permissive than you want (there may be more devices attached than just this one), but you get the idea.Try instead of GROUP="plugdev" use the main group of your user.Easiest way is to allow android debugging group usb connections as per developer.android.com .\nIn short sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb will make you happy.In my case on ubuntu 12.04 LTS, I had to change my HTC Incredible usb mode from charge to Media and then the device showed up under adb. Of course, debugging was already on in both cases.I used su and it started working.  When I use Jetbrains with regular user, I see this problem but after restarting Jetbrains in su mode, I can see my device without doing anything.I am using Ubuntu 13.04 and Jetbrains 12.1.4You could also try editing adb_usb.ini file, located at /home/username/.android/. This file contains id vendor list of devices you want to connect. You just add your device\'s id vendor in new line (it\'s one id per line). Then restart adb server and replug your device.It worked for me on Ubuntu 12.10.If anyone faces the following error message when they use adb devicesExecute the following That fixed the issue for me on a custom build android device As mentioned above the issue is caused by not running adb with root permissions.I wanted to add my solution to the problem running Ubuntu 12.04 with Android Studio 0.8.2. Which also will show you how to open android studio without typing the full path:First you add android-studio/bin to your PATH by editing your .bashrc file.This will allow you to run the program with the studio.sh command from within the terminal from any directory.\nBut this will not allow you to run it with sudo from within the terminal from any directory!!! Which brings us back to our main issue. To do this we will need to edit our /etc/sudoers file.Now adb is run as root and your computer will recognize your connected device. And you can start the program from any directory. This is just the way I fixed the problem and thought I\'d share. As Debian goes, I did the above things having been using Kali. After chown command and a reboot I lost use of my laptop and external keyboard / mouse. Dual booting Ubuntu Studio, I booted to that, mounted Debian partition, opened a terminal and sudo su\nrm path/to/all.android.rulesBoth in /libs/udev ... AND /etc/udev AND gedit /lib/udev/rules.d/91-permissions.rulesAnd switched back that toSUBSYSTEM==\xe2\x80\x9dusb\xe2\x80\x9d, ENV{DEVTYPE}==\xe2\x80\x9dusb_device\xe2\x80\x9d, \\ MODE=\xe2\x80\x9d0666\xe2\x80\xb3Reboot and all keyboards/ mice work again. Also, reboot back to Kali / Debian with no android.rules and "normal" 91-permission.rules and...adb devicesWorks as it should - with permissions etc. I do still have my non root user in plugdev group. Have adb path in $PATH. Have adb at /home/user/andy/sdk/platform-tools/Hopes this helps someone who runs into that as well.
