I am just wondering how to use the new HTML5 input attribute "required" the right way on radiobuttons. Does every radiobutton field need the attribute like below? Or is it sufficient if only one field gets it?   You just need to set the required-attribute for one input of the radiogroup, but you can set it for all.For example:See this fiddleIn case you dynamically generate those radio-buttons, I\'d suggest to always add the required attribute so that you don\'t have to worry to have at least one input with it left.Also take note of:To avoid confusion as to whether a radio button group is required or not, authors are encouraged to specify the attribute on all the radio buttons in a group. Indeed, in general, authors are encouraged to avoid having radio button groups that do not have any initially checked controls in the first place, as this is a state that the user cannot return to, and is therefore generally considered a poor user interface.Sourcetry out this...Find JSFIDDLEIf your radio buttons have been customised, for example the original icon for the radio button has been hidden via css "display:none" so that you can create your own radio button then you will might be getting the error. The way to fix it is to replace "display:none" with "opacity:0" :D
