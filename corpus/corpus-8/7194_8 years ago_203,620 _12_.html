For example, if we have a table Books, how would we count total number of book records with hibernate?Assuming the class name is Book:It is at least a Number, most likely a Long.In Java i usually need to return int and use this form:Here is what official hibernate docs tell us about this:You can count the number of query results without returning them:However, it doesn\'t always return Integer instance, so it is better to use java.lang.Number for safety.You could try count(*) Where Books is the name off the class - not the table in the database.Long count = (Long) session.createQuery("select count(*) from  Book")\n                    .uniqueResult();If you are using Hibernate 5+, then query will be modified asOr if you Need TypedQuery
