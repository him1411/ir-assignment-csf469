I know that using ls -l "directory/directory/filename" tells me the permissions of a file. How do I do the same on a directory? I could obviously use ls -l on the directory higher in the hierarchy and then just scroll till I find it but it\'s such a pain. If I use ls -l on the actual directory, it gives the permissions/information of the files inside of it, and not of the actual directory. I tried this in the terminal of both Mac OS X 10.5 and Linux (Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon), and it\'s the same result. Is there some sort of flag I should be using?Here is the short answer:Here\'s what it does:You might be interested in manpages.
