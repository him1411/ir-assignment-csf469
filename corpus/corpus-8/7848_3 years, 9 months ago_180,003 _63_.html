I have cmsplus.dev under /etc/apache2/sites-available with the following code,Now when I use sudo /usr/sbin/a2ensite cmsplus.dev, I am getting the error,My webserver Apache/2.4.6 (Ubuntu)How to solve this issue?Solved the issue by adding .conf extension to site configuration files.Apache a2ensite results in:   Error! Site Does Not ExistProblem; If you found the error while trying to enable a site using:but it returns:Error: mysite.com does not exista2ensite is simply a perl script that only works with filenames ending .conf Therefore, I have to rename my setting file for mysite.com to mysite.com.conf as might be achieved as follows: SuccessYou probably updated your Ubuntu installation and one of the updates included the upgrade of Apache to version 2.4.xIn Apache 2.4.x the vhost configuration files, located in the /etc/apache2/sites-available directory, must have the .conf extension.Using terminal (mv command), rename all your existing configuration files and add the .conf extension to all of them. If you get a "Permission denied" error, then add "sudo " in front of your terminal commands.You do not need to make any other changes to the configuration files.Enable the vhost(s):And then reload Apache:Your sites should be up and running now. UPDATE: As mentioned here, a Linux distribution that you installed changed the configuration to Include *.conf only. Therefore it has nothing to do with Apache 2.2 or 2.4There\'s another good way, just edit the file apache2.conf theres a line at the endIncludeOptional sites-enabled/*.confjust remove the .conf at the end, like thisIncludeOptional sites-enabled/*and restart the server.(I tried this only in the Ubuntu 13.10, when I updated it.)I just had the same problem. I\'d say it has nothing to do with the apache.conf.a2ensite must have changed - line 532 is the line that enforces the .conf suffix:If you change it to:...it will work without any suffix.Of course you wouldn\'t want to change the a2ensite script, but changing the conf file\'s suffix is the correct way.It\'s probably just a way of enforcing the ".conf"-suffix.So .. \nquickest way is rename site config names ending in ".conf" other notes on previous comments:IncludeOptional wasn\'t introduced until apache 2.36 - making change above followed by restart on 2.2 will leave your server down!also, version 2.2 a2ensite can\'t be hacked as describedas well, since your sites-available file is actually a configuration file, it should be named that way anyway..In general do not restart services  (webservers are one type of service):Servers can run for many years - live update, reload config, etc.The cloud doesn\'t mean you have to restart to load a configuration file.When changing configuration of a service use "reload" not "restart".restart stops the service then starts service - if there is a any problem in your change to the config, the service will not restart.reload will give an error but the service never shuts down giving you a chance to fix the config error which could only be bad syntax.debian or ubunto [service-name for this thread is apache2]other os\'s left as an excersize for the reader.Worked after I added .conf to the configuration fileIn my case with Ubuntu 14.04.3 and Apache 2.4.7, the problem was that I copied site1.conf to make site2.conf available, and by copying, something happend and I could not a2ensite site2.conf with the error described in thread.The solution for me, was to rename site2.conf to site2 and then again rename site2 to site2.conf. After that I was able to a2ensite site2.conf.I have just upgraded the Ubuntu Server version from 12.04 LTS to 14.04 LTS.Indeed, as said above, the .conf extension to Apache 2.4.x is needed to the websites vhost files that resides on sites-available directory.Before read this question I did not have a clue what was going on with the server. Pretty nice solution.Just summarizing I did the following steps on Terminal:1) Access sites-enabled folder2) Because the command a2dissite will not work with deprecated files (without .conf) remove the old website files that was published3) Rename the website vhost files changing its extension adding .conf to the end4) Republish the new and correct vhost file5) Check the website on browser and have fun! :)Try like this..and add entry in /etc/hostsrestart apache..
