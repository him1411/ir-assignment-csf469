I\'ve an AJAX request which will be made every 5 seconds. But the problem is before the AJAX request if the previous request is not completed I\'ve to abort that request and make a new request.My code is something like this, how to resolve this issue?The jquery ajax method returns a XMLHttpRequest object. You can use this object to cancel the request.The XMLHttpRequest has a abort method, which cancels the request, but if the request has already been sent to the server then the server will process the request even if we abort the request but the client will not wait for/handle the response.The xhr object also contains a readyState which contains the state of the request(UNSENT-0, OPENED-1, HEADERS_RECEIVED-2, LOADING-3 and DONE-4). we can use this to check whether the previous request was completed.Just use ajax.abort() for example you could abort any pending ajax request before sending another one like thisI know this might be a little late but i experience similar issues where calling the abort method didnt really aborted the request. instead the browser was still waiting for a response that it never uses.\nthis code resolved that issue.Why should you abort the request?If each request takes more than five seconds, what will happen?You shouldn\'t abort the request if the parameter passing with the request is not changing.\neg:- the request is for retrieving the notification data. \nIn such situations, The nice approach is that set a new request only after completing the previous Ajax request.When you make a request to a server, have it check to see if a progress is not null (or fetching that data) first. If it is fetching data, abort the previous request and initiate the new one.jQuery:\nUse this as a starting point - as inspiration.\nI solved it like this:\n (this is not a perfect solution, it just aborts the last instance and is WIP code)You can use jquery-validate.js . The following is the code snippet from jquery-validate.js.So that you just only need to set the parameter mode to abort when you are making ajax request.Ref:https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery-validate/1.14.0/jquery.validate.jsThe jquery ajax method returns a XMLHttpRequest object. You can use this object to cancel the request.I hope this answer is useful for you.You should also check for readyState 0. Because when you use xhr.abort() this function set readyState to 0 in this object, and your if check will be always true -  readyState !=4
