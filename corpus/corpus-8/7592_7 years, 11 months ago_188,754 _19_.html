I have a class Items with properties (Id, Name, Code, Price).The List of Items is populated with duplicated items. For ex.: How to remove the duplicates in the list using linq?To match on only some of the properties, create a custom equality comparer, e.g.:Then use it like this:If there is something that is throwing off your Distinct query, you might want to look at MoreLinq and use the DistinctBy operator and select distinct objects by id.This is how I was able to group by with Linq. Hope it helps.Use Distinct() but keep in mind that it uses the default equality comparer to compare values, so if you want anything beyond that you need to implement your own comparer. Please see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb348436.aspx for an example. You have three option here for removing duplicate item in your List:Use GroupBy, but please note in GroupBy you should Group by all of the columns because if you just group by Id it doesn\'t remove duplicate items always. For example consider the following example:The result for this grouping will be:Which is incorrect because it considers {Id = 3, Name = "Item3", Code = "IT00004", Price = 250} as duplicate. So the correct query would be:3.Override Equal and GetHashCode in item class:Then you can use it like this:Try this extension method out. Hopefully this could help.Usage:When you don\'t want to write IEqualityComparer you can try something like following.
