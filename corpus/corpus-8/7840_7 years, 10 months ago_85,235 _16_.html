I\'d like to do something like this:How should I do this?... doesn\'t work.RSpec 1 Syntax:See the documentation (for RSpec 1 syntax) and RSpec 2 documentation for more.Instead of lambda, use expect to:This is applies for more recent versions of rspec, i.e. rspec 2.0 and up.See the doco for more.Note: raise_error and raise_exception are interchangeable.Note: raise_error is an alias for raise_exception.RSpec 2:RSpec 1:The syntax changed recently and now it is:From version 3.3 on rspec-expections gem raises a warning for a blank raise_error without a parameterThis gives you a hint that your code may fail with a different error than the test intended to check.WARNING: Using the raise_error matcher without providing a specific error or message risks false positives, since raise_error will match when Ruby raises a NoMethodError, NameError or ArgumentError, potentially allowing the expectation to pass without even executing the method you are intending to call. Instead consider providing a specific error class or message. This message can be supressed by setting: RSpec::Expectations.configuration.warn_about_potential_false_positives = false.
