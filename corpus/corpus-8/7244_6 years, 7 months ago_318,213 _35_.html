Are there any ways in CSS to give outlines to text with different colors ? I want to highlight some parts of my text to make it more intuitive - like the names, links, etc. Changing the link colors etc. are common nowadays, so I want something new.There is an experimental webkit property called text-stroke in CSS3, I\'ve been trying to get this to work for some time but have been unsuccessful so far. What I have done instead is used the already supported text-shadow property (supported in  Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and IE 9 I believe).Use four shadows to simulate a stroked text: HTML: CSS:I have made a demo for you hereAnd a hovered example is available hereAs Jason C has mentioned in the comments, the text-shadow CSS property is now supported by all major browsers, with the exception of Opera Mini. Where this solution will work for backwards compatibility (not really an issue regarding browsers that auto-update) I believe the text-stroke CSS should be used. Edit: text-stroke is now fairly mature and implemented in most browsers. It is easier, sharper and more precise. If your browser audience can support it, you should now use text-stroke first, instead of text-shadow.You can and should do this with just the text-shadow effect without any offsets:Why? When you offset multiple shadow effects, you\xe2\x80\x99ll begin to notice ungainly, jagged corners:\n\n\nHaving text-shadow effects in just one position eliminates the offsets, meaning \nIf you feel that\xe2\x80\x99s too thin and would prefer a darker outline instead, no problem \xe2\x80\x94 you can repeat the same effect (keeping the same position and blur), several times. Like so:Here\xe2\x80\x99s a sample of just one effect (top), and the same effect repeated 14 times (bottom):\nAlso note: Because the lines become so thin, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very good idea to turn off sub-pixel rendering using-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased.This is a simplified method:Here\'s a more complex demo.You could try stacking multiple blured shadows until the shadows look like a stroke, like so:Here\'s a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/GGUYY/I mention it just in case someone\'s interested, although I wouldn\'t call it a solution because it fails in various ways:I was looking for a cross-browser text-stroke solution that works when overlaid on background images. think I have a solution for this that doesn\'t involve extra mark-up, js and works in IE7-9 (I haven\'t tested 6), and doesn\'t cause aliasing problems.This is a combination of using CSS3 text-shadow, which has good support except IE (http://caniuse.com/#search=text-shadow), then using a combination of filters for IE.  CSS3 text-stroke support is poor at the moment.IE FiltersThe glow filter (http://www.impressivewebs.com/css3-text-shadow-ie/) looks terrible, so I didn\'t use that.David Hewitt\'s answer involved adding dropshadow filters in a combination of directions. ClearType is then removed unfortunately so we end up with badly aliased text.I then combined some of the elements suggested on useragentman with the dropshadow filters.Putting it togetherThis example would be black text with a white stroke. I\'m using conditional html classes by the way to target IE (http://paulirish.com/2008/conditional-stylesheets-vs-css-hacks-answer-neither/).I got better results with 6 different shadows:Working with thicker strokes gets a bit messy, if you have the pleasure of sass try this mixin, not perfect and depending on stroke weight it generates a fair amount of css. Multiple text-shadows..\nSomething like this:Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/punosound/gv6zs58m/Here is CSS file hope you will get wht u want
