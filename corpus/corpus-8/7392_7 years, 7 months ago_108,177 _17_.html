In jQuery how do I use a selector to access all but the first of an element? So in the following code only the second and third element would be accessed. I know I can access them manually but there could be any number of elements so thats not possible. Thanks.or:or:or:or:or: (as per @Jordan Lev\'s comment):and so on.See:Because of the way jQuery selectors are evaluated right-to-left, the quite readable li:not(:first) is slowed down by that evaluation.An equally fast and easy to read solution is using the function version .not(":first"):e.g.JSPerf: http://jsperf.com/fastest-way-to-select-all-expect-the-first-one/6This is only few percentage points slower than slice(1), but is very readable as "I want all except the first one".My answer is focused to a extended case derivated from the one exposed at top. Extended Case: Suppose you have group of elements from which you want to hide the child elements except first. As an example:$(\'.child:not(:first)\').hide();$(\'.some-group\').each(function(i,group){\n   $(group).find(\'.child:not(:first)\').hide();\n});
