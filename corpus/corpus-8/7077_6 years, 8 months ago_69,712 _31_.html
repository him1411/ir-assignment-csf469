I just signed up for Amazon\'s new Elastic Beanstalk offering and loving it. What I can\'t figure out is how to SSH to a Beanstalk instance. I don\'t have a private key because Beanstalk generated the instance on my behalf. Ideas? Thanks,\nBennoI found it to be a 2-step process. This assumes that you\'ve already set up a keypair to access EC2 instances in the relevant region.Edit the security group to add a rule for SSH access. The below will lock it down to only allow ingress from a specific IP address.Once the instance has relaunched, you need to get the host name from the AWS Console EC2 instances tab, or via the API. You should then be able to ssh onto the server.Note: For adding a keypair to the environment configuration, the instances\' termination protection must be off as Beanstalk would try to terminate the current instances and start new instances with the KeyPair. Note: If something is not working, check the "Events" tab in the Beanstalk application / environments and find out what went wrong.Elastic beanstalk CLI v3 now supports direct SSH with the command eb ssh. E.g.No need for all the hassle of setting up security groups of finding out the EC2 instance address.There\'s also this cool trick: That\'ll temporarily force port 22 open to 0.0.0.0, and keep it open until you exit. This blends a bit of the benefits of the top answer, without the hassle. You can temporarily grant someone other than you access for debugging and whatnot. Of course you\'ll still need to upload their public key to the host for them to have access. Once you do that (and as long as you\'re inside eb ssh), the other person canMy experience in August 2013 with a linux client and a simple AWS Beanstalk installation (single EC2 instance) is as follows (based on Community Wiki above)Good luckI have been playing with this as well.The service will be relaunched so make a coffee for 5 minsOn your ec2 tab for the same region you\'ll see your new running instance.\nssh to the public dns name as ec2-user using the key added in 3\ne.g.\nssh ec2-user@ec2-xx-xxx-xx-xxx.compute-1.amazonaws.comThere is a handy \'Connect\' option in the \'Instance Actions\' menu for the EC2 instance.  It will give you the exact SSH command to execute with the correct url for the instance.  Jabley\'s overall instructions are correct.If you are using elastic bean and EB CLI, just use eb ssh to login to instance. You can use options as specified in the following link\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb3-ssh.htmlIt seems the answers above are somewhat dated. Amazon has a good doc on how to do it now. Follow the suggestions above on how to create the key pair. Then follow this:\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features.ec2connect.htmlGood luck!You need to connect to the ec2 instance directly using its public ip address. You can not connect using the elasticbeanstalk url.You can find the instance ip address by looking it up in the ec2 console.You also need to make sure port 22 is open. By default the EB CLI closes port 22 after a ssh connection is complete. You can call eb ssh -o to keep the port open after the ssh session is complete.Warning: You should know that elastic beanstalk could replace your instance at anytime. State is not guaranteed on any of your elastic beanstalk instances. Its probably better to use ssh for testing and debugging purposes only, as anything you modify can go away at any time.The direction to set the key-pair for an ElasticBeanstalk ec2 instance with the current UI is:\nWarning: This will require an update of EC2 instances in your ElasticBeanstalk App. \nNote: You will need to have created a key-pair in the EC2 dashboard prior to this.1) In AWS Dashboard, Select the ElasticBeanstalk service\n2) Select the Application you want to use.\n3) Select \'Configuration\'\n4) Select the gear (settings) icon on the \'Instances\' configuration box.\n5) This will take you to a page titled \'Server\', where you can update the \'EC2 key pair\' drop-down field with your desired key-pair and select \'Save\'.One thing to note is that this may not work for Applications with multiple instances (but I believe it\'s likely if they are all in the same region as the key-pair).I also ran into the same problem awhile ago. I wanted to use the key file, but Amazon says somewhere that you cannot add a key file to an existing EC2 server. For the first Beanstalk application, Amazon preconfigures the application for you. You need to create a new application, and you can configure the EC2 server that runs the Beanstalk app to use an old pem file (ppk if using Putty), or you can create a new one. Now you should be able to SSH.Then configure, then delete your old app.You should be able to do it the way jabley describes. I\'ve written a blog post on how to get started, which covers these details, but it should be pretty straight forward. http://blog.diabol.se/?p=75.
