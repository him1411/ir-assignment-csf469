I have conflicting branches, branch2 branched from branch1.Let\'s say when rebasing branch2 on current branch1, while resolving conflicts, I decide to take some (not all) of "their" (i.e. branch1) files as-is.\nHow do I do that?I tried:You want to use:If you rebase a branch feature_x on master, during rebasing ours refers to the master and theirs to feature_x.As pointed out in the git-rebase docs:Note that a rebase merge works by replaying each commit from the\n  working branch on top of the  branch. Because of this, when\n  a merge conflict happens, the side reported as ours is the so-far\n  rebased series, starting with <upstream>, and theirs is the working\n  branch. In other words, the sides are swapped.For further details read this thread.If you want to pull a particular file from another branch just doThis will pull a version of the file from one branch into the current tree
