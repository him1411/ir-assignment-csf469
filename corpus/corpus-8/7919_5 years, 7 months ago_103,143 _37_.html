When I downloaded the Git project OsmAnd and went to compile it,\nEclipse returned these errors:Google and Stackoverflow said that I must change -Xms40m -Xmx384m in eclipse.ini. \nConversion to Dalvik format failed: Unable to execute dex: Java heap space.\nI cleaned project and restarted Eclipse, but it did not help.I found this link: Tips for Android developer: \xe2\x80\x9cConversion to Dalvik format failed: Unable to execute dex: null\xe2\x80\x9d\nBut I do not know which .jar from my project to change the input in.\nIf anyone can help, I can send the project to them.It can be fixed by changing the VM values in Eclipse.ini.  Set the values to 512 and 1024 as below:The changed area in image\nFor me following steps workedSee hereeclipse.ini look like this.Let me assume this problem caused due to the Android XML, because of very frequently you\'re opening itThese following two issues on StackOverFlow are realted with each other:Every time I click on an Android XML file in Eclipse, it loads data for all API versionsandUnable to execute dex: GC overhead limit exceededI found one more solution to resolve this problem other than increasing the VM values or downgrading to an older ADT version (22.6.2 or 23.2)Note:Some of the older ADT versions which won\'t load the XML each and every time you open so there is no memory overflow to cause this GC overhead limit exceeded as discussed on the first threadSolution:At the bottom of the eclipse there will be Trash can symbol which states Run Garbage Collector. Whenever you close an XML file of android don\'t forget to just click on the Trash Can or Run Garbage Collector to release memory. This way you can protect the workspace from crashing this kind of error :DThis could be an ultimate solution because you can\'t increase the VM value beyond your RAM limit if you very frequently open your android XML especially if you do lot of UI works like me :P I hope this would help everyone who will come to this thread :)Keep Calm and Code OnAfter 12 hours with this error and no success with changing the eclipse.ini file I finally found the correct solution. In my environment variables there was a variable named "_JAVA_OPTIONS" containing the value "-Xmx512M". Changing this value to the same value as in eclipse.ini (-Xmx4096M) I was once again able to export my project to an APK file.I DO NOT know the reason behind this work-around, but it works for me all the time when all of the above don\'t.Do not start eclipse from a short-cut or a link. Always open it from the eclipse.exe in your eclipse folder, the very folder which holds the eclipse.iniNote - I tried only for linux.To avoid this annoyable message, i had to change my configuration as follows:based on the answer marked as correct, changingand:The same eclipse.ini file will be located in Eclipse in this root path of eclipse itself like:The same file will be located in android studio project:-If these answers don\'t work (They didn\'t for me) then try this:1) Make a copy of your .metadata folder in your workspace.2) Delete your .metadata directory AFTER MAKING A COPY3) Open Eclipse and close Eclipse.4) Copy your plugins folder from your old .metadata to your new .metadata5) Import all the projects back into your workspace6) Keep Calm and Code On!
