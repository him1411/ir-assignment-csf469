What are the options to generate .NET 4.0 c# classes (entities) from an xsd file, using Visual Studio 2010?simple enough; just run (at the vs command prompt)(which will create your.cs). Note, however, that most of the intrinsic options here haven\'t changed much since 2.0For the options, use xsd /? or see MSDN; for example /enableDataBinding can be useful.xsd.exe as mentioned by Marc Gravell. The fastest way to get up and running IMO.Or if you need more flexibility/options :xsd2code VS add-in (Codeplex)xsd.exe does not work well when you have circular references (ie a type can own an element of its own type directly or indirectly).When circular references exist, I use Xsd2Code.  Xsd2Code handles circular references well and works within the VS IDE, which is a big plus.  It also has a lot of features you can use like generating the serialization/deserialization code.  Make sure you turn on the GenerateXMLAttributes if you are generating serialization though (otherwise you\'ll get exceptions for ordering if not defined on all elements).Neither works well with the choice feature. you\'ll end up with lists/collections of object instead of the type you want.  I\'d recommend avoiding choice in your xsd if possible as this does not serialize/deserialize well into a strongly typed class.  If you don\'t care about this, though, then it\'s not a problem.The any feature in xsd2code deserializes as System.Xml.XmlElement which I find really convenient but may be an issue if you want strong typed objects.  I often use any when allowing custom config data, so an XmlElement is convenient to pass to another XML deserializer that is custom defined elsewhere.I use XSD in a batch script to generate .xsd file and classes from XML directly :  Marc Gravells answer was right for me but my xsd was with extension of .xml. When I used xsd program it gave :\n- The table (Amt) cannot be the child table to itself in nested relations.As per this KB325695 I renamed extension from .xml to .xsd and it worked fine.I used xsd.exe in the Windows command prompt.However, since my xml referenced several online xml\'s (in my case http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink.xsd which references http://www.w3.org/2001/xml.xsd) I had to also download those schematics, put them in the same directory as my xsd, and then list those files in the command:"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v8.1A\\bin\\NETFX 4.5.1 Tools\\xsd.exe" /classes /language:CS your.xsd xlink.xsd xml.xsd
