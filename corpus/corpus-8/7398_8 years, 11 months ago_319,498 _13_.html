I have been trying to change the background color of Eclipse\'s windows to black and customize the font colors. There doesn\'t seem to be a way to do this, at least not in an obvious way. I am using version 3.3.How do I do this or are there any plugin\'s that might be able to assist in doing this?I just came across this: Eclipse Colour ThemesInstall the plugin and choose from a selection of pre-defined themes, or write your own.\nJust what I needed!Background color of views (navigator, console, tasks etc) is set according to the desktop (system) settings. On Linux/GNome I changed System/Preferences/Appeareance to change this color.Editor colors are set chaotically by different editors, search for background in eclipse preferences to find different options. One easy way to get beautiful dark (and not only dark) themes is to install Afae plugin, and then pick theme within its preferences (twilight theme is beautiful, for example) - again, eclipse prefs, Afae group. Of course this applies only when you edit with Afae.You can install eclipse theme plugin then select default.\nPlease visit here: http://eclipsecolorthemes.org/?view=pluginIf you go to Windows, Preferences then select General, Editors, Text editors, you can set colors on that property page (and there\'s a link for setting MORE colors - General, Appearance, Colors and fonts).That\'s with an Eclipse 3.3 build anyway.Under Windows \xe2\x86\x92 Preferences \xe2\x86\x92 General \xe2\x86\x92 Apperance you can find a dark theme.The easiest way is to install the plugin is from the Eclipse Marketplace. Go to Help\xe2\x86\x92Eclipse Marketplace, then search for Eclipse Color Theme and install it.... on a Mac, Preferences\' is under the main \'Aptana Studio 3\' menu rather than the \'Windows\' menu as mentioned above.On Windows or Mac, you can find this setting under the General \xe2\x86\x92 Editors \xe2\x86\x92 Text Editors menu.
