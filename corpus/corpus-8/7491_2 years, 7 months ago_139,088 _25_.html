Today I updated Font Awesome package to 4.3.0 and noticed that woff2 font was added. That file is linked in CSS so I need to configure nginx to serve woff2 files properly.Currently I have this block in nginx config for fonts:What is proper mime type for woff2 fonts?In IIS you can declare the mime type for WOFF2 font files by adding the following to your project\'s web.config:Update:\nThe mime type may be changing according to the latest W3C Editor\'s Draft WOFF2 spec. See Appendix A: Internet Media Type Registration section 6.5. WOFF 2.0 which states the latest proposed format is font/woff2font/woff2For nginx add the following to the mime.types file:font/woff2    woff2;Old AnswerThe mime type (sometime written as mimetype) for WOFF2 fonts has been proposed as application/font-woff2.Also, if you refer to the spec (http://dev.w3.org/webfonts/WOFF2/spec/) you will see that font/woff2 is being discussed. I suspect that the filal mime type for all fonts will eventually be the more logical font/* (font/ttf, font/woff2 etc)...N.B. WOFF2 is still in \'Working Draft\' status -- not yet adopted officially.In Apache, you can add the woff2 mime type via your .htaccess file as stated by this link.In IIS, simply add the following mimeMap tag into your web.config file inside the staticContent tag.http://dev.w3.org/webfonts/WOFF2/spec/#IMTIt seem that w3c switched it to font/woff2I see there is some discussion about the proper mime type.\nIn the link we read: This document defines a top-level MIME type "font" ...... the officially defined IANA subtypes such as "application/font-woff" ...The members of the W3C WebFonts WG believe the use of "application" top-level type is not ideal.and laterSo proposition from W3C differs from IANA.We can see that it also differs from woff type:\nhttp://dev.w3.org/webfonts/WOFF/spec/#IMT\nwhere we read:which ishttp://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF/#appendix-b
