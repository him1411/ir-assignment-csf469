This question already has an answer here:I have some fragments in my activityAnd on Back Button Press I must to return from [2] to [1] if current active fragment is [2], or do nothing otherwise.What is the best practise to do that?EDIT: Application must not return to [2] from [3]...[6]When you are transitioning between Fragments, call addToBackStack() as part of your FragmentTransaction:If you require more detailed control (i.e. when some Fragments are visible, you want to suppress the back key) you can set an OnKeyListener on the parent view of your fragment:I\'d rather do something like this:if you overide the onKey method for the fragment view you\'re gonna need :Use addToBackStack method when replacing one fragment by another:Then in your activity, use the following code to go back from a fragment to another (the previous one).If you want to handle hardware Back key event than you have to do following code in your onActivityCreated() method of Fragment.You also need to check Action_Down or Action_UP event. If you will not check then onKey() Method will call 2 times.Also, If your rootview(getView()) will not contain focus then it will not work. If you have clicked on any control then again you need to give focus to rootview using  getView().requestFocus(); After this only onKeydown() will call.Working very well for me.The most ideal way of doing this is found here:\nFragment: which callback invoked when press back button & customize itCreate interfaces:BackButtonHandlerInterfaceOnBackClickListenerIn Activity:In Fragment:\n\nOr you could use getSupportFragmentManager().getBackStackEntryCount() to check what to do:If you manage the flow of adding to back stack every transaction, then you can do something like this in order to show the previous fragment when the user presses back button (you could map the home button too).I\'m working with SlidingMenu and Fragment, present my case here and hope helps somebody.Logic when [Back] key pressed :SlidingMenu not shows, current Fragment is #0, do the original [Back] key does.This is a very good and reliable solution: http://vinsol.com/blog/2014/10/01/handling-back-button-press-inside-fragments/The guy has made an abstract fragment that handles the backPress behaviour and is switching between the active fragments using the strategy pattern. For some of you there maybe a little drawback in the abstract class...Shortly, the solution from the link goes like this:And usage in the activity:Working Code:I think the easiest way is to create an interface, and in the Activity check if the fragment is of the interface type, and if so, call its method to handle the pop. Here\'s the interface to implement in the fragment. Here\'s how to implement it.And in your Activity, when you handle the pop (likely in both onBackPressed and onOptionsItemSelected), pop the backstack using this method:You can use from getActionBar().setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled() :We created tiny library for handling back press across multiple fragments and/or in Activity. Usage is as simple as adding dependency in your gradle file:Let your fragment implement BackFragment interface:Notify your fragments about back presses:For more details and other use-cases visit GitHub page:https://github.com/skoumalcz/fragment-backAdd addToBackStack() to fragment transaction and then use below code for Implementing Back Navigation for Fragmentsif you are using FragmentActivity. then do like thisfirst call This inside your Fragment.and then Call onBackPressed method in side your parent FragmentActivity class.Add this code in your Activity@OverrideAnd add this line in your Fragment before commit()ft.addToBackStack("Any name");For Those Who Use Static FragmentIn a case if you have a static fragment then It would be preferable. \nMake an instance object of your fragmentin onCreate() of MyFragment initialize that instancealso make a function to get Instancealso make functions In Your Activity You can do in fragment class put this code for back event:After looking at all solutions, I realised there is a much simpler solution.In your activity\'s onBackPressed() that is hosting all your fragments, find the fragment that you want to prevent back press. Then if found, just return. Then popBackStack will never happen for this fragment. In your oncreateView() method you need to write this code and in KEYCODE_BACk condition you can write whatever the functionality you want
