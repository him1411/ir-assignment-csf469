I need to change my column type from date to datetime for an app I am making. I don\'t care about the data as its still being developed.How can I do this? First in your terminal:Then in your migration file:For Rails >= 3.2:Also, if you\'re using Rails 3 or newer you don\'t have to use the up and down methods. You can just use change:In Rails 3.2 and Rails 4, Benjamin\'s popular answer has a slightly different syntax.First in your terminal:Then in your migration file:There\'s a change_column method, just execute it in your migration with datetime as a new type.AFAIK, migrations are there to try to reshape data you care about (i.e. production) when making schema changes. So unless that\'s wrong, and since he did say he does not care about the data, why not just modify the column type in the original migration from date to datetime and re-run the migration? (Hope you\'ve got tests:)).
