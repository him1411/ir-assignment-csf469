Is it possible in linux command line to have a command repeat every n seconds.For example, say I have an import running and i am doingto check the file size is increasing.  I would like to have a command to have this automatically repeat.Watch every 5 seconds ...watch -n 5 ls -lIf you wish to have visual confirmation of changes, append --differences prior to the ls command.According to the OSX man page, there\'s alsoThe --cumulative option makes highlighting "sticky", presenting a\n  running display of  all  positions  that  have  ever changed.  The -t\n  or --no-title option turns off the header showing the interval,\n  command, and current time at the top of the display, as well as the\n  following blank line.Linux/Unix man page can be found here "watch" does not allow fractions of a second in Busybox, while "sleep" does. If that matters to you, try this:Running commands periodically without cron is possible when we go with while.As a command:Example: Do not forget the last & as it will put your loop in the background. But you need to find the process id with command "ps -ef | grep your_script" then you need to kill it. So kindly add the \'&\' when you running the script.Here is the same loop as a script. Create file "while_check.sh" and put this in it:Then run it by typing bash ./while_check.sh &If the command contains some special characters such as pipes and quotes, the command needs to be padded with quotes. For example, to repeat ls -l | grep "txt", the watch command should be:watch -n 5 \'ls -l | grep "txt"\'sleep already returns 0. Thus, I\'m usingwhich is a tiny bit shorter than mikhail\'s solution.If you want to avoid "drifting", meaning you want the command to execute every N seconds regardless of how long the command takes (assuming it takes less than N seconds), here\'s some bash that will repeat a command every 5 seconds with one-second accuracy (and will print out a warning if it can\'t keep up):It may still drift a little since the sleep is only accurate to one second.  You could improve this accuracy by creative use of the date command.watch is good but will clean the screen.You can run the following and filter the size only. If your file was called  somefilename you can do the followingwhile :; do ls -lh | awk \'/some*/{print $5}\'; sleep 5; doneOne of the many ideas`If you want to do something a specific number of times you can always do this:To minimize drift more easily, use:there will still be a tiny amount of drift due to bash\'s time to run the loop structure and the sleep command to actually execute.hint: \':\' evals to 0 ie true.
