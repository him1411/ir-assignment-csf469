I\'m writing a Rails application, but can\'t seem to find how to do relative time, i.e. if given a certain Time class, it can calculate "30 seconds ago" or "2 days ago" or if it\'s longer than a month "9/1/2008", etc.Sounds like you\'re looking for the time_ago_in_words method (or distance_of_time_in_words), from ActiveSupport. Call it like this:I\'ve written this, but have to check the existing methods mentioned to see if they are better.Just to clarify Andrew Marshall\'s solution for using time_ago_in_words\n(For Rails 3.0 and Rails 4.0)If you are in a viewIf you are in a controllerControllers do not have the module ActionView::Helpers::DateHelper imported by default.N.B. It is not "the rails way" to import helpers into your controllers.  Helpers are for helping views.  The time_ago_in_words method was decided to be a view entity in the MVC triad.  (I don\'t agree but when in rome...)What aboutOr something else you were shooting for?You can use the arithmetic operators to do relative time.Will give you 2 days ago.Something like this would work.Take a look at the instance methods here:http://apidock.com/rails/TimeThis has useful methods such as yesterday, tomorrow, beginning_of_week, ago, etc.Examples:Since the most answer here suggests time_ago_in_words.Instead of using :In Rails, Prefer:alongwith a jquery library http://timeago.yarp.com/, with code:Main Advantage : Cachinghttp://rails-bestpractices.com/posts/2012/02/10/not-use-time_ago_in_words/I\'ve written a gem that does this for Rails ActiveRecord objects. The example uses created_at, but it will also work on updated_at or anything with the class ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone.Just gem install and call the \'pretty\' method on your TimeWithZone instance. https://github.com/brettshollenberger/hublotAnother approach is to unload some logic from the backend and maek the browser do the job by using Javascript plugins such as:jQuery time ago or its Rails Gem adaptation
