I\'ve created a web application which uses a tagbox drop down, this works great in all browsers except my preferred browser Chrome (Version 21.0.1180.89).Despite both the input field AND the form field having the autocomplete="off" attribute, Chrome insists on showing a drop down history of previous entries for the field, which is obliterating the tagbox list.In my experience, Chrome only autocompletes the first <input type="password"> and the previous <input>.  So I added:To the top of the <form> and the case was resolved.It appears that Chrome now ignores autocomplete="off" unless it is on the <form autocomplete="off"> tag. The best solution: orWorks in:Chrome: 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57 and 58Firefox: 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49 and 50For a reliable workaround, you can add this code to your layout page:Chrome respects autocomplete=off only when there is at least one other input element in the form with any other autocomplete value.This will not work with password fields--those are handled very differently in Chrome. See https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=468153 for more details.UPDATE: Bug closed as "Won\'t Fix" by Chromium Team March 11, 2016. See last comment in my originally filed bug report, for full explanation. TL;DR: use semantic autocomplete attributes such as autocomplete="new-street-address" to avoid Chrome performing autofill.Chrome version 34 now ignores the autocomplete=off, \nsee this.Lots of discussion on whether this is a good thing or a bad thing? Whats your views?The solution at present is to use type="search". Google doesn\'t apply autofill to inputs with a type of search.See: https://twitter.com/Paul_Kinlan/status/596613148985171968Update 04/04/2016: Looks like this is fixed! See http://codereview.chromium.org/1473733008Simply make your input readonly, and on focus, remove it. This is a very simple approach and browsers will not populate readonly inputs. Therefore, this method is accepted and will never be overwritten by future browser updates.Style your input accordingly so that it does not look like a readonly inputWORKING EXAMPLEBrowser does not care about autocomplete=off auto or even fills credentials to wrong text field?I fixed it by setting the password field to read-only and activate it, when user clicks into it or uses tab-key to this field.fix browser autofill in: readonly and set writeble on focus (at mouse click and tabbing through fields)Update:\nMobile Safari sets cursor in the field, but does not show virtual keyboard. New Fix works like before but handles virtual keyboard:Live Demo https://jsfiddle.net/danielsuess/n0scguv6/// UpdateEndBy the way, more information on my observation:Sometimes I notice this strange behavior on Chrome and Safari, when there are password fields in the same form. I guess, the browser looks for a password field to insert your saved credentials. Then it autofills username into the nearest textlike-input field , that appears prior the password field in DOM (just guessing due to observation). As the browser is the last instance and you can not control it, sometimes even autocomplete=off would not prevent to fill in credentials into wrong fields, but not user or nickname field. Well, a little late to the party, but it seems that there is a bit of misunderstanding about how autocomplete should and shouldn\'t work. According to the HTML specifications, the user agent (in this case Chrome) can override autocomplete:https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#autofilling-form-controls:-the-autocomplete-attributeA user agent may allow the user to override an element\'s autofill field name, e.g. to change it from "off" to "on" to allow values to be remembered and prefilled despite the page author\'s objections, or to always "off", never remembering values. However, user agents should not allow users to trivially override the autofill field name from "off" to "on" or other values, as there are significant security implications for the user if all values are always remembered, regardless of the site\'s preferences.So in the case of Chrome, the developers have essentially said "we will leave this to the user to decide in their preferences whether they want autocomplete to work or not. If you don\'t want it, don\'t enable it in your browser".However, it appears that this is a little over-zealous on their part for my liking, but it is the way it is. The specification also discusses the potential security implications of such a move:The "off" keyword indicates either that the control\'s input data is particularly sensitive (for example the activation code for a nuclear weapon); or that it is a value that will never be reused (for example a one-time-key for a bank login) and the user will therefore have to explicitly enter the data each time, instead of being able to rely on the UA to prefill the value for him; or that the document provides its own autocomplete mechanism and does not want the user agent to provide autocompletion values.So after experiencing the same frustration as everyone else, I found a solution that works for me. It is similar in vein to the autocomplete="false" answers. A Mozilla article speaks to exactly this problem:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Securing_your_site/Turning_off_form_autocompletion In some case, the browser will keep suggesting autocompletion values even if the autocomplete attribute is set to off. This unexpected behavior can be quite puzzling for developers. The trick to really force the no-completion is to assign a random string to the attributeSo the following code should work:And so should each of the following:The issue I see is that the browser agent might be smart enough to learn the autocomplete attribute and apply it next time it sees the form. If it does do this, the only way I can see to still get around the problem would be to dynamically change the autocomplete attribute value when the page is generated.One point worth mentioning is that many browser will ignore autocomplete settings for login fields (username and password). As the Mozilla article states:For this reason, many modern browsers do not support autocomplete="off" for login fields.This is the behavior in Firefox (since version 38), Google Chrome (since 34), and Internet Explorer (since version 11).Finally a little info on whether the attribute belongs on the form element or the input element. The spec again has the answer:If the autocomplete attribute is omitted, the default value corresponding to the state of the element\'s form owner\'s autocomplete attribute is used instead (either "on" or "off"). If there is no form owner, then the value "on" is used.So. Putting it on the form should apply to all input fields. Putting it on an individual element should apply to just that element (even if there isn\'t one on the form). If autocomplete isn\'t set at all, it defaults to on.SummaryTo disable autocomplete on the whole form:Or if you dynamically need to do it:To disable autocomplete on an individual element (regardless of the form setting being present or not)Or if you dynamically need to do it:And remember that certain user agents can override even your hardest fought attempts to disable autocomplete.Seen chrome ignore the autocomplete="off", I solve it with a stupid way which is using "fake input" to cheat chrome to fill it up instead of filling the "real" one.Example:Chrome will fill up the "fake input", and when submit, server will take the "real input" value.I am posting this answer to bring an updated solution to this problem.\nI am currently using Chrome 49 and no given answer work for this one.\nI am also looking for a solution working with other browsers and previous versions.Put this code on the beginning of your formThen, for your real password field, useComment this answer if this is no longer working or if you get an issue with another browser or version.Approved on:to anyone looking for a solution to this, I finally figure it out. Chrome only obey\'s the autocomplete="off" if the page is a HTML5 page (I was using XHTML).I converted my page to HTML5 and the problem went away (facepalm).Up until just this last week, the two solutions below appeared to work for Chrome, IE and Firefox. But with the release of Chrome version 48 (and still in 49), they no longer work:The following in the password input element:autocomplete="off"So to quickly fix this, at first I tried to use a major hack of initially setting the password input element to disabled and then used a setTimeout in the document ready function to enable it again. But this seemed so crazy and I did some more searching and found @tibalts answer in Disabling Chrome Autofill. His answer is to use autocomplete="new-password" in the passwords input and this appears to work on all browsers (I have kept my fix number 1 above at this stage).Here is the link in the Google Chrome developer discussion:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=370363#c7 You can use autocomplete="new-password"Works in:Instead of autocomplete="off" use autocomplete="false" ;)from: https://stackoverflow.com/a/29582380/75799As of Chrome 42, none of the solutions/hacks in this thread (as of 2015-05-21T12:50:23+00:00) work for disabling autocomplete for an individual field or the entire form. EDIT: I\'ve found that you actually only need to insert one dummy email field into your form (you can hide it with display: none) before the other fields to prevent autocompleting. I presume that chrome stores some sort of form signature with each autocompleted field and including another email field corrupts this signature and prevents autocompleting.The good news is that since the "form signature" is corrupted by this, none of the fields are autocompleted, so no JS is needed to clear the fake fields before submission.Old Answer:The only thing I\'ve found to be still viable is to insert two dummy fields of type email and password before the real fields. You can set them to display: none to hide them away (it isn\'t smart enough to ignore those fields):Unfortunately, the fields must be within your form (otherwise both sets of inputs are autofilled). So, for the fake fields to be truly ignored you\'ll need some JS to run on form submit to clear them:Notice from above that clearing the value with Javascript works to override the autocomplete. So if loosing the proper behavior with JS disabled is acceptable, you can simplify all of this with a JS autocomplete "polyfill" for Chrome:After the chrome v. 34, setting autocomplete="off" at <form> tag doesn`t workI made the changes to avoid this annoying behavior:(So far, Chrome wont put the saved password on the input, but the form is now broken)Finally, to make the form work, put this code to run when the user click the submit button, or whenever you want to trigger the form submittion:In my case, I used to hav id="password" name="password" in the password input, so I put them back before trigger the submition.I just updated to Chrome 49 and Diogo Cid\'s solution doesn\'t work anymore.I made a different workaround hiding and removing the fields at run-time after the page is loaded.Chrome now ignores the original workaround applying the credentials to the first displayed type="password" field and its previous type="text" field, so I have hidden both fields using CSS visibility: hidden;I know that it may seem not very elegant but it works.In Chrome 48+ use this solution:Put fake fields before real fields:Hide fake fields:You did it!Also this will work for older versions.Whilst I agree autocomplete should be a user choice, there are times when Chrome is over-zealous with it (other browsers may be too). For instance, a password field with a different name is still auto-filled with a saved password and the previous field populated with the username. This particularly sucks when the form is a user management form for a web app and you don\'t want autofill to populate it with your own credentials.Chrome completely ignores autocomplete="off" now. Whilst the JS hacks may well work, I found a simple way which works at the time of writing:Set the value of the password field to the control character 8 ("\\x08" in PHP or &#8; in HTML). This stops Chrome auto-filling the field because it has a value, but no actual value is entered because this is the backspace character.Yes this is still a hack, but it works for me. YMMV.i found this solution to be the most appropriate: It must be loaded after dom ready, or after the form renders. I solved in another way. You can try this.The hidden input element trick still appears to work (Chrome 43) to prevent autofill, but one thing to keep in mind is that Chrome will attempt to autofill based on the placeholder tag. You need to match the hidden input element\'s placeholder to that of the input you\'re trying to disable.In my case, I had a field with a placeholder text of \'City or Zip\' which I was using with Google Place Autocomplete. It appeared that it was attempting to autofill as if it were part of an address form. The trick didn\'t work until I put the same placeholder on the hidden element as on the real input:I had a similar issue where the input field took either a name or an email. I set autocomplete="off" but Chrome still forced suggestions. Turns out it was because the placeholder text had the words "name" and "email" in it.For exampleI got around it by putting a zero width space into the words in the placeholder. No more Chrome autocomplete.After having tried all solutions, Here is what seems to be working for chrome version:45, with form having password field :Looks like this is fixed! See https://codereview.chromium.org/1473733008Here is what worked for me on Chrome Version 51.0.2704.106.<input id="user_name" type="text" name="user_name" autocomplete="off" required />\n and in combination with <input id="user_password" type="password" name="user_password"  autocomplete="new-password" required />. My problem was that after implementing new-password it would still show a drop-down of usernames on the user_name field.Need to use AutoComplete=\'false\' which will work on chrome browser also Used code I\'ve just tried the following, and it appears to do the trick on Chrome 53 - it also disables the "Use password for:" drop down when entering the password field.Simply set your password input type to text, and then add the onfocus handler (inline or via jQuery/vanilla JS) to set the type to password:Or even better:Add this right after form tag:Add this to your css file:
