Is it possible to have an ASP.NET MVC route that uses subdomain information to determine its route?  For example:Or, can I make it so both of these go to the same controller/action with a username parameter?You can do it by creating a new route and adding it to the routes collection in RegisterRoutes in your global.asax.  Below is a very simple example of a custom Route:To capture the subdomain while retaining the standard MVC5 routing features, use the following SubdomainRoute class derived from Route.Additionally, SubdomainRoute allows the subdomain optionally to be specified as a query parameter, making sub.example.com/foo/bar and example.com/foo/bar?subdomain=sub equivalent. This allows you to test before the DNS subdomains are configured. The query parameter (when in use) is propagated through new links generated by Url.Action, etc.The query parameter also enables local debugging with Visual Studio 2013 without having to configure with netsh or run as Administrator. By default, IIS Express only binds to localhost when non-elevated; it won\'t bind to synonymous hostnames like sub.localtest.me.For convenience, call the following MapSubdomainRoute method from your RegisterRoutes method just as you would plain old MapRoute:Finally, to conveniently access the subdomain (either from a true subdomain or a query parameter), it is helpful to create a Controller base class with this Subdomain property:This is not my work, but I had to add it on this answer.Here is a great solution to this problem.  Maartin Balliauw wrote code that creates a DomainRoute class that can be used very similarly to the normal routing.http://blog.maartenballiauw.be/post/2009/05/20/ASPNET-MVC-Domain-Routing.aspxSample use would be like this...;To capture the subdomain when using Web API, override the Action Selector to inject a subdomain query parameter. Then use the subdomain query parameter in your controllers\' actions like this:This approach makes debugging convenient since you can specify the query parameter by hand when using localhost instead of the actual host name (see the standard MVC5 routing answer for details). This is the code for Action Selector:Replace the default Action Selector by adding this to WebApiConfig.Register:Yes but you have to create your own route handler.  Typically the route is not aware of the domain because the application could be deployed to any domain and the route would not care one way or another.  But in your case you want to base the controller and action off the domain, so you will have to create a custom route that is aware of the domain.In ASP.NET Core, the host is available via Request.Host.Host. If you want to allow overriding the host via a query parameter, first check Request.Query.To cause a host query parameter to propagate into to new route-based URLs, add this code to the app.UseMvc route configuration:And define HostPropagationRouter like this:After defining a new Route handler that would look at the host passed in the URL, you can go with the idea of a base Controller that is aware of the Site it\xe2\x80\x99s being accessed for. It looks like this:ISiteProvider is a simple interface:I refer you go to  Luke Sampson BlogIf you are looking at giving MultiTenancy capabilities to your project with different domains/subdomains for each tenant, you should have a look at SaasKit:https://github.com/saaskit/saaskitCode examples can be seen here: http://benfoster.io/blog/saaskit-multi-tenancy-made-easySome examples using ASP.NET core: http://andrewlock.net/forking-the-pipeline-adding-tenant-specific-files-with-saaskit-in-asp-net-core/EDIT:\nIf you do no want to use SaasKit in your ASP.NET core project you can have a look at Maarten\'s implementation of domain routing for MVC6: https://blog.maartenballiauw.be/post/2015/02/17/domain-routing-and-resolving-current-tenant-with-aspnet-mvc-6-aspnet-5.htmlHowever those Gists are not maintained and need to be tweaked to work with the latest release of ASP.NET core.Direct link to the code: https://gist.github.com/maartenba/77ca6f9cfef50efa96ec#file-domaintemplateroutebuilderextensions-cs
