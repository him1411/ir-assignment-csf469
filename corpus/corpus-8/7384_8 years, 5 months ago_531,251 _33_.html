How to use jQuery to get the checked checkboxes values, and put it into a textarea immediately?Just like this code:If the id="c_d" is updated by Ajax, the below of altCognito\'s code doesn\'t work. Is there any good solution?UpdateHere\'s one that works. (see the example)Some number of months later another question was asked in regards to how to keep the above working if the ID changes. Well, the solution boils down to mapping the updateTextArea function into something generic that uses css classes, and to use the live function to monitor the DOM for those changes. Sorry, I\'m not really up to writing the example at the moment.You can also return all selected checkboxes value in comma separated string.\nThis will also make it easier for you when you send it as a parameter to SQLHere is a sample that return all selected checkboxes values that have the name "chkboxName" in comma separate stringAnd here is the javascriptHere is the HTML sampleYour question is quite vague but I think this is what you need:Edit: Oh, okay.. there you go... You didn\'t have the HTML up before. Anyways, yeah, I thought you meant to put the value in a textarea when it gets clicked. If you want the checked checkboxes\' values to be put into the textarea (maybe with a nice comma-seperation) on page load it would be as simple as:Edit 2 As people have done, you can also do this to shortcut the lengthy selector I wrote:... I totally forgot about that shortcut. ;)This works perfectly for me:Thanks Mohamed ElSheikhThanx altCognito your solution helped....\nwe can also do this by using nam eof the checkboxes...This one helps tooThe following may be useful since I got here looking for a slightly different solution. My script needed to automatically loop through input elements and had to return their values (for jQuery.post() function), the problem was with checkboxes returning their values regardless of checked status. This was my solution:Usage:If the given input field is a checkbox, the input_val function only returns a value if its checked.  For all other elements, the value is returned regardless of checked status. Here\'s an alternative in case you need to save the value to a variable:(map() returns an array, which I find handier than the text in textarea).Anyway, you probably need something like this:This will get the value of the first checked checkbox on the page and insert that in the textarea with id=\'textarea\'.Note that in your example code you should put the checkboxes in a form.A much easier and shorted way which I am using to accomplish the same, using answer from another post, is like this:Originally the cities are retrieved from a MySQL database, and looped in PHP while loop:Now, using the above jQuery code, I get all the city_id values, and submit back to the database using $.get(...)This has made my life so easy since now the code is fully dynamic. In order to add more cities, all I need to do is to add more cities in my database, and no worries on PHP or jQuery end.If you want to insert the value of any checkbox immediately as it is ebing ckecked then this should work for you I have had a similar problem and this is how i solved it using the examples above:Try this one..
