I have some disabled inputs in a form and I want to send them to a server, but Chrome excludes them from the request. Is there any workaround for this without adding a hidden field? Elements with Disabled attribute are not submitted or you can say their values are not posted. i.e.FYI,You can use readonly attribute in your case, by doing this you will be able to post your field\'s data.i.e.FYI,Hope this helps.Using Jquery and sending the data with ajax, you can solve your problem: If you absolutely have to have the field disabled and pass the data you could use a javascript to input the same data into a hidden field (or just set the hidden field too).  This would allow you to have it disabled but still post the data even though you\'d be posting to another page.I\'m updating this answer since is very useful. Just add readonly to the input.So the form will be:You can totally avoid disabling, it is painful since html form format won\'t send anything related to <p> or some other label.So you can instead put regularadd this\nreadonly="readonly"It wouldn\'t disable your text but wouldn\'t change by user so it work like <p> and will send value through form. Just remove border if you would like to make it more like <p> tag
