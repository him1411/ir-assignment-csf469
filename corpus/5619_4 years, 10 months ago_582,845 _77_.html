I\'m really new to setting up web servers in general. I\'ve got IIS 8 on Windows 8, and I\'m trying to set up a little site locally, while doing some development. In IIS I choose Add Site, give a name, points to a location where I have a index.html file (I\'ve tried different locations, latest in a c:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\test -folder) and otherwise use all default settings. However, when I try to browse to localhost I get HTTP Error 503. The service is unavailable.I\'ve verified the pool is started, and I\'ve given IIS_IUSRS Full Control on the target folderI\'ve search around but not found anything that solved my issue, and there\'s nothing helpfull in the EventLog or in the C:\\Windows\\System32\\LogFiles\\HTTPERR folderCould anyone tell me what\'s wrong?It could be that the user identity is outdated, especially if you\'ve tried starting a stopped app pool and the next request again fails.In IIS, go to the Application Pools under the Server, then find the correct Application Pool for your web site, and click on it. On the Advanced Settings menu to the right,  select Identity and change it and enter new user and password. Click on your Application Pool again, and select Recycle to restart it.You can also try looking at the error message in Event Viewer, under Windows Logs, Application, Details tab. Edit: jcolebrand 2017-05-04I had this error, and it was because I was doing some powershell scripting, so I had C:\\\\path instead of C:\\path. Yay typos! Saying this to say, always double check your keyed-in values.In my case the problem was the DefaultAppPool. I changed the "Load User Profile" to false and now it works. However, I don\'t know if there are side effects to this.\nOther answers are fine. But in my case, I was working on a Windows box that already was running some old IIS, IISExpress or any other web site. What happened is urls ACLs where reserved somehow in the system. So, you might want to check this.Here is the console command to dump all URL acls:Check what\'s returned here, and if anything matches the url you are testing, here is the command to delete one URL acl (for example):(beware to carefully note what you do here in case it was not related to the original problem)Check your application\'s respective Application Framework Pool - it could be stopped. If it is, start it and check again.If you\'re still experiencing issues you can also check out Event Viewer to find the cause of that error in order to troubleshoot more.If it helps anyone, and this may be laughable, but not obvious to me, was the application pool was not started. I just presumed on starting the website or creating the application pool, it would start. In fact, I didn\'t even know you had to start the application pool...In my case, the application pool had stopped. Starting it fixed the problem. My website is hosted on Arvixe. The error problem probably occurred because I have membership based application and something bad happened when I was upload files.If App pool is running under some user identity then go to the advance settings of update username password again,\nit worked for me.Start by looking in Event Viewer, either under the System or the Application log.In my case the problem was that no worker process could be started for the App Pool because its configuration file couldn\'t be read - I had included an extra \'.\' at the end of its name.I resolved this issue by removing a URL reservation that matched my app directory in IIS. I had a similar (definitely not the same) issue as outlined in this article: A Not So Common Root Cause for 503 Service UnavailableIn my case Pool uses custom identity(account and password).After password expired and reload,the error has ocured.I simply correct password in identityIn my case, I created a new App Pool, and just forgot to start it.It is possible that your domain requires the account used for running the AppPool to have batch logon rights. In which case you will see this same error message. The way you can tell if that is the case, is by looking at the System events in the Event Viewer. There should be an event saying that the account being used with the App Pool has either \'the wrong password or does not have batch logon rights\'.This is why developers quite often use IIS Express on their development machine, since it by passes the batch logon rights issue.I ran into the same issue, but it was an issue with the actual site settings in IIS.Select Advanced Settings... for your site/application and then look at the Enabled Protocols value. For whatever reson the value was blank for my site and caused the following error:HTTP Error 503. The service is unavailable.The fix was to add in http and select OK. The site was then functional again.Check Event Viewer - Windows - Application. If there is a red Error line made from IIS-W3SVC-WP and the message is like The Module DLL C:\\Windows\\system32\\inetsrv\\rewrite.dll failed to load. The data is the error. then you are missing some Windows Setup features.In Windows Server 2012 go to Server Manager, Add Roles and Features, Web Server (IIS) and add the matching feature. Usually, most of the Application Development section is installed. Here is a complete list of IIS features and their associated DLL to help in diagnosis.After going through a few iterations of that I ended on the error message above regarding "rewrite.dll". This led to a direct download and install of Microsoft URL Rewrite tool. Finally all websites came to life.If you have IIS URL Rewriting installed it could be to do with that.  I suffered issues after a Windows 10 Update.This StackOverflow post helped me.Go to Windows Control Panel > Programs and Features > IIS URL Rewrite Module 2 > Repair.I followed Solve HTTP Error 503 link above. In my case my application pool was stopping every time when I right click on my svc file and choose "Browse". I followed below steps to solve problem of Application Pool stoppingI am using Windows Server 2008 R2.In my IIS manager application pool, I right-clicked on the application pool which I am interested in and clicked Advanced Settings. This opens up Advanced Settings popup.In that under Process Model section click Identity and clicked Set button in my Application Pool Identity popup. This will open Set credentials popup where I gave Username, password, and confirm password and clicked OK. Now when I right click on my svc file it opens up in IE browser.After some try and error I found out, that the app pool was configured to use my domain account as identity and I remembered that I changed the password of my domain account shorty before. Resetting the application pool\xe2\x80\x99s identity (using my new password) fixed the problem and the app pool could be restarted without any problems.Same thing with IIS Express 10.0 after upgrading Windows 7 to Windows 10.\nSolution: go to IIS and enable all disabled websites and reinstall ASP.NET Core.If you have McAfee HIPS and if you see the following error in event viewer application log:  The Module DLL C:\\Windows\\System32\\inetsrv\\HipIISEngineStub.dll failed to load.\n      The data is the error.  Then this workaround on McAfee.com resolved the issue in my case.Quote from the page:Edit the <globalModules> section and remove the following line:\n  <add name="MfeEngine" image="%windir%\\System32\\inetsrv\\HipIISEngineStub.dll" />Edit the <modules> section and remove the following line:\n  <add name="MfeEngine" />     Also check the address bar and make sure the page is in the right location. This error can be returned instead of the 404 (Page not found). In my case, it was a bad link on the page that didn\'t have a subfolder included.Our server ran out of disk space on Sunday afternoon which led to an application suddenly failing and returning HTTP error 502. The logs were empty so it had to be something that was occurring before IIS even did anything.A swift look at the event viewer(WIN+R > eventvwr) exposed the issue. \nIt\'s a good idea to filter out the output of the System and Application windows to WAS since it can get pretty verbose in there.The application depended on another one which was disabled. Therefore keep in mind an application can go down indirectly if one of it\'s dependent processes has gone down. We simply re-enabled the .NET application pool and our other application started running normally again.This might be because of number of connections to the database. I had such a situation and so, wrote a de-constructor and killed db open connection and it resolved.I had the same problem and found it was caused by permission problems creating the user profile in C:\\Users. I gave ApplicationPoolIdentity full permissions to the C:\\Users folder, started the site and everything worked, the profile must have been created properly, and my site worked as it should. I then removed access to C:\\Users from ApplicationPoolIdentity.Site wont start on local using ApplicationPoolIdentity, only when using NetworkService: "HTTP Error 503. The service is unavailable."For me, the DefaultAppPool was unable to start and the event log told me that C:\\Windows\\System32\\inetsrv\\redirect.dll was unable to load.The file was missing. The cause for this was that the Windows feature "HTTP Redirection" was not installed. Check if that feature is ticket under Internet Information Services\\World Wide Web Services\\Common HTTP Features\\HTTP Redirection. No reboot should be required if you just installed it now.I know this is answered in different way but in my case, I noticed the app pool stopping automatically even after a manual restart. And it but when I change the password for the account used and is changed few days ago, it works just fine without any other change.\nTry the same.Or if none of the current solutions work, look in your website\'s directory for a file called app_offline.htm. That basically tells IIS that your site is unavailable and to show this page instead. To fix it, either delete it or rename it to app_offline.htm.bak.In my case, I added it while showing a colleague how to use that to prevent traffic to the site temporarily and then forgot that I did that on my box. Sigh.This happened to me on a server on our intranet. After browsing through blog posts and Windows logs, it turned out that a few days before Christmas 2015 (related to a Windows Update?) my web site application pool wanted to create a config file in folder c:\\inetpub\\temp\\appPools, but access to this folder was restricted. This caused the application pool to be disabled.After adding Full control to Everyone on this temp folder, I restarted the Windows Process Activation Service and everything went online again.If I\'d been a little more elegant, it would probably had been enough to grant the AppPool user full control to the folder, but I never seem to remember how the app pool name and app pool user relates to eachother...In my case, the problem was that another application was using the port that I had bound to my web site.I found it by running the following command from a command line, which lists all of the listening ports and the executable involved:I had the same error today. The issue was that I recently changed the domain password, so I had to update it in each Application Pool, in Advanced Settings > Process Model > Identity credentials.This could also happen if any recent installs or updates happened with .NET framework and/or ASP.NET. If you are unsure of what happened recently and if all your apps use ASP.NET version 4, you can try reset them by running the following commands in command prompt in administrator mode.This makes sure to install or reinstall ASP.NET 4 and updates existing applications to use ASP.NET 4 version of the app pool. It updates both IIS Classic and Integrated mode handlers and script mappings in the IIS metabase. It also recreates ASP.NET v4.0 and ASP.NET v4.0 Classic app pools, and sets .NET framework 4 to DefaultAppPool and Classic .NET app pools.
