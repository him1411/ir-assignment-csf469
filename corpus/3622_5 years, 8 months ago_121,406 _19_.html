In shell scripts, when do we use {} when expanding variables?For example, I have seen the following:Is there a significant difference, or is it just style? Is one preferred over the other?In this particular example, it makes no difference. However, the {} in ${} are useful if you want to expand the variable foo in the stringsince "$foobar" would instead expand foobar.Curly braces are also unconditionally required when:Doing this everywhere, instead of just in potentially ambiguous cases, can be considered good programming practice. This is both for consistency and to avoid surprises like $foo_$bar.jpg, where it\'s not visually obvious that the underscore becomes part of the variable name.Variables are declared and assigned without $ and without {}. You have to useto assign. In order to read from the variable (in other words, \'expand\' the variable), you must use $.This has confused me sometimes - in other languages we refer to the variable in the same way, regardless of whether it\'s on the left or right of an assignment. But shell-scripting is different, $var=10 doesn\'t do what you might think it does!You use {} for grouping. The braces are required to dereference array elements. Example:You are also able to do some text manipulation inside the braces:Result:orResult:You are right in "regular variables" are not needed... But it is more helpful for the debugging and to read a script.The end of the variable name is usually signified by a space or newline. But what if we don\'t want a space or newline after printing the variable value? The curly braces tell the shell interpreter where the end of the variable name is.Example: (Fred\'s answer already states this but his example is a bit too abstract)
