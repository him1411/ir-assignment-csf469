Can you please explain to me what where T : class, new() means in the following line of code? That is a constraint on the generic parameter T. It must be a class (reference type) and must have a public parameter-less default constructor.That means T can\'t be an int, float, double, DateTime or any other struct (value type).It could be a string, or any other custom reference type, as long as it has a default or parameter-less constructor.Those are generic type constraints. In your case there are two of them:Means that the type T must be a reference type (not a value type).Means that the type T must have a parameter-less constructor. Having this constraint will allow you to do something like T field = new T(); in your code which you wouldn\'t be able to do otherwise.You then combine the two using a comma to get:where T : structThe type argument must be a value type. Any value type except Nullable can be specified. See Using Nullable Types (C# Programming Guide) for more information.where T : classThe type argument must be a reference type, including any class, interface, delegate, or array type. (See note below.)where T : new()\nThe type argument must have a public parameterless constructor. When used in conjunction with other constraints, the new() constraint must be specified last.where T : [base class name]The type argument must be or derive from the specified base class.where T : [interface name]The type argument must be or implement the specified interface. Multiple interface constraints can be specified. The constraining interface can also be generic.where T : UThe type argument supplied for T must be or derive from the argument supplied for U. This is called a naked type constraint.new(): Specifying the new() constraint means type T must use a parameterless constructor, so an object can be instantiated from it - see Default constructorsclass: Means T must be a reference type so it can\'t be an int, float, double, DateTime or other struct (value type). That means that type T must be a class and have a constructor that does not take any arguments.For example, you must be able to do this:where (C# Reference)The new() Constraint lets the compiler know that any type argument supplied must have an accessible parameterless--or default-- constructorSo it should be, T must be a class, and have an accessible parameterless--or default constructor.here was a similar question asked It\'s called a \'constraint\' on the generic parameter T. It means that T must be a reference type (a class) and that it must have a public default constructor.This is part of the Generics mechanism, where the where keyword add constraints to what types must implement in order to be used as type parameters.What comes after the "Where" is a constraint on the generic type T you declared, so:class means that the T should be a class and not a value type or a struct.new() indicates that the T class should have a public parameter-free default constructor defined.class & new are 2 constraints on the generic type parameter T.\nRespectively they ensure:The type argument must be a reference type; this applies also to any class, interface, delegate, or array type.The type argument must have a public parameterless constructor. When used together with other constraints, the new() constraint must be specified last.Their combination means that the type T must be a Reference Type (can\'t be a Value Type), and must have a parameterless constructor.Example:
