Say I\'m in a Git repository. I delete a file and commit that change. I continue working and make some more commits. Then, I find I need to restore that file.I know I can checkout a file using git checkout HEAD^ foo.bar, but I don\'t really know when that file was deleted.I\'m hoping I don\'t have to manually browse my logs, checkout the entire project for a given SHA and then manually copy that file into my original project checkout.Find the last commit that affected the given path. As the file isn\'t in the HEAD commit, this commit must have deleted it.Then checkout the version at the commit before, using the caret (^) symbol:Or in one command, if $file is the file in question.To restore all those deleted files in a folder enter the following command.If you\xe2\x80\x99re insane, use git-bisect. Here\'s what to do:Now it\'s time to run the automated test. The shell command \'[ -e foo.bar ]\' will return 0 if foo.bar exists, and 1 otherwise. The "run" command of git-bisect will use binary search to automatically find the first commit where the test fails. It starts halfway through the range given (from good to bad) and cuts it in half based on the result of the specified test.Now you\'re at the commit which deleted it. From here, you can jump back to the future and use git-revert to undo the change,or you could go back one commit and manually inspect the damage:I came to this question looking to restore a file I just deleted but I hadn\'t yet committed the change.  Just in case you find yourself in this situation, all you need to do is the following:git checkout HEAD -- path/to/file.extMy new favorite alias, based on bonyiii\'s answer (upvoted), and my own answer about "Pass an argument to a Git alias command":I have lost a file, deleted by mistake a few commits ago?\nQuick:Crisis averted.Robert Dailey proposes in the comments the following alias:To restore a deleted and commited file:It was tested on Git version 1.7.5.4.If you know the filename, this is an easy way with basic commands:List all the commits for that file.The last commit (topmost) is the one that deleted the file. So you need to restore the second to last commit.I\'ve got this solution.Get the id of the commit where the file was deleted using one of the ways below.You should get something like: commit bfe68bd117e1091c96d2976c99b3bcc8310bebe7 Author: Alexander\n  Orlov  Date:   Thu May 12 23:44:27 2011\n  +0200commit 3ea4e3af253ac6fd1691ff6bb89c964f54802302 Author: Alexander\n  Orlov  Date:   Thu May 12 22:10:22 2011\n  +02003. Now using the commit id bfe68bd117e1091c96d2976c99b3bcc8310bebe7 do:As the commit id references the commit where the file was already deleted you need to reference the commit just before bfe68b which you can do by appending ^1. This means: give me the commit just before bfe68b.If you only made changes and deleted a file, but not commit it, and now you broke up with your changesbut your deleted files did not return, you simply do the following command:And presto, your file is back.In many cases, it can be useful to use coreutils (grep, sed, etc.) in conjunction with Git. I already know these tools quite well, but Git less so. If I wanted to do a search for a deleted file, I would do the following:When I find the revision/commit:Just like others have stated before me.The file will now be restored to the state it had before removal. Remember to re-commit it to the working tree if you want to keep it around.Put this in your .bash_profile (or other relevant file that loads when you open a command shell):Then use:This alias first checks to find the last commit where this file existed, then does a git checkout of that file path from that last commit where this file existed. sourceSo I had to restore a bunch of deleted files from a specific commit and I managed it with two commands:(Note the trailing space on the end of each command.)The files had been added to the .gitignore file and then cleared with git rm, I needed to restore the files but then unstage them. I had hundreds of files to restore, typing things manually for each file as in the other examples was going to be far too slow.In our case we accidentally deleted files in a commit and some commit later we realized our mistake and wanted to get back all the files that were deleted but not those that were modified.Based on Charles Bailey\'s excellent answer here is my one liner:Restore the deleted file:If you know the commit that deleted the file(s), run this command where <SHA1_deletion> is the commit that deleted the file:The part before the pipe lists all the files that were deleted in the  commit; they are all checkout from the previous commit to restore them.If you are encountering this problem more frequently and you are willing to use a Git GUI tool, have a look at DeepGit and use File|Search there.
