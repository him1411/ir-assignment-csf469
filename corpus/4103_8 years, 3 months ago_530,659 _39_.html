I have 3 radio buttons in my web page, like below:In jQuery, I want to get the value of the selected radio button when any of these three are clicked. In jQuery we have id (#) and class (.) selectors, but what if I want to find a radio button by its name, as below?Please tell me how to solve this problem.This should do it, all of this is in the documentation, which has a very similar example to this:I should also note you have multiple identical IDs in that snippet. This is invalid HTML. Use classes to group set of elements, not IDs, as they should be unique.To determine which radio button is checked, try this:The event will be caught for all of the radio buttons in the group and the value of the selected button will be placed in val.Update: After posting I decided that Paolo\'s answer above is better, since it uses one less DOM traversal. I am letting this answer stand since it shows how to get the selected element in a way that is cross-browser compatible.another wayThis works great for me. For example you have two radio buttons with the same "name", and you just wanted to get the value of the checked one. You may try this one.The following code is used to get the selected radio button value by name Thanks\nAdnanI found this question as I was researching an error after I upgraded from 1.7.2 of jQuery to 1.8.2. I\'m adding my answer because there has been a change in jQuery 1.8 and higher that changes how this question is answered now.With jQuery 1.8 they have deprecated the pseudo-selectors like :radio, :checkbox, :text.To do the above now just replace the :radio with [type=radio].So your answer now becomes for all versions of jQuery 1.8 and above:You can read about the change on the 1.8 readme and the ticket specific for this change as well as a understand why on the :radio selector page under the Additional Information section.For anyone who doesn\'t want to include a library to do something really simple:For a performance overview of the current answers check hereIf you\'d like to know the value of the default selected radio button before a click event, try this:You can use filter function if you have more than one radio group on the page, as belowHere is fiddle urlhttp://jsfiddle.net/h6ye7/67/If you want a true/false value, use this:Something like this maybe?When you click on any radio button, I believe it will end up selected, so this is going to be called for the selected radio button.I you have more than one group of radio buttons on the same page you can also try this to get the value of radio button:Cheers!can also use a CSS class to define the range of radio buttons and then use the following to determine the valueThis worked for me..HTML:Jquery:Hope it helps..You might notice using class selector to get value of ASP.NET RadioButton controls is always empty and here is the reason.You create RadioButton control in ASP.NET as below:And ASP.NET renders following HTML for your RadioButtonFor ASP.NET we don\'t want to use RadioButton control name or id because they can change for any reason out of user\'s hand (change in container name, form name, usercontrol name, ...) as you can see in code above.The only remaining feasible way to get the value of the RadioButton using jQuery is using css class as mentioned in this answer to a totally unrelated question as following
