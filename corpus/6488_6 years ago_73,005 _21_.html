Is it possible to do the following using ELMAH:I\'m doing something like this:This exception will not be automatically logged by ELMAH because it was handled.Direct log writing method, working since ELMAH 1.0:ELMAH 1.2 introduces a more flexible API:There is a difference between the two solutions:I\'d recommend wrapping the call to Elmah in a simple wrapper class of your own.Then just call it whenever you need to log an error.This has the following benefits:Note: I\'ve added a \'contextualMessage\' property for contextual information. You can omit this if you prefer but I find it very useful. Elmah automatically unwraps exceptions so the underlying exception will still be reported in the log but the contextualMessage will be visible when you click on it.You can use the Elmah.ErrorSignal() method to log an issue without raising an exception.Yes, it is possible. ELMAH was  designed to intercept unhandled exceptions. However you can signal an exception to ELMAH via the ErrorSignal class. Those exceptions are not thrown (don\'t bubble up), but are only sent out to ELMAH (and to subscribers of the Raise event of the ErrorSignal class).A small example:I was looking to do this same thing in a thread I had started to queue mail from within my MVC4 application, as such I did not have the HttpContext available when an exception was raised. To do this I ended up with the following based on this question and another answer found on here: elmah: exceptions without HttpContext?In the config file I specified an application name:Then in code (like the answer provided above, but without the HttpContext) you can pass null instead of an HttpContext:In some cases CurrentHttpContext may not be available. DefineUseI was trying to write custom messages into elmah logs using Signal.FromCurrentContext().Raise(ex); and found that these exceptions are bubbled up, eg:Besides I don\'t see how elmah supports different levels of logging - is it possible to switch off verbose logging by a web.config setting?
