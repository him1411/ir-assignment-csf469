When an html element is \'focused\' (currently selected/tabbed in to), many browsers (at least Safari and Chrome) will put a blue border around it.For the layout I am working on, this is distracting and does not look right.FireFox does not seem to do this, or at least, will let me control it withIf someone can tell me how IE performs, I would be curious. But getting Safari to remove this little bit of flare would be nice.ThanksIn your case, try:Or in general, to affect all basic form elements:In the comments, Noah Whitmore suggested taking this even further to support elements that have the contenteditable attribute set to true (effectively making them a type of input element). The following should target those as well (in CSS3 capable browsers):Although I wouldn\'t recommend it, for completeness\' sake, you could always disable the focus outline on everything with this:Keep in mind that the focus outline is an accessibility and usability feature; it clues the user into what element is currently focused.To remove it from all inputsThis is an old thread, but for reference it\'s important to note that disabling an input element\'s outline is not recommended as it hinders accessibility.The outline property is there for a reason - providing users with a clear indication of keyboard focus. For further reading and additional sources about this subject see http://outlinenone.com/Use this code:You could use CSS to disable that!\nThis is the code I use for disabling the blue border:This will remove the blue border!This is a working example: JSfiddle.netHope it helps!Remove the outline when focus is on element, using below CSS property:This CSS property removes the outline for all input fields on focus or use pseudo class to remove outline of element using below CSS property.This property removes the outline for selected element.You can try this alsoorThe default outline that browsers render is ugly.See this for example:The most common "fix" that most recommend is outline:none - which if used incorrectly - is disaster for accessibility. There\'s a very dry-cut website I found which explains everything well. It provides visual feedback for links that have "focus" when\n  navigating a web document using the TAB key (or equivalent). This is\n  especially useful for folks who can\'t use a mouse or have a visual\n  impairment. If you remove the outline you are making your site\n  inaccessible for these people.Ok, let\'s try it out same example as above, now use the TAB key to navigate. Notice how you can tell where the focus is even without clicking the input? Now, let\'s try outline:none on our trusty <input>So, once again, use the TAB key to navigate after clicking the text and see what happens.See how it\'s more difficult to figure out where the focus is? The only telling sign is the cursor blinking. My example above is overly simplistic. In real-world situations, you wouldn\'t have only one element on the page. Something more along the lines of this. Now compare that to the same template if we keep the outline:So we have established the following Remove the ugly outline and add your own visual cues to indicate focus. Here\'s a very simple example of what I mean. I remove the outline and add a bottom border on :focus and :active. I also remove the default borders on the top, left and right sides by setting them to transparent on :focus and :active (personal preference)So, we try the approach above with our "real-world" example from earlier:This can be extended further by using external libraries that build on the idea of modifying the "outline" as opposed to removing it entirely like MaterializeYou can end up with something that is not ugly and works with very little effortAnother solution is to remove the outline by default but activate it only if user presses TAB key:
