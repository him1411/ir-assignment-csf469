To create a new event handler on a control you can do thisor thisand to remove an event handler you can do thisBut how do you remove all event handlers from a control?I found a solution on the MSDN forums. The sample code below will remove all Click events from button1.You guys are making this WAY too hard on yourselves. It\'s this easy:From Removing All Event Handlers:Directly no, in large part because you\n  cannot simply set the event to null.Indirectly, you could make the actual\n  event private and create a property\n  around it that tracks all of the\n  delegates being added/subtracted to\n  it.Take the following:Accepted answer is not full. It doesn\'t work for events declared as {add; remove;}Here is working code:It doesn\'t do any harm to delete a non-existing event handler. So if you know what handlers there might be, you can simply delete all of them. I just had similar case. This may help in some cases.Like:I\'m actually using this method and it works perfectly. I was \'inspired\' by the code written by Aeonhack here.The field MyEventEvent is hidden, but it does exist.Debugging, you can see how d.target is the object actually handling the event, and d.method its method. You only have to remove it.It works great. No more objects not being GC\'ed because of the event handlers.Stephen has right. It is very easy:If you reaallly have to do this... it\'ll take reflection and quite some time to do this. Event handlers are managed in an event-to-delegate-map inside a control. You would need toIn short, a lot of work. It is possible in theory... I never tried something like this.See if you can have better control/discipline over the subscribe-unsubscribe phase for the control.I just found How to suspend events when setting a property of a WinForms control. It will remove all events from a control:Wow. I found this solution, but nothing worked like I wanted. But this is so good:I hated any complete solutions shown here, I did a mix and tested now, worked for any event handler:Easy! Thanks for Stephen Punak.I used it because I use a generic local method to remove the delegates and the local method was called after different cases, when different delegates are setted.Sometimes we have to work with ThirdParty controls and we need to build these awkward solutions. Based in @Anoop Muraleedharan answer I created this solution with inference type and ToolStripItem supportAnd you can use it like thisWell, here there\'s another solution to remove an asociated event (if you already have a method for handling the events for the control):This is not an answer to the OP, but I thought I\'d post this here in case it can help others. This page helped me a lot. The code I got from here was meant to remove a click event from a button. I need to remove double click events from some panels and click events from some buttons. So I made a control extension, which will remove all event handlers for a certain event.Now, the usage of this extenstion.\nIf you need to remove click events from a button,If you need to remove doubleclick events from a panel,I am not an expert in C#, so if there are any bugs please forgive me and kindly let me know about it.I found this answer and it almost fit my needs.  Thanks to SwDevMan81 for the class.  I have modified it to allow suppression and resumation of individual methods, and I thought I\'d post it here.
