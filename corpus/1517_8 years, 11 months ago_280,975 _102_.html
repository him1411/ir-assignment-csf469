How can I check if a given string is a valid URL address?My knowledge of regular expressions is basic and doesn\'t allow me to choose from the hundreds of regular expressions I\'ve already seen on the web.I wrote my URL (actually IRI, internationalized) pattern to comply with RFC 3987 (http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3987.html). These are in PCRE syntax.For absolute IRIs (internationalized):To also allow relative IRIs:How they were compiled (in PHP):Edit 7 March 2011: Because of the way PHP handles backslashes in quoted strings, these are unusable by default. You\'ll need to double-escape backslashes except where the backslash has a special meaning in regex. You can do that this way:I\'ve just written up a blog post for a great solution for recognizing URLs in most used formats such as:The regular expression used is:However, I would recommend you to go to http://blog.mattheworiordan.com/post/13174566389/url-regular-expression-for-links-with-or-without-the to see the working example.What platform? If using .NET, use System.Uri.TryCreate, not a regex.For example:(Thanks to @Yoshi for the tip about javascript:)Here\'s what RegexBuddy uses.It matches these below (inside the ** ** marks):  You can download RegexBuddy at http://www.regexbuddy.com/download.html. With regard to eyelidness\' answer post that reads "This is based on my reading of the URI specification.": Thanks Eyelidness, yours is the perfect solution I sought, as it is based on the URI spec! Superb work. :)I had to make two amendments. The first to get the regexp to match IP address URLs correctly in PHP (v5.2.10) with the preg_match() function.I had to add one more set of parenthesis to the line above "IP Address" around the pipes:Not sure why.I have also reduced the top level domain minimum length from 3 to 2 letters to support .co.uk and similar.Final code:This modified version was not checked against the URI specification so I can\'t vouch for it\'s compliance, it was altered to handle URLs on local network environments and two digit TLDs as well as other kinds of Web URL, and to work better in the PHP setup I use.As PHP code:Here is a test program in PHP which validates a variety of URLs using the regex:Thanks again to eyelidness for the regex!The post Getting parts of a URL (Regex) discusses parsing a URL to identify its various components. If you want to check if a URL is well-formed, it should be sufficient for your needs.If you need to check if it\'s actually valid, you\'ll eventually have to try to access whatever\'s on the other end.In general, though, you\'d probably be better off using a function that\'s supplied to you by your framework or another library. Many platforms include functions that parse URLs. For example, there\'s Python\'s urlparse module, and in .NET you could use the System.Uri class\'s constructor as a means of validating the URL.Mathias Bynens has a great article on the best comparison of a lot of regular expressions: In search of the perfect URL validation regexThe best one posted is a little long, but it matches just about anything you can throw at it.This might not be a job for regexes, but for existing tools in your language of choice.  You probably want to use existing code that has already been written, tested, and debugged.In PHP, use the parse_url function.Perl: URI module.Ruby: URI module..NET: \'Uri\' classRegexes are not a magic wand you wave at every problem that happens to involve strings.For reference purposes, here\'s the IETF Spec: (TXT | HTML). In particular, Appendix B. Parsing a URI Reference with a Regular Expression is on point. Here\'s the regex they provide:As someone else said, it\'s probably best to leave this to a lib/framework you\'re already using.This will match all URLs...including sub-domains and those new top-level domain name extensions such as \n  .museum, \n  .academy, \n  .foundation\n  etc. which can have up to 63 characters (not just .com, .net, .info etc.)Because today maximum length of the available top-level domain name extension is 13 characters such as .international, you can change the number 63 in expression to 13 to prevent someone misusing it.as javascriptWikipedia Article: List of all internet top-level domainsMatches \nhttp://site.com/dir/file.php?var=moo | ftp://user:pass@site.com:21/file/dirNon-Matches \nsite.com | http://site.com/dir//The best regular expression for URL for me would be:If you really search for the ultimate match, you probably find it on "A Good Url Regular Expression?".But a regex that really matches all possible domains and allows anything that is allowed according to RFCs is horribly long and unreadable, trust me ;-)Matches \nhttp://www.asdah.com/~joe | ftp://ftp.asdah.co.uk:2828/asdah%20asdah.gif | https://asdah.gov/asdh-ah.asi wrote a little groovy version that you can runit matches the following urls (which is good enough for me)http://google.comhttp://google.com/help.phphttp://google.com/help.php?a=5http://www.google.comhttp://www.google.com/help.phphttp://www.google.com?a=5google.com?a=5google.com/help.phpgoogle.com/help.php?a=5http://www.m.google.com/help.php?a=5 (and all its permutations)www.m.google.com/help.php?a=5 (and all its permutations)m.google.com/help.php?a=5 (and all its permutations)The important thing for any urls that dont start with http or www is that they must include a / or ?i bet this can be tweaked a little more but it does the job pretty nice for being so short and compact... because you can pretty much split it in 3:find anything that starts with http: https?://w{0,3}\\w*?.\\w{2,3}\\S*find anything that starts with www: www.\\w*?.\\w{2,3}\\S*or find anything that must have a text then a dot then at least 2 letters and then a ? or /: \\w*?.\\w{2,3}[/\\?]\\S*I was not able to find the regex I was looking for so I modified a regex to fullfill my requirements, and apparently it seems to work fine now. My requirements were:Here what I came up with, any suggestion is appreciated:I\'ve been working on an in-depth article discussing URI validation using regular expressions. It is based on RFC3986.  Regular Expression URI ValidationAlthough the article is not yet complete, I have come up with a PHP function which does a pretty good job of validating HTTP and FTP URLs. Here is the current version:This function utilizes two regexes; one to match a subset of valid generic URIs (absolute ones having a non-empty host), and a second to validate the DNS "dot-separated-parts" host name. Although this function currently validates only HTTP and FTP schemes, it is structured such that it can be easily extended to handle other schemes.I use this regex:To support both:And:    This one works for me very well.

My requirement was to capture instances in a String where possible url can be cse.uom.ac.mu - noting that it is not preceded by http nor wwwFor Python, this is the actual URL validating regex used in Django 1.5.1:This does both ipv4 and ipv6 addresses as well as ports and GET parameters.Found in the code here, Line 44.whats wrong with plain and simple FILTER_VALIDATE_URL ?I know its not the question exactly but it did the job for me when I needed to validate urls so thought it might be useful to others who come across this post looking for the same thingThe following RegEx will work:For convenience here\'s a one-liner regexp for URL\'s that will also match localhost where you\'re more likely to have ports than .com or similar.You don\'t specify which language you\'re using.\nIf PHP is, there is a native function for that:Returns the filtered data, or FALSE if the filter fails.Check it here >>Hope it helps.This is a rather old thread now and the question asks for a regex based URL validator.  I ran into the thread whilst looking for precisely the same thing.  While it may well be possible to write a really comprehensive regex to validate URLs I eventually settled on another way to do things - by using PHP\'s parse_url function.  It returns boolean false if the url cannot be parsed. Otherwise it returns the scheme, the host and other information.  This may well not be enough for a comprehensive URL check on its own but can be drilled down into for further analysis.  If the intent is to simply catch typos, invalid schemes etc it is perfectly adequate.To Check URL regex would be:Use this one its working for me
