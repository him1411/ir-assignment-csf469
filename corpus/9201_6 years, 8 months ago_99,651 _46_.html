As the title suggests I am trying to install a python package from a private github repo. For a public repository I can issue the following command which works fine:However if I try this for a private repository:I get the following output:I guess this is because I am trying to access a private repository without providing any authentication. I therefore tried to use git+ssh hoping that pip would use my ssh public key to authenticate:This gives the following output:Does anyone know if it what I am trying to achieve is even possible? If so can you please tell me how?You can use git+ssh URI scheme, but you MUST set username:See git@ part into URI?PS: Also read about deploy keys.PPS: In my installation the "git+ssh" URI scheme works only with "editable" requirements:Remember: Change the : character that git remote -v prints to a / character before using the remote\'s address in the pip command:If you forget, you will get this error:As an additional technique, if you have the private repository cloned locally, you can do:EDIT: More modernly, you can just do this (and the -e will mean you don\'t have to commit changes before they\'re reflected):You can do it directly with the HTTPS URL like this:This also works just appending that line in the requirements.txt in a django project, for instance.Also works with Bitbucket:Pip will use your SSH keys in this case.The syntax for the requirements file is given here: https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install.html#requirements-file-formatSo for example:if you want the source to stick around after installationor justif you just want it to be installed.I found it much easier to use tokens than SSH keys. I couldn\'t find much good documentation on this, so came across this solution mainly through trial & error. Further, installing from pip & setuptools have some subtle differences; but this way should work for both.GitHub don\'t (currently, as of August 2016) offer an easy way to get the zip / tarball of private repos. So you need to point setuptools to tell setuptools that you\'re pointing to a git repo:A couple of notes here:When I was installing from github I was able to use:BUT, since I had to run pip as sudo, the SSH Keys were not working with github anymore, "git clone" failed on "Permission denied (publickey)". Using git+https allowed me to run the command as sudo, and have github ask me my user/password.You can also install a private repo dependency via git+https://github.com/... URL by providing login credentials (login and password, or deploy token) for curl with the .netrc file:oxyum\'s solution is ok for this answer, I just want to point out that you need to be careful if you are installing using sudo as the keys must be stored for root too (e.g. /root/.ssh).Then you can typesudo pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/echweb/echweb-utils.gitI figured out a way to automagically \'pip install\' a GitLab private repository that requires no password prompt.  This approach uses GitLab "Deploy Keys" and an SSH config file so you can deploy using keys other than your personal SSH keys (in my case, for use by a \'bot).  Perhaps someone kind soul can verify using GitHub.ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "GitLab_Robot_Deploy_Key"The file should show up as ~/.ssh/GitLab_Robot_Deploy_Key and ~/.ssh/GitLab_Robot_Deploy_Key.pubCopy and paste the contents of the ~/.ssh/GitLab_Robot_Deploy_Key.pub file into the GitLab "Deploy Keys" dialog.The following command tells SSH to use your new deploy key to set up the connection.  On success, you should get the message: "Welcome to GitLab, UserName!"ssh -T -i ~/.ssh/GitLab_Robot_Deploy_Key git@gitlab.mycorp.comNext, use an editor to create a ~/.ssh/config file.  Add the following contents.  The \'Host\' value can be anything you want (just remember it, because you\'ll be using it later).  The HostName is the URL to your GitLab instance.  The IdentifyFile is path to the SSH key file you created in the first step.@oxyum gave us the recipe for using pip with SSH:pip install git+ssh://git@gitlab.mycorp.com/my_name/my_repo.gitWe just need to modify it a bit to make SSH use our new Deploy Key.  We do that by pointing SSH to the Host entry in the SSH config file.  Just replace the \'gitlab.mycorp.com\' in the command to the Host name we used in the SSH config file:pip install git+ssh://git@GitLab/my_name/my_repo.gitThe package should now install with no password prompt.Reference A\nReference B
