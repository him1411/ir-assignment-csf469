Can you explain to me;Descriptive source code will be appreciated, Thanks for all replies!A predicate is a function that returns true or false.  A predicate delegate is a reference to a predicate.So basically a predicate delegate is a reference to a function that returns true or false.  Predicates are very useful for filtering a list of values - here is an example. Now if you are using C# 3 you can use a lambda to represent the predicate in a cleaner fashion:Leading on from Andrew\'s answer with regards to c#2 and c#3 ... you can also do them inline for a one off search function (see below).Hope this helps.Just a delegate that returns a boolean.  It is used a lot in filtering lists but can be used wherever you\'d like.There\'s a good article on predicates here, although it\'s from the .NET2 era, so there\'s no mention of lambda expressions in there.The predicate-based searching methods allow a method delegate or lambda expression to decide whether a given element is a \xe2\x80\x9cmatch.\xe2\x80\x9d\n A predicate is simply a delegate accepting an object and returning true or false:\npublic delegate bool Predicate (T object);If you\'re in VB 9 (VS2008), a predicate can be a complex function:Or you can write your predicate as a lambda, as long as it\'s only one expression:What is Predicate Delegate?1) Predicate is a feature that returns true or false.This concept has come in .net 2.0 framework. \n2) It is being used with lambda expression (=>). It takes generic type as an argument.\n3) It allows a predicate function to be defined and passed as a parameter to another function.\n4) It is a special case of a Func, in that it takes only a single parameter and always returns a bool.In C# namespace:It is defined in the System namespace.Where should we use Predicate Delegate?We should use Predicate Delegate in the following cases:1) For searching items in a generic collection.\n  e.g. 2) Basic example that shortens the code and returns true or false:now, Call above predicate:3) An anonymous method can also be assigned to a Predicate delegate type as below:Any best practices about predicates?Use Func, Lambda Expressions and Delegates instead of Predicates.A delegate defines a reference type that can be used to encapsulate a method with a specific signature.\nC# delegate Life cycle:\nThe life cycle of C# delegate islearn more form\n http://asp-net-by-parijat.blogspot.in/2015/08/what-is-delegates-in-c-how-to-declare.html
