I am using the UI DatePicker from jQuery UI as the stand alone picker. I have this code:And the following JS:When I try to return the value with this code:I am returned this:Which is totally the wrong format. Is there a way I can get it returned in the format DD-MM-YYYY?Here\'s one specific for your code:var date = $(\'#datepicker\').datepicker({ dateFormat: \'dd-mm-yy\' }).val();More general info available here:inside the jQuery script code just paste the code. this should work.The getDate method of datepicker returns a date type, not a string.You need to format the returned value to a string using your date format.\nUse datepicker\'s formatDate function:The full list of format specifiers is available here.Here complete code for date picker with date format (yy/mm/dd).Copy link below and paste in head tag :  Copy below code and paste between body tag : If you would like two(2) input type text like Start Date and End Date then use this script and change date format.Two input text like :dateFormatThe format for parsed and displayed dates. This attribute is one of\n  the regionalisation attributes. For a full list of the possible\n  formats see the formatDate function.Code examples Initialize a datepicker with the dateFormat option\n  specified.Get or set the dateFormat option, after init.getDate function returns a JavaScript date. Use the following code to format this date:It uses a utility function which is built into datepicker:$.datepicker.formatDate( format, date, settings ) - \n  Format a date into a string value with a specified format.The full list of format specifiers is available here.$("#datepicker").datepicker("getDate") returns a date object, not a string.Try to use the and there is lots of option available For the datepicker you can find it HereThis is the way we call the datepicker with the parameteryou can simply use this format in you function \njust like This works too:If you need the date in yy-mm-dd format,you can use this:-You can find all the supported format \nhttps://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#date-formatsI was in need of 06,Dec 2015,I did this:-Just run this HTML page, You can see several formats.I am using jquery for datepicker.These jqueries are used for thatThen you follow this code,Finally got the answer for datepicker date change method:I use this:Which returns a date of format like "20120118" for Jan 18, 2012.Below code might help to check if form got more than 1 date field:If you setup a datepicker on an input[type="text"] element you may not get a consistently formatted date, particularly when the user doesn\'t follow the date format for data entry.For example, when you set the dateFormat as dd-mm-yy and the user types 1-1-1.  The datepicker will convert this to Jan 01, 2001 internally but calling val() on the datepicker object will return the string "1-1-1" -- exactly what is in the text field.This implies you should either be validating the user input to ensure the date entered is in the format you expect or not allowing the user to enter dates freeform (preferring instead the calendar picker).  Even so it is possible to force the datepicker code to give you a string formatted like you expect:Be aware however that while the datepicker\'s getDate() method will return a date, it can only do so much with user input that doesn\'t exactly match the date format.  This means in the absence of validation it is possible to get a date back that is different from what the user expects. Caveat emptor.I think the correct way to do this would be something like this:This way you make sure the format string is defined only once and you use the same formatter to translate the format string into the formatted date.
