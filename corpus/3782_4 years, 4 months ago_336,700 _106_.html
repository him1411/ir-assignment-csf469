I downloaded Android Studio and attempted to launch the program.This is running on Windows 7 64-bit with Java 1.7. During the installation my Java 1.7 is detected, and the rest of the installation goes through just fine. However, when attempting to launch the application from the desktop icon, nothing happens. Looking at the task manager, a new process from the CMD is loaded. This is because it\'s attempting to run the batch file studio.bat.When I execute via CMD, I get the following error:ERROR: cannot start Android Studio. No JDK found. Please validate\n  either ANDROID_STUDIO_JDK, or JDK_HOME or JAVA_HOME points to valid\n  JDK installation. ECHO is off. Press any key to continue . . .I\'ve attempted to open the idea properties file to see if there was something I could configure for this ANDROID_STUDIO_JDK or something like that. However, I found nothing. I hope some of you can let me know if you were able to install this or if you are having problems as well.Adding a system variable JDK_HOME with value c:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_21\\ worked for me. The latest Java release can be downloaded here.Additionally, make sure the variable JAVA_HOME is also set with the above location. Steps are here. For VideoOK, I figured out how fix this nasty bug.Go to your Android Studio installation folder and locate the bin folder. Inside the bin folder, you will find studio.bat. Execute the file, and it\'ll show the error. If it is about the Java path then follow the tip 1.When you set the path JAVA_HOME, etc., make sure not to include bin at the end of the path. This solved the issue for me.JAVA_HOME => C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_21path => C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_21\\binIt works fine with JDK 1.7 (I tried with 32 bit).If you do so, you can see the initial screen as below.Are you getting the below error message?Your Android SDK is out of date or is missing templates. Please ensure\n  you are using SDK version 22 or later.This error probably occurs, because you have reference to your older SDK (that you downloaded with Eclipse) in your path variable. Go to Environment variables and remove any reference to the old SDK folder and point it to new SDK folder that is found inside the Android Studio installation folder.Save and restart Studio, things should work as expected now. If you hate messing around with the path variable as given above by removing old references, simply follow the following steps to refer to new SDK path that comes with Studio.*Project Defaults* -> *Project Structure* -> Click "New" -> Select "Android SDK" -> Select the SDK folder inside the studio installation.With the last update of Androd Studio I have two versions of the IDE\'s launcherOne is called studio.exe and the other studio64.exe they are both on:You have to launch the one that matches your Java version 64 or 32 bitI had the same issue. I got resolved setting up correctly the environment variables in windows, for instance:I\'ve tried so many of the answers here but none of them works, so I decided to mix some of the answers here and I am successful!Step 1: Go to the system properties by right-clicking on My Computer or by pressing windows button on typing This PC and right clicking on it and selecting Properties.Step 2: Click the advanced system settings or Environment VariablesStep 3: Take note that there are 2 different variable. What you need to create is system variables not user variables, when you clicked new type the followingVariable name: JAVA_HOMEVariable value: C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_25\\ (Note: Please check if the path is right, sometimes it is C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_25)Step 4: Run the android studio, no need to restart.Note:*C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_25\\ depends entirely on the installation path of your JDK not JRE so don\'t be confused if you see something like the picture below. Just enter the location of your jdk, in my case it is C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_25\\.*Do not include the bin folder when you enter the Variable value.Edit: For Windows 8 and 10 Users:  Try to run C:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio\\bin\\studio.exe instead of C:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio\\binstudio64.exeThe path for latest JDK. It worked very well.I had the same issue. I am having 64 bit windows 8. I downloaded the android studio which worked on 32 bit machine but not on my 64 bit.The solution for me was pretty simple. I navigated to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Android\\android-studio\\binthere I saw 2 exe files studio.exe and studio64.exe. Normally in my start menu was pointing to studio64.exe which alwasys kept on giving me "The enviournmental variable JDK_HOME does not point to valid JVM". So then I clicked studio.exe and it worked :)I hope this may help someone facing same problem like meIf you are getting message "Your Android SDK is out of date\xe2\x80\xa6" \xe2\x80\x94 click "Configure" \xe2\x80\x94> "Project Defaults" \xe2\x80\x94> "Project Structure", pick "SDKs" \xe2\x80\x94> "Android SDK" and in a "Build Target" choose "Android 4.2.2". Click "OK". Now it should work fine.I got the problem that the installation stopped by "$(^name) has stopped working" error. I have installed Java SE Development kit already, also set both SDK_HOME and JAVA_HOME that point to "C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_21\\" My laptop installed with Windows 7 64 bitsSo I tried to install the 32 bit version of Java SE Developement kit, set my JAVA_HOME to "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_21", restart and the installation worked OK.This problem has been fixed in Android Studio v0.1.1, so just update Android Studio and it should work.Sometimes you can resolve this type of issue by setting environment variables so the process looks for the JDK in the right spot.Another approach is to figure out where the process is looking, then put your JDK there.I\'ve had lots of success using Process Monitor from Sysinternals:This will filter down to all the file system operations taking place on your machine.You could try filtering based on the result of the File System operation:You can also quite easily filter based on the process name, either from the Filter... menu option or by right clicking on the Process Name column and selecting Include \'process.exe\'.Once you find the file system operation that\'s failing, the Path column will tell you where to put your JDK.I\'ve found this to be very empowering. Especially compared to the frustrating process of changing environment variables by trial and error.My issue was caused because I have an & character in my Windows user name, so when installed in the default path I was getting the following error after running bin/studio.batSo I uninstalled and reinstalled it to program files and it launches fine now.I couldn\'t get this to work no matter which environment variables I set. So I simply put a copy of the JDK into my Android Studio installation folder.Copy the contents of the JDK installation (for example, C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_21)Paste them into the installation directory of the Android Studio (for example, C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Android\\android-studio)I somewhat assumed that the issue was caused by having the x64 version of the JDK installed. But what was especially confusing was the fact that I could start Android Studio just fine when I started the studio.bat as an Administrator (even though the environment variables were set for my personal user account).studio.bat will look for several valid options when determining which JDK to use.:: Locate a JDK installation directory which will be used to run the IDE.\n  :: Try (in order): ANDROID_STUDIO_JDK, ..\\jre, JDK_HOME, JAVA_HOME.As explained above, I picked the ..\\jre option.Today I found another situation when this problem occures - when you have several JDK, defined in JAVA_PATH. I have:So I received this problem with Android Studio setupBut when I\'ve removed one of JDK - problem has been solved:Installation wisard found my jdk and i had a nice night to study studio. But unfortunatelly even installed studio doesn\'t work with several jdk.\nDoes anybody know how to fix it?I hope I\'ve helped someoneMAKE SURE YOU RESTART ANDROID STUDIOEven though i should know better and swear i did, make sure you restart studio after making these changes as it clearly does not check them on every build (which to me makes sense that system/user variables should only be read once on startup)Anyway, yea... Make sure you restart after you make these changes..Path = to the bin folder in the jdk folder (path already exists)JAVA_HOME = to the jdk folderWindows 64 bit, JDK 64 bit (Solution that worked for me)\nTried all the above solutions, None of them worked, I have been trying to solve it from past few days and now i done it successfully.For me the problem was, when i first installed Android Studio my JDK version was 1.7, then after installing i updated the JDK to 1.8,then i removed old JDK folder and everything was messed up, even uninstalling and reinstalling android studio randomly didn\'t solved the issue.Below is the solution that worked for me1) Uninstall Android Studio.2) clean temp files and android studio C:\\Users\\Username.AndroidStudio1.53) Uninstall JDK.4) Now without JDK try to install Android Studio and now it will show \nmessage that it cant find any JDK. Stop installation5) Install JDK 1.7 or 1.8 (Set JAVA_HOME,JDK_HOME,path Environment variables as explained by everybody above)6) Install Android Studio.7) Done. Enjoy and happy coding. In my experience, I was unable (even after adding JDK_HOME) to launch Studio via either the shortcut or studio.exe itself.  I had to first run bin/studio.bat (mentioned in the original question).  After the first successful launch, I\'m able to start it by the shortcut.Install the latest JDK in your system from JDK 7 and JRE 7 Installation Guide. If you have a 64 bit windows OS, pointing the JAVA_HOME system variable toWill work when fails to work. You need 1.7 JDK installed on your system. Add a system variable with:name: ANDROID_STUDIO_JDKpath: your JDK path (for example, C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_21)TRY TO INSTALL 32BIT JDKif you have jdk installed and had set up the System Varibles such as JAVA_HOME or JDK_HOME\nand tried click back and then next ,you might have installed the 64bit JDK,just download the 32bit jdk and install it.I downloaded the latest jdk versionJAVA_HOME to C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_11\\bin\nSet the PATH to C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_11\\binI restarted the STUDIO and it worked.On Windows 10, restarting the installer and running as admin worked for me.To complete this stack of possible solutions: For me the problem was, that I did not execute the Android-Studio-Setup as administrator. Running it as administrator then made me able to install Android-Studio.For me, the problem was that I had changed the GC vm arg to -XX:+UseParallelGC in the C:\\Users\\<username>\\.AndroidStudio2.1\\studio64.exe.vmoptions file.  That\'s what I use in Eclipse and I was trying various things to get AndroidStudio half way as efficent as Eclipse.  I restored the GC to -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC.The answer to the original question is that, might be you are opening android studio from 32 bit shortcut icon of android studio, try to open from icon "studio64" located under .../bin/ where android studio setup is install.
