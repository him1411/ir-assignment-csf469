I\'m trying to fill the vertical space of a flex item inside a flexbox. And here\'s the JSFiddleflex-2-child doesn\'t fill the required height except in the two cases where: This doesn\'t work in Chrome or Firefox currently.I have answered a similar question here. I know you have already said position: absolute; is inconvenient but it works. See below for further information on fixing the resize issue.Also see this jsFiddle for a demo, although I have only added webkit prefixes so open in Chrome.You basically have 2 issues which I will deal with separately.See this answer for more information on the scrolling issue.If I understand correctly, you want flex-2-child to fill the height and width of its parent, so that the red area is fully covered by the green?If so, you just need to set flex-2 to use flexbox:Then tell flex-2-child to become flexible:See http://jsfiddle.net/2ZDuE/10/The reason is that flex-2-child is not a flexbox item, but its parent is. Similar to David Storey\'s answer, my work around is:Alternatively to align-items, you can use align-self just on the .flex-2-child item you want stretched.I suppose that Chrome\'s behavior is more consistent with the CSS spec (though it\'s less intuitive). According to Flexbox spec, the default stretch value of align-self property changes only the used value of the element\'s "cross size property" (height, in this case). And, as I understand the CSS2.1 spec, the percentage heights are calculated from the specified value of the parent\'s height, not its used value. The specified value of the parent\'s height isn\'t affected by any flex properties and is still auto.Setting explicit height: 100% makes it formally possible to calculate the percentage height of the child, just like setting height: 100% to html makes it possible to calculate the percentage height of body in CSS2.1.An idea would be that display:flex; with flex-direction: row; is filling the container div with .flex-1 and .flex-2, but that does not mean that .flex-2 has a default height:100%; even if it is extended to full height and to have a child element (.flex-2-child) with height:100%; you\'ll need to set the parent to height:100%; or use display:flex; with flex-direction: row; on the .flex-2 div too.From what I know display:flex will not extend all your child elements height to 100%.A small demo, removed the height from .flex-2-child and used display:flex; on .flex-2:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/2ZDuE/3/htmlcsshttp://jsfiddle.net/2ZDuE/750/This is my solution using css+First of all if first child (flex-1) should be 100px shouldn\'t be flex.\nIn css+ in fact you can set flexible and/or static elements (columns or rows) and your example become as easy as this:container css:and obviously include css+ 0.2 corehear the fiddle
