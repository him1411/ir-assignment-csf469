When debugging using console.log(), how can I get the full object?Outputs:But I want to also see the content of property f.You need to use util.inspect():OutputsSee util.inspect() docs.You can use JSON.stringify, and get some nice indentation as well as perhaps easier to remember syntax.The third argument sets the indentation level, so you can adjust that as desired.More detail here if needed:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify\nA compilation of the many useful answers from (at least) Node.js v0.10.33 (stable) / v0.11.14 (unstable) presumably through (at least) v7.7.4 (the version current as of the latest update to this answer).tl;drutil.inspect() is at the heart of diagnostic output: console.log() and console.dir() as well as the Node.js REPL use util.inspect() implicitly, , so it\'s generally NOT necessary to require(\'util\') and call util.inspect() directly.To get the desired output for the example in the question:Details below.console.log() (and its alias, console.info()):console.dir():util.inspect() automatically (and invariably) pretty-prints object and array representations, but produces multiline output only when needed - if everything fits on one line, only 1 line is printed.By default, output is wrapped at around 60 characters thanks, Shrey\n, regardless of whether the output is sent to a file or a terminal. In practice, since line breaks only happen at property boundaries, you will often end up with shorter lines, but they can also be longer (e.g., with long property values).In v6.3.0+ you can use the breakLength option to override the 60-character limit; if you set it to Infinity, everything is output on a single line.If you want more control over pretty-printing, consider using JSON.stringify() with a 3rd argument, but note the following:util.inspect() options object (2nd argument):source: http://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_format_formatAn optional options object may be passed that alters certain aspects of the formatted string:util.format() format-string placeholders (1st argument)source: http://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_format_formatAnother simple method is to convert it to jsonperhaps console.dir is all you need.http://nodejs.org/api/console.html#console_console_dir_objUses util.inspect on obj and prints resulting string to stdout.use util option if you need more control.Try this:You can also doSince Node.js 6.4.0, this can be elegantly solved with util.inspect.defaultOptions:You can simply add an inspect() method to your object which will override the representation of object in console.log messageseg:then, your object will be represented as required in both console.log and node shellA good way to inspect objects is to use node --inspect option with Chrome DevTools for Node. Open chrome://inspect/#devices in chrome and click Open dedicated DevTools for NodeNow every logged object is available in inspector like regular JS running in chrome. There is no need to reopen inspector, it connects to node automatically as soon as node starts or restarts. Both --inspect and Chrome DevTools for Node may not be available in older versions of Node and Chrome.The node REPL has a built-in solution for overriding how objects are displayed, see here.The REPL module internally uses util.inspect(), when printing values.\n  However, util.inspect delegates the call to the object\'s inspect()\n  function, if it has one.A simple trick would be use debug module to add DEBUG_DEPTH=null as environment variable when running the scriptEx.In you code
