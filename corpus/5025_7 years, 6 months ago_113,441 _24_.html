I sometimes check out some previous version of the code to examine or test.  I have seen instructions on what to do if I wish to modify previous commits -- but suppose I make no changes.  After I\'ve done e.g. git checkout HEAD^, how do I get back to the tip of the branch?.. git log no longer shows me the SHA of the latest commit.If you know the commit you want to return to is the head of some branch, or is tagged, then you can justYou can also use git reflog to see what other commits your HEAD (or any other ref) has pointed to in the past.Edited to add:In newer versions of Git, if you only ran git checkout or something else to move your HEAD once, you can also do to switch back to wherever it was before the last checkout. This was motivated by the analogy to the shell idiom cd - to go back to whatever working directory one was previously in.git checkout mastermaster is the tip, or the last commit.  gitk will only show you up to where you are in the tree at the time.  git reflog will show all the commits, but in this case, you just want the tip, so git checkout master.Came across this question just now and have something to addTo go to the most recent commit:Explanation:git log --branches shows log of commits from all local branches\n-1 limit to one commit → most recent commit\n--pretty=format:"%H" format to only show commit hash\ngit checkout $(...) use output of subshell as argument for checkoutNote:This will result in a detached head though (because we checkout directly to the commit). This can be avoided by extracting the branch name using sed, explained below.To go to the branch of the most recent commit:Explanation:git log --branches shows log of commits from all local branches\n-1 limit to one commit → most recent commit\n--pretty=format:"%D" format to only show ref names\n|sed \'s/HEAD -> \\|tag: [^,]*\\|,.*//g\' ignore HEAD, tag and extract the first of multiple branch names\ngit checkout $(...) use output of subshell as argument for checkoutNote:This will always only use the first branch name if there are multiple for that commit.Anyway, I think the best solution would just be to display the ref names for the most recent commit to know where to checkout to:E.g. create the alias git top for that command.Have a look at the graphical GUI ... gitk it shows all commits. Sometimes it is easier to work graphical ... ^^You can use one of the following git command for this:If your latest commit is on the master branch, you can simply use
