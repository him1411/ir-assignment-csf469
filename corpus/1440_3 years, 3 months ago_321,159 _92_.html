How do you get the length of a String? For example, I have a variable defined like:However, I can\'t seem to find a length method on the string.As of Swift 4With the upcoming Swift 4, it will just be:for reasons.(Thanks to Martin R)As of Swift 2:With Swift 2, Apple has changed global functions to protocol extensions, extensions that match any type conforming to a protocol. Thus the new syntax is:(Thanks to JohnDifool for the heads up)As of Swift 1Use the count characters method:right from the Apple Swift Guide(note, for versions of Swift earlier than 1.2, this would be countElements(unusualMenagerie) instead)for your variable, it would beOr you can use test1.utf16countFor Swift 2.0 and 3.0, use test1.characters.count. But, there are a few things you should know. So, read on.Before Swift 2.0, count was a global function. As of Swift 2.0, it can be called as a member function.It will return the actual number of Unicode characters in a String, so it\'s the most correct alternative in the sense that, if you\'d print the string and count characters by hand, you\'d get the same result.However, because of the way Strings are implemented in Swift, characters don\'t always take up the same amount of memory, so be aware that this behaves quite differently than the usual character count methods in other languages. For example, you can also use test1.utf16.countBut, as noted below, the returned value is not guaranteed to be the same as that of calling count on characters.From the language reference:Extended grapheme clusters can be composed of one or more Unicode\n  scalars. This means that different characters\xe2\x80\x94and different\n  representations of the same character\xe2\x80\x94can require different amounts of\n  memory to store. Because of this, characters in Swift do not each take\n  up the same amount of memory within a string\xe2\x80\x99s representation. As a\n  result, the number of characters in a string cannot be calculated\n  without iterating through the string to determine its extended\n  grapheme cluster boundaries. If you are working with particularly long\n  string values, be aware that the characters property must iterate over\n  the Unicode scalars in the entire string in order to determine the\n  characters for that string.The count of the characters returned by the characters property is not\n  always the same as the length property of an NSString that contains\n  the same characters. The length of an NSString is based on the number\n  of 16-bit code units within the string\xe2\x80\x99s UTF-16 representation and not\n  the number of Unicode extended grapheme clusters within the string.An example that perfectly illustrates the situation described above is that of checking the length of a string containing a single emoji character, as pointed out by n00neimp0rtant in the comments.Swift 1.2 Update: There\'s no longer a countElements for counting the size of collections. Just use the count function as a replacement: count("Swift") Swift 2.0, 3.0 and 3.1: let strLength = string.characters.count\n  Swift 4.0: [Apple Documentation - Strings]let strLength = string.countSwift 4"string".count;)Swift 3usage"string".lengthIf you are just trying to see if a string is empty or not (checking for length of 0), Swift offers a simple boolean test method on StringThe other side of this coin was people asking in ObjectiveC how to ask if a string was empty where the answer was to check for a length of 0:NSString is emptytl;dr If you want the length of a String type in terms of the number of human-readable characters, use countElements(). If you want to know the length in terms of the number of extended grapheme clusters, use endIndex. Read on for details.The String type is implemented as an ordered collection (i.e., sequence) of Unicode characters, and it conforms to the CollectionType protocol, which conforms to the _CollectionType protocol, which is the input type expected by countElements(). Therefore, countElements() can be called, passing a String type, and it will return the count of characters.However, in conforming to CollectionType, which in turn conforms to _CollectionType, String also implements the startIndex and endIndex computed properties, which actually represent the position of the index before the first character cluster, and position of the index after the last character cluster, respectively. So, in the string "ABC", the position of the index before A is 0 and after C is 3. Therefore, endIndex = 3, which is also the length of the string.So, endIndex can be used to get the length of any String type, then, right?Well, not always...Unicode characters are actually extended grapheme clusters, which are sequences of one or more Unicode scalars combined to create a single human-readable character.circledStar is a single character made up of U+2606 (a white star), and U+20DD (a combining enclosing circle). Let\'s create a String from circledStar and compare the results of countElements() and endIndex.In Swift 2.0 count doesn\'t work anymore. You can use this instead:Here\'s something shorter, and more natural than using a global function:I don\'t know if it\'s available in beta 1, though. But it\'s definitely there in beta 2.As of Swift 1.2 utf16Count has been removed. You should now use the global count() function and pass the UTF16 view of the string. Example below...Updated for Xcode 6 beta 4, change method utf16count --> utf16CountOrFor XCode 7.3 and Swift 2.2.1) If you want the number of visual characters:2) If you want the 16-bit code units within the string\xe2\x80\x99s UTF-16 representation:Most of the time, 1) is what you need.When would you need 2)? I\'ve found a use case for 2):If you use 1), the result is incorrect:in Swift 2.x the following is how to find the length of a stringreturns 24You could try like this  Swift 2.0:\nGet a count: yourString.text.characters.countFun example of how this is useful would be to show a character countdown from some number (150 for example) in a UITextView:In Xcode 6.1.1 I think that brainiacs will change this on every minor version.Get string value from your textview or textfield:Find the count of the characters in the string:This counts the characters in Regular Swift StringThis counts the characters in a NSStringBest way to count String in Swift is this:String and NSString are toll free bridge so you can use all methods available to NSString with swift Stringwill get you the number of letters/numbers etc in your string.ex:(prints "13")Apple made it different from other major language. The current way is to call:test1.characters.countHowever, to be careful, when you say length you mean the count of characters not the count of bytes, because those two can be different when you use non-ascii characters.For example;\n      "\xe4\xbd\xa0\xe5\xa5\xbd\xe5\x95\x8ahi".characters.count will give you 5 but this is not the count of the bytes.\n      To get the real count of bytes, you need to do "\xe4\xbd\xa0\xe5\xa5\xbd\xe5\x95\x8ahi".lengthOfBytes(using: String.Encoding.utf8). This will give you 11.Right now (in Swift 2.3) if you use:the method will return a "Distance" type, if you need the method to return an Integer you should type cast like so:Here is what I ended up doingSwift 4 update comparing with swift 3Swift 4 removes the need for a characters array on String. This means that you can directly call count on a string without getting characters array first.Whereas in swift 3, you will have to get characters array and then count element in that array. Note that this following method is still available in swift 4.0 as you can still call characters to access characters array of the given stringSwift 4.0 also adopts Unicode 9 and it can now interprets grapheme clusters. For example, counting on an emoji will give you 1 while in swift 3.0, you may get counts greater than 1.If you are looking for a cleaner way to get length of a string checkout this library which has bunch of extensions to the Swift built in classes http://www.dollarswift.org/#lengthUsing this library you can just do "Some Str".lengthUsing Xcode 6.4, Swift 1.2 and iOS 8.4:You can add this function to your extentionObjective C:- String.length\nSwift2.0 :- String.character.countYou could use SwiftString (https://github.com/amayne/SwiftString) to do this.
