I\'m not sure what is the proper syntax for using C enums. I have the following code:But this does not compile, with the following error:What am I doing wrong?Declaring an enum variable is done like this:However, you can use a typedef to shorten the variable declarations, like so:Having a naming convention to distinguish between types and variables is a good idea:It\'s worth pointing out that you don\'t need a typedef. You can just do it like the followingIt\'s a style question whether you prefer typedef. Without it, if you want to refer to the enumeration type, you need to use enum strategy. With it, you can just say strategy.Both ways have their pro and cons. The one is more wordy, but keeps type identifiers into the tag-namespace where they won\'t conflict with ordinary identifiers (think of struct stat and the stat function: these don\'t conflict either), and where you immediately see that it\'s a type. The other is shorter, but brings type identifiers into the ordinary namespace. When you sayyou create a single instance variable, called \'strategy\' of a nameless enum. This is not a very useful thing to do - you need a typedef:You\'re trying to declare strategy twice, and that\'s why you\'re getting the above error. The following works without any complaints (compiled with gcc -ansi -pendantic -Wall):If instead of the above, the second line were changed to:From the warnings, you could easily see your mistake:So the compiler took strategy = IMMEDIATE for a declaration of a variable called strategy with default type int, but there was already a previous declaration of a variable with this name.However, if you placed the assignment in the main() function, it would be a valid code:As written, there\'s nothing wrong with your code.  Are you sure you haven\'t done something likeWhat lines do the error messages point to?  When it says "previous declaration of \'strategy\' was here", what\'s "here" and what does it show?  @ThoAppelsin in his comment to question posted is right. The code snippet posted in the question it is valid and with no errors. The error you have must be because other bad syntax in any other place of your c source file. enum{a,b,c}; defines three symbolic constants (a, b and c) which are integers with values 0,1 and 2 respectively, but when we use enum it is because we don\'t usually care about the specific integer value, we care more about the meaning of the symbolic constant name. \nThis means you can have this:and this will output 1.This also will be valid:and will output the same as before.If you do this:you will have an error, but if you do this:you will not have any error.you can do this:and aa will be an integer variable with value 0. but you can also do this:and will have the same effect (that is, aa being an int with 0 value). you can also do this:and aa will be int with value 7.because you cannot repeat symbolic constant definition with the use of enum, as i have said previously, you must use tags if you want to declare int vars with the use of enum:the use of typedef it is to safe you from writing each time enum tag1 to define variable. With typedef you can just type Tag1:You can also have:Last thing to say it is that since we are talking about defined symbolic constants it is better to use capitalized letters when using enum, that is for example:instead of It\'s worth mentioning that in C++ you can use "enum" to define a new type without needing a typedef statement. I find this approach a lot more friendly.[edit - clarified C++ status - I had this in originally, then removed it!]There seems to be a confusion about the declaration.When strategycomes before {RANDOM, IMMEDIATE, SEARCH} as in the following,you are creating a new type named enum strategy. However, when declaring the variable, you need to use enum strategy itself. You cannot just use strategy. So the following is invalid.While, the following is validWhen strategy comes after {RANDOM, IMMEDIATE, SEARCH}, you are creating an anonymous enum and then declaring strategy to be a variable of that type.So now, you can do something likeHowever, you cannot declare any other variable of type enum {RANDOM, IMMEDIATE, SEARCH} because you have never named it. So the following is invalidYou can combine both the definitions tooTypedef as noted before is used for creating a shorter variable declaration.Now you have told compiler that enum {RANDOM, IMMEDIATE, SEARCH} is synonomous to strategy. So now you can freely use strategy as variable type. You don\'t need to type enum strategy anymore. The following is valid nowYou can also combine Typedef along with enum name to getThere\'s not much advantage of using this method apart from the fact that you can now use strategy and enum strategyName interchangeably.If you declare the name for enumeration no error will occur.If not declared, you have to use a typedef:It will not display an error...I tried with gcc and come up with for my need I was forced to use the last alternative, to compile with out error. typedef enum state {a = 0, b = 1, c = 2} state;Tarc\'s answer is the best.Much of the enum discussion is a red herring.Compare this code snippet:-which gives with this one which compiles with no problem.The fact that he used enum {RANDOM, IMMEDIATE, SEARCH} instead of int is only relevant to the extent that it has confused people that can\'t see beyond it.\nThe redefinition error messages in the question show that this is what the author has done wrong.So now you should be able to see why the first of the example below is wrong and the other three are okay.Example 1. WRONG!Example 2. RIGHT.Example 3. RIGHT.Example 4. RIGHT.If you have a working program you should just be able to paste these snippets into your program and see that some compile and some do not.
