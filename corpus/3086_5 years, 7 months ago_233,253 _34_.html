I would like to write a CSS selector rule that selects all elements that don\'t have a certain class. For example, given the following HTML:I would like to write a selector that selects all elements that don\'t have the "printable" class which, in this case, are the nav and a elements.Is this possible?NOTE: in the actual HTML where I would like to use this, there are going to be a lot more elements that don\'t have the "printable" class than do (I realize it\'s the other way around in the above example).Typically you add a class selector to the :not() pseudo-class like so:But if you need better browser support (IE8 and older don\'t support :not()), you\'re probably better off creating style rules for elements that do have the "printable" class. If even that isn\'t feasible despite what you say about your actual markup, you may have to work your markup around that limitation.Keep in mind that, depending on the properties you\'re setting in this rule, some of them may either be inherited by descendants that are .printable, or otherwise affect them one way or another. For example, although display is not inherited, setting display: none on a :not(.printable) will prevent it and all of its descendants from displaying, since it removes the element and its subtree from layout completely. You can often get around this by using visibility: hidden instead which will allow visible descendants to show, but the hidden elements will still affect layout as they originally did. In short, just be careful.Actually, this will select anything that does not have a css class (class="css-selector") applied to it.I made a jsfiddle demoIs this supported? Yes : Caniuse.com (accessed 25 Aug 2014): Funny edit, i was googling for the oposite of :not. CSS negation? The negation CSS pseudo-class, :not(X), is a functional notation\n  taking a simple selector X as an argument. It matches an element that\n  is not represented by the argument. X must not contain another\n  negation selector.You can use :not to exclude any subset of matched elements, ordered as you would normal CSS selectors.div:not(.class)Would select all div elements without the class .class:not(div) > divWould select all div elements which arent children of another divWith the notable exception of not being able to chain/nest :not selectors and pseudo elements, you can use in conjunction with other pseudo selectors.:not is a CSS3 level selector, the main exception in terms of support is that it is IE9+The spec also makes an interesting point:the :not() pseudo allows useless selectors to be written. For\n  instance :not(*|*), which represents no element at all, or\n  foo:not(bar), which is equivalent to foo but with a higher\n  specificity.I think this should work:From "negative css selector" answer.Just like to contribute that the above answers of :not() can be very effective in angular forms, rather than creating effects or adjusting the view/DOM, Ensures that on loading your page, the input fields will only show the invalid (red borders or backgrounds, etc) if they have data added (i.e. no longer pristine) but are invalid.You can use :not(.class) selector as mentioned before.If you care about Internet explorer compatibility I recommend you to use http://selectivizr.com/.But remember to run it under apache otherwise you won\'t see the effect.Example// Opacity 0.6 all "section-" but not "section-name"
