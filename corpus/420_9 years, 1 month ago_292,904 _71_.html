How can I permanently have line numbers in IntelliJ?From version 14.0 onwards, the path to the setting dialog is slightly different, a General submenu has been added between Editor and Appearance as shown belowFrom IntelliJ 8.1.2 onwards, this option is in File | Settings1. Within the IDE Settings section of that dialog, you\'ll find it under Editor | Appearance.The question is obviously well answered already, but since IJ 13 you can enable line numbers in 2 seconds flat: Et voila ;)There\'s another way, and even quicker (works for me in version 10.5)Simply right click on the place where the line-numbers should be, and there you\'ll see a small menu.then, mark the "Show Line Numbers" option.Please note that this only works on a per-file basis, however.  Enjoy.In Intellij 13 the layout has changed, the Settings button can only be found in File -> Settings and not in the toolbars, and from there you follow the same steps: Editor -> Appearance -> Show line numbers, or search for Line numbers in the Settings search input.Global configurationFile -> Settings -> Editor -> General -> Appearance -> Show line numbers\nFirst way: View -> Active Editor -> Show Line Numbers (this option will only be available if you previously have clicked into a file of the active editor)Second way: Right click on the small area between the project\'s structure and the active editor (that is, the one that you can set breakpoints) -> Show Line Numbers.\nFor InteliJ IDEA 11.0 and above\nGoto File --> Settings in the Settings window Editor --> Appearance\nand tick Show line numbers check box.IntelliJ 14 (Ubuntu): See: how-do-i-turn-on-line-numbers-permanently-in-intellij-14Permanently:File > Settings > Editor > General > Appearance > show line numbersFor current Editor:View > Active Editor > Show Line NumbersFile > Settings... > Editor > General > Appearance > Show line numbersHit Shift twice > write "line numbers" > Show Line Numbers (that one that has the toggle) > change the toggle to ONRight click on the left side bar > Show Line NumbersHit Shift twice > write "line" > Show Line Numbers (the line doesn\'t have the toggle)Ctrl + Shift + A > write "Show line" > Active Editor: Show Line Numbers > change the toggle to ONOk in intelliJ 14 Ultimate using the Mac version this is it.IntelliJ Idea > Preferences > Editor > General > Appearance > Show Line NumbersOn IntelliJ 12 on MAC OSX, I had a hard time finding it. The search wouldn\'t show me the way for some reason. Go to Preferences and under IDE Settings, Editor, Appearance and select \'Show line numbers\'Android StudioGo to Android Studio => Preferences => Editor => General => Appearance => set Checked "Show line numbers"Hello this is Tim from the FUTURE!!! 2011... For 9.0.4 File > SettingsIn the tree view group------------IDE Settings ---------Click the Editor [+]Select Appearance... Its there.1st way: Go to View => Active Editor => show line numbers2nd way Go to Android Studio => Preferences => Editor=> Appearance => set Checked "Show Line Numbers"I just hit this with IdeaVim plugin installed, where even if I set Show Line Numbers, it continued to revert to hiding them.The (forehead-slapping-worthy) solution was:On Mac Intellij 12.1.2 there is no File-Settings:There is an application-name menu item to the left of "File" with a "preferences" menu item:and within that is the "Settings" dialog shown by the Windows Intellij.In IntelliJ 14 it has moved again somewhat down the menu.
