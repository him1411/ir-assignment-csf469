I am working on developing a website and need to work on the print view. Typically when I have layout issues I use Chrome\'s Element Inspector. However this does not exist in print preview mode. Is there a Chrome plugin or some other way to change your viewing medium within chrome itself, to view a page as a printer would?  I suppose it doesn\'t have a be a Chrome specific solution, but that is my primary browser so it would be nice to have an in-browser solution.Right now I\'m focused just on the print preview medium, but it would be ideal to be able to change to any of the supported media types (i.e. all/braille/embossed/handheld/print/projection/screen/speech/tty/tv).  Note: This answer covers several versions of Chrome, scroll to see v52, v48, v46, v43 and v42 each with their updated changes.(In Chrome 35+ the "Emulation" tab is present by default. Also, the console is available from any primary tab.)This option is not (yet?) available in the console tab.Since Chrome 32 you have the CSS media option in the Screen section of the drawer Emulation tab.Just enable it, select print as the target media type, and - behold - your page is rendered [almost] the way it will be printed.Use Esc to bring up the drawer if it\'s not visible.Please see This articleThen goto the "overrides" tabAs of Chrome 48 (and perhaps a few versions earlier), the function seems to have moved yet again:The first few steps are unchanged:Press F12 to bring up the developer toolsPress ESC to to open the consoleAccording to the previous answers, the setting could then be found under the "Emulation" tab. As shown in the images below, it has now been moved to the "Rendering" tab, which can be brought up by clicking on the three dots to the left of the "Console" tab.As of Chrome 48+, you can access the print preview via the following steps: From there Chrome will show you a print version of your page and you can inspect element and troubleshoot like you would the browser version.Under Chrome v51 on a Mac, I found the rendering settings by clicking in the upper right corner, choosing More tools > Rendering settings and checking the Emulate media button in the options offered at the bottom of the window.\nThank you to all the other posters that led me to this, and credit to those that provided the answer without the images.If you are debugging your CSS using Print As PDF in Google Chrome and your CSS element background colors are not showing, then make sure the \'Background graphics\' checkbox is ticked. I spent almost 30 minutes debugging my CSS and wondering what is causing my CSS background being ignored.Chrome v50:Way 1: Way 2:
