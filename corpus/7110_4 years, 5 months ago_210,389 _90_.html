I upgraded IntelliJ Idea 12.0.4 to 12.10. Now all the modules in my Android project give the error: Error: Default Activity Not FoundI reverted to 12.0.4 and it works.Any ideas ?? I think it might be related to some plugins not being installed cause the only other thing could have been a local config but I deleted the configuration folder to confirm and that didn\'t change anything.If you see that error occur after upgrading versions of IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio, or after Generating a new APK, you may need to refresh the IDE\'s cache.I can\'t comment on why the upgrade of IntelliJ might cause this problem because I don\'t use it.However, that error: "Default Activity Not Found" seems to be telling you that you don\'t have an activity declared in AndroidManifest.xml that is marked as the main activity, to be launched when the application starts.You should have at least one activity that looks something like this:If you don\'t have at least one activity with an intent filter like that, you would most likely see the error message you have included here.You should add that intent filter to the Activity that you wish to open when you start the application, and that should fix your problem.Try to right click on the project and choose Open Module Settings. Then go to the Sources tab in your module, find the src folder, right click on it and mark it as Sources (blue color).EDIT: There is no sources tab in later versions of Android Studio, but you can edit the build.gradle file instead: https://stackoverflow.com/a/22028681/1101730You app have launch activity default?possibly this could be your mistakeStep 1: Select Edit ConfigurationsStep 2: watch this warning: Default Activity not found\nStep 3: select a default activity\nStep 3: Save your changes and finishGood LuckThe correct way to do this is to add the following to the Manifest file:This should be inserted between:No need in invalidating caches.Nothing above helped me. After some time I found that IDEA changed action names to uppercase. Like:After reverting to normal, IDEA recognizes default activity:In Android Studio under Run/Debug Configuration -> Android Application -> General -> Activity -> select the option "Do not launch Activity".If you are working on a widget app this solution should work for you:@TouchBoarder almost had it. Although selecting "Do not launch Activity" results in nothing launching.In Android Studio under Run/Debug Configuration -> Android Application -> General -> Activity -> select the option "Launch:"Choose your Activity. This doesn\'t exactly fix the intended behaviour but rather overrides it correctly.In case your application doesn\'t have an Activity (only a service for example), change the run/debug configuration \'Launch\' option to Nothing.I found this in my code:If you look very carefully, it should be <activity android:name=".MainActivity"> instead.Apparently, I refactored an "activity" somewhere, and it changed names in the AndroidManifest as well.in my case i refactored a member variable that was named "activity", i renamed it to "context" ... i found out that the refactor was made to the activity tags in manifest, and i found them context tags instead ... this is really stupid from Android Studio !!It works for me. \nRebuild project to make sure that no errors in project. Then we can invalidate cache. just faced this error on android studio 2.1.2.\nsolved by adding MAIN/LAUNCHER intent-filter to default activity in flavour manifest, though filter already was in default activity in default manifest. It even was in merged manifest, but studio can\'t found it until i duplicated filter in both manifests.my experience:\nmake sure that all your java file has been indentify,if IDEA not indentify your java file ,so he not able to understand what\'s "Activity" means good luck :)Well I got this error too,Error: Default Activity Not Foundwell in my case  it was for wear module ..I don\'t need an Activity there so what i do is simply Note: Don\'t forget to Clean Project and Sync Gradle Files.I started with a demo app and modified it. I change the java path inside source from com -> example -> foo to my own and edited the manifest; however, Android Studio (0.8.7) got very confused.I tried everything listed above and none of it worked for me. Maybe it even made things worse?My final solution was to edit <projectname>.iml in the .idea subdirectory by opening it up in Android Studio (aka text editor).Before:I (re)added the src directory (2nd line).\nAfter:After saving it, Android Studio reloaded and started functioning as expected.After updating Android Studio from 1.2.x to 1.3 I got the same problem and I tried all suggestions but nothing worked. Then I did this:Go to Run/Debug Configurations. Select the configuration that gives the error and delete it. Create a new one with the same name and settings. After that, reconnect the USB cable and run the application.This solved the problem for me.Error: Default Activity Not FoundI solved this way\nRun>>Edit Configuration >>Android Application >> Enter the path of your default \nactivity class in "Launch" Edit Box.Invalidate Caches / RestartAfter that, your app must be run!I changed my Intent-filter toJust add DEFAULT option as well. I was using Process Phoenix library and it prompted me to define a default intent. This addition solved my problem.Android Manifest.xml\nset the starting activity like followingWell, I don\'t understand Android Studio sometimes...I encountered the same problem and tried the what the answers here told, but to no avail. And then I changed one thing: the action in my intent-filter was having the action name all in caps and I changed it to small and left only the word MAIN in caps, and it solved the problem! How absurd! I hope this can help someone.This will help someone who landed on this page like meI got the error Error: Default Activity Not Found after I copy pasted a code from an online course. The mistake was in the first line MainActivity.java file Instead of package com.example.myname.justjava;the first line was package com.example.android.justjava; from the code provided for learningRectifying it got rid of the errorugly but worked for me:Had this error message, my problem was in a module, I just deleted the application tag compleatly from my module\'s manifest and it worked.(delete ic_launcher from the module library as well)was:now:You Might be missing  attributes. Make sure to include this activity inside manifest fileI was facing similar issue recently. The issue was with activitymanifest xml file.\nplease check if taglines are closed properly.I\'ve encountered the same issue. For some reasons, android Studio replaced all the android:name attributes in most of XML files, including the manifest, to android:subject which isn\'t recognized by Android Studio.As you can see in the picture above the IDE doesn\'t recognize the android:subject attribute. As a result, it won\'t be able to read the lines which specify the MainActivty. The solution is simply to change every android:subject to android:name and then Rebuild the project from Build menu -> Rebuild Project. You might encounter the same issue when rebuilding the project, so do the same as above.While Configuring a new projectthe company name should end as .app \nfor example it should be android.example.com.app\nand it should not be android.example.comIn my case, there was a misstype in AndroidManifest.xml as shown below. Removing "o" letter above application tag solved. Apparently, Android Studio doesn\'t detect type errors in AndroidMainfest.xml
