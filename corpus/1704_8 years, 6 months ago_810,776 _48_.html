I\'m trying to horizontally center a <div> block element on a page and have it set to a minimum width. What is the simplest way to do this? I want the <div> element to be inline with rest of my page. I\'ll try to draw an example:In the case of a non-fixed width div (i.e. you don\'t know how much space the div will occupy).Keep in mind that the width of #yourdiv is dynamic -> it will grow and shrink to accommodate the text inside it.You can check browser compatibility on CaniuseIn most browsers this will work...StylesheetHTMLIn IE6 you will need to add another outer div...StylesheetHTMLas ck has said, min-width is not supported by all browsersCSS, HTML:\nYour diagram shows a block level element also (which a div usually is), not an inline one.Of the top of my head, min-width is supported in FF2+/Safari3+/IE7+. Can be done for IE6 using hackety CSS, or a simple bit of JS.The title of the question and the content is actually different, so I will post two solutions for that using Flexbox.I guess Flexbox will replace/add to the current standard solution by the time IE8 and IE9 is completely destroyed ;)Check the current Browser compatibility table for flexboxSingle elementMultiple elements but center only oneDefault behaviour is flex-direction: row which will align all the child items in a single line. Setting it to flex-direction: column will help the lines to be stacked.Minimum width is not globally supported, but can be implemented usingThen you can set your div to be If old browsers are not an issue, use HTML5 / CSS3. If they are, apply polyfills and still use HTML5 / CSS3. I assume that your div has no margins or paddings here, but they are relatively easy to account for. The code follows.What this does is: It is easy to imagine this process to confirm that the div would be horizontally centered eventually. As a bonus, you can center vertically at no additional cost:The advantage of this approach is that you don\'t have to do any counterintuitive stuff, such as considering your div a text of sorts, wrapping it in a (often semantically useless) additional container, or giving it a fixed width, which is not always possible.Don\'t forget vendor prefixes for transform if needed.You should use position: relative and text-align: center on the parent element and then display: inline-block on the child element you want to center. This is a simple CSS design pattern that will work across all major browsers. Here is an example below or check out the CodePen Example.you can use margin: 0 auto on your css instead of margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;JsFiddleIf your <div> has position: absolute you need to use width: 100%;Here I add proper answerYou can use this snippet code and customize. Here I use 2 child block.This should show center of the page.\nYou can use one or multiple blocks.In your html file you write:your css file you write:works for me.The best response to this question is to use margin-auto but for using it you must know the width of your div in px or %.CSS code:I use div and span tags together with css properties such as block, cross-browser inline-block and text-align center, see my simple exampleUsage of margin-left:auto and margin-right:auto may not work in certain situations. Here is a solution what will always work. You specify a required width and than set a left-margin to a half of the remaining width.you can use the position:relative; and then set the left and the top values:Using jQuery:or, if you want to center every element with class ".myElement":
