I\'m starting to learn about writing scripts for the bash terminal, but I can\'t work out how to get the comparisons to work properly. I\'m sure this is very basic to many of you I just can\'t seem to find the answer to my question anywhere (or at least I\'m not totally sure what to search for). The script I\'m using is:The problem I have is that it compares the number from the first digit on, i.e. 9 is bigger than 10000, but 1 is greater than 09. How can I convert the numbers into a type to do a true comparison? I realize that this is probably irritatingly simple, but any help would be greatly appreciated!In bash, you should do your check in arithmetic context:For POSIX shells that don\'t support (()), you can use -lt and -gt.You can get a full list of comparison operators with help test.Plain and simpleYou can check out this cheatsheet if you want more number comparsions in the wonderful world of Bash Scripting.Shortly, integers can only be compared with:There is also one nice thing some people might not know about:This code will print the smallest number out of a and bIn Bash I prefer doing this as it addresses itself more as a conditional operation unlike using (( )) which is more of arithmetic.Unless I do complex stuffs likeBut everyone just has their own preferences. Sad thing is that some people impose their unofficial standards.Update:You actually can also do this:Which allows you to add something else which you could do with [[ ]] besides arithmetic stuffs.This code can also compare floats. It is using awk (it is not pure bash), however this shouldn\'t be a problem, as awk is a standard POSIX command that is most likely shipped by default with your operating system.To make it shorter for use, use this function:I solved this by using a small function to convert version strings to plain integer values that can be compared:This makes two important assumptions:For exampleExample testing whether npm command meets minimum requirement ...
