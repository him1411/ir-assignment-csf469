I have 2 HTML files, suppose a.html and b.html. In a.html I want to include b.html.In JSF I can do it like that:It means that inside a.xhtml file, I can include b.xhtml.How can we do it in *.html file?In my opinion the best solution uses jQuery:a.html:b.html:This method is a simple and clean solution to my problem.The jQuery .load() documentation is here.My solution is similar to the one of lolo above. However, I insert the HTML code via JavaScript\'s document.write instead of using jQuery:a.html:b.js:The reason for me against using jQuery is that jQuery.js is ~90kb in size, and I want to keep the amount of data to load as small as possible.In order to insert the escape characters without much work, I recommend using a simple regular expression that matches whole lines (^.*$) and adds \\ at the end of each line. For example, you could use sed on the command line like this:Expanding lolo\'s answer from above, here is a little more automation if you have to include a lot of files:And then to include something in the html:Which would include the file views/header.html and views/footer.htmlCheckout HTML5 imports via Html5rocks tutorial \nand at polymer-projectFor example:A simple server side include directive to include another file found in the same folder looks like this:Shameless plug of a library that I wrote the solve this.https://github.com/LexmarkWeb/csi.jsThe above will take the contents of /path/to/include.html and replace the div with it.A very old solution I did met my needs back then, but here\'s how to do it standards-compliant code:No need for scripts. No need to do any fancy stuff server-side (tho that would probably be a better option)Since old browsers don\'t support seamless, you should add some css to fix it:Keep in mind that for browsers that don\'t support seamless, if you click a link in the iframe it will make the frame go to that url, not the whole window. A way to get around that is to have all links have target="_parent", tho the browser support is "good enough".As an alternative, if you have access to the .htaccess file on your server, you can add a simple directive that will allow php to be interpreted on files ending in .html extension.Now you can use a simple php script to include other files such as:Following works if html content from some file needs to be included:\nFor instance, the following line will include the contents of piece_to_include.html at the location where the OBJECT definition occurs.Reference: http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-html40-970708/struct/includes.html#h-7.7.4To insert contents of the named file:Most of the solutions works but they have issue with jquery:The issue is following code $(document).ready(function () { alert($("#includedContent").text()); } alerts nothing instead of alerting included content.I write the below code, in my solution you can access to included content in $(document).ready function:(The key is loading included content synchronously).index.htm:include.inc:jquery include plugin on githubThis is what helped me. For adding a block of html code from b.html to a.html, this should go into the head tag of a.html:Then in the body tag, a container is made with an unique id and a javascript block to load the b.html into the container, as follows:The Athari\xc2\xb4s answer (the first!) was too much conclusive! Very Good!But if you would like to pass the name of the page to be included as URL parameter, this post has a very nice solution to be used combined with:http://www.jquerybyexample.net/2012/06/get-url-parameters-using-jquery.htmlSo it becomes something like this:Your URL: The a.html code now becomes:It worked very well for me!\nI hope have helped :)There is no direct HTML solution for the task for now. Even  HTML Imports  (which is permanently in  draft) will not do the thing, because Import != Include and some JS magic will be required anyway.\nI recently wrote  a VanillaJS script that is just for inclusion HTML into HTML, without any complications.  Just place in your a.htmlIt is open-source and may give an idea (I hope)Here is a great article, You can implement common library and just use below code to import any HTML files in one line. You can also try Google PolymerYou can do that with JavaScript\'s library jQuery like this:HTML:JS:Please note that banner.html should be located under the same domain your other pages are in otherwise your webpages will refuse the banner.html file due to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policies.Also, please note that if you load your content with JavaScript, Google will not be able to index it so it\'s not exactly a good method for SEO reasons.Based on the answer of https://stackoverflow.com/a/31837264/4360308\nI\'ve implemented this functionality with Nodejs (+ express + cheerio) as follows:HTML (index.html)JSappend -> includes the content into the divreplace -> replaces the divyou could easily add more behaviours following the same designhtml5rocks.com has a very good tutorial on this stuff, and this might be a little late, but I myself didn\'t know this existed. w3schools also has a way to do this using their new library called w3.js. The thing is, this requires the use of a web server and and HTTPRequest object. You can\'t actually load these locally and test them on your machine. What you can do though, is use polyfills provided on the html5rocks link at the top, or follow their tutorial. With a little JS magic, you can do something like this:This will make the link (Can change to be the wanted link element if already set), set the import (unless you already have it), and then append it. It will then from there take that and parse the file in HTML, and then append it to the desired element under a div. This can all be changed to fit your needs from the appending element to the link you are using. I hope this helped, it may irrelevant now if newer, faster ways have come out without using libraries and frameworks such as jQuery or W3.js.UPDATE: This will throw an error saying that the local import has been blocked by CORS policy. Might need access to the deep web to be able to use this because of the properties of the deep web. (Meaning no practical use)In w3.js include works like this:You can use a polyfill of HTML Imports (https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/imports/), or that simplified solution\nhttps://github.com/dsheiko/html-importFor example, on the page you import HTML block like that:The block may have imports of its own:The importer replaces the directive with the loaded HTML pretty much like SSIThese directives will be served automatically as soon as you load this small JavaScript:It will process the imports when DOM is ready automatically. Besides, it exposes an API that you can use to run manually, to get logs and so on. Enjoy :)I came to this topic looking for something similar, but a bit different from the problem posed by lolo.  I wanted to construct an HTML page holding an alphabetical menu of links to other pages, and each of the other pages might or might not exist, and the order in which they were created might not be alphabetical (nor even numerical).  Also, like Tafkadasoh, I did not want to bloat the web page with jQuery.  After researching the problem and experimenting for several hours, here is what worked for me, with relevant remarks added:If you use some framework like django/bootle, they often ship some template engine.\nLet\'s say you use bottle, and the default template engine is SimpleTemplate Engine.\nAnd below is the pure html fileYou can include the footer.tpl in you main file, like: Besides that, you can also pass parameter to your dashborard.tpl.A simple solution with php:PHP is a server level scripting language. It can do many things, but one popular use is to include HTML documents inside your pages, much the same as SSI. Like SSI, this is a server level technology. If you are not sure if you have PHP functionality on your website contact your hosting provider.Here is a simple PHP script you can use to include a snippet of HTML on any PHP-enabled web page:Save the HTML for the common elements of your site to separate files. For example, your navigation section might be saved as navigation.html or navigation.php.\nUse the following PHP code to include that HTML in each page.Use that same code on every page that you want to include the file.\nMake sure to change the higlighted file name to the name and path to your include file.Well, if all you\'re wanting to do is put text from a separate file into your page (tags in the text should work, too), you can do this (your text styles on the main page\xe2\x80\x94test.html\xe2\x80\x94should still work):test.htmlsample.jsYou can always recreate the HTML tags you want yourself, after all. There\'s need for server-side scripting just to grab text from another file, unless you want to do something more.Anyway, what I\'m starting to use this for is to make it so if I update a description common among lots of HTML files, I only need to update one file to do it (the .js file) instead of every single HTML file that contains the text.So, in summary, instead of importing an .html file, a simpler solution is to import a .js file with the content of the .html file in a variable (and write the contents to the screen where you call the script).Thanks for the question.using jquery u need import libraryi recommend you using phpb.html
