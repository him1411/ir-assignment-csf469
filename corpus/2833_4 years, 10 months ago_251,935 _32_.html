How can I tell gradle to redownload dependencies from repositories?Generally, you can refresh dependencies in your cache with the command line option --refresh-dependencies. You can also delete the cached files under ~/.gradle/caches. With the next build Gradle would attempt to download them again.What is your specific use case? Do you use dynamic dependency versions or SNAPSHOT versions?On Unix systems, you can delete all the existing artifacts (artifacts and metadata) Gradle has downloaded using:If you are using recent version of Gradle, you can use --refresh-dependencies option. you can refer the gradle manual.The --refresh-dependencies option tells Gradle to ignore all cached entries for resolved modules and artifacts. A fresh resolve will be performed against all configured repositories, with dynamic versions recalculated, modules refreshed, and artifacts downloaded. Gradle manualYou can tell Gradle to re-download some dependencies in the build script by flagging the dependency as \'changing\'. Gradle will then check for updates every 24 hours, but this can be configured using the resolutionStrategy DSL. I find it useful to use this for for SNAPSHOT or NIGHTLY builds.Expanded:Condensed:I found this solution at this forum thread.For MAC ./gradlew build --refresh-dependenciesFor Windows gradlew build --refresh-dependenciesFor Windows...in order to make gradle re-download specific dependencies:delete the dependencies you want to re-download from the directory below:delete all metadata directories at the path:run gradle build (or gradlew build if using gradle wrapper) in the project\'s root directory.note: the numbers in the file paths above might be different for you.One can remove folder with cached jars.In my case on Mac the library was cached at path "/Users/MY_NAME/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/cached-library-to-remove"I removed the cached library folder ("cached-library-to-remove" in above example), deleted the build folder of my project and compiled again. Fresh library was downloaded then.Instead of removing your entire gradle cache, like some answers here are suggesting, you can delete the cache for a specific group or artifact id. I added the following function to my .bash_profile:Usage:Then, on the next build or if you resync, gradle will re-download dependencies.delete this directory:I think gradle 2.14.1 fixes the issue. The accepted answer is correct, but there is a bug in gradle with \xe2\x80\x93refresh-dependencies. 2.14.1 fixes that.See https://discuss.gradle.org/t/refresh-dependencies-should-use-cachechangingmodulesfor-0s/556You need to redownload it, so you can either manually download and replace the corrupted file and again sync your project . Go to this location\nC:\\users[username].gradle\\wrapper\\dist\\gradle3.3-all\\55gk2rcmfc6p2dg9u9ohc3hw9\\gradle-3.3-all.zip\nHere delete gradle3.3allzip and replace it by downloading again from this site\nhttps://services.gradle.org/distributions/\nFind the same file and download and paste it to that location\nThen sync your project.\nHope it works for you too.
