So what I\'m looking for here is something like PHP\'s print_r function. This is so I can debug my scripts by seeing what\'s the state of the object in question.You are really mixing together two different things.Use dir(), vars() or the inspect module to get what you are interested in (I use __builtins__ as an example; you can use any object instead).Print that dictionary however fancy you like:orPretty printing is also available in the interactive debugger as a command:You want vars() mixed with pprint():There are many 3rd-party functions out there that add things like exception handling, national/special character printing, recursing into nested objects etc. according to their authors\' preferences. But they all basically boil down to this.dir has been mentioned, but that\'ll only give you the attributes\' names.  If you want their values as well try __dict__.Here is the output:To print the current state of the object you might: or orFor your classes define __str__ or __repr__ methods. From the Python documentation:__repr__(self) Called by the repr() built-in function and by string\n  conversions (reverse quotes) to\n  compute the "official" string\n  representation of an object. If at all\n  possible, this should look like a\n  valid Python expression that could be\n  used to recreate an object with the\n  same value (given an appropriate\n  environment). If this is not possible,\n  a string of the form "<...some useful\n  description...>" should be returned.\n  The return value must be a string\n  object. If a class defines repr()\n  but not __str__(), then __repr__() is\n  also used when an "informal" string\n  representation of instances of that\n  class is required. This is typically\n  used for debugging, so it is important\n  that the representation is\n  information-rich and unambiguous.__str__(self) Called by the str() built-in function and by the print\n  statement to compute the "informal"\n  string representation of an object.\n  This differs from __repr__() in that\n  it does not have to be a valid Python\n  expression: a more convenient or\n  concise representation may be used\n  instead. The return value must be a\n  string object.You can use the "dir()" function to do this.Another useful feature is help.Might be worth checking out --Is there a Python equivalent to Perl's Data::Dumper?My recommendation is this --https://gist.github.com/1071857Note that perl has a module called Data::Dumper which translates object data back to perl source code (NB: it does NOT translate code back to source, and almost always you don\'t want to the object method functions in the output). This can be used for persistence, but the common purpose is for debugging.There are a number of things standard python pprint fails to achieve, in particular it just stops descending when it sees an instance of an object and gives you the internal hex pointer of the object (errr, that pointer is not a whole lot of use by the way). So in a nutshell, python is all about this great object oriented paradigm, but the tools you get out of the box are designed for working with something other than objects.The perl Data::Dumper allows you to control how deep you want to go, and also detects circular linked structures (that\'s really important). This process is fundamentally easier to achieve in perl because objects have no particular magic beyond their blessing (a universally well defined process).In most cases, using __dict__ or dir() will get you the info you\'re wanting. If you should happen to need more details, the standard library includes the inspect module, which allows you to get some impressive amount of detail. Some of the real nuggests of info include:If you\'re just looking for "what attribute values does my object have?", then dir() and __dict__ are probably sufficient. If you\'re really looking to dig into the current state of arbitrary objects (keeping in mind that in python almost everything is an object), then inspect is worthy of consideration.A metaprogramming example Dump object with magic:Without arguments:With Gnosis Utils:It is a bit outdated but still working.I was needing to print DEBUG info in some logs and was unable to use pprint because it would break it.  Instead I did this and got virtually the same thing.To dump "myObject":I tried vars() and dir(); both failed for what I was looking for. vars() didn\'t work because the object didn\'t have __dict__ (exceptions.TypeError: vars() argument must have __dict__ attribute). dir() wasn\'t what I was looking for: it\'s just a listing of field names, doesn\'t give the values or the object structure.I think json.dumps() would work for most objects without the default=json_util.default, but I had a datetime field in the object so the standard json serializer failed. See How to overcome "datetime.datetime not JSON serializable" in python?If you\'re using this for debugging, and you just want a recursive dump of everything, the accepted answer is unsatisfying because it requires that your classes have good __str__ implementations already. If that\'s not the case, this works much better:Why not something simple:Just try beeprintit help you with not only printing object variables, but beautiful output, like this:pprint contains a \xe2\x80\x9cpretty printer\xe2\x80\x9d for producing aesthetically pleasing representations of your data structures. The formatter produces representations of data structures that can be parsed correctly by the interpreter, and are also easy for a human to read. The output is kept on a single line, if possible, and indented when split across multiple lines.This prints out all the object contents recursively in json or yaml indented format:Try pprettyOutput:You can try the Flask Debug Toolbar.\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask-DebugToolbarI like working with python object built-in types keys or values.  For attributes regardless they are methods or variables: For values of those attributes:For everybody struggling with The following code prints all attributes of obj with their values:
