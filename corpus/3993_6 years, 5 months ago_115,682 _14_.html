This gives a good explanation of squashing multiple commits:http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasingbut it does not work for commits that have already been pushed. How do I squash the most recent few commits both in my local and remote repos? EDIT: When I do git rebase -i origin/master~4 master, keep the first one as pick, set the other three as squash, and then exit (via c-x c-c in emacs), I get:where 2f40 is the pick commit. And now none of the 4 commits appear in git log. I expected my editor to be restarted so that I could enter a commit message. What am I doing wrong?Squash commits locally with and then force push with From the documentation of git push: Note that --force applies to all the refs that are pushed, hence using\n  it with push.default set to matching or with multiple push\n  destinations configured with remote.*.push may overwrite refs other\n  than the current branch (including local refs that are strictly behind\n  their remote counterpart). To force a push to only one branch, use a +\n  in front of the refspec to push (e.g git push origin +master to force\n  a push to the master branch).On a branch I was able to do it like this (for the last 4 commits)A lot of problems can be avoided by only creating a branch to work on & not working on master:git checkout -b mybranchThe following works for remote commits already pushed & a mixture of remote pushed commits / local only commits:I also have some pull request notes which may be helpful.
