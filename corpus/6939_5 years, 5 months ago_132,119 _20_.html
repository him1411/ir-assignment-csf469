s is \'E\', but what I want is "123"Please tell me how can I get "123".And in Java, I can do in this way: how can I concat two strings in Go?Use the strconv package\'s Itoa function.For example:You can concat strings simply by +\'ing them, or by using the Join function of the strings package.If you know the specific type of value use the corresponding formatter for example %d for int More info - fmtYou can use fmt.SprintfSee http://play.golang.org/p/bXb1vjYbyc for example.It is interesting to note that strconv.Itoa is shorthand for with base 10For Example:is equivalent tofmt.Sprintf, strconv.Itoa and strconv.FormatInt will do the job. But Sprintf will use the package reflect, and it will allocate one more object,  so it\'s not a good choice.In this case both strconv and fmt.Sprintf do the same job but using the strconv package\'s Itoa function is the best choice, because fmt.Sprintf allocate one more object during conversion. \ncheck the benchmark here: https://gist.github.com/evalphobia/caee1602969a640a4530see https://play.golang.org/p/hlaz_rMa0D for example.
