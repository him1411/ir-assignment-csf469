I have a SQL Server database of organizations, and there are many duplicate rows. I want to run a select statement to grab all of these and the amount of dupes, but also return the ids that are associated with each organization.A statement like:  Will return something likeBut I\'d also like to grab the IDs of them. Is there any way to do this? Maybe like a The reason being that there is also a separate table of users that link to these organizations, and I would like to unify them (therefore remove dupes so the users link to the same organization instead of dupe orgs). But I would like part manually so I don\'t screw anything up, but I would still need a statement returning the IDs of all the dupe orgs so I can go through the list of users.Any help would be greatly appreciated.You can run the following query and find the duplicates with max(id) and delete those rows.But you\'ll have to run this query a few times.You can do it like this:If you want to return just the records that can be deleted (leaving one of each), you can use:Edit: SQL Server 2000 doesn\'t have the ROW_NUMBER() function. Instead, you can use:The solution marked as correct didn\'t work for me, but I found this answer that worked just great: Get list of duplicate rows in MySqlYou can try this , it is best for you So the records with rowum> 1 will be the duplicate records in your table. \xe2\x80\x98Partition by\xe2\x80\x99 first group by the records and then serialize them by giving them serial nos.\nSo rownum> 1 will be the duplicate records which could be deleted as such.Src : https://stackoverflow.com/a/59242/1465252You have several way for Select duplicate rows.for my solutions , first consider this table for exampleFirst solution :Secound solution : Use identity fieldand end of all solution use this commandIf you want to delete duplicates:i think i know what you need\ni needed to mix between the answers and i think i got the solution he wanted:having the max id will give you the id of the dublicate and the one of the original which is what he asked for: only sad thing you get it put out in this formhope it still helpsFor finding duplicate Record \n1)Using CTE2)By Using GroupByTry
