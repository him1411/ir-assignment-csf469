Is there a quick way to set an HTML text input (<input type=text />) to only allow numeric keystrokes (plus \'.\')?JavaScript\n(the most reliable still)While this is simple, it will not let you use combination keys and other non typeable keys. For a more complete JavaScript solution that also supports input of type number and max length validation, consider using this Polyfill.HTML 5\n(does not require JavaScript, and also does not behave in standard way in many modern browsers.)<input type="number">Try input type=number to see the HTML5 version in action.jQueryMore complex validation optionsIf you want to do some other validation bits and pieces, this could be handy:http://www.javascript-coder.com/html-form/javascript-form-validation.phtml\nhttps://github.com/lockevn/html-numeric-inputBut don\'t forget you still must do server side validation!for AZERTY keyboard:jQueryUse this DOMAnd this scriptI\'ve searched long and hard for a good answer to this, and we desperately need <input type="number", but short of that, these 2 are the most concise ways I could come up with:If you dislike the non-accepted character showing for a split-second before being erased, the method below is my solution.  Note the numerous additional conditions, this is to avoid disabling all sorts of navigation and hotkeys.  If anyone knows how to compactify this, let us know!HTML5 has <input type=number>, which sounds right for you. Currently, only Opera supports it natively, but there is a project that has a JavaScript implementation.And one more example, which works great for me: Also attach to keypress eventAnd HTML:Here is a jsFiddle exampleI opted to use a combination of the two answers mentioned here i.e.<input type="number" />and <input type="text" onkeypress="return isNumberKey(event);">Most answers here all have the weakness of using key- events. Many of the answers would limit your ability to do text selection with keyboard macros, copy+paste and more unwanted behavior, others seem to depend on specific jQuery plugins, which is killing flies with machineguns. This simple solution seems to work best for me cross platform, regardless of input mechanism (keystroke, copy+paste, rightclick copy+paste, speech-to-text etc.). All text selection keyboard macros would still work, and it would even limit ones ability to set a non-numeric value by script.HTML5 supports regexes, so you could use this:Warning:  Some browsers don\'t support this yet.So simple....// In a JavaScript function (can use HTML or PHP).In your form input:With input max. (These above allows for a 12-digit number)2 solutions:Use a form validator (for example with jQuery validation plugin)Do a check during the onblur (i.e. when the user leaves the field) event of the input field, with the regular expression:JavaScriptadditional you could add comma, period and minus (,.-) HTMLHere is a simple one which allows for exactly one decimal, but no more:You can use pattern for this:Here you can see the complete mobile website interface tips.A short and sweet implementation using jQuery and replace() instead of looking at event.keyCode or event.which:Only small side effect that the typed letter appears momentarily and CTRL/CMD + A seems to behave a bit strange.If you want to suggest to the device (maybe a mobile phone) between alpha or numeric you can use <input type="number">.A safer approach is checking the value of the input, instead of hijacking keypresses and trying to filter keyCodes.This way the user is free to use keyboard arrows, modifier keys, backspace, delete, use non standard keyboars, use mouse to paste, use drag and drop text, even use accessibility inputs.The below script allows positive and negative numbersEDIT: I removed my old answer because I think it is antiquated now.Just an other variant with jQuery using                 input type="number" is an HTML5 attribute.In the other case this will help you:You can also compare input value (which is treated as string by default) to itself forced as numeric, like: However, you need to bind that to event like keyup etc.Please find below mentioned solution. In this user can be able to enter only numeric value, Also user can not be able to copy, paste, drag and drop in input. Allowed CharactersNot allowed Characters and Characters through eventsLet me know if it not works.This is the extended version of geowa4\'s solution. Supports min and max attributes. If the number is out of range, the previous value will be shown.You can test it here.Usage: <input type=text class=\'number\' maxlength=3 min=1 max=500>If the inputs are dynamic use this:JavaScript code:HTML code:works perfectly because the backspace keycode is 8 and a regex expression doesn\'t let it, so it\'s an easy way to bypass the bug :)You can replace the Shurok function with:The best way (allow ALL type of numbers - real negative, real positive, iinteger negative, integer positive) is:Code bellow will also check for PASTE event.\nUncomment "ruleSetArr_4" and add(concate) to "ruleSetArr" to allow FLOAT numbers.\nEasy copy/paste function. Call it with your input element in parameter.\nExample: inputIntTypeOnly($(\'input[name="inputName"]\'))Give the input field a class (<input class="digit" ...> ) and use jquery as below .Above code also works to disable special characters in Ctrl+V strokes and right click strokes also.My solution for a better user experience:HTMLjQueryDetails:First of all, input types:number shows up/down arrows shrinking the actual input space, I find them ugly and are only useful if the number represents a quantity (things like phones, area codes, IDs... don\'t need them)\ntel provides similar browser validations of number without arrowsUsing [number / tel] also helps showing numeric keyboard on mobile devices.For the JS validation I ended up needing 2 functions, one for the normal user input (keypress) and the other for a copy+paste fix (change), other combinations would give me a terrible user experience.I use the more reliable KeyboardEvent.key instead of the now deprecated KeyboardEvent.charCodeAnd depending of your browser support you can consider using Array.prototype.includes() instead of the poorly named Array.prototype.indexOf() (for true / false results)Use this DOM:And this script:...OR this script, without indexOf, using two for\'s...I used the onkeydown attribute instead of onkeypress, because the onkeydown attribute is checked before onkeypress attribute. The problem would be in the Google Chrome browser.With the attribute "onkeypress", TAB would be uncontrollable with "preventDefault" on google chrome, however, with the attribute "onkeydown", TAB becomes controllable!ASCII Code for TAB => 9The first script have less code than the second, however, the array of ASCII characters must have all the keys.The second script is much bigger than the first, but the array does not need all keys. The first digit in each position of the array is the number of times each position will be read. For each reading, will be incremented 1 to the next one. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\nNCount = 048 + NCount = 48NCount + +48 + NCount = 49NCount + +...48 + NCount = 57\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of numerical keys are only 10 (0 - 9), but if they were 1 million it would not make sense to create an array with all these keys.ASCII codes:
