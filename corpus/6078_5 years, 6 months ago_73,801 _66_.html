New version of ADT r17 plugin for Eclipse added feature to automatically setup JAR dependencies. Any .jar files in the /libs folder are added to the build configuration now. Unfortunately Android Dependencies classpath container is non modifiable.How can i attach javadoc and sources to the automatically inserted .jar (from /libs folder)?The best way to answer your question is to summarize the answers from Xavier, plastiv, VinceFR and Christopher.In order to link the sources and javadoc to a .jar library that is automatically linked by Eclipse you have to do the following:The example uses the Gson library.You can of course move the javadoc and sources .jar into other folders and specify relative paths. That\'s up to you. Placing the source and javadoc jars directly into the lib folder is possible but not recommended, as that causes documentation and source code to be included in your application.\nScreenshot of the Eclipse JavaDoc panel:Screenshot of an Eclipse project using Gson with Android 4.2.2.:In case you want to reference javadocs which are not provided as a packed .jar but simply as files and folders as asked by android developer in the comments do the following:Create a .properties file with the following content:Add the javadocs folders to the libs/ folder.You should come up with the following folder structure:Do not forget to close and re-open the Eclipse project as mentioned above!\nHere is a screenshot of a working example project referencing the GoogleAdMobAds Android library.On windows you have to escape the backslash for references to doc and src paths in the properties file. Example, for \nandroid-support-v4.jar the properties file content is something like:An answer come from http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=27490#c21In your libs folder, you must have:And in your foo.jar.properties, just put doc=./doc/foo_docMaybe you will have to refresh your project, to clean it, to close it and to reopen it.It works for me!I tried all of the above and none of them worked for me.  I figured out a method that will always work.  Basically, the culprit is the way that the ADT treats the "libs" folder so I quit using the "libs" folder.  Instead I created a "libraries" folder and used it.You can do the following and it will always work - even if the ADT should change how it changes how it deals with the "libs" folder in the future:By following the above procedure your project will have folders that look like this: Your Java Build Path will look something like this:In Order and Export the libraries are ticked:For now, move the library you want Javadoc to lib. Them add that library to the Build Path and add the Javadoc.Check this comment in the android issues.On ADT 22 I could not access Javadoc for both commons-io-2.4.jar and android-support-v4.jarThis is the way I fixed it:Precondition: both libraries are listed under "Referenced Libraries".Right click on commons-io-2.4.jar and select Properties. This window appears: commons-io-2.4.jar is bundled with commons-io-2.4-javadoc.jar, so I specified the Javadoc in archive External file path.I did the same thing for the support library: right click on android-support-v4.jar and select Properties. This screen appears:This time I specied the path to the source directory.The library reference to commons-io-2.0.1.jar was broken when I upgraded to SDK Tools and ADT revision 17.To resolve the problem I used Project -> Properties - > Java Build Path and I selected the Libraries tab. I deleted any reference to commons-io-2.0.1.jar and then used Add Jar to re-add commons-io-2.0.1.jar to the project. Then I click the \xe2\x80\x98>\xe2\x80\x99 arrow next to the library name to expand the library reference and I used the edit buttons to set the Source attachment and the Javadoc location.Sorry I can\'t post an image as I don\'t have enough rep (please...).Seems to be a moving target but, after having collected bits and pieces from many places (including answers to this very question that helped but failed to describe all necessary details, or maybe the system had changed slightly in the meantime), this seems to be the solution, at least as of now (August 28, 2013).doc=d:\\\\Android\\\\javadoc\\\\libGoogleAnalyticsServicesFailing to observe any of these steps (not unzipping the javadoc, referencing a file instead of a folder, etc) seems to break it.I know this question is rather old, but when I was facing the same problem yesterday and the solution posted above was way too annoying for me, I found out that one can easily add a source path definition to the .classpath file of the project. Eclipse will then adapt it and you\'re able to browse through the source. classpath entry before:After adding the path to the sourceHope this helpsjust update the ADT plugin. That worked for me!!Hope that helps!For any given jar, if you would like to see the Javadoc help on the tooltip while coding, do the following:\nRight click your project > Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries Tab. Click the arrow next to your jar to expand. Source attachment should point to the location of the actual jar (probably right in your java folder). Javadoc location: You have two choices here: URL and archive. If your javadocs for this jar are in the form of a folder containing an index.html file at the first level, choose \'Javadoc URL\' and point to that folder. \nIf your javadocs are in a jar, choose \'Javadoc in archive\' and point to the jar.\nDon\'t forget to restart your workspace/close and reopen your project to update the tooltip with the Javadoc info.I hope this helps give a simple answer for what I believe should be a very simple task.My solucion:Download an eclipse plugin called: "Java Source Attacher Feature".Later, select a jar and attach the source code using this plugin. Click in the jar file to select it, right buttom on the mouse, and then select "attach java source".When you have the source code you have automatically the javadoc.Now you can use F2 over the classes to view the asociated javadoc.Enjoy
