I\'m using Bootstrap and the following doesn\'t work:You are using Bootstrap which means you are using jQuery :^), so one way to do it is:Of course you don\'t have to use href or switch locations, you can do whatever you like in the click handler function. Read up on jQuery and how to write handlers; Advantage of using a class over id is that you can apply the solution to multiple rows:and your code base doesn\'t change. The same handler would take care of all the rows.You can use Bootstrap jQuery callbacks like this (in a document.ready callback):This has the advantage of not being reset upon table sorting (which happens with the other option).Since this was posted window.document.location is obsolete (or deprecated at the very least) use window.location instead.You can\'t do that. It is invalid HTML. You can\'t put a <a> in between a <tbody> and a <tr>. Try this instead:When you work up to it, you\'d want to use JavaScript to assign the click handler outside of the HTML.You could include an anchor inside every <td>, like so:You could then use display:block; on the anchors to make the full row clickable.Example jsFiddle here.This is probably about as optimum as you\'re going to get it unless you resort to JavaScript.Yes, but not with the standard <table> elements. If you use the display: table style properties, you can. Here and here are some fiddles to demonstrate. This code should do the trick:You can use onclick javascript method in tr and make it clickable, also if you need to build your link due to some details you can declare a function in javascript and call it in onclick, passing some values.You can use this bootstrap component:http://jasny.github.io/bootstrap/javascript/#rowlinkThe missing components for your favorite front-end framework.Add class .rowlink and attribute data-link="row" to a <table> or <tbody> element. For other options append the name to data-, as in data-target="a.mainlink" A cell can be excluded by adding the .rowlink-skip class to the <td>.Call the input mask via javascript:Another option using an <a>, CSS positions and some jQuery or JS:HTML: CSS:Then you need to give the  a width, using for example jQuery:Here is a way by putting a transparent A element over the table rows. Advantages are:Disadvantages:The table stays as is:Add the links (for each row) via jQuery JavaScript by inserting an A element into each first column and setting the needed properties:The width and height setting can be tricky, if many paddings and margins are used, but in general a few pixels off should not even matter.Live demo here: http://jsfiddle.net/qo0dx0oo/ (works in Firefox, but not IE or Chrome, there the link is positioned wrong)Fixed for Chrome and IE (still works in FF too): http://jsfiddle.net/qo0dx0oo/2/This code bellow will make your whole table clickable. Clicking the links in this example will show the link in an alert dialog instead of following the link.The HTML:Here\'s the HTML behind the above example:The CSSAnd the CSS:The jQueryAnd finally the jQuery which makes the magic happen:What it does is when a row is clicked, a search is done for the href belonging to an anchor. If one is found, the window\'s location is set to that href.I know someone has written pretty much the same already, however my way is the correct way (div cannot be child of A) and also it\'s better to use classes.You can imitate a table using CSS and make an A element the rowcss:You could give the row an id, e.g. <tr id="special"> ... </tr>and then use jquery to say something like:$(\'#special\').onclick(function(){ window="http://urltolinkto.com/x/y/z";})You can add the button role to a table row and Bootstrap will change the cursor without any css changes. I decided to use that role as a way to easily make any row clickable with very little code.HtmljQueryYou can apply this same principle to add the button role to any tag.There is a nice way to technically do it with <a> tag inside <tr>, which might be semantically incorrect (might give you a browser warning), but will work with no JavaScript/jQuery required:PS: Notice the trick here is to put <a> tag as last element, otherwise it will try to take the space of the first <td> cell.PPS: Now your entire row will be clickable and you can use this link to open in new tab as well (Ctrl/CMD+click)Here is another way...The HTML:The jQuery:Why should we don\'t use "div" tags....
