How do you create a simple, custom rule using the jQuery Validate plugin (using addMethod) that doesn\'t use a regex?For example, what function would create a rule that validates only if at least one of a group of checkboxes is checked?You can create a simple rule by doing something like this:And then applying this like so:Just change the contents of the \'addMethod\' to validate your checkboxes.Thanks, it worked!Here\'s the final code:You are able to create a custom rule and attach it to an element using the data attribute using the syntax data-rule-rulename="true";So to check if at least one of a group of checkboxes is checked:data-rule-oneormorecheckedaddMethodAnd you can also override the message of a rule (ie: Atleast 1 must be selected) by using the syntax  data-msg-rulename="my new message".NOTEIf you use the data-rule-rulename method then you will need to make sure the rule name is all lowercase. This is because the jQuery validation function dataRules applies .toLowerCase() to compare and the HTML5 spec does not allow uppercase.Working ExampleYou can add a custom rule like this: And use it like this: Hope this helps
