What\'s the simplest way to count the number of occurrences of a character in a string?e.g. count the number of times \'a\' appears in \'Mary had a little lamb\'str.count(sub[, start[, end]])Return the number of non-overlapping occurrences of substring sub in the range [start, end]. Optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation.You can use count() :As other answers said, using the string method count() is probably the simplest, but if you\'re doing this frequently, check out collections.Counter:Regular expressions maybe?more info hereRegular expressions are very useful if you want case-insensitivity (and of course all the power of regex).Be aware that the regex version takes on the order of ten times as long to run, which will likely be an issue only if my_string is tremendously long, or the code is inside a deep loop.str.count(a) is the best solution to count a single character in a string. But if you need to count more characters than one you would have to read the string as many times as characters you want to count.A better approach for this job would be:So you\'ll have a dict that returns the number of ocurrences of every letter in the string and 0 if it isn\'t present.No more than this IMHO - you can add the upper or lower methodsThis will give you the occurrence of each characters in a string. O/P is also in string format:count is definitely the most concise and efficient way of counting the occurrence of a character in a string but I tried to come up with a solution using lambda, something like this :This will result in :Also, there is one more advantage to this is if the sentence is a list of sub-strings containing same characters as above, then also this gives the correct result because of the use of in. Have a look :This also results in :But Of-course this will work only when checking occurrence of single character such as \'a\' in this particular case.
