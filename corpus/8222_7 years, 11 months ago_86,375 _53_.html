How do I use Notepad++ (or any other editor besides vim) with msysgit?I tried all of the following to no avail:Update 2010-2011:zumalifeguard\'s solution (upvoted) is simpler than the original one, as it doesn\'t need anymore a shell wrapper script.As I explain in "How can I set up an editor to work with Git on Windows?", I prefer a wrapper, as it is easier to try and switch editors, or change the path of one editor, without having to register said change with a git config again.\nBut that is just me.Additional information: the following solution works with Cygwin, while the zuamlifeguard\'s solution does not.Original answer.The following:does work. Those commands are interpreted as shell script, hence the idea to wrap any windows set of commands in a sh script.\n(As Franky comments: "Remember to save your .sh file with Unix style line endings or receive mysterious error messages!")More details on the SO question How can I set up an editor to work with Git on Windows?Note the \'-multiInst\' option, for ensuring a new instance of notepad++ for each call from Git.Note also that, if you are using Git on Cygwin (and want to use Notepad++ from Cygwin), then scphantm explains in "using Notepad++ for Git inside Cygwin" that you must be aware that:git is passing it a cygwin path and npp doesn\'t know what to do with itSo the script in that case would be:Multiple lines for readability:With "$(cygpath -w "$*")" being the important part here.Val commented (and then deleted) that you should not use -notabbar option:It makes no good to disable the tab during rebase, but makes a lot of harm to general Notepad usability since -notab becomes the default setting and you must Settings>Preferences>General>TabBar> Hide>uncheck every time you start notepad after rebase. This is hell. You recommended the hell.So use rather:That is:If you want to place the script \'npp.sh\' in a path with spaces (as in\n\'c:\\program files\\...\',), you have three options:Either try to quote the path (single or double quotes), as in:or try the shortname notation (not fool-proofed):or (my favorite) place \'npp.sh\' in a directory part of your %PATH% environment variable. You would not have then to specify any path for the script.Steiny reports in the comments having to do:Or, for 64-bit Windows and a 32-bit install of Notepad++:Or, the following can be issued on the command line on either 32-bit or 64-bit Windows.  It will pull the location of notepad++.exe from the registry and configure git to use it automatically:If you wish to place the above from a .BAT or .CMD file, you must replace %A with %%A and %B with %%BThis works for meI use the approach with PATH variable. Path to Notepad++ is added to system\'s PATH variable and then core.editor is set like following:Also, you may add some additional parameters for Notepad++:(as I detailed in "Git core.editor for Windows")And here you can find some options you may use when stating Notepad++ Command Line Options.UPDATE 2015If you unpack/install Notepad++ into c:\\utils\\npp\\ and rename notepad++.exe to npp.exe for simplicity, then all you have to do isNo wrapper scripts or other trickery. No need to have Notepad++ in PATH.Follow these instructions,First make sure you have notepad++ installed on your system and that it is the default programme to open .txt files.Then Install gitpad on your system. Note the last I checked the download link was broken, so download it from here as explained.Then while committing you should see your favorite text editor popping up.I used starikovs\' solution. I started with a bash window and gave the commandsThen I found the .bashrc file in windows explorer, opened it with notepad++ and addedso that bash knows where to find Notepad++. (Having Notepad++ in the bash PATH is a useful thing on its own!) Then I pasted his lineinto a bash window. I started a new bash window for a git repository to test things with the commandand the file opened in Notepad++ as hoped.Here is a solution with Cygwin:If no path, pass no pathIf path is empty, pass empty pathIf path is not empty, convert to Windows format.Then I set these variables:EDITOR allows script to work with GitGIT_EDITOR allows script to work with Hub commandsSource
