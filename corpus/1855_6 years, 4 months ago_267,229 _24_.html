How can I use the @link tag to link to a method?I want to changetobut I don\'t know how to format the @link tag correctly.You will find much information about JavaDoc at the JavaDoc Tool reference page, including the information on the {@link package.class#member  label}tag (that you are looking for):For example, here is a comment that refers to the getComponentAt(int, int) method:Use the {@link #getComponentAt(int, int) getComponentAt} method.Other useful links about JavaDoc are:The general format, from the @link section of the javadoc documentation, is:Method in the same class:Method in a different class, either in the same package or imported:Method in a different package and not imported:Label linked to method, in plain text rather than code font:A chain of method calls, as in your question. We have to specify labels for the links to methods outside this class, or we get getFoo().Foo.getBar().Bar.getBaz(). But these labels can be fragile; see "Labels" below.Automated refactoring may not affect labels. This includes renaming the method, class or package; and changing the method signature.Therefore, provide a label only if you want different text than the default. For example, you might link from human language to code:Or you might link from a code sample with text different than the default, as shown above under "A chain of method calls." However, this can be fragile while APIs are evolving. If the method signature includes parameterized types, use the erasure of those types in the javadoc @link. For example:you can use @see to do that:sample:
