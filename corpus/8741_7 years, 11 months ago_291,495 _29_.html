Is there a way to grab the columns name of a table in mysql?\nusing phpYou can use DESCRIBE:Or in newer versions you can use INFORMATION_SCHEMA:Or you can use SHOW COLUMNS:The following SQL statements are nearly equivalent:Reference: INFORMATION_SCHEMA COLUMNSI made a PDO function which returns all the column names in an simple array.The output will be an array:Sorry for the necro but I like my function ;)P.S. I have not included the class Core but you can use your own class.. D.S.How about this:This solution is from command line mysqlIn below query just change <--DATABASE_NAME--> to your database and <--TABLENAME--> to your table name where you just want Field values of DESCRIBE statementYou may also want to check out mysql_fetch_array(), as in:It\'s also interesting to note that you can use\nEXPLAIN table_name which is synonymous with DESCRIBLE table_name and SHOW COLUMS FROM table_name\nalthough EXPLAIN is more commonly used to obtain information about the query execution plan.Look into:The MySQL function\ndescribe table\nshould get you where you want to go (put your table name in for "table").  You\'ll have to parse the output some, but it\'s pretty easy.  As I recall, if you execute that query, the PHP query result accessing functions that would normally give you a key-value pair will have the column names as the keys.  But it\'s been a while since I used PHP so don\'t hold me to that. :)There\'s also this if you prefer:The mysql_list_fields function might interest you ; but, as the manual states :This function is deprecated. It is\n  preferable to use mysql_query() to\n  issue a SQL SHOW COLUMNS FROM table [LIKE \'name\'] statement instead.this worked for me..you can get the entire table structure using following simple command.or you can use following query.in mysql to get columns details and table structure by following keywords or queries1.DESC table_name2.DESCRIBE table_name3.SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name4.SHOW create table table_name;5.EXPLAIN table_name
