I have some jQuery JavaScript code that I want to run only when there is a hash (#) anchor link in a URL. How can you check for this character using JavaScript? I need a simple catch-all test that would detect URLs like these:Basically something along the lines of:If anyone could point me in the right direction, that would be much appreciated.Simple:Put the following:If the URI is not the document\'s location this snippet will do what you want.Have you tried this?(Where url is the URL you want to check, obviously.)This will solve the problem ;)will return the hash identifier...or there\'s a jquery selector:Here\'s what you can do to periodically check for a change of hash, and then call a function to process the hash value.Most people are aware of the URL properties in document.location. That\'s great if you\'re only interested in the current page. But the question was about being able to parse anchors on a page not the page itself.What most people seem to miss is that those same URL properties are also available to anchor elements:Partridge and Gareths comments above are great. They deserve a separate answer. \nApparently, hash and search properties are available on any html Link object:OrShould you need this on a regular string variable and happen to have jQuery around,\nthis should work:(but its maybe a bit overdone .. )Throwing this in here as a method for abstracting location properties from arbitrary URI-like strings. Although window.location instanceof Location is true, any attempt to invoke Location will tell you that it\'s an illegal constructor. You can still get to things like hash, query, protocol etc by setting your string as the href property of a DOM anchor element, which will then share all the address properties with window.location.Simplest way of doing this is:For convenience, I wrote a little library that utilises this to replace the native Location constructor with one that will take strings and produce window.location-like objects: Location.jsUsually clicks go first than location changes,\nso after a click is a good idea to setTimeOut\nto get updated window.location.hashor you can listen location with:I wrote a jQuery plugin that does something like\nwhat you want to do.It\'s a simple anchor router.Here is a simple function that returns true or false (has / doesn\'t have a hashtag):Returns true in this case.Based on @jon-skeet\'s comment.sometimes you get the full query string such as "#anchorlink?firstname=mark"this is my script to get the hash value:
