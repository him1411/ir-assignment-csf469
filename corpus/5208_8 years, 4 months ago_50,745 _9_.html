What does @private mean in Objective-C?It\'s a visibility modifier\xe2\x80\x94it means that instance variables declared as @private can only be accessed by instances of the same class. Private members cannot be accessed by subclasses or other classes.For example:Also, to clarify, methods are always public in Objective-C. There are ways of "hiding" method declarations, though\xe2\x80\x94see this question for more information.As htw said, it\'s a visibility modifier.  @private means that the ivar (instance variable) can only be accessed directly from within an instance of that same class.  However, that may not mean much to you, so let me give you an example.  We\'ll use the init methods of the classes as examples, for simplicity\'s sake.  I\'ll comment inline to point out items of interest.So to answer your question, @private protects ivars from access by an instance of any other class.  Note that two instances of MyFirstClass could access all of each other\'s ivars directly; it is assumed that since the programmer has complete control over this class directly, he will use this ability wisely.It important to understand what it means when somebody says that you can\'t access a @private instance variable.  The real story is that the compiler will give you an error if you attempt to access these variables in your source code.  In previous versions of GCC and XCode, you would just get a warning instead of an error.Either way, at run time, all bets are off.  These @private and @protected ivars can be accessed by an object of any class.  These visibility modifiers just make it difficult to compile the source code into machine code that violates the intent of the visibility modifiers.  Do not rely on ivar visibility modifiers for security! They provide none at all. They are strictly for compile-time enforcement of the class-builder\'s wishes.
