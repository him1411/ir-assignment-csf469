Update: A sample project reproducing this bug can be found here at Microsoft Connect. I have also tested and verified that the solution given in the accepted answer below works on that sample project. If this solution doesn\'t work for you, you are probably having a different issue (which belongs in a separate question).This is a question asked before, both here on Stack Overflow and other places, but none of the suggestions I\'ve found this far has helped me, so I just have to try asking a new question.Scenario: I have a simple Windows Forms application (C#, .NET 4.0, Visual Studio 2010). It has a couple of base forms that most other forms inherit from, it uses Entity Framework (and POCO classes) for database access. Nothing fancy, no multi-threading or anything.Problem: All was fine for a while. Then, all out of the blue, Visual Studio failed to build when I was about to launch the application. I got the warning "Unable to delete file \'...bin\\Debug\\[ProjectName].exe\'. Access to the path \'...bin\\Debug\\[ProjectName].exe\' is denied." and the error "Unable to copy file \'obj\\x86\\Debug\\[ProjectName].exe\' to \'bin\\Debug\\[ProjectName].exe\'. The process cannot access the file \'bin\\Debug\\[ProjectName].exe\' because it is being used by another process." (I get both the warning and the error when running Rebuild, but only the error when running Build - don\'t think that is relevant?)I understand perfectly fine what the warning and error message says: Visual Studio is obviously trying to overwrite the exe-file while it the same time has a lock on it for some reason. However, this doesn\'t help me find a solution to the problem... The only thing I\'ve found working is to shut down Visual Studio and start it again. Building and launching then works, untill I make a change in some of the forms, then I have the same problem again and have to restart... Quite frustrating!As I mentioned above, this seems to be a known problem, so there are lots of suggested solutions. I\'ll just list what I\'ve already tried here, so people know what to skip:Adding the following to the following to the project\'s pre-build event:Adding the following to the project properties (.csproj file):However, none of them worked for me, so you can probably see why I\'m starting to get a bit frustrated. I don\'t know where else to look, so I hope somebody has something to give me! Is this a bug in VS, and if so is there a patch? Or has I done something wrong, do I have a circular reference or similar, and if so how could I find out?Any suggestions are highly appreciated :)Update: As mentioned in comment below, I\'ve also checked using Process Explorer that it actually is Visual Studio that is locking the file.This is going to sound stupid, but I tried all these solutions, running VS2010 on Windows 7. None of them worked except the renaming and building, which was VERY tedious to say the least. Eventually, I tracked down the culprit, and I find it hard to believe. But I was using the following code in AssemblyInfo.cs...This is pretty common, but for some reason, changing the version to 2.0.0.0 made things work again. I don\'t know if it\'s a Windows 7 specific thing (I\'ve only been using it for 3-4 weeks), or if it\'s random, or what, but it fixed it for me. I\'m guessing that VS was keeping a handle on each file it generated, so it would know how to increment things? I\'m really not sure and have never seen this happen before. But if someone else out there is also pulling their hair out, give it a try.Since I haven\'t gotten any more feedback on this issue, I thought I\'d just share what ended up being my solution:As suggested by Barry in a comment to the original post, manually renaming the \'...bin\\Debug[ProjectName].exe\' to something else (e.g. \'[ProjectName]1.exe\') is one work-around (I\'m however not allowed to delete the file myself, and I must say I find that a bit weird as one would believe the same lock preventing deletion would also prevent renaming...). It\'s not a good solution, but it\'s reasonable fast (at least after you\'ve done it a couple of times, it almost becomes a routine), and at least way faster than restarting Visual Studio which is what I did in the beginning.In case somebody wonders, I could also add that I only see this problem semi-randomly. It usually happens after I\'ve done some changes in the design mode of a form (but not always). It usually doesn\'t happen if I only change business-logic code or non-visual related code (but sometimes it does...). Frustrating indeed, but at least I have a hack that works for me - let\'s just hope that my next project doesn\'t face this problem as well...@Barry: if you would like to get credit for your comment, please feel free to post it as an answer and I\'ll make sure to accept it :)I found one simple solution, just disable the Windows Indexing Services for the project folder and subfoldersI have the same problem (MSB3021) with WPF project in VS2008 (on Windows 7 x32).\nThe problem appearing if i try to re-run application too quick after previous run.\nAfter a few minutes exe-file unlocked by itself and i can re-run application again. But such a long pause angers me.\nThe only thing that really helped me was running VS as Administrator.When I have come across this problem it is to do with the Fact that the project I am trying to  build is set as the Startup project in the solution making the .exe in the obj folder locked ( it also appears in your task manager,) right click another project in your solution and choose set startup project. This will release the lock, remove it from task manager and should let you build.I tried all the other suggestions in the answers here, none of which worked. Eventually I used Process Monitor to discover that my .exe that VS2010 was failing to build was locked by the System process (PID=4). Searching SO for situations involving this yielded this answer.Summarised: if you have the Application Experience service disabled (as I did) then re-enable and start it. Two years of aggravation ended.I also had a problem very similar to this and found the reason in my case was that I had made the bin\\debug folder available as a shared folder under VMware and either VMware, Explorer under the VM guest, or maybe even an anti-virus program under the guest (though I don\'t think I had one installed) was holding a handle to the file(s).IF YOUR PROBLEM IS NOT SOLVED YET:Visual studio\'s error is :"The process cannot access the file \'bin\\Debug**app.exe**\' because it is being used by another process."So ,go to task manager of windows(Ctrl+Shift+Esc),find your application (for example app.exe)\n then force it to close by Endprocces.Disable "Enable the Visual Studio hosting process"\nUsing Visual Studio I could never come up with a simple project to reproduce the error.My solution was to disable the Visual Studio Hosting process.For those interested I have attached a handle trace for the offending handle:Here\'s another possibility:After receiving this error in vs2012 / win7, I went and tried to delete the file in the bin directory and explorer indicated that the file was in use by the XAML UI Designer.I closed all the tabs I had open in VS, closed VS, then made sure to kill all MSBuild processes in taskmanager. Finally, after restarting VS I was able to build the solution.and another possible cause:I have noticed another possible cause for this issue. After doing some code refactoring, moving projects in and out of a solution, my project references were no longer referencing the projects in the solution as expected.This mislead visual studio to think it could build some projects concurrently, thus creating the file locks.EDIT: I have had this happen on a few occasions even recently with VS2012 and it does fix it once I set the build order to the correct dependencies, kill any msbuild processes that VS left running, and then restart VS. I kill the msbuild processes just to be sure, but closing VS should kill them off too.What I usually do to cause this is refactor a project such that it relies on another project within the solution that it wasn\'t referencing on last build. This sometimes seem to confuse VS and it doesn\'t update the build order.To check build order: Right-click the Solution in the Solution Explorer and select "Project Build Order..." and verify that dependencies are properly noted for each project.Restart IIS- could be a process attached to the debuggerDisable antivirus and try.\nI was also facing that problem... but in my case antivirus was blocking my application when I disabled antivirus it resolved.I faced the same error.I solved the problem by deleting all the contents of bin folders of all the dependent projects/libraries.This error mainly happens due to version changes.I\'d suggest download Process Explorer to find out exactly what process is locking the file. It can be found at:http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspxThis has been filed multiple times on Connect, Microsoft\'s community bug reporting site.  FYI, I believe this bug has afflicted Visual Studio since 2003 and has been fixed after RTM each time. :(  One of the references is as follows:https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/568672/handles-to-project-dlls-are-not-released-when-compiling?wa=wsignin1.0This is rather commonly caused by Avast.  I can usually run my projects in Release regardless, but when running in debug it would pretty regularly fail.  I just add an exclusion for my projects folder and the problem seems to go away.  I assume this might also be cause by other antivirus software.Renaming the .exe and .pub file worked for me, but really tedious. I also face the problem that I could not do editing during a debug session. Finally I went to the Advanced Security Setting Page, as per:https://msdn.microsoft.com/query/dev10.query?appId=Dev10IDEF1&l=EN-US&k=k%28%22VS.ERR.DEBUG_IN_ZONE_NO_HOSTPROC%3a11310%22%29;k%28TargetFrameworkMoniker-%22.NETFRAMEWORK%2cVERSION%3dV4.0%22%29&rd=trueI  un-select then re-select the "Enable ClickOnce security settings" checkbox. It\'s been problem free for some days now....For me this was being caused by having a command prompt open in the targeted folder (C:\\users\\username\\source\\repos\\project\\project\\bin\\debug\\app.publish).Not sure why DEBUGGING requires access to the publish folder, but closing the command window solved the issue for me. I tried several solutions that you provided, but occasionally I still receive this error. I am positive that my process is not running, and when i try to delete the executable file with internet explorer it is removed from the file list, but then I press F5 and voila, the file is back. It has not been deleted at all. But if i delete the file through the TotalCommander, the exe file is actually deleted and I can successfully build the project.I am using windows 7 x64 and total commander 7.56a 32 bit. None of the other answers worked for me but closing all open tabs in Visual Studio appears to have solved the problem.I know this is a very old question, but I recently experienced the "cannot copy from obj to bin" error in VS 2012. Every single time I tried to rebuild a certain project, I got the message. The only solution was to do a clean before every rebuild. After much investigating, it turns out I had an incomplete pragma warning statement in one of my files that did not prevent the compilation from succeeding, but was somehow confusing VS into keeping the file(s) locked.In my case, I had the following at the top of the file:That\'s it. I guess I was attempting to do something a while back and got distracted and never finished the process, but the VS warnings about that particular line were lost in the shuffle. Eventually I noticed the warning, removed the line, and rebuild works every time since then.Do the simple things first.Check that part of your solution is not locked by a running process.For instance, I ran "InstallUtil \' on my windows service(which I normally unit test from a console).This locked some of my dlls in the bin folder of the windows service project.\nWhen I did a rebuild I got the exception in this issue.I stopped the windows service, rebuilt and it succeeded.Check Windows Task Manager for your Application, before doing any of the advance steps in this issue.So when you hear footsteps, think horses not zebras! (from medical student friend)When I faced a similar issue, the only thing that seemed to work was:For Windows Services using WCF, I ended the WFC host process and it worked. I hate it when this happens, and it happens randomly at times.My solution has nothing to do with versions, processes being locked, restarting, or deleting files.The problem was actually due to the build failing, and not giving the correct error.\nThe actual problem was a design flaw:After changing the scope of "a" to outside the function, or not using "a" after Task.Factory.StartNew();, I was able to build again.This happened when using VS2012 Update 4 on Windows7x64 sp1.Error message: C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\Microsoft.Common.targets(3390,5):\n  error MSB3030: Could not copy the file "obj\\x86\\Debug\\xxx.exe" because\n  it was not found.I have found with VS2013 I get this error regularly.  Something that seems to work reasonably well is to  perform a Rebuild Solution prior trying to run the application.  I found that performing a CLEAN sometimes works, but the Rebuild Solution seems to work more consistently.I had same problem. It said could not copy from bin\\debug to obj.....When i build web project i found my dll were all in bin folder and not in bin\\debug. During publish vs was looking for files in bin\\debug. So i opened web project file in editor and look for instances of bin\\debug and i found all the dll were mentioned as bin\\debug\\mylibrary.dll. I removed all \\debug from the path and published again. This time vs was able to find all the dll in bin folder and publish succeeded.I have no idea how this path got changed in web project file.I spent more than 5 hours debugging this and finally found solution on my own.This is the right answer.If none of the above works, and you are developing a console application:Try typing any character into Program.cs, then delete it. I have no idea why this works, but it seems to resolve \'Unable to copy\' problem every time.This helps for me after i remove read only flag from bin directory.\nhttp://www.thewindowsclub.com/error-0x80080015-windows-defender-activation-requires-display-name
