I can select all the distinct values in a column in the following ways:But how do I get the row count from that query? Is a subquery required?You can use the DISTINCT keyword within the COUNT aggregate function:This will count only the distinct values for that column.This will give you BOTH the distinct column values and the count of each value.  I usually find that I want to know both pieces of information.Be aware that Count() ignores null values, so if you need to allow for null as its own distinct value you can do something tricky like:you\'ve got to count that distinct col, then give it an alias.An sql sum of column_name\'s unique values and sorted by the frequency:This will give count of distinct group of columns.Count(distinct({fieldname})) is redundantSimply Count({fieldname}) gives you all the distinct values in that table. It will not (as many presume) just give you the Count of the table [i.e. NOT the same as Count(*) from table]
