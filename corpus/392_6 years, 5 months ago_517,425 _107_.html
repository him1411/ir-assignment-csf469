I am modifying a site\'s appearance (CSS modifications) but can\'t see the result on Chrome because of annoying persistent cache. I tried Shift+refresh but it doesn\'t work.How can I disable the cache temporarily or refresh the page in some way that I could see the changes?The Chrome DevTools can disable the cache. F12 or Right-click and Inspect Element to open the DevTools. Now click Network in the toolbar. Finally, check the Disable cache checkbox at the top.Keep in mind, and as a tweet from @ChromiumDev stated, this setting is only active while devtools is open.Clearing the cache is too annoying when you need to clear the cache 30 times an hour.. so I installed a Chrome Extension called Cache Killer that clears the cache on every page load.https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jpfbieopdmepaolggioebjmedmclkbapNow my mock json, javascript, css, html and data refreshes every time on every page load. I never have to worry if I need to clear my cache.There are about 20 cache cleaners for Chrome I found, but this one seemed lightweight and zero effort. In an update, Cache Killer can now stay "always on".Note: I do not know the plugin author in any way.  I just found it useful.Pull up the Chrome developer console by pressing F12 and then (with the console open):Right click (or hold left click) on the reload button at the top of the browser and select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload." This will go beyond "Hard Reload" to empty the cache entirely, ensuring that anything downloaded via javascript or etc. will also avoid using the cache. You don\'t have to mess with settings or anything, it\'s a quick 1-shot solution.There are two more options to disable page caching in Chrome for good:1. Deactivate Chrome Cache in the RegistryOpen Registry (Start -> Command -> Regedit)Search for: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\ChromeHTML\\shell\\open\\commandChange the part after ...chrom.exe" to this value:  \xe2\x80\x93disable-application-cache \xe2\x80\x93media-cache-size=1 \xe2\x80\x93disk-cache-size=1 \xe2\x80\x94 "%1"Example: "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe" -disable-application-cache \xe2\x80\x93media-cache-size=1 \xe2\x80\x93disk-cache-size=1 \xe2\x80\x94 "%1"IMPORTANT: there is a space and a hyphen after ...chrome.exe" leave the path to chrome.exe as it is If you copy the line, be sure to check, if the quotes are actual quotes. 2. Deactivate Chrome cache by changing the shortcut propertiesRight-click on the Chrome icon and select "Properties" in the context menu.\nAdd following value to the path:  \xe2\x80\x93disk-cache-size=1Example:\n"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe" \xe2\x80\x93disk-cache-size=1IMPORTANT: there is a space and a hyphen after ...chrome.exe" leave the path to chrome.exe as it isIn addition to the disable cache option (which you get to via a button in the lower right corner of the developer tools window -- Tools | Developer Tools, or Ctrl + Shift + I), on the network pane of the developer tools you can now right click and choose "Clear Cache" from the popup menu.If you do not wish to edit Chrome\'s settings you may use incognito mode for the same results.In the Canary Channel (and maybe the dev and stable channel will follow along) this is to be found as the second option overall on the left hand-side under the "General" section.In addition to that, there is always the option to switch into Incognito Mode via Ctrl + Shift + N. Even though that unfortunately also ends your session. This is currently on the Preferences tab which is the default. You may need to scroll down. This checkbox gets moved around and has been moved at least a couple times since this question was asked. Last I checked, it was in the middle column at the bottom. If you have it open on a thinner screen and there are 2 columns under Preferences, it may be near the top right. Feel free to update this post if it changes or comment and I\'ll update the post.To be clear, the disable cache checkbox in Chrome (v17 here, but since v15 I believe) is not in the main settings UI. It is in the developer tools settings UI.From the browser window\'s wrench icon menu (prefs menu) choose Tools \xe2\x86\x92 Developer ToolsIn the developer tools UI that appears, click the gear icon at bottom right.Check the \'Disable cache\' checkbox in the Network section.Using Ctrl+Shift+R to refresh was nice but didn\'t get everything I needed.\nstill some things wouldn\'t refresh, such as data stored in js and css.\nfound a solution: a toolbar of google for chrome web developers. After you install the toolbar select options and "reset page".Instead of hitting "F5"\nJust hit:"Ctrl + F5"Disable cache in chrome only works when you have dev tools openUntil the bug is fixed you could use Clear Cache Chrome plugin and you can also set a keyboard shortcut for it.After installing it, right click and go to options:http://j.mp/15ZdA6fCheck Automatically reload active tab after clearing data:http://j.mp/15ZdGLhSelect Everything for Time Period:http://j.mp/15ZdPy7And then you can go to Menu => Tools => Extensions:http://j.mp/15ZehfXClick on keyboard shortcuts at the bottom:http://j.mp/15ZepftAnd set your keyboard shortcut, for example Ctrl + Shift +R:http://j.mp/15Zev6MActually if you don\'t mind using the bandwidth it is more secure for multiple reasons to disable caching and advised by many security sites.Chromium shouldn\'t be arrogant enough to make decisions and enforce settings on users.You can disable the cache on UNIX with --disk-cache-dir=/dev/null.As this is unexpected crashes may happen but if they do then that will clearly point to a more severe bug which should be fixed in any case.This might help someone. I have rigged my Nginx for crazy caching. Thus, disabling cache in network tools and explicitly clearing cache don\'t work.A very simple yet boring workaround is, I just open a new Incognito Tab. Surprisingly it works, all the time!A hard refresh in incognito mode does the trick anytime I wish to reload in the same mode.How about a bookmarklet which changes the page name to prevent the page from cacheing. In Chrome you would create a new bookmark and then paste the code into the URL. Click the bookmark and the page will reload with timestamp to thwart the cache.I just got caught out but not necessarily due to Chrome.I am using jQuery to make AJAX requests. I had the cache attribute set to true in the request:Setting this to false fixed my problem but this is not ideal.I have no idea where this data is saved but I do know that chrome never hit the server for a request.There is a chrome extension available in the chrome web store named Clear Cache.I use it every day and its a very useful tool I think. You can use it as a reload button and can clear the cache and if you like also cookies, locale storage, form data etc. Also you can define on which domain this happens. So can clear all this shit with only the reload button which you anyway have to press - on your chosen domains.Very very nice!You also can define a Keyboard Shortcut for this in the options!Also another way is to start your chrome window in incognito-mode.\nHere the cache also should be completely disabled.One more option for disabling the cache is provided by my 3rd Chrome extension Page Size Inspector that disables the cache exactly the same way as Devtools does.In addition, the extension quickly reports page size, cache usage, network requests and load time of a web page in a convenient way. Plus its open source at Github.Not sure what you are using, but if you are using ASP.Net you can do the following which works like a charm:Basically it will automatically append the Date and Time to the end of the file each time it is ran, meaning since the file name is technically different, you will never have to worry about it getting cached again.How can I disable the cache temporarily or refresh the page in some way that I could see the changes?It\'s unclear which "cache" you\'re referring to. There are several different methods a browser can cache content persistently. Web Storage being one of them, Cache-Control being another.Some browsers also have a Cache, used in conjunction with Service Workers, to create Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) providing offline support.To clear the cache for a PWAto list the names of the cache keys, then run:to delete a cache key by name (i.e., my-site-cache). Then refresh the page.If you see any worker-related errors in the console after refreshing, you may also need to unregister the registered workers:There is a better and quicker way now (Chrome version 59.x.x.): Right-click onto the reload-icon (left of the url-field) and you get a drop-down menu, select the third option: \'empty Cache and Hard reload\'.This option is only available when the developer tools are open.\n(Notice the difference to option 2: \'Hard reload\' -cmd-shift-R). No cache emptying here!Hey if your site is using PHP then place following little PHP snippet at the beginning of your html page :Now everywhere you load resources like CSS- or JS- files in a script or link element you append your generated random value to the request URL after appending \'?\' to the URI via PHP:Thats it! There will be no browser that caches you site anymore - regardless which kind.Of course remove your code before publishing or simply set $rand to an empty string to allow caching again.I have used the other options described above but I find that the best is to add the following parameter to the startup of chrome.exe."C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe" --disk-cache-size=1\n-media-cache=1I find not disabling media cache is a good idea but it is here for completeness sake.In actuality I want an option to completely disable the cache, to use the memory for IO instead of my disk (which would make load time 10x faster too!) but I don\'t think chrome or any browser for that matter has that option yet.Since version 50 (if I remember correctly), the "Disable cache" option was removed from the Devtool Settings. Go to the "Network" tab and there\'s the "Disable cache" option.Chrome\'s Cache killer is by far the best option. Since the store URL to install cache killer is down, you can download the CRX file here:https://www.crx4chrome.com/extensions/jpfbieopdmepaolggioebjmedmclkbap/once the extension file is downloaded, open Chrome -> more tools -> extensions, then drag the CRX file from the File Explorer or your Desktop (depending the location where you downloaded the file) into the chrome window to install the extension.Add this string of code to your  and it should do the trick.
