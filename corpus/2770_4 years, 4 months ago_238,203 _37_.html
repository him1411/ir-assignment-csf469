I am defining a custom filter like so:As you can see the ng-repeat where the filter is being used is nested within another ng-repeatThe filter is defined like this:I\'m getting:Error: Duplicates in a repeater are not allowed. Repeater: comment in item.comments | range:1:2 ngRepeatAction@https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.1.4/anThe solution is actually described here: http://www.anujgakhar.com/2013/06/15/duplicates-in-a-repeater-are-not-allowed-in-angularjs/AngularJS does not allow duplicates in a ng-repeat directive. This means if you are trying to do the following, you will get an error.However, changing the above code slightly to define an index to determine uniqueness as below will get it working again.Official docs are here: https://docs.angularjs.org/error/ngRepeat/dupesFor those who expect JSON and still getting the same error, make sure that you parse your data:What do you intend your "range" filter to do?Here\'s a working sample of what I think you\'re trying to do: http://jsfiddle.net/evictor/hz4Ep/HTML:JS:I was having an issue in my project where I was using ng-repeat track by $index but the products were not getting reflecting when data comes from database. My code is as below:In the above code, product is a separate directive to display the product.But i came to know that $index causes issue when we pass data out from the scope. So the data losses and DOM can not be updated.I found the solution by using product.id as a key in ng-repeat like below:But the above code again fails and throws the below error when more than one product comes with same id:angular.js:11706 Error: [ngRepeat:dupes] Duplicates in a repeater are not allowed. Use \'track by\' expression to specify unique keys. RepeaterSo finally i solved the problem by making dynamic unique key of ng-repeat like below:This solved my problem and hope this will help you in future.If by chance this error happens when working with SharePoint 2010: Rename your .json file extensions and be sure to update your restService path. No additional "track by $index" was required.  Luckily I was forwarded this link to this rationale: .json becomes an important file type in SP2010. SP2010 includes certains webservice endpoints. The location of these files is 14hive\\isapi folder. The extension of these files are .json. That is the reason it gives such a error."cares only that the contents of a json file is json - not its file extension"Once the file extensions are changed, should be all set. My JSON response was like this:So, I used ng-repeat = "item in variables.items"  to display it.Just in case this happens to someone else, I\'m documenting this here, I was getting this error because I mistakenly set the ng-model the same as the ng-repeat array:Instead of:I checked the array and didn\'t have any duplicates, just double check your variables.Duplicates in a repeater are not allowed. Use \'track by\' expression to specify unique keys.Exampletry thisDuplicates in a repeater are not allowed. Use \'track by\' expression to specify unique keys. Repeater: sdetail in mydt, Duplicate key: string: , Duplicate value: I faced this error because i had written wrong database name in my php api part......So this error may also occurs when you are fetching the data from database base, whose name is written incorrect by you.
