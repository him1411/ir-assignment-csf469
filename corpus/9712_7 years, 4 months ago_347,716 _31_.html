I want to use C# to check if a string value contains a word in a string array. For example,How can I check if the string value for \'stringToCheck\' contains a word in the  array?here is how you can do it:UPDATE: May be you are looking for a better solution.. refer to @Anton Gogolev\'s answer below which makes use of LINQ.Here\'s how:This checks if stringToCheck contains any one of substrings from stringArray. If you want to ensure that it contains all the substrings, change Any to All:No need to use LINQJust use linq method:(Sorry cannot add a comment on existing answers as my reputation is <50)Easiest and sample way.Something like this perhaps:Using Linq and method group would be the quickest and more compact way of doing this.I would use Linq but it still can be done through:Try:You can also do the same thing as Anton Gogolev suggests to check if any item in stringArray1 matches any item in stringArray2:And likewise all items in stringArray1 match all items in stringArray2:I use the following in a console application to check for argumentsSimple solution, not required linq anyString.Join(",", array).Contains(Value+",");try this, here the example : To check if the field contains any of the words in the array. To check if the field(someField) contains any of the words in the array.I used a similar method to the IndexOf by Maitrey684 and the foreach loop of Theomax to create this.  (Note: the first 3 "string" lines are just an example of how you could create an array and get it into the proper format).  If you want to compare 2 arrays, they will be semi-colon delimited, but the last value won\'t have one after it.  If you append a semi-colon to the string form of the array (i.e. a;b;c becomes a;b;c;), you can match using "x;" no matter what position it is in:bFound sets to true if searched string is matched with any element of array \'lines\'.Try thisIt will return you the line with the first incidence of the text that you are looking for.If stringArray contains a large number of varied length strings, consider using a Trie to store and search the string array.Here is the implementation of the Trie classIf all strings in stringArray have the same length, you will be better off just using a HashSet instead of a TrieThree options demonstrated.  I prefer to find the third as the most concise.Try this, no need for a loop..I used the following code to check if the string contained any of the items in the string array:
