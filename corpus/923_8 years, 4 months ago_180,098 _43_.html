I have changes to a file, plus a new file, and would like to use git stash to put them away while I switch to another task.  But git stash by itself stashes only the changes to the existing file; the new file remains in my working tree, cluttering up my future work.  How do I stash this untracked file?Warning, doing this will permanently delete your files if you have any directory/* entries in your gitignore file.Add (git add) the file and start tracking it. Then stash. Since the entire contents of the file are new, they will be stashed, and you can manipulate it as necessary.As of version 1.7.7 you can use git stash save -u to stash untracked files without staging them.As of git 1.7.7, git stash accepts the --include-untracked option (or short-hand -u). To include untracked files in your stash, use either of the following commands:Warning, doing this will permanently delete your files if you have any directory/* entries in your gitignore file.Add the file to the index:The entire contents of the index, plus any unstaged changes to existing files, will all make it into the stash.In git bash, stashing of untracked files is achieved by using the commandor http://git-scm.com/docs/git-stashgit stash removes any untracked or uncommited files from your workspace. And you can revert git stash by using following commandsThis will place the file back in your local workspace.My experienceI had to perform a modification to my gitIgnore file to avoid movement of .classpath and .project files into remote repo. \nI am not allowed to move this modified .gitIgnore in remote repo as of now..classpath and .project files are important for eclipse - which is my java editor.I first of all selectively added my rest of the files and committed for staging. However, final push cannot be performed unless the modified .gitIgnore fiels and the untracked files viz. .project and .classpath are not stashed.I usedfor stashing the modified .gitIgnore file.For stashing .classpath and .project file, I used and it removed the files from my workspace. Absence of these files takes away my capability of working on my work location in eclipse.\nI proceeded on with completing the procedure for pushing the committed files to remote.\nOnce this was done successfully, I used This pasted the same files back in my workspace. This gave back to me my ability to work on the same project in eclipse.\nHope this brushes aside misconceptions.As has been said elsewhere, the answer is to git add the file.  e.g.:However, the question is also raised in another answer: What if you don\'t really want to add the file?  Well, as far as I can tell, you have to.  And the following will NOT work:this will fail, as follows:So, what can you do?  Well, you have to truly add the file, however, you can effectively un-add it later, with git rm --cached:And then you can continue working, in the same state as you were in before the git add (namely with an untracked file called path/to/untracked-file; plus any other changes you might have had to tracked files).Another possibility for a workflow on this would be something like:... which could also be easily scripted -- even aliases would do (presented in zsh syntax; adjust as needed) [also, I shortened the filename so it all fits on the screen without scrolling in this answer; feel free to substitute an alternate filename of your choosing]:Note that the latter might be better as a shell script or function, to allow parameters to be supplied to git stash, in case you don\'t want pop but apply, and/or want to be able to specify a specific stash, rather than just taking the top one.  Perhaps this (instead of the second alias, above) [whitespace stripped to fit without scrolling; re-add for increased legibility]:Note: In this form, you need to supply an action argument as well as the identifier if you\'re going to supply a stash identifier, e.g. unstashall apply stash@{1} or unstashall pop stash@{1}Which of course you\'d put in your .zshrc or equivalent to make exist long-term.Hopefully this answer is helpful to someone, putting everything together all in one answer.There are several correct answers here, but I wanted to point out that for new entire directories, \'git add path\' will NOT work. So if you have a bunch of new files in untracked-path and do this:this will stash with the following message:and if untracked-path is the only path you\'re stashing, the stash "temp stash" will be an empty stash. Correct way is to add the entire path, not just the directory name (i.e. end the path with a \'/\'):I was able to stash just the untracked files by doing:The last one pops the stash of the tracked files, thus leaving only the untracked files stashed.I thought this could be solved by telling git that the file exists, rather than committing all of the contents of it to the staging area, and then call git stash. Araqnid describes how to do the former.orHowever, the latter doesn\'t work:I used to ponder and desire the same feature.\nBut over time, I noticed it really isn\'t needed.\nWhen you stash, it\'s OK to leave the new files.  Nothing "bad" can happen to them (when you check out something else, git will error and not overwrite the existing untracked file)And since usually the time frame between the git stash and the git stash pop is rather small, you\'ll be needing the untracked file quickly again.\nSo I would say the inconvenience of the file showing up in git status while you\'re working on something else (between the git stash and the git stash pop) is smaller then the inconvenience caused by the work and needed attention it would otherwise cost to try to add the untracked file to your stash.
