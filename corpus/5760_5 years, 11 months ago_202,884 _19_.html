How can I represent an infinite number in python? No matter which number you enter in the program, no number should be greater than this representation of infinity.In Python, you can do:In Python 3.5, you can do:And then:Will always be true. Unless of course, as pointed out, x is also infinity or "nan" ("not a number").Additionally (Python 2.x ONLY), in a comparison to Ellipsis, float(inf) is lesser, e.g:would return true.Since Python 3.5 you can use math.inf:I don\'t know exactly what you are doing, but float("inf") gives you a float Infinity, which is greater than any other number.Another, less convenient, way to do it is to use Decimal class:In python2.x there was a dirty hack that served this purpose (NEVER use it unless absolutely necessary):Thus the check i < \'\' holds True for any integer i.It has been reasonably deprecated in python3. Now such comparisons end up withThere is an infinity in the NumPy library: from numpy import inf. To get negative infinity one can simply write -inf.No one seems to have mentioned about the negative infinity explicitly, so I think I should add it.For positive infinity (just for the sake of completeness):For negative infinity:first of all type of float(\'inf\') is float though it can be used for comparison purpose but it is considerably slow to compare against it. So if you are comparing a large list of number against float(\'inf\') then be careful to pick it. I am not sure about the performance of "math.inf".Set the value using the code above
