If there are two arrays created in swift like this:How can they be merged to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]?You can concatenate the arrays with +, building a new array or append one array to the other with += (or extend):With Swift 3, according to your needs and tastes, you may choose one of the five following ways to concatenate/merge two arrays.Swift standard library defines a +(_:_:) generic operator. +(_:_:) has the following declaration:Creates a new collection by concatenating the elements of two collections.The following Playground code shows how to merge two arrays of type [Int] into a new array using +(_:_:) generic operator:Swift Array has an append(contentsOf:) method. append(contentsOf:) has the following declaration:Adds the elements of a sequence or collection to the end of this collection.The following Playground code shows how to append an array to another array of type [Int] using append(contentsOf:) method:Swift provides a flatMap(_:) method for all types that conform to Sequence protocol (including Array). flatMap(_:) has the following declaration:Returns an array containing the concatenated results of calling the given transformation with each element of this sequence.The following Playground code shows how to merge two arrays of type [Int] into a new array using flatMap(_:) method:Swift provides a joined() method for all types that conform to Sequence protocol (including Array). joined() has the following declaration:Returns the elements of this sequence of sequences, concatenated.Besides, Swift Array has a init(_:) initializer. init(_:) has the following declaration:Creates an array containing the elements of a sequence.Therefore, the following Playground code shows how to merge two arrays of type [Int] into a new array using joined() method and init(_:) initializer:Swift Array has a reduce(_:_:) method. reduce(_:_:) has the following declaration:Returns the result of calling the given combining closure with each element of this sequence and an accumulating value.The following Playground code shows how to merge two arrays of type [Int] into a new array using reduce(_:_:) method:My favorite method since Swift 2.0 is flattenThis will return FlattenBidirectionalCollection so if you just want a CollectionType this will be enough and you will have lazy evaluation for free. If you need exactly the Array you can do this:If you are not a big fan of operator overloading, or just more of a functional type:To complete the list of possible alternatives, reduce could be used to implement the behavior of flatten:The best alternative (performance/memory-wise) among the ones presented is simply flatten, that just wrap the original arrays lazily without creating a new array structure.But notice that flatten does not return a LazyColletion, so that lazy behavior will not be propagated to the next operation along the chain (map, flatMap, filter, etc...). If lazyness makes sense in your particular case, just remember to prepend or append a .lazy to flatten(), for example, modifying Tomasz sample this way:If you want the second array to be inserted after a particular index you can do this (as of Swift 2.2):Swift 3.0You can create a new array by adding together two existing arrays with compatible types with the addition operator (+). The new array\'s type is inferred from the type of the two array you add together,this is the right results of above codes.Here\'s the shortest way to merge two arrays.Concatenate/merge themMarge array that are different data types :Output :
