I have a double in Java and I want to check if it is NaN.\nWhat is the best way to do this?Use the static Double.isNaN(double) method, or your Double\'s .isNaN() method.Simply doing:is not sufficient due to how the IEEE standard for NaN and floating point numbers is defined.Try Double.isNaN():Returns true if this Double value is a Not-a-Number (NaN), false otherwise. Note that [double.isNaN()] will not work, because unboxed doubles do not have methods associated with them.You can check for NaN by using var != var. NaN does not equal NaN.EDIT: This is probably by far the worst method. It\'s confusing, terrible for readability, and overall bad practice.You might want to consider also checking if a value is finite via Double.isFinite(value). Since Java 8 there is a new method in Double class where you can check at once if a value is not NaN and infinity.Check the Javadoc for the Double API.Beginners needs practical examples. so try the following code.
