I have been developing with WebApi and have moved on to WebApi2 where Microsoft has introduced a new IHttpActionResult Interface that seems to recommended to be used over returning a HttpResponseMessage. I am confused on the advantages of this new Interface. It seems to mainly just provide a SLIGHTLY easier way to create a HttpResponseMessage. I would make the argument that this is "abstraction for the sake of abstraction". Am I missing something? What is the real world advantages I get from using this new Interface besides maybe saving a line of code?Old way (WebApi):New Way (WebApi2):You might decide not to use IHttpActionResult because your existing code builds a HttpResponseMessage that doesn\'t fit one of the canned responses.  You can however adapt HttpResponseMessage to IHttpActionResult using the canned response of ResponseMessage.  It took me awhile to figure this out, so I wanted to post it showing that you don\'t necesarily have to choose one or the other:Note, ResponseMessage is a method of the base class ApiController that your controller should inherit from.You can still use HttpResponseMessage.  That capability will not go away.  I felt the same way as you and argued extensively with the team that there was no need for an additional abstraction.  There were a few arguments thrown around to try and justify its existence but nothing that convinced me that it was worthwhile.That is, until I saw this sample from Brad Wilson.  If you construct IHttpActionResult classes in a way that can be chained, you gain the ability to create a "action-level" response pipeline for generating the HttpResponseMessage.  Under the covers, this is how ActionFilters are implemented however, the ordering of those ActionFilters is not obvious when reading the action method which is one reason I\'m not a fan of action filters.However, by creating IHttpActionResults that can be explicitly chained in your action method you can compose all kinds of different behaviour to generate your response.Here are several benefits of IHttpActionResult over HttpResponseMessage mentioned in Microsoft ASP.Net Documentation:  But here are some other advantages of using IHttpActionResult worth mentioning:This is just my personal opinion and folks from web API team can probably articulate it better but here is my 2c.First of all, I think it is not a question of one over another. You can use them both depending on what you want to do in your action method but in order to understand the real power of IHttpActionResult, you will probably need to step outside those convenient helper methods of ApiController such as Ok, NotFound, etc.Basically, I think a class implementing IHttpActionResult as a factory of HttpResponseMessage. With that mind set, it now becomes an object that need to be returned and a factory that produces it. In general programming sense, you can create the object yourself in certain cases and in certain cases, you need a factory to do that. Same here.If you want to return a response which needs to be constructed through a complex logic, say lots of response headers, etc, you can abstract all those logic into an action result class implementing IHttpActionResult and use it in multiple action methods to return response.Another advantage of using IHttpActionResult as return type is that it makes ASP.NET Web API action method similar to MVC. You can return any action result without getting caught in media formatters.Of course,  as noted by Darrel, you can chain action results and create a powerful micro-pipeline similar to message handlers themselves in the API pipeline. This you will need depending on the complexity of your action method.Long story short - it is not IHttpActionResult versus HttpResponseMessage. Basically, it is how you want to create the response. Do it yourself or through a factory.WebAPI basically return 4 type of object: void, HttpResponseMessage, IHttpActionResult, and other strong types. First version WebAPI returns HttpResponseMessage which is pretty straight forward HTTP response message.IHttpActionResult was introduced by WebAPI 2 which is a kind of wrap of HttpResponseMessage. It contains ExecuteAsync method to create an HttpResponseMessage. It simplifies unit testing of your controller. Other return type are kind of strong typed classes serialized by Web API using media formatter into the response body. The drawback was you cannot directly return an error code, such as 404. All you can do is throw an HttpResponseException error.I\'d rather implement TaskExecuteAsync interface function for IHttpActionResult. Something like:, where _request is the HttpRequest and _respContent is the payload.
