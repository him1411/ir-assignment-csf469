What\'s the best way to do case insensitive string comparison in Python?I would like to encapsulate comparison of a regular strings to a repository string using in a very simple and pythonic way.  I also would like to have ability to look up values in a dict hashed by strings using regular python strings.  Much obliged for advice.Assuming ASCII strings:Comparing string in a case insensitive way seems like something that\'s trivial, but it\'s not. I will be using Python 3, since Python 2 is underdeveloped here.The first thing to note it that case-removing conversions in unicode aren\'t trivial. There is text for which text.lower() != text.upper().lower(), such as "\xc3\x9f":But let\'s say you wanted to caselessly compare "BUSSE" and "Bu\xc3\x9fe". Heck, you probably also want to compare "BUSSE" and "BU\xe1\xba\x9eE" equal - that\'s the newer capital form. The recommended way is to use casefold:Do not just use lower. If casefold is not available, doing .upper().lower() helps (but only somewhat).Then you should consider accents. If your font renderer is good, you probably think "\xc3\xaa" == "e\xcc\x82" - but it doesn\'t:This is because they are actuallyThe simplest way to deal with this is unicodedata.normalize. You probably want to use NFKD normalization, but feel free to check the documentation. Then one doesTo finish up, here this is expressed in functions:Using Python 2, calling .lower() on each string or Unicode object......will work most of the time, but indeed doesn\'t work in the situations @tchrist has described.Assume we have a file called unicode.txt containing the two strings \xce\xa3\xce\xaf\xcf\x83\xcf\x85\xcf\x86\xce\xbf\xcf\x82 and \xce\xa3\xce\x8a\xce\xa3\xce\xa5\xce\xa6\xce\x9f\xce\xa3. With Python 2:The \xce\xa3 character has two lowercase forms, \xcf\x82 and \xcf\x83, and .lower() won\'t help compare them case-insensitively.However, as of Python 3, all three forms will resolve to \xcf\x82, and calling lower() on both strings will work correctly:So if you care about edge-cases like the three sigmas in Greek, use Python 3.(For reference, Python 2.7.3 and Python 3.3.0b1 are shown in the interpreter printouts above.)Section 3.13 of the Unicode standard defines algorithms for caseless\nmatching.X.casefold() == Y.casefold() in Python 3 implements the "default caseless matching" (D144).Casefolding does not preserve the normalization of strings in all instances and therefore the normalization needs to be done (\'\xc3\xa5\' vs. \'a\xcc\x8a\'). D145 introduces "canonical caseless matching":NFD() is called twice for very infrequent edge cases involving U+0345 character.Example:There are also compatibility caseless matching (D146) for cases such as \'\xe3\x8e\x92\' (U+3392) and  "identifier caseless matching" to simplify and optimize caseless matching of identifiers.How about converting to lowercase first? you can use string.lower().I saw this solution here using regex.It works well with accentsHowever, it doesn\'t work with unicode characters case-insensitive. Thank you @Rhymoid for pointing out that as my understanding was that it needs the exact symbol, for the case to be true. The output is as follows:The usual approach is to uppercase the strings or lower case them for the lookups and comparisons.  For example:If you have  lists with strings and you want to compare the strings in different list  with case insensitive. Here is my solution. After doing that, you can make string comparision easly.I\'ve used this to accomplish something more useful for comparing two strings:Update: As noted by gerrit, this answer has some bugs.  This was years ago and I no longer remember what I used it for.  I do recall writing tests, but what good are they now!
