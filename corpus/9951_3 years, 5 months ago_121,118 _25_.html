As the title says. I need to be able to retrieve the IP address the docker hosts and the portmaps from the host to the container, and doing that inside of the container. As @MichaelNeale noticed, there is no sense to use this method in Dockerfile (except when we need this IP during build time only), because this IP will be hardcoded during build time.On Docker for Mac the docker0 bridge does not exist so the answers above will not work. All outgoing traffic however, is routed through your parent host, so as long as you try to connect to an IP it recognizes as itself (and the docker container doesn\'t think is itself) you should be able to connect. For example if you run this from the parent machine run:This should show you the IP of your Mac on its current network and your docker container should be able to connect to this address as well. This is of course a pain if this IP address ever changes, but you can add a custom loopback IP to your Mac that the container doesn\'t think is itself by doing something like this on the parent machine:You can then test the connection from within the docker container with telnet. In my case I wanted to connect to a remote xdebug server:Now when traffic comes into your Mac addressed for 192.168.46.49 (and all the traffic leaving your container does go through your Mac) your Mac will assume that IP is itself. When you are finish using this IP, you can remove the loopback alias like this:One thing to be careful about is that the docker container won\'t send traffic to the parent host if it thinks the traffic\'s destination is itself. So check the loopback interface inside the container if you have trouble:In my case, this showed inet 127.0.0.1/8 which means I couldn\'t use any IPs in the 127.* range. That\'s why I used 192.168.* in the example above. Make sure the IP you use doesn\'t conflict with something on your own network.For those running Docker in AWS, the instance meta-data for the host is still available from inside the container.For example:On Docker for Mac, as of version 17.06 (the latest, as of this writing), you can use docker.for.mac.localhost as the host\'s IP.DocsFor example, I have environment variables set on my host:In my docker-compose.yml file, I have this:The --add-host could be a more cleaner solution (but without the port part, only the host can be handled with this solution).  So, in your docker run command, do something like:(From https://stackoverflow.com/a/26864854/127400 )The only way is passing the host information as environment when you create a containerIf you enabled the docker remote API (via -Htcp://0.0.0.0:4243 for instance) and know the host machine\'s hostname or IP address this can be done with a lot of bash.Within my container\'s user\'s bashrc:The second line grabs the container ID from your local /proc/self/cgroup file.Third line curls out to the host machine (assuming you\'re using 4243 as docker\'s port) then uses node to parse the returned JSON for the DESIRED_PORT.With https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/a)    $ docker-machine ipb) Get the IP address of one or more machines.Here is another option for those running Docker in AWS. This option avoids having using apk to add the curl package and saves the precious 7mb of space. Use the built-in wget (part of the monolithic BusyBox binary):
