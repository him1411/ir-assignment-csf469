I am trying to import a Gradle project into IntelliJ, and when I get to the Gradle Home textbox, it is not automatically populated, nor will typing in the path of Gradle Home result in a valid location - I have the GRADLE_USER_HOME environment variable set (to what I think is!) the correct path, and I have been able to successfully import this same project into Eclipse. Any suggestions?You can write a simple gradle script to print your GRADLE_HOME directory.and name it build.gradle.Then run it with:If you installed with homebrew, use brew info gradle to find the base path (i.e. /usr/local/Cellar/gradle/1.10/), and just append libexec.Installed on a Mac via Homebrew, the path is preferable to since the former will survive version upgrades.If you installed gradle with homebrew, then the path is:Where X.X is the version of gradle (currently 2.1)If you are using IntelliJ, just do the following. That\'s all. On a mac it should ideally be at : /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/gradle/gradle-2.14.1AFAIK it is GRADLE_HOME not GRADLE_USER_HOME (see gradle installation http://www.gradle.org/installation).On the other hand I played a bit with Gradle support in Idea 13 Cardea and I think the gradle home is not automatically discover by Idea. If so you can file a issue in youtrack.Also, if you use gradle 1.6+ you can use the Graldle support for setting the build and wrapper. I think idea automatically discover the wrapper based gradle project.$ gradle setupBuild --type java-library $ gradle wrapper Note: Supported library types: basic, maven, javaRegardsIf you\'re using MacPorts, the path isI had some weird errors where it could not find my class, I had to right click on my src folder (was red) to "Make Directory as" -> Source Folder RootIn case you are using Mac, most probably your gradle home should be /usr/local/gradle-2.0 for example.In preference of IDEA search for gradle and set gradle home as given above.\nIt should workC:\\Users\\prabs\\.gradle\\wrapper\\dists\\gradle-3.3-all\\55gk2rcmfc6p2dg9u9ohc3hw9\\gradle-3.3\\Android studio\\gradle didn\'t worked for me.And "Default gradle wrapper" wasn\'t configured while importing (cloning) the project from bitbucket
