I have a lot of projects in my .Net solution. I would like to exclude all "bin/Debug" and "bin/Release" folders (and their contents), but still include the "bin" folder itself and any dll\'s contained therein..gitignore with "bin/" ignores "Debug" and "Release" folders, but also any dll\'s contained in the "bin" folder."bin/Debug" or "bin/Release" in the .gitignore file does not exclude the directories, unless I fully qualify the ignore pattern as "Solution/Project/bin/Debug" - which I don\'t want to do as I will need to include this full pattern for each project in my solution, as well as add it for any new projects added.Any suggestions?Have you tried wildcards?With version 1.8.2 of git, you can also use the ** wildcard to match any level of subdirectories:You can use .gitignore in the top level to ignore all directories in the project with the same name. For example:This should update immediately so it\'s visible when you do git status. Ensure that these directories are not already added to git, as that will override the ignores.The question isn\'t asking about ignoring all subdirectories, but I couldn\'t find the answer anywhere, so I\'ll post it: */*.All the above answers are valid, but something that I don\'t think is mentioned is that once you add a file from that directory into the repo, you can\'t ignore that directory/subdirectory that contains that file (git will ignore that directive). You\'ll have to remove all files from the target directory first from the repo and then you can ignore that folder.Besides putting the correct entries in your .gitignore file, if you\'re trying to ignore something already added to the repo, you have to do git rm -r /path/to/dir and commit that before you add the dir to your .gitignore file. Otherwise the only thing git will ignore is your ignore directive.The only way I got this to work on my machine was to do it this way:Notice how you have to explicitly allow content for each level you want to include. So if I have subdirectories 5 deep under themes, I still need to spell that out.This is from @Yarin\'s comment here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/5250314/1696153These were useful topics:I also tried and **/wp-content/themes/**or /wp-content/themes/**/*None of that worked for me, either. Lots of trail and error!The generic way to ignore all subfolders, while continuing to track the files that are in the /bin directory would be to add the following line to your project\'s .gitignore file:If you want to ignore only particular named subfolders, you can do:nb. if the bin directory is not in the root of your project (alongside the .gitignore file), then instead of eg. bin/*/* you might need path/to/bin/*/* To ignore all subdirectories you can simply use:This works as of version 1.8.2 of git.I needed to commit changes that were made to the directory dirname/. Now by adding dirname/ to .gitignore the directory dirname is now ignored.
