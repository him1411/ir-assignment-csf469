Is there a method for printing to the console without a trailing newline? The console object documentation doesn\'t say anything regarding that:console.log()Prints to stdout with newline. This function can take multiple arguments in a printf()-like way. Example:If formating elements are not found in the first string then util.inspect is used on each argument.You can use process.stdout.write():See the docs for details.Also, if you want to overwrite messages in the same line, for instance in a countdown, you could add \'\\r\' at the end of the string.util.print can be used also. Read: http://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_printutil.print([...])#\n  A synchronous output function. Will block the process, cast each argument to a string then  output to stdout. Does not place newlines after each argument.An example:In Windows console (Linux, too), you should replace \'\\r\' with its equivalent code \\033[0G:This uses a VT220 terminal escape sequence to send the cursor to the first column.There seem to be many answers suggesting process.stdout.write.  Error logs should be emitted on process.stderr instead (Use console.error).  For anyone who is wonder why process.stdout.write(\'\\033[0G\'); wasn\'t doing anything it\'s because stdout is buffered and you need to wait for drain event (See Stdout flush for NodeJS?).  If write returns false it will fire a drain event.None of these solutions work for me.  process.stdout.write(\'ok\\033[0G\') and just using \'\\r\' just create a new line, do not overwrite, Mac OSX 10.9.2EDIT:  I had to use this to replace the current lineprocess.stdout.write(\'\\033[0G\');\nprocess.stdout.write(\'newstuff\');I got an error when using strict mode.Node error: "Octal literals are not allowed in strict mode."I found the answer here:\nhttps://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/issues/111process.stdout.write("received: " + bytesReceived + "\\x1B[0G");
