How can I tell Maven 2 to load the Servlet 3.0 API?I tried:I use http://repository.jboss.com/maven2/ but what repository would be correct?Addendum:It works with a dependency for the entire Java EE 6 API and the following settings:I\'d prefer to only add the Servlet API as dependency, but "Brabster" may be right that separate dependencies have been replaced by Java EE 6 Profiles. Is there a source that confirms this assumption?I\'d prefer to only add the Servlet API as dependency, To be honest, I\'m not sure to understand why but never mind...Brabster separate dependencies have been replaced by Java EE 6 Profiles. Is there a source that confirms this assumption?The maven repository from Java.net indeed offers the following artifact for the WebProfile:This jar includes Servlet 3.0, EJB Lite 3.1, JPA 2.0, JSP 2.2, EL 1.2, JSTL 1.2, JSF 2.0, JTA 1.1, JSR-45, JSR-250.But to my knowledge, nothing allows to say that these APIs won\'t be distributed separately (in java.net repository or somewhere else). For example (ok, it may a particular case), the JSF 2.0 API is available separately (in the java.net repository):And actually, you could get javax.servlet-3.0.jar from there and install it in your own repository.This seems to be added recently:http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/javax/servlet/javax.servlet-api/3.0.1/Or you can use the Central Maven Repository with the Servlet 3.0 API which is also provided for the Tomcat Server 7.0.Xfrom here: http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/tomcat/tomcat-servlet-api/7.0.21/Unfortunately, adding the javaee-(web)-api as a dependency doesn\'t give you the Javadoc or the Source to the Servlet Api to browse them from within the IDE. This is also the case for all other dependencies (JPA, EJB, ...)\nIf you need the Servlet API sources/javadoc, you can add the following to your pom.xml (works at least for JBoss&Glassfish):Repository:Dependency:I completely removed the javaee-api from my dependencies and replaced it with the discrete parts (javax.ejb, javax.faces, ...) to get the sources and Javadocs for all parts of Java EE 6.EDIT:Here is the equivalent Glassfish dependency (although both dependencies should work, no matter what appserver you use). Here is what I use. All of these are in the Central and have sources.For Tomcat 7 (Java 7, Servlet 3.0)Note - Servlet, JSP and EL APIs are provided in Tomcat. Only JSTL (if used) needs to be bundled with the web app.For Tomcat 8 (Java 8, Servlet 3.1)The Apache Geronimo project provides a Servlet 3.0 API dependency on the Maven Central repo:I found an example POM for the Servlet 3.0 API on DZone from September.Suggest you use the java.net repo, at http://download.java.net/maven/2/There are Java EE APIs in there, for example http://download.java.net/maven/2/javax/javaee-web-api/6.0/ with POM that look like they might be what you\'re after, for example:I\'m guessing that the version conventions for the APIs have been changed to match the version of the overall EE spec (i.e. Java EE 6 vs. Servlets 3.0) as part of the new \'profiles\'. Looking in the JAR, looks like all the 3.0 servlet stuff is in there. Enjoy!A convenient way (JBoss recommended) to include Java EE 6 dependencies is demonstrated below. As a result dependencies are placed separately (not all in one jar as in javaee-web-api), source files and javadocs of the libraries are available to download from maven repository.To include individual dependencies only, dependencyManagement section and scope import can be used:Just for newcomers.Try this code...
