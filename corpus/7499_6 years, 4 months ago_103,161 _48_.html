I have found all kinds of links online but none that are current and show how to run a single test.I have the following file:What command in terminal do I use to run just that spec and in what dir do I run the command?My gem file:spec fileUsually I do:Where 42 represents the line of the test I want to run.EDIT1:You could also use tags. See here. EDIT 2:Try:With Rake:(Credit goes to this answer.  Go vote him up.)EDIT (thanks to @cirosantilli): To run one specific scenario within the spec, you have to supply a regex pattern match that matches the description.You can pass a regex to the spec command which will only run it blocks matching the name you supply.My preferred method for running specific tests is slightly different -\nI added the linesTo my spec_helper file.Now, whenever I want to run one specific test (or context, or spec), I can simply add the tag "focus" to it, and run my test as normal - only the focused test(s) will run. If I remove all the focus tags, the run_all_when_everything_filtered kicks in and runs all the tests as normal.It\'s not quite as quick and easy as the command line options - it does require you to edit the file for the test you want to run. But it gives you a lot more control, I feel.There are many options:@apneadiving answer is a neat way of solving this. However, now we have a new method in Rspec 3.3. We can simply run rspec spec/unit/baseball_spec.rb[#context:#it] instead of using a line number. Taken from here:RSpec 3.3 introduces a new way to identify examples[...]For example, this command:$ rspec spec/unit/baseball_spec.rb[1:2,1:4]\n  \xe2\x80\xa6would run the 2nd and 4th example or group defined under the 1st top-level group defined in spec/unit/baseball_spec.rb.So instead of doing \nrspec spec/unit/baseball_spec.rb:42 where it (test in line 42) is the first test, we can simply do\nrspec spec/unit/baseball_spec.rb:[1:1] or rspec spec/unit/baseball_spec.rb:[1:1:1] depending on how nested the test case is.starting with rspec 2 you can use the following:I used this way to run single test file(all the tests in one file)Class name can be used to match to the desired file TopicsControllerTestMy class class TopicsControllerTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTestOutput : If You want you can tweak the regex to match to single test method  \\TopicsControllerTest#test_Should_delete\\ For model, it will run case on line number 5 onlyFor controller : it will run case on line number 5 onlyFor signal model or controller remove line number from aboveTo run case on all modelsTo run case on all controllerTo run all casesGiven you\'re on a rails 3 project with rspec 2, From the rails root directory: should definitely work.  i got tired of typing that so i created an alias to shorten \'bundle exec rspec\' to \'bersp\'\'bundle exec\' is so that it loads the exact gem environment specified in your gem file: http://gembundler.com/Rspec2 switched from the \'spec\' command to the \'rspec\' command.I use this guard gem to auto-run my test. It execute test after create or update operations on test file. https://github.com/guard/guard-testor \n usually you can run using following command rspec spec/controllers/groups_controller_spec.rbYou can do something like this:There is a gem \'watchr\' which can track any code change in the file and run the test automatically for you
