But always see first. Otherwise you will only see what you were expecting. Most scientists forget that." -- Wonko the Saneby Dale CarnegieHow to Win Friends and Influence People http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/38/3c/0432c6da8da0f79a93332110._AA240_.L.jpgAlthough this was first published in 1936, the advice contained within is still as fresh and appropriate as ever. Don\'t be put off by the name. This isn\'t some underhand guide to having your way with unsuspecting victims, but rather common sense advice on how to get on with people, how to nurture relationships and make the most of yourself and your fellow man (and woman).It is well known that technical folk (including programmers) are often thought of as not being terribly \'people oriented\' (whether this is a justified stereotype or not is subject of another discussion) and so this book is an invaluable resource for teaching you the finer points of human interaction.It\'s warm, heartfelt, sturdy, straightforward and timelessly written. Highly recommended.This book will inspire anyone to think and be original.by George OrwellAnother one from a different angle from prior posts:  G\xc3\xb6del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid, by Douglas Hofstadter.alt text http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f1/GEBcover.jpg/200px-GEBcover.jpgThe Design of Everyday Things by Donald A.

I\'ve gotten about five people to read it so far. 100% positive reviews, predictably.by Tom DeMarco and Timothy Listeralt text http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MlUgcSICL._SL500_BO2,-64_OU01_AA240_SH20_.jpgThis classic book encourages us to think about the people instead of the process. It\'s full of practical advice on team building, productivity and office environments. It\'s a must read, not just for managers, but anyone related to software development. Get two copies, one for you and one for your manager.by Robert M. PirsigThis book is many things, but you could say it\'s sort of a philosophical take on what it means to "grok" something.Commentry from Garth Gilmore:I credit this book with teaching me more about software development than any programming book I ever read.The central thread in the book is how our romantic (artistic) and classical (technical/rational) perceptions of the world are both derived from how we perceive quality in the environment around us. This understanding is then applied to apparently mundane tasks like motorcycle maintenance.To give some examples of how this applies to coding:Long story short its a good read :-)Ender\'s Game by Orson Scott Cardby Neal StephensonThis book follows parallel stories of a World War II code breaker and his present day descendant, and deals a lot with the development of computers (Alan Turing is actually a character in the book).  A geek\'s must-read!by Edward TufteThe Visual Display of Quantitative Information http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41CZQ3YDSKL._SL500_AA300_.jpgDiscusses how to graphically represent different types of complex databy William Strunk & E.B. WhiteWe got a copy in our R&D library after coming across Joshua Bloch\'s (of Effective Java fame) recommendation for it:This slim volume preaches the gospel of simplicity and clarity as it applies to English prose. If you take it to heart, it will improve your coding as well as your prose. In another interview Bloch elaborates on why this is good for programmers: I believe that reading Strunk and White will make you a better developer because good programming and good writing are both about clarity and economy of expression. You can\'t write good code or good prose unless you understand what it is you\'re trying to say. Many of Strunk and White\'s admonitions have direct analogues for software. For example, Strunk and White say, "Omit needless words!" where Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas ("The Pragmatic Programmers") say, "Don\'t repeat yourself." Strunk and White say, "Revise and Rewrite," where Martin Fowler says, "refactor." And the list goes on.Now, personally I think some of the advice in The Elements of Style is a bit aged, as usage of English has evolved (e.g., nowadays it\'s quite ok to start a sentence with "However," or to use "hopefully" instead of "I hope"). But for the most part I agree with Mr Bloch, and enjoyed reading this.Edit:  Oh, here\'s what Jeff Atwood more recently had to say about The Elements of Style. Perhaps he\'s an even better known figure around here than Josh Bloch ;)I can\'t believe I didn\'t see this already listed:by Frank HerbertDune Cover http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5a/FrankHerbert_Dune_1st.jpgDune is the pinnacle of Sci-Fi novels!The Art of War - Sun TzuWikipedia: Much of the text is about how to fight wars without actually having to do battle: it gives tips on how to outsmart one\'s opponent so that physical battle is not necessary. As such, it has found application as a training guide for many competitive endeavors that do not involve actual combat.This knowledge would surely be useful in the everyday "battles" we have to fight in and out of the office. It\'s also filled with quotes you can impress your fellow programmers with... :)My recommendation would be: read anything that is outside your usual scope.Really - anything will broaden your horizon. This does not only apply to programmers and developers. I think everyone would do better having an interest in something that you don\'t already spend 8-12 hours a day.Personally, I sometimes feel like a real world idiot because my personal library of books on all kind of topics related to computers is growing and growing and I can never relax - I mean, I spend roughly 10 hours a day with them and then I am reading a book on design patterns before I go to bed. How sick is that? ;)My current refuge is my newspaper subscription, and various other magazines I pick up every so often when I go by a news stand. Most of them have nothing to do with technology and programming. I made a habit going out for a coffee in the morning, taking the newspaper along and reading something else, or meeting friends and just chatting away.So, just to make it more clear - I know that a newspaper or any magazine is not as current and up to date as a website. But this allows me to not read it on a screen and do something outside the usual.Snow Crash By Neal Stephensonalt text http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/49/b4/8cbff0f9e7a0d2eb66a78110.L.jpgLewis Carroll "Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland"Isaac Asimov\'s Foundation Series is brilliant!http://www.vavatch.co.uk/books/asimov/found1as.jpgReally?  No one has yet mentioned the Lord of the Rings?alt text http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/62/Jrrt_lotr_cover_design.jpgIn addition to being a spectacular piece of writing in it\'s own right, it\'s also the foundation of (almost all) modern fantasy fiction.  (Also, and maybe more to the point for a group of computer programmers, one of the core inspirations for Dungeons & Dragons.)Back a ways, the three books every programmer had to have read to be able to participate in the lunchtime conversation was the Lord of the Rings, Dune, and Hitchhiker\'s Guide.  (This is a slight exaggeration.)If you\'ve only seen the movies, give the books a try.From a technical perspective, the book\'s fundamental message that "unimportant" people can have a profound and positive effect on the world and organizations around them can be very hopeful to all of us doing "big corp" programming.Flatland, by Abbott\nA Brief History of Time - Stephen HawkingA Brief History Of Time - Stephen Hawking http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71HADMSE3JL._SL500_AA240_.gifby C.

Also a lot of emphasis on interaction design and related activities. Delivering what is needed instead of what is asked for.by Stephen Coveyhttp://bloggybiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/stephen-covey-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people.jpgYou are missing out on a lot of your potential if you have not read this book.Originally taken from @John Channing\'s postEdit: Now available as a free audiobook.Comments by Julie:\nThis book has universal value - not just for software developers. Whereas Getting Things Done helps you manage day-to-day activites, 7 Habits helps you keep a high-level vision of life and a general methodology that you need to turn into specifics. It\'s the perfect complement to Getting Things Done in that regard.
