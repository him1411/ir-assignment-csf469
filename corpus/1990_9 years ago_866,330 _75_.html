I have a div with two images and an h1. All of them need to be vertically aligned within the div, next to each other.One of the images needs to be absolute positioned within the div.What is the CSS needed for this to work on all common browsers?Wow, this problem is popular. It\'s based on a misunderstanding in the vertical-align property. This excellent article explains it:Understanding vertical-align, or "How (Not) To Vertically Center Content" by Gavin Kistner.\xe2\x80\x9cHow to center in CSS\xe2\x80\x9d is a great web tool which helps to find the necessary CSS centering attributes for different situations.In a nutshell (and to prevent link rot):I used this very simple code:HTML:CSS:Obviously, whether you use a .class or an #id, the result won\'t change. It worked for me:Now that flexbox support is increasing, this CSS applied to the containing element would vertically center the contained item:Use the prefixed version if you also need to target Explorer 10, and old (< 4.4) Android browsers:A technique from a friend of mine:HTML:CSS:DEMO hereAll of them need to be vertically aligned within the divAligned how? Tops of the images aligned with the top of the text? One of the images needs to be absolute positioned within the div.Absolutely positioned relative to the DIV? Perhaps you could sketch out what you\'re looking for...?fd has described the steps for absolute positioning, as well as adjusting the display of the H1 element such that images will appear inline with it. To that, i\'ll add that you can align the images by use of the vertical-align style:...this would put the header and images together, with top edges aligned. Other alignment options exist; see the documentation. You might also find it beneficial to drop the DIV and move the images inside the H1 element - this provides semantic value to the container, and removes the need to adjust the display of the H1:Use this formula, and it will works always without cracks:To position block elements to the center (works in IE9 and above), needs a wrapper div:My trick is to put inside the div a table with 1 row and 1 column, set 100% of width and height, and the property vertical-align:middle.Fiddle:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/joan16v/sbqjnn9q/Almost all methods needs to specify the height, but often we don\'t have any heights.\nSo here is a CSS3 3 line trick that doesn\'t require to know the height.It\'s supported even in IE9.with its vendor prefixes:Source: http://zerosixthree.se/vertical-align-anything-with-just-3-lines-of-css/By default h1 is a block element and will render on the line after the first img, and will cause the second img to appear on the line following the block.To stop this from occurring you can set the h1 to have inline flow behaviour:As for absolutely positioning the img inside the div, you need to set the containing div to have a "known size" before this will work properly.  In my experience, you also need to change the position attribute away from the default - position: relative works for me:If you can get that to work, you might want to try progressively removing the height, width, position attributes from div.header to get the minimal required attributes to get the effect you want.UPDATE:Here is a complete example that works on Firefox 3:Using CSS to vertical center, you can let the outer containers act like a table, and the content as a table cell. In this format your objects will stay centered. :) I nested multiple objects in JSFiddle for an example, but the core idea is like this:HTMLCSSThe multiple objects example:HTMLCSSResulthttps://jsfiddle.net/martjemeyer/ybs032uc/1/We may use a CSS function calculation to calculate the size of the element and then position the child element accordingly.Example HTML:And CSS:Demo created here: https://jsfiddle.net/xnjq1t22/This solution works well with responsive div height and width as well.Note: The calc function is not tested for compatiblity with old browsers.I have been using the following solution (with no positioning and no line height) since over a year, it works with IE 7 and 8 as well.This is my personal solution for an i element inside a divJSFiddle ExampleJust use a one-cell table inside the div! Just set the cell and table height and with to 100% and you can use the vertical-align.A one-cell table inside the div handles the vertical-align and is backward compatible back to the Stone Age!For me, it worked this way:The "a" element converted to a button, using Bootstrap classes, and it is now vertically centered inside an outer "div".As per today, I have found a new workaround to vertically align multiple text-lines in a div using CSS3 (and I am also using bootstrap v3 grid system to beautify the UI), which is as below:As per my understanding, immediate parent of text containing element must have some height. I hope it will help you too. Thanks!Add style,for each element inside the div tag. So each element will get aligned vertically...I\'m a .NET guy who just got into web programming. I didn\'t use CSS (well, a little bit). I used a little JavaScript to accomplish vertical centering along with jQuery\'s .css function.I\'m just posting everything from my test. It\'s probably not overly elegant, but it works so far.Just this:A one-cell table inside the div handles the vertical-align and is backward compatible back to the Stone Age!Here is just another (responsive) approach:http://jsfiddle.net/herrfischerhamburg/JcVxz/...or CSSBrowser Coverage
