I have been using Vim, and I would really like to save my settings. The problem I am having is that I cannot find my .vimrc file, and it is not in the standard /home/user/.vimrc location. How might I find this file?You need to create it. In most installations I\'ve used it hasn\'t been created by default.You usually create it as ~/.vimrc. :scriptnames list all the .vim files that Vim loaded for you, including your .vimrc file.:e $MYVIMRC open & edit the current .vimrc that you are using, then use Ctrl + G to view the path in status bar.To create your vimrc, start up vim and do one of the following:Insert the settings you want, and save the file.Note that exisitence of this file will disable the compatible option. See below for details.There are two kinds of vimrc:The user vimrc file often does not exist until created by the user. If you cannot find $HOME/.vimrc (or $HOME/_vimrc on Windows) then you can, and probably should, just create it.The system vimrc should normally be left unmodified and is located in the $VIM directory ($VIM may not be set in your shell, but is always set inside vim.) The system vimrc is not a good place you keep your personal settings. If you modify this file your changes may be overwritten if you ever upgrade vim. Also, changes here will affect other users on a multi-user system.From :help vimrc:A file that contains initialization commands is called a "vimrc" file.\n  Each line in a vimrc file is executed as an Ex command line.  It is\n  sometimes also referred to as "exrc" file.  They are the same type of\n  file, but "exrc" is what Vi always used, "vimrc" is a Vim specific\n  name.  Also see |vimrc-intro|.Places for your personal initializations:The files are searched in the order specified above and only the first\n  one that is found is read.(Mac OS X counts as Unix for the above.)Note that the mere existence of a user vimrc will change vim\'s behavior by turning off the compatible option. From :help compatible-default:When Vim starts, the \'compatible\' option is on.  This will be used when Vim\n  starts its initializations.  But as soon as a user vimrc file is found, or a\n  vimrc file in the current directory, or the "VIMINIT" environment variable is\n  set, it will be set to \'nocompatible\'.  This has the side effect of setting or\n  resetting other options (see \'compatible\').  But only the options that have\n  not been set or reset will be changed.As additional info, mostly in macOS, the .vimrc is located at dir:will give you the location of your .vimrc file.will open it.For whatever reason, these answers didn\'t quite work for me. This is what worked for me instead:In vim, the :version command gives you the paths of system and user vimrc and gvimrc files (among other things) and the output looks something like this:The one you want is user vimrc file: "$HOME/.vimrc"So to edit the file: vim $HOME/.vimrcSource: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/VimrcI\'d like to share how I set showing the line number as default on mac.If in terminal, type in cd /usr/share/vim/ go to that folder then type inls, you can directly see a file named vimrc. But it\'s a system file that says read only. I guess it\'s not a good idea to try modify it. So follow the upwards steps to create a vimrc by yourself is better. It works for me.Here are a few more tips: In Arch Linux the global one is at /etc/vimrc. There are some comments in there with helpful details.Since the filename starts with a ., it\'s hidden unless you use ls -a to show ALL files.Typing :version while in Vim will show you a bunch of interesting information including the file location.If you\'re not sure what ~/.vimrc means look at this question.I tried everything above and couldn\'t find a .vimrc file so I had to make one.I copied the example file cp vimrc_example.vim ~/.vimrc\nI had to create the file, copying from /usr/share/vim/vim74/vimrc_example.vim to ~/.vimrc. Those where the instructions in the vimrc_example file.My solution is for unix for other operating systems, according to the vim docs, your destination path should be as follows:In SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) and openSUSE the global one is located at /etc/vimrc to edit it simply vi /etc/vimrcvimrc file in Ubuntu (12.04) : I tried :scriptnames in vim and it shows both /usr/share/vim/vimrc and ~/.vimrc.But I had manually created ~/.vimrc.From cmd: (windows):C\\Users\\You> vim foo.txtNow in vim, enter command mode by typing: ":" (i.e. shift + ";")
