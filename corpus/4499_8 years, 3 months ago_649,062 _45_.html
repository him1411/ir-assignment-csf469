I haveand I want to convert it to \'int\' to store it in a database. How can I do this?Try this:or better yet:Also, since Int32.TryParse returns a bool you can use its return value to make decisions about the results of the parsing attempt:If you are curious, the difference between Parse and TryParse is best summed up like this:The TryParse method is like the Parse\n  method, except the TryParse method\n  does not throw an exception if the\n  conversion fails. It eliminates the\n  need to use exception handling to test\n  for a FormatException in the event\n  that s is invalid and cannot be\n  successfully parsed. - MSDNIt won\'t throw if the text is not numeric.You need to parse the string, and you also need to ensure that it is truly in the format of an integer.The easiest way is this:Another way would be:The difference between the two is that the first one would throw an exception if the value in your textbox can\'t be converted, whereas the second one would just return false.The TryParse statement returns a boolean representing whether the parse has succeeded or not. If it succeeded, the parsed value is stored into the second parameter.See Int32.TryParse Method (String, Int32) for more detailed information.Enjoy it...As explained in the TryParse documentation, TryParse() returns a boolean which indicates that a valid number was found:While there are already many solutions here that describe int.Parse, there\'s something important missing in all the answers. Typically, the string representations of numeric values differ by culture. Elements of numeric strings such as currency symbols, group (or thousands) separators, and decimal separators all vary by culture. If you want to create a robust way to parse a string to an integer, it\'s therefore important to take the culture information into account. If you don\'t, the current culture settings will be used. That might give a user a pretty nasty surprise -- or even worse, if you\'re parsing file formats. If you just want English parsing, it\'s best to simply make it explicit, by specifying the culture settings to use:For more information, read up on CultureInfo, specifically NumberFormatInfo on MSDN.You can write your own extesion methodAnd wherever in code just callIn this concrete caseYou can use either,orYou also may use an extension method, so it will be more readable (although everybody is already used to the regular Parse functions).And then you can call it that way:If you are sure that your string is an integer, like "50".If you are not sure and want to prevent crashes.To make it more dynamic, so you can parse it also to double, float, etc., you can make a generic extension.Conversion of string to int can be done for: int, Int32, Int64 and other data types reflecting integer data types in .NETBelow example shows this conversion:This show (for info) data adapter element initialized to int value. The same can be done directly like,Ex.Link to see this demo. the way i always do this is like thisthis is how i would do it, i hope this helps. (:You can try this, it will work:The string value in the variable TextBoxD1.Text will be converted into Int32 and will be stored in x.Be carefull when using Convert.ToInt32() on a char! It will return the ASCII Code!\nIf you might need to extract only a certain position within the string.If you\'re looking for the long way, just create your one method:This would doOr you can useRefer Microsoft Developer Network for more informationyou can do like below without TryParse or inbuilt functionsthis may help you ;D
