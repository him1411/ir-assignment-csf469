I\'m trying to make my objects Parcelable. However, I have custom objects and those objects have ArrayList attributes of other custom objects I have made.What would be the best way to do this?You can find some examples of this here, here (code is taken here), and here.You can create a POJO class for this, but you need to add some extra code to make it Parcelable. Have a look at the implementation.Once you have created this class, you can easily pass objects of this class through the Intent like this, and recover this object in the target activity.Here, the student is the key which you would require to unparcel the data from the bundle.This example shows only String types. But, you can parcel any kind of data you want. Try it out.EDIT: Another example, suggested by Rukmal Dias.Here is a website to create a Parcelable Class from your created class:http://www.parcelabler.com/IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio have plugins for this:These plugins generate Android Parcelable boilerplate code based on fields in the class.\nYou simply annotate a POJO with a special annotation and library does the rest. Pros:Cons:Hrisey is based on Lombok. Parcelable class using Hrisey:Now you don\'t need to implement any methods of Parcelable interface. Hrisey will generate all required code during preprocessing phase.Hrisey in Gradle dependencies:See here for supported types. The ArrayList is among them.Install a plugin - Hrisey xor Lombok* - for your IDE and start using its amazing features!  \n* Don\'t enable Hrisey and Lombok plugins together or you\'ll get an error during IDE launch.Parcelable class using Parceler:To use the generated code, you may reference the generated class directly, or via the Parcels utility class using To dereference the @Parcel, just call the following method of Parcels classParceler in Gradle dependencies:Look in README for supported attribute types.AutoParcel is an AutoValue extension that enables Parcelable values generation.Just add implements Parcelable to your @AutoValue annotated models:AutoParcel in Gradle build file:PaperParcel is an annotation processor that automatically generates type-safe Parcelable boilerplate code for Kotlin and Java. PaperParcel supports Kotlin Data Classes, Google\'s AutoValue via an AutoValue Extension, or just regular Java bean objects.Usage example from docs.\nAnnotate your data class with @PaperParcel, implement PaperParcelable, and add a JVM static instance of PaperParcelable.Creator e.g.:For Kotlin users, see Kotlin Usage; For AutoValue users, see AutoValue Usage.ParcelableGenerator (README is written in Chinese and I don\'t understand it. Contributions to this answer from english-chinese speaking developers are welcome)Usage example from README. The android-apt plugin assists in working with annotation processors in combination with Android Studio.I have found simplest way to create Parcelable class It is very easy, you can use a plugin on android studio to make objects Parcelables.Now you can use Parceler library to convert your any custom class in parcelable. Just annotate your POJO class with @Parcel.\ne.g.you can create an object of Example class and wrap through Parcels and send as a bundle through intent. e.gNow to get Custom Class object just use  To put:\nbundle.putSerializable("key",(Serializable) object);To get: \nList<Object> obj  = (List<Object>)((Serializable)bundle.getSerializable("key"));
