I would like this to be the ultimate discussion on how to check if a table exists in SQL Server 2000/2005 using SQL Statement.When you Google for the answer, you get so many different answers. Is there an official/backward and forward compatible way of doing it?Here are two possible ways of doing it. Which one among the two is the standard/best way of doing it?First way:Second way:MySQL provides the simple SHOW TABLES LIKE \'%tablename%\'; statement. I am looking for something similar.For queries like this it is always best to use an INFORMATION_SCHEMA view.  These views are (mostly) standard across many different databases and rarely change from version to version.To check if a table exists use:Also note that if for any reason you need to check for a temporary table you can do this:We always use the OBJECT_ID style for as long as I rememberPlease see the below approaches,Approach 1: Using INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES viewWe can write a query like below to check if a Customers Table exists in the current database.Approach 2: Using OBJECT_ID() functionWe can use OBJECT_ID() function like below to check if a Customers Table exists in the current database.Approach 3: Using sys.Objects Catalog ViewWe can use the Sys.Objects catalog view to check the existence of the Table as shown below:Approach 4: Using sys.Tables Catalog ViewWe can use the Sys.Tables catalog view to check the existence of the Table as shown below:Approach 5: Avoid Using sys.sysobjects System tableWe should avoid using sys.sysobjects System Table directly, direct access to it will be deprecated in some future versions of the Sql Server. As per Microsoft BOL link, Microsoft is suggesting to use the catalog views sys.objects/sys.tables instead of sys.sysobjects system table directly.referred from: http://sqlhints.com/2014/04/13/how-to-check-if-a-table-exists-in-sql-server/Looking for a table on a different database:Using the Information Schema is the SQL Standard way to do it, so it should be used by all databases that support it.Just wanted to mention one situation where it would probably be a little easier to use the OBJECT_ID method.  The INFORMATION_SCHEMA views are objects under each database-The information schema views are defined in a special schema named\n  INFORMATION_SCHEMA. This schema is contained in each database.https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms186778.aspxTherefore all tables you access using will only reflect what is in [database].  If you wanted to check if tables in another database exist, without dynamically changing the [database] each time, OBJECT_ID will let you do this out of the box.  Ex-works just as well asSQL SERVER 2016 Edit:Starting with 2016, Microsoft simplified the ability to check for non-existent objects prior to dropping, by adding the if exists keywords to drop statements.  For example,will do the same thing as OBJECT_ID / INFORMATION_SCHEMA wrappers, in 1 line of code.https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sqlserverstorageengine/2015/11/03/drop-if-exists-new-thing-in-sql-server-2016/Here in the above code, the table name is Mapping_APCToFANavigator.If you need to work on different databases:I know it is an old question but I have found this possibility if you plan to call it often.Just adding here, for the benefit of developers and fellow DBAsa script that receives @Tablename as a parameter (which may or may not contain the schemaname) and returns the info below if the schema.table exists:I produced this script to be used inside other scripts every time I need to test whether or not a table or view exists, and when it does, get its object_id to be used for other purposes.It raises an error when either you passed an empty string, wrong schema name or wrong table name.this could be inside a procedure and return -1 for example.As an example, I have a table called "Facts.FactBackOrder" in one of my Data Warehouse databases.This is how I achieved this:In SQL Server 2000 you can try:If anyone is trying to do this same thing in linq to sql (or especially linqpad) turn on option to include system tables and views and do this code:given that you have an object with the name in a property called item, and the schema in a property called schema where the source variable name is aSomething important to know for anybody who hasn\'t found their solution yet:\nSQL server != MYSQL.\nIf you want to do it with MYSQL, it is quite simplePosting this here because it\'s the top hit at Google.If this is to be the \'ultimate\' discussion, then it should be noted that Larry Leonard\'s script can query a remote server as well if the servers are linked.-- -- create procedure to check if a table exists -- -- how to use : check if table migrations exists consider in one database you have a table t1. you want to run script on other Database like - if t1 exist then do nothing else create t1. \nTo do this open visual studio and do the following:Right click on t1, then Script table as, then DROP and Create To, then New Query Editor you will find your desired query. But before executing that script don\'t forget to comment out the drop statement in the query as you don\'t want to create new one if there is already one. Thanks
