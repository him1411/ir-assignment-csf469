How do I copy a file in Python? I couldn\'t find anything under os.shutil has many methods you can use. One of which is:Copy the contents of the file named src to a file named dst. The destination location must be writable; otherwise, an IOError exception will be raised. If dst already exists, it will be replaced. Special files such as character or block devices and pipes cannot be copied with this function. src and dst are path names given as strings. copy2(src,dst) is often more useful than copyfile(src,dst) because:Here is a short example:Copying a file is a relatively straightforward operation as shown by the examples below, but you should instead use the shutil stdlib module for that.If you want to copy by filename you could do something like this:Use the shutil module.Copy the contents of the file named src to a file named dst. The destination location must be writable; otherwise, an IOError exception will be raised. If dst already exists, it will be replaced. Special files such as character or block devices and pipes cannot be copied with this function. src and dst are path names given as strings.Take a look at filesys for all the file and directory handling functions available in standard Python modules.Directory and File copy example - From Tim Golden\'s Python Stuff:http://timgolden.me.uk/python/win32_how_do_i/copy-a-file.htmlLook at module shutil. \nIt contains function copyfile(src, dst) You could use os.system(\'cp nameoffilegeneratedbyprogram /otherdirectory/\')or as I did it,  where rawfile is the name that I had generated inside the program.This is a Linux only solution You can use one of the copy functions from the shutil package:Example:For large files, what I did was read the file line by line and read each line into an array. Then, once the array reached a certain size, append it to a new file. I suggest using Swati\'s answer, but supposing you have a text file and don\'t want to use additional libraries in your code just to copy it, you can use the following one-liner:
