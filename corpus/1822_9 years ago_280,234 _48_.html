Given:How do I get a string which represents the same value in an ISO 8601-compliant format?Note that ISO 8601 defines a number of similar formats. The specific format I am looking for is:This gives you a date similar to 2008-09-22T13:57:31.2311892-04:00.Another way is:which gives you 2008-09-22T14:01:54.9571247ZTo get the specified format, you can use:DateTime Formatting OptionsDateTime.UtcNow.ToString("s", System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture) should give you what you are looking for as the "s" format specifier is described as a sortable date/time pattern; conforms to ISO 8601.Returns something like 2008-04-10T06:30:00UtcNow obviously returns a UTC time so there is no harm in:Use:Standard Date and Time Format Strings (MSDN)Custom Date and Time Format Strings (MSDN)=>I would just use XmlConvert:It will automatically preserve the time zone.You can get the "Z" (ISO 8601 UTC) with the next code:Here is why:The ISO 8601 have some different formats:DateTimeKind.LocalDateTimeKind.UtcDateTimeKind.Unspecified.NET provides us with an enum with those options:Note: If you apply the Visual Studio 2008 "watch utility" to  the toString("o") part you may get different results, I don\'t know if it\'s a bug, but in this case you have better results using a String variable if you\'re debugging.Source: Standard Date and Time Format Strings (MSDN)To convert DateTime.UtcNow to a string representation of yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ, you can use the ToString() method of the DateTime structure with a custom formatting string. When using custom format strings with a DateTime, it is important to remember that you need to escape your seperators using single quotes.The following will return the string represention you wanted:The "s" standard format specifier represents a custom date and time format string that is defined by the DateTimeFormatInfo.SortableDateTimePattern property. The pattern reflects a defined standard (ISO 8601), and the property is read-only. Therefore, it is always the same, regardless of the culture used or the format provider supplied. The custom format string is "yyyy\'-\'MM\'-\'dd\'T\'HH\':\'mm\':\'ss".When this standard format specifier is used, the formatting or parsing operation always uses the invariant culture.\xe2\x80\x93 from MSDNIf you must use DateTime to ISO 8601, then ToString("o") should yield what you are looking for. For example,However, DateTime + TimeZone may present other problems as described in the blog post DateTime and DateTimeOffset in .NET: Good practices and common pitfalls:DateTime has countless traps in it that are designed to give your code bugs:1.- DateTime values with DateTimeKind.Unspecified are bad news.2.- DateTime doesn\'t care about UTC/Local when doing comparisons.3.- DateTime values are not aware of standard format strings.4.- Parsing a string that has a UTC marker with DateTime does not guarantee a UTC time.Most of these answers have milliseconds / microseconds which clearly isn\'t supported by ISO 8601. The correct answer would be:References:It is interesting that custom format "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssK" (without ms) is the quickest format method.Also it is interesting that "S" format is slow on Classic and fast on Core...Of course numbers are very close, between some rows difference is insignificant (tests with suffix _Verify are the same as those that are without the suffix)Code:https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet was usedIf you\'re developing under SharePoint 2010 or higher you can use
