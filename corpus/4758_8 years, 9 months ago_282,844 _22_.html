You can do this in the head section of the HTML and specify a second stylesheet with a media attribute.The best thing to do is to create a "print-only" version of the page.Oh, wait... this isn\'t 1999 anymore.  Use a print CSS with "display: none".Here is a simple solution\nput this CSS and here is the HTML
