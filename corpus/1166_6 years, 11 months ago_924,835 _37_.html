How can I generate random integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive) in Python?i.e. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9Try:More info: https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.randintReturn a random integer N such that a <= N <= b.Docs: https://docs.python.org/3.1/library/random.html#random.randintTry this:Generates 10 pseudo random integers in range 0 to 9 inclusive.The secrets module is new in Python 3.6. This is better than the random module for cryptography or security uses.To randomly print an integer in the inclusive range 0-9:For details, see PEP 506.Try this through random.shuffleIn case of contiguous numbers randint or randrange are probably the best choices but if you have several distinct values in a sequence (i.e. a list) you could also use choice:choice also works for one item from a not-contiguous sample:If you need it "cryptographically strong" there\'s also a secrets.choice in python 3.6 or newer:if you want to use numpy then use the following:Choose the size of the array (in this example, I have chosen the size to be 20). And then, use the following: You can expect to see an output of the following form (different random integers will be returned each time you run it; hence you can expect the integers in the output array to differ from the example given below).To get a list of ten samples:random.sample is another that can be usedBest way is to use import Random function  or without any library import:here the popitems removes and returns an arbitrary value from the dictionary n.I used variable to control the rangeI used the print function to see the results. You can comment is out if you do not need this.Multiple Random IntegersThe original question implies generating multiple random integers.How can I generate integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive) in Python?Many responses show how to get one random number.  For clarity, you can still generate many random numbers using those techniques by simply iterating N times, e.g.:Some posts demonstrate to get many random integers.1 The next sections shows options using the random module.Sample of Random Integersrandom.sample returns k unique selections from a population (without replacement):2In Python 3.6, random.choices returns k selections from a population (with replacement):1Namely @John Lawrence Aspden, @S T Mohammed, @SiddTheKid, @user14372, @zangw, et al.2@prashanth mentions this module and demonstrates for one integer.I had better luck with this for Python 3.6  Just add characters like \'ABCD\' and \'abcd\' or \'^!~=-><\' to alter the character pool to pull from, change the range to alter the number of characters generated.
