What\'s the best way to get the current date/time?It depends on what form of date / time you want:If you want the date / time as a single numeric value, then System.currentTimeMillis() gives you that, expressed as the number of milliseconds after the UNIX epoch (as a Java long).  This value is a delta from a UTC time-point, and is independent of the local time-zone ... assuming that the system clock has been set correctly.If you want the date / time in a form that allows you to access the components (year, month, etc) numerically, you could use one of the following:new Date() gives you a Date object initialized with the current date / time.  The problem is that the Date API methods are mostly flawed ... and deprecated.Calendar.getInstance() gives you a Calendar object initialized with the current date / time, using the default Locale and TimeZone.  Other overloads allow you to use a specific Locale and/or TimeZone.  Calendar works ... but the APIs are still cumbersome.new org.joda.time.DateTime() gives you a Joda-time object initialized with the current date / time, using the default time zone and chronology.  There are lots of other Joda alternatives ... too many to describe here.in Java 8, calling LocalDateTime.now() and ZonedDateTime.now() will give you representations for the current date / time.Prior to Java 8, most people who know about these things recommended Joda-time as having (by far) the best Java APIs for doing things involving time point and duration calculations.  With Java 8, this is no longer true.  However, if you are already using Joda time in your codebase, there is no strong1 reason to migrate.1 - Your code won\'t break if you don\'t, and you won\'t get deprecation warnings.  Sure, the Joda codebase will probably stop getting updates, but it is unlikely to need them.  No updates means stability and that is a good thing.If you just need to output a time stamp in format YYYY.MM.DD-HH.MM.SS (very frequent case) then here\'s the way to do it:If you want the current date as String, try this:orhttp://www.mkyong.com/java/java-how-to-get-current-date-time-date-and-calender/In Java 8 it is:and in case you need time zone info:and in case you want to print fancy formatted string:Just create a Date object...Use:(It\'s working.)There are many different methods:Create object of date and simply print it down.Have you looked at java.util.Date? It is exactly what you want.Similar to above solutions.  But I always find myself looking for this chunk of code:\xe2\x80\xa6 or \xe2\x80\xa6A few of the Answers mention that java.time classes are the modern replacement for the troublesome old legacy date-time classes bundled with the earliest versions of Java. Below is a bit more information.The other Answers fail to explain how a time zone is crucial in determining the current date and time. For any given moment, the date and the time vary around the globe by zone. For example, a few minutes after midnight is a new day in Paris France while still being \xe2\x80\x9cyesterday\xe2\x80\x9d in Montr\xc3\xa9al Qu\xc3\xa9bec.Much of your business logic and data storage/exchange should be done in UTC, as a best practice. To get the current moment in UTC with a resolution in nanoseconds, use Instant class.You can adjust that Instant into other time zones. Apply a ZoneId object to get a ZonedDateTime.We can skip the Instant and get the current ZonedDateTime directly.Always pass that optional time zone argument. If omitted, your JVM\xe2\x80\x99s current default time zone is applied. The default can change at any moment, even during runtime. Do not subject your app to an externality out of your control. Always specify the desired/expected time zone.You can later extract an Instant from the ZonedDateTime.Always use an Instant or ZonedDateTime rather than a LocalDateTime when you want an actual moment on the timeline. The Local\xe2\x80\xa6 types purposely have no concept of time zone so they represent only a rough idea of a possible moment. To get an actual moment you must assign a time zone to transform the Local\xe2\x80\xa6 types into a ZonedDateTime and thereby make it meaningful.The LocalDate class represents a date-only value without time-of-day and without time zone.To generate a String representing the date-time value, simply call toString on the java.time classes for the standard ISO 8601 formats.\xe2\x80\xa6 or \xe2\x80\xa6The ZonedDateTime class extends the standard format by wisely appending the name of the time zone in square brackets.For other formats, search Stack Overflow for many Questions and Answers on the DateTimeFormatter class.Contrary to the comment on the Question by RamanSB, you should not use LocalDateTime class for the current date-time.The LocalDateTime purposely lacks any time zone or offset-from-UTC information. So, this is not appropriate when you are tracking a specific moment on the timeline. Certainly not appropriate for capturing the current moment. The \xe2\x80\x9cLocal\xe2\x80\x9d wording is counter-intuitive. It means any locality rather than any one specific locality. For example Christmas this year starts at midnight on the 25th of December: 2017-12-25T00:00:00, to be represented as a LocalDateTime. But this means midnight at various points around the globe at different times. Midnight happens first in Kiribati, later in New Zealand, hours more later in India, and so on, with several more hours passing before Christmas begins in France when the kids in Canada are still awaiting that day. Each one of these Christmas-start points would be represented as a separate ZonedDateTime. The java.time framework is built into Java 8 and later. These classes supplant the troublesome old legacy date-time classes such as java.util.Date, Calendar, & SimpleDateFormat.The Joda-Time project, now in maintenance mode, advises migration to the java.time classes.To learn more, see the Oracle Tutorial. And search Stack Overflow for many examples and explanations. Specification is JSR 310.Where to obtain the java.time classes? The ThreeTen-Extra project extends java.time with additional classes. This project is a proving ground for possible future additions to java.time. You may find some useful classes here such as Interval, YearWeek, YearQuarter, and more.It\'s automatically populated with the time it\'s instantiated.I find this to be the best way:1st Understand the java.util.Date class1.1 How to obtain current Date1.2 How to use getTime() methodThis will return the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT for time comparison purposes.1.3 How to format time using SimpleDateFormat classAlso try using different format patterns like "yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss" and select desired pattern. http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html2nd Understand the java.util.Calendar class2.1 Using Calendar Class to obtain current time stamp2.2 Try using setTime and other set methods for set calendar to different date.Source: http://javau91.blogspot.com/Have a look at the Date class. There\'s also the newer Calendar class which is the preferred method of doing many date / time operations (a lot of the methods on Date have been deprecated.)If you just want the current date, then either create a new Date object or call Calendar.getInstance();.As mentioned the basic Date() can do what you need in terms of getting the current time.  In my recent experience working heavily with Java dates there are a lot of oddities with the built in classes (as well as deprecation of many of the Date class methods).  One oddity that stood out to me was that months are 0 index based which from a technical standpoint makes sense, but in real terms can be very confusing.If you are only concerned with the current date that should suffice - however if you intend to do a lot of manipulating/calculations with dates it could be very beneficial to use a third party library (so many exist because many Java developers have been unsatisfied with the built in functionality).I second Stephen C\'s recommendation as I have found Joda-time to be very useful in simplifying my work with dates, it is also very well documented and you can find many useful examples throughout the web.  I even ended up writing a static wrapper class (as DateUtils) which I use to consolidate and simplify all of my common date manipulation.  Use:The print statement will print the time when it is called and not when the SimpleDateFormat was created. So it can be called repeatedly without creating any new objects.you can use date for fet current data. so using SimpleDateFormat get formatYou can use Date object and format by yourself. It is hard to format and need more codes, as a example,output: As you can see this is the worst way you can do it and according to oracle documentation it is deprecated.Oracle doc:The class Date represents a specific instant in time, with millisecond\n  precision.Prior to JDK 1.1, the class Date had two additional functions. It\n  allowed the interpretation of dates as year, month, day, hour, minute,\n  and second values. It also allowed the formatting and parsing of date\n  strings. Unfortunately, the API for these functions was not amenable\n  to internationalization. As of JDK 1.1, the Calendar class should be\n  used to convert between dates and time fields and the DateFormat class\n  should be used to format and parse date strings. The corresponding\n  methods in Date are deprecated.So alternatively, you can use Calendar class,To get current time, you can use:Doc:Like other locale-sensitive classes, Calendar provides a class method,\n  getInstance, for getting a generally useful object of this type.\n  Calendar\'s getInstance method returns a Calendar object whose calendar\n  fields have been initialized with the current date and timeBelow code for to get only dateAlso, Calendar class have Subclasses. GregorianCalendar is a one of them and concrete subclass of Calendar and provides the standard calendar system used by most of the world.Example using GregorianCalendar:You can use SimpleDateFormat, simple and quick way to format date:Read this Jakob Jenkov tutorial: Java SimpleDateFormat.As others mentioned, when we need to do manipulation from dates, we didn\'t had simple and best way or we couldn\'t satisfied built in classes, APIs.As a example, When we need to get different between two dates, when we need to compare two dates(there is in-built method also for this) and many more. We had to use third party libraries. One of the good and popular one is Joda Time.Also read:.\nThe happiest thing is now(in java 8), no one need to download and use libraries for any reasons. A simple example to get current date & time in Java 8,One of the good blog post to read about Java 8 date.And keep remeber to find out more about Java date and time because there is lot more ways and/or useful ways that you can get/use.EDIT:According to @BasilBourque comment, the troublesome old date-time classes such as java.util.Date, java.util.Calendar, and java.text.SimpleTextFormat are now legacy, supplanted by the java.time classes.For java.util.Date, just create a new Date()For java.util.Calendar, uses Calendar.getInstance()For java.time.LocalDateTime, uses LocalDateTime.now()For java.time.LocalDate, uses LocalDate.now()
