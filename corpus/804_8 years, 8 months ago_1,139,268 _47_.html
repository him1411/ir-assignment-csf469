How do I see the type of a variable whether it is unsigned 32 bit, signed 16 bit, etc.?How do I view it?Python doesn\'t have the same types as C/C++, which appears to be your question.Try this:The distinction between int and long goes away in Python 3.0, though.You may be looking for the type() function.See the examples below, but there\'s no "unsigned" type in Python just like Java.Positive integer:Large positive integer:Negative integer:Literal sequence of characters:It is so simple. You do it like this.So if you have a variable, for example:You want to know its type?There are right ways and wrong ways to do just about everything in Python. Here\'s the right way: You can use the __name__ attribute to get the name of the object. (This is one of the few special attributes that you need to use the __dunder__ name to get to - there\'s not even a method for it in the inspect module.)In Python, names that start with underscores are semantically not a part of the public API, and it\'s a best practice for users to avoid using them. (Except when absolutely necessary.)Since type gives us the class of the object, we should avoid getting this directly. :This is usually the first idea people have when accessing the type of an object in a method - they\'re already looking for attributes, so type seems weird. For example:Don\'t. Instead, do type(self):How do I see the type of a variable whether it is unsigned 32 bit, signed 16 bit, etc.?In Python, these specifics are implementation details. So, in general, we don\'t usually worry about this in Python. However, to sate your curiosity...In Python 2, int is usually a signed integer equal to the implementation\'s word width (limited by the system). It\'s usually implemented as a long in C. When integers get bigger than this, we usually convert them to Python longs (with unlimited precision, not to be confused with C longs).For example, in a 32 bit Python 2, we can deduce that int is a signed 32 bit integer:In Python 3, the old int goes away, and we just use (Python\'s) long as int, which has unlimited precision.We can also get some information about Python\'s floats, which are usually implemented as a double in C:Don\'t use __class__, a semantically private attribute, to get the type of a variable. Use type instead. And don\'t worry too much about the implementation details of Python. I\'ve not had to deal with issues around this myself. You probably won\'t either, and if you really do, you should know enough not to be looking to this answer for what to do.One more way using __class__:The question is somewhat ambiguous -- I\'m not sure what you mean by "view". If you are trying to query the type of a native Python object, @atzz\'s answer will steer you in the right direction.However, if you are trying to generate Python objects that have the semantics of primitive C-types, (such as uint32_t, int16_t), use the struct module. You can determine the number of bits in a given C-type primitive thusly:This is also reflected in the array module, which can make arrays of these lower-level types:The maximum integer supported (Python 2\'s int) is given by sys.maxint.There is also sys.getsizeof, which returns the actual size of the Python object in residual memory:For float data and precision data, use sys.float_info:Do you mean in Python or using ctypes?In the first case, you simply cannot - because Python does not have signed/unsigned, 16/32 bit integers.In the second case, you can use type():For more reference on ctypes, an its type, see the official documentation.I also highly recommend the IPython interactive interpreter when dealing with questions like this. It lets you type variable_name? and will return a whole list of information about the object including the type and the doc string for the type.e.g.It may be little irrelevant. but you can check types of an object with isinstance(object, type) as mentioned here.Python doesn\'t have such types as you describe. There are two types used to represent integral values: int, which corresponds to platform\'s int type in C, and long, which is an arbitrary precision integer (i.e. it grows as needed and doesn\'t have an upper limit). ints are silently converted to long if an expression produces result which cannot be stored in int.Examples of simple type checking in Python:Simple, for python 3.4 and abovePython 2.7 and aboveIt really depends on what level you mean. In Python 2.x, there are two integer types, int (constrained to sys.maxint) and long (unlimited precision), for historical reasons. In Python code, this shouldn\'t make a bit of difference because the interpreter automatically converts to long when a number is too large. If you want to know about the actual data types used in the underlying interpreter, that\'s implementation dependent. (CPython\'s are located in Objects/intobject.c and Objects/longobject.c.) To find out about the systems types look at cdleary answer for using the struct module.
