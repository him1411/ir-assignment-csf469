I have an ArrayList with custom objects. Each custom object contains a variety of strings and numbers. I need the array to stick around even if the user leaves the activity and then wants to come back at a later time, however I don\'t need the array available after the application has been closed completely. I save a lot of other objects this way by using the SharedPreferences but I can\'t figure out how to save my entire array this way. Is this possible? Maybe SharedPreferences isn\'t the way to go about this? Is there a simpler method?After API 11 the SharedPreferences Editor accept Sets. You could convert your List into a HashSet or something similar and store it like that. When your read it back, convert it into an ArrayList, sort it if needed and you\'re good to go.You can also serialize your ArrayList and then save/read it to/from SharedPreferences. Below is the solution:EDIT:\nOk, below is the solution to save ArrayList as serialized object to SharedPreferences and then read it from SharedPreferences.Because API supports only storing and retrieving of strings to/from SharedPreferences (after API 11, its simpler), we have to serialize and de-serialize the ArrayList object which has the list of tasks into string.In the addTask() method of the TaskManagerApplication class, we have to get the instance of the shared preference and then store the serialized ArrayList using the putString() method:Similarly we have to retrieve the list of tasks from the preference in the onCreate() method:You can get ObjectSerializer class from Apache Pig project ObjectSerializer.javaSaving Array in SharedPreferences:Loading Array Data from SharedPreferencesUsing this object --> TinyDB--Android-Shared-Preferences-Turbo  its very simple.to putto getYou can convert it to JSON String and store the string in the shared preferences.As @nirav said, best solution is store it in sharedPrefernces as a json text by using Gson utility class. Below sample code:Hey friends I got the solution of above problem without using Gson library. Here I post  source code.1.Variable declaration i.e 2.Variable initialization i.e 3.Store value to sharedPreference using packagesharedPreferences():4.Retrive value of sharedPreference using retriveSharedValue():I hope it will helpful for you...Android SharedPreferances allow you to save primitive types (Boolean, Float, Int, Long, String and StringSet which available since API11) in memory as an xml file.The key idea of any solution would be to convert the data to one of those primitive types.I personally love to convert the my list to json format and then save it as a String in a SharedPreferences value.In order to use my solution you\'ll have to add Google Gson lib.In gradle just add the following dependency (please use google\'s latest version):Save data (where HttpParam is your object):Retrieve Data (where HttpParam is your object):best way is that convert to JSOn string using GSON and save this string to SharedPreference.\nI also use this way to cache responses.You could refer the serializeKey() and deserializeKey() functions from FacebookSDK\'s SharedPreferencesTokenCache class. It converts the supportedType into the JSON object and store the JSON string into SharedPreferences. You could download SDK from hereYou can also convert the arraylist into a String and save that in preferenceYou can save the Arraylist after converting it to string using convertToString method and retrieve the string and convert it to array using convertToArrayAfter API 11 you can save set directly to SharedPreferences though !!! :)Why don\'t you stick your arraylist on an Application class? It only get\'s destroyed when the app is really killed, so, it will stick around for as long as the app is available.The best way i have been able to find is a make a 2D Array of keys and put the custom items of the array in the 2-D array of keys and then retrieve it through the 2D arra on startup.\nI did not like the idea of using string set because most of the android users are still on Gingerbread and using string set requires honeycomb.Sample Code: \nhere ditor is the shared pref editor and rowitem is my custom object.don\'t forget to implement Serializable:https://stackoverflow.com/a/7635154/4639974I have read all answers above. That is all correct but i found a more easy solution as below:1)saving String List in shared-preference>>2)and for getting String List from Shared-preference>>Here Constants.APP_PREFS is the name of the file to open; can not contain path separators.You can convert it to a Map Object to store it, then change the values back to an ArrayList when you retrieve the SharedPreferences.following code is the accepted answer, with a few more lines for new folks (me), eg. shows how to convert the set type object back to arrayList, and additional guidance on what goes before \'.putStringSet\' and \'.getStringSet\'.  (thank you evilone)You can use serialization or Gson library to convert list to string and vice versa and then save string in preferences.Using google\'s Gson library:Using Java serialization:All of the above answers are correct. :) I myself used one of these for my situation. However when I read the question I found that the OP is actually talking about a different scenario than the title of this post, if I didn\'t get it wrong."I need the array to stick around even if the user leaves the activity and then wants to come back at a later time"He actually wants the data to be stored till the app is open, irrespective of user changing screens within the application. "however I don\'t need the array available after the application has been closed completely" But once the application is closed data should not be preserved.Hence I feel using SharedPreferences is not the optimal way for this.What one can do for this requirement is create a class which extends Application class.Using the setter and getter the ArrayList can be accessed from anywhere withing the Application. And the best part is once the app is closed, we do not have to worry about the data being stored. :)It\'s very simple using getStringSet and putStringSet in SharedPreferences, but in my case, I have to duplicate the Set object before I can add anything to the Set. Or else, the Set will not be saved if my app is force closed. Probably because of the note below in the API below. (It saved though if app is closed by back button). Note that you must not modify the set instance returned by this call. The consistency of the stored data is not guaranteed if you do, nor is your ability to modify the instance at all.\n  http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/SharedPreferences.html#getStringSet
