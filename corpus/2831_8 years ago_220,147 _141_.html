I\'m looking to try and symbolicate my iPhone app\'s crash reports.I retrieved the crash reports from iTunes Connect. I have the application binary that I submitted to the App Store and I have the dSYM file that was generated as part of the build.I have all of these files together inside a single directory that is indexed by spotlight.What now?I have tried invoking:and it just outputs the same text that is in the crash report to start with, not symbolicated.Am I doing something wrong?Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks.Steps to analyze crash report from apple:Copy the release .app file which was pushed to the appstore, the .dSYM file that was created at the time of release and the crash report receive from APPLE into a FOLDER.OPEN terminal application and go to the folder created above (using cd command)Run atos -arch armv7 -o APPNAME.app/APPNAME MEMORY_LOCATION_OF_CRASH. The memory location should be the one at which the app crashed as per the report.Ex:  atos -arch armv7  -o \'APPNAME.app\'/\'APPNAME\' 0x0003b508This would show you the exact line, method name which resulted in crash.Ex: [classname functionName:]; -510Symbolicating IPAif we use IPA for symbolicating - just rename the extention .ipa with .zip , extract it then we can get a Payload Folder which contain app. In this case we don\'t need .dSYM file. NoteThis can only work if the app binary does not have symbols stripped. By default release builds stripped the symbols. We can change it in project build settings "Strip Debug Symbols During Copy" to NO.More details see this postAfter reading all these answers here in order to symbolicate a crash log (and finally succeeding) I think there are some points missing here that are really important in order to determine why the invocation of symbolicatecrash does not produce a symbolicated output.There are 3 assets that have to fit together when symbolicating a crash log:Before starting symbolication you should check if all those artifacts match, which means that the crash log belongs to the binary you have and that the debug symbols are the ones produced during the build of that binary.Each binary is referred by a UUID that can be seen in the crash log file:In this extract the crash log belongs to an app binary image named example.app/example with UUID aa5e633efda8346cab92b01320043dc3.You can check the UUID of the binary package you have with dwarfdump:Afterwards you should check if the debug symbols you have also belong to that binary:In this example all assets fit together and you should be able to symbolicate your stacktrace.Proceeding to the symbolicatecrash script:In Xcode 8.3 you should be able to invoke the script viaIf it is not there you may run a find . -name symbolicatecrash in your XCode.app directory to find it.As you can see there are no more parameters given. So the script has to find your application binary and debug symbols by running a spotlight search. It searches the debug symbols with a specific index called com_apple_xcode_dsym_uuids. You can do this search yourself:resp.The first spotlight invocation gives you all indexed dSYM packages and the second one gives you the .dSYM packages with a specific UUID. If spotlight does not find your .dSYM package then symbolicatecrash will neither. If you do all this stuff e.g. in a subfolder of your ~/Desktop spotlight should be able to find everything.If symbolicatecrash finds your .dSYM package there should be a line like the following in symbolicate.log:For finding your .app package a spotlight search like the following is invoked by symbolicatecrash:If symbolicatecrash finds your .app package there should be the following extract in symbolicate.log:If all those resources are found by symbolicatecrash it should print out the symbolicated version of your crash log. If not you can pass in your dSYM and .app files directly.Note: The symbolicated backtrace will be output to terminal, not symbolicate.log.With the latest version of Xcode (3.2.2), you can drag and drop any crash reports into the Device Logs section of the Xcode Organiser and they will automatically by symbolicated for you.  I think this works best if you built that version of the App using Build & Archive (also part of Xcode 3.2.2)I did successfully, Now I want to share with all you guys.These are following steps:Step 1: Create a folder in desktop, I give name it to "CrashReport" and put three files ("MYApp.app", "MyApp.app.dSYM", "MYApp_2013-07-18.crash") in it.Step 2: Open Finder and go to Applications, where you will find the Xcode application, right click on this and Click "Show Package Contents" , after this follow this simple path"Contents->Developer->Platforms->iPhoneOS.platform->Developer->Library->PrivateFrameworks->DTDeviceKit.framework->Versions->A->Resources"OR "Contents->Developer->Platforms->iPhoneOS.platform->Developer->Library->PrivateFrameworks->DTDeviceKitBase.framework->Versions->A->Resources"ORFor Xcode 6 and above the path is\nApplications/Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/DTDeviceKitBase.framework/Versions/A/ResourcesWhere you find "symbolicatecrash" file , copy this and paste it to "CrashReport" folder.Step 3: launch the terminal, run these 3 Commandcd  /Users/mac38/Desktop/CrashReport    and  press Enter buttonexport DEVELOPER_DIR="/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer" and press EnterHappy Coding.. ThanksI use Airbrake in my apps, which does a fairly good job of remote error logging. Here\'s how I symbolicate them with atos if the backtrace needs it:In Xcode (4.2) go to the organizer, right click on the archive from\nwhich the .ipa file was generated. In Terminal, cd into the xcarchive for instance MyCoolApp 10-27-11 1.30 PM.xcarchiveEnter the following atos -arch armv7 -o \'MyCoolApp.app\'/\'MyCoolApp\'\n(don\'t forget the single quotes)I don\'t include my symbol in that call. What you get is a block cursor on an empty line. Then I copy/paste my symbol code at that block cursor and press\nenter.  You\'ll see something like:-[MyCoolVC dealloc] (in MyCoolApp) (MyCoolVC.m:34)You\'re back to a block cursor and you can paste in other symbols.  Being able to go through your backtrace one item without re-entering the first bit is a nice time saver. Enjoy!I also put dsym, app bundle, and crash log together in the same directory before running symbolicate crashThen I use this function defined in my .profile to simplify running symbolicatecrash:The arguments added there may help you.You can check to make sure spotlight "sees" your dysm files by running the command:Look for the dsym you have in your directory.NOTE: As of the latest Xcode, there is no longer a Developer directory. You can find this utility here:/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/DTDeviceKitBase.framework/Vers\xe2\x80\x8c\xe2\x80\x8bions/A/Resources/symbolicatecrashJust a simple and updated answer for xcode 6.1.1 .STEPS1.Xcode>Window>Devices.2.Select a device from a list of devices under DEVICES section.3.Select View Device Logs.4.Under the All Logs section you can directly drag drop the report.crash 5.Xcode will automatically Symbolicate the crash report for you.6.You can find the Symbolicated crash report by matching its Date/Time with the Date/Time mentioned in your crash report.Even though I had been developing apps for a few years now, this was my first time debugging a binary and I felt like a complete NOOB figuring out where all the files were i.e. where is *.app *.dSYM and crash logs?  I had to read multiple posts in order to figure it out. Picture is worth a thousand words and I hope this post helps anyone else in future.1- First go to itunesconnect and download your crash logs. \nNOTE: Is most cases you may get something like "Too few reports have been submitted for a report to be shown." Basically not enough users have submitted crash log reports to Apple in which case you can\'t do much of anything at that point.2- Now if you had not changed your code since you had submitted your binary it to Apple then Launch Xcode for that project and do Product --> Archive again. Otherwise just find your latest submitted binary and right click on it.Connect an iOS device to your Mac (yes a physical one, yes I know this is stupid)Choose "Devices" from the "Window" menu\nClick your device on the left and VIEW DEVICE LOGS on the right\nWait. It might take a minute to show up. Maybe doing Command-A then Delete will speed this up.Critical undocumented step: rename the crash report that you got from iTunesConnect from .txt extension to .crash extensionDrag the crash report into that area on the left\nAnd then Xcode will symbolicate the crash report and display the results.Source: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/tn2151/_index.htmlUsing XCode 4, the task is even simpler :and voil\xc3\xa0.  The log file is imported and Symbolized automatically for you.  Provided you Archived the build using XCode -> Product -> Archive firstIn XCode 4.2.1, open Organizer, then go to Library/Device Logs and drag your .crash file into the list of crash logs.  It will be symbolicated for you after a few seconds.  Note that you must use the same instance of XCode that the original build was archived on (i.e. the archive for your build must exist in Organizer).  The Magical XCode Organizer isn\'t that magical about symbolicating my app. I got no symbols at all for the crash reports that I got back from Apple from a failed app submission. I tried using the command-line, putting the crash report in the same folder as the .app file (that I submitted to the store) and the .dSYM file:This only provided symbols for my app and not the core foundation code, but it was better than the number dump that Organizer is giving me and was enough for me to find and fix the crash that my app had. If anyone knows how to extend this to get Foundation symbols it would be appreciated.In my case, I was dragging crash reports directly from Mail to the Organizer. For some reason, that prevented the crash reports from getting symbolicated (I\'d love to know why). Copying the crash reports to the Desktop first, and then dragging them from there to the Organizer got them symbolicated properly.Very specific case, I know. But thought I\'d share just in case.Here\'s another issue I have with symbolicatecrash \xe2\x80\x93 it won\'t work with Apps that have spaces in their bundle (i.e. \'Test App.app\'). Note I don\'t think you can have spaces in their name when submitting so you should remove these anyway, but if you already have crashes that need analysing, patch symbolicatecrash (4.3 GM) as such:For those using Airbrake, there\'s a solid response above but it wouldn\'t work for me without tweaking: Works for some memory addresses but not others, not sure why...The combination that worked for me was:Using atos I wasn\'t able to resolve the correct symbol information with the addresses and offsets that were in the crash report. When I did this, I see something more meaningful, and it seems to be a legitimate stack trace.I had to do a lot of hacking of the symbolicatecrash script to get it to run properly.As far as I can tell, symbolicatecrash right now requires the .app to be in the same directory as the .dsym.  It will use the .dsym to locate the .app, but it won\'t use the dsym to find the symbols.You should make a copy of your symbolicatecrash before attempting these patches which will make it look in the dsym:Around line 212 in the getSymbolPathFor_dsymUuid functionAround line 265 in the matchesUUID functionThis is simple, after searching a lot i found clear steps to symbolicate whole crash log file.happy coding,\nRiyaz In order to symbolicate crashes, Spotlight must be able to find the .dSYM file that was generated at the same time the binary you submitted to Apple was. Since it contains the symbol information, you will be out of luck if it isn\'t available.I got a bit grumpy about the fact nothing here seems to "just work" so I did some investigating and the result is:Set up: QuincyKit back end that receives reports. No symbolication set up as I couldn\'t even begin to figure out what they were suggesting I do to make it work.The fix: download crash reports from the server online. They\'re called \'crash\' and by default go into the ~/Downloads/ folder. With that in mind, this script will "do the right thing" and the crash reports will go into Xcode (Organizer, device logs) and symbolication will be done.The script:Things can be automated to where you can drag and drop in Xcode Organizer by doing two things if you do use QuincyKit/PLCR. Firstly, you have to edit the remote script admin/actionapi.php ~line 202. It doesn\'t seem to get the timestamp right, so the file ends up with the name \'crash\' which Xcode doesn\'t recognize (it wants something dot crash):Secondly, in the iOS side in QuincyKit BWCrashReportTextFormatter.m ~line 176, change @"[TODO]" to @"TODO" to get around the bad characters.atos is being deprecated so if you are running OSX 10.9 or later you may need to runxcrun atosWarning: /usr/bin/atos is moving and will be removed from a future OS\n  X release. It is now available in the Xcode developer tools to be\n  invoked via: xcrun atosI like to use Textwrangler to pinpoint errors in an original app upload binary rejection. (The crash data will be found in your itunesConnect account.)  Using Sachin\'s method above I copy the original.crash to TextWrangler, then copy the symbolicatecrash file I\'ve created to another TextWrangler file. Comparing the two files pinpoints differences. The symbolicatecrash file will have differences which point out the file and line number of problems.I prefer a script that will symbolicate all my crash logs.Create a folder and put there 4 things:symbolicatecrash perl script - there are many SO answers that tells it\'s locationThe archive of the build that match the crashes (from Xcode Organizer. simple as Show in Finder and copy) [I don\'t sure this is necessery]All the xccrashpoint packages - (from Xcode Organizer. Show in Finder, you may copy all the packages in the directory, or the single xccrashpoint you would like to symbolicate)Add that short script to the directory:When you run the script, you\'ll get 2 directories.allCrashes - all the crashes from all the xccrashpoint will be there.symboledCrashes - the same crashes but now with all the symbols.you DON\'T need to clean the directory from old crashes before running the script. it will clean automatically. good luck!
