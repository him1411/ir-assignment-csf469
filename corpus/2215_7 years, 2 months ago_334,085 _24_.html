What\'s the best way to limit the text length of an EditText in Android?Is there a way to do this via xml?DocumentationExampleuse an input filter to limit the max length of a text view.A note to people who are already using a custom input filter and also want to limit the max length: When you assign input filters in code all previously set input filters are cleared, including one set with android:maxLength. I found this out when attempting to use a custom input filter to prevent the use of some characters that we don\'t allow in a password field. After setting that filter with setFilters the maxLength was no longer observed. The solution was to set maxLength and my custom filter together programmatically. Something like this:Only for Android:For anyone else wondering how to achieve this, here is my extended EditText class EditTextNumeric..setMaxLength(int) - sets maximum number of digits.setMaxValue(int) - limit maximum integer value.setMin(int) - limit minimum integer value.getValue() - get integer valueExample usage:All other methods and attributes that apply to EditText, of course work too.Due to goto10\'s observation, I put together the following code to protected against loosing other filters with setting the max length:Another way you can achieve this is by adding the following definition to the XML file:This will limit the maximum length of the EditText widget to 6 characters.This works fine...android:maxLength="10"this will accept only 10 characters.This is a custom EditText Class that allow Length filter to live along with other filters.\nThanks to Tim Gallagher\'s Answer (below)it simple way in xml:if u require to set 4 character in xml edit-text so,use this
