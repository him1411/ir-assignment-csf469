I have a kind of open-ended question..I want to have a HTML code based on condition (desktop/ipad)..say Condition 1/Condition 2I want to have separate HTML snippets for each of these conditions...The condition I want to test (in JS) is;Now this has to be implemented in a .jsp page...So how do I do that? Should I use JSTL ? \nWhat is the best way?The main thing is that only corresponding code should actually be loaded/rendered \ne.g. if condition 1 is true, the HTML code in condition 2 should not be executed at all (apart from being hidden in the browser)Should I use JSTL ? Yes.You can use <c:if> and <c:choose> tags to make conditional rendering in jsp using JSTL.To simulate if , you can use:To simulate if...else, you can use:If you just want to output different text, a more concise example would be It is way shorter than c:choose.The construct for this is:If the condition isn\'t expensive, I sometimes prefer to simply use two distinct <c:if tags - it makes it easier to read.In case you want to compare strings, write the following JSTL:If you want to do the following by using JSTL Tag Libe, please follow the following steps:[Requirement] if a number is a grater than equal 40 and lower than 50 then display "Two digit number starting with 4" otherwise "Other numbers".[Solutions]
