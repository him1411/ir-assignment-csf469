I have a hidden DIV which contains a toolbar-like menu.I have a number of DIVs which are enabled to show the menu DIV when the mouse hovers over them.Is there a built-in function which will move the menu DIV to the top right of the active (mouse hover) DIV? I\'m looking for something like $(menu).position("topright", targetEl);tl;dr: (try it here)If you have the following HTML:then you can use the following JavaScript code:But it doesn\'t work!This will work as long as the menu and the placeholder have the same offset parent. If they don\'t, and you don\'t have nested CSS rules that care where in the DOM the #menu element is, use:just before the line that positions the #menu element.But it still doesn\'t work!You might have some weird layout that doesn\'t work with this approach. In that case, just use jQuery.ui\'s position plugin (as mentioned in an answer below), which handles every conceivable eventuality. Note that you\'ll have to show() the menu element before calling position({...}); the plugin can\'t position hidden elements.Update notes 3 years later in 2012:(The original solution is archived here for posterity)So, it turns out that the original method I had here was far from ideal. In particular, it would fail if:Luckily, jQuery introduced methods (position() and outerWidth()) way back in 1.2.6 that make finding the right values in the latter case here a lot easier. For the former case, appending the menu element to the placeholder works (but will break CSS rules based on nesting).You can now use:For fast positioning (jQuery UI/Position).NOTE: This requires jQuery UI (not just jQuery).You can download jQuery UI here.This is what worked for me in the end.Here is a jQuery function I wrote that helps me position elements.Here is an example usage:The code above aligns the bottom-right of #el1 with the top-right of #el2. [\'cc\', \'cc\'] would center #el1 in #el2. Make sure that #el1 has the css of position: absolute and z-index: 10000 (or some really large number) to keep it on top.The offset option allows you to nudge the coordinates by a specified number of pixels.The source code is below:Why complicating too much? Solution is very simplecss:jquery:It works even if,You can use the jQuery plugin PositionCalculatorThat plugin has also included collision handling (flip), so the toolbar-like menu can be placed at a visible position.for that markup:Here is the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/QrrpB/1657/Something like this?This works for me:
