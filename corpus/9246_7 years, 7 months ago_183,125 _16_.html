I\'m trying to plot a figure without tickmarks or numbers on either of the axes (I use axes in the traditional sense, not the matplotlib nomenclature!). An issue I have come across is where matplotlib adjusts the x(y)ticklabels by subtracting a value N, then adds N at the end of the axis.This may be vague, but the following simplified example highlights the issue, with \'6.18\' being the offending value of N:The three things I would like to know are:How to turn off this behaviour in the first place (although in most cases it is useful, it is not always!) I have looked through matplotlib.axis.XAxis and cannot find anything appropriateHow can I make N disappear (i.e. X.set_visible(False))Is there a better way to do the above anyway? My final plot would be 4x4 subplots in a figure, if that is relevant.Instead of hiding each element, you can hide the whole axis:Or, you can set the ticks to an empty list:In this second option, you can still use plt.xlabel() and plt.ylabel() to add labels to the axes.If you want to hide just the axis text keeping the grid lines:Doing set_visible(False) or set_ticks([]) will also hide the grid lines.Somewhat of an old thread but, this seems to be a faster method using the latest version of matplotlib:set the major formatter for the x-axisIf you are like me and don\'t always retrieve the axes, ax, when plotting the figure, then a simple solution would be to do I was not actually able to render an image without borders or axis data based on any of the code snippets here (even the one accepted at the answer). After digging through some API documentation, I landed on this code to render my imageI used the tick_params call to basically shut down any extra information that might be rendered and I have a perfect graph in my output file :). Hope this helps!
