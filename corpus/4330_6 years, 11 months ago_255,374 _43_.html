How do I get the apk file from an android device? Or how do I transfer the apk file from device to system?Use adb. With adb pull   you can copy files from your device to your system, when the device is attached with USB.Of course you also need the right permissions to access the directory your file is in. If not, you will need to root the device first.None of these suggestions worked for me, because Android was appending a sequence number to the package name to produce the final APK file name (this may vary with the version of Android OS). The following sequence of commands is what worked for me on a non-rooted device:1) Determine the package name of the app, e.g. "com.example.someapp". Skip this step if\nyou already know the package name.Look through the list of package names and try to find a match between the app in question and the package name. This is usually easy, but note that the package name can be completely unrelated to the app name. If you can\'t recognize the app from the list of package names, try finding the app in Google Play using a browser. The URL for an app in Google Play contains the package name.2) Get the full path name of the APK file for the desired package.The output will look something like this: package:/data/app/com.example.someapp-2.apk3) Pull the APK file from the Android device to the development box.No root is required:This code will get 3rd party packages path with the name so you can easily identify your APKthe output will be package:/data/app/XX.XX.XX.apk=YY.YY.YYnow pull that package using below code:if you executed above cmd in C:>\\ , then you will find that package there.I\'ve seen that many solutions to this problem either you have to root your phone or you have to install an app. Then after much googling I got this solution for non rooted/rooted phones.To list which apps you got so far.Then you may select an app, for instance twitterAn important thing here is to not set up a password for encrypt your backupThis is going to create a file named as backup.ap, but you still can\'t open it. For this you got to extract it again but using the dd command.After this all you have to do is to extract the tar content and it\'s done.Hope it works for you guysCompleting @Yojimbo \'s answer, this is what I did (Linux/Mac only, will not work out of the box on Windows... maybe in git\'s bash shell):This is ugly bash, but works :)EDIT:\nIt no longer works on AndroidM: all files are named "base.apk" under another dir. Should be "trivial" to fix.As said above, you can get the apk by using the pull command in adb. Since, you are talking about your installed applications, go ahead and look in the /data/app directory of your Android filesystem. You will find the APK\'s there. Then use the adb command - adb pull /data/data/appname.apkIf you know (or if you can "guess") the path to the .apk (it seems to be of the format /data/app/com.example.someapp-{1,2,..}.apk to , then you can just copy it from /data/app as well. This worked even on my non-rooted, stock Android phone.Just use a Terminal Emulator app (such as this one) and run:Then you can move it from the SD-card to wherever you want (or attach it to an email etc). The last bit might be technically optional, but it makes your life a lot easier when trying to do something with the .apk file.The procedures outlined here do not work for Android 7 (Nougat) [and possibly Android 6, but I\'m unable to verify]. You can\'t pull the .apk files directly under Nougat (unless in root mode, but that requires a rooted phone). But, you can copy the .apk to an alternate path (say /sdcard/Download) on the phone using adb shell, then you can do an adb pull from the alternate path.On unix systems, you can try this function:Here\'s how you do it: Download and install APK Extractor in your device. It is free, and is compatible in almost all of the Android devices. Another plus point is it does not even require root or anything to work.\nAfter you have it installed, launch it. There you will see a list of apps which are in your device, which include the apps you\xe2\x80\x99ve installed later, along with the system apps. Long press any app you want to extract (you can select multiple or all apps at once), and click on the extract option you see in the top. You will also have the option to share via Bluetooth or messaging.\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re done, you will see the extracted apps as AppName_AppPackage_AppVersionName_AppVersionCode.apk, which will be saved in the path /sdcard/ExtractedApks/ by default.For detailed description for how to extract apk files in android, visit: http://appslova.com/how-to-extract-apk-files-in-android/ All these answers require multiple steps for each apk file retrieved from the device.  1. determine package name, 2. find the file, and 3. download it.  I built a simple apk_grabber python script to do this for any app that matches a given regex, and then decompiles those apks into jar files.I haven\'t used code to pull .apk file from mobile but i have been using software to extract .apk file from mobile and software i have used are below with google play link:Hope it helps You.I have a simple and easy to use answer.Download the application App Share/Send Pro from google play store. Select the app you want to send and method send application.I usually use Bluetooth to send applications to my pc or another phone.Hope this will help for someone who is looking for a non technical answer
