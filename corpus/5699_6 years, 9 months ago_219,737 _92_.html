I am using Authlogic-Connect for third party logins. After running appropriate migrations, Twitter/Google/yahoo logins seem to work fine but the facebook login throws exception:The dev log shows Please suggest..I ran into a similar problem when trying to use the JQuery generator for Rails 3I solved it like this:Get the CURL Certificate Authority (CA) bundle. You can do this with:Execute the ruby code that is trying to verify  the SSL certification: SSL_CERT_FILE=/opt/local/etc/certs/cacert.pem rails generate jquery:install. In your case, you want to either set this as an environment variable somewhere the server picks it up or add something like ENV[\'SSL_CERT_FILE\'] = /path/to/your/new/cacert.pem in your environment.rb file.You can also just install the CA files (I haven\'t tried this) to the OS -- there are lengthy instructions here -- this should work in a similar fashion, but I have not tried this personally.Basically, the issue you are hitting is that some web service is responding with a certificate signed against a CA that OpenSSL cannot verify.If you\'re using RVM on OS X, you probably need to run this:More information here: http://rvm.io/support/fixing-broken-ssl-certificatesAnd here is the full explanation: https://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/blob/master/help/osx-ssl-certs.mdOn Ruby 2.2, you may have to reinstall Ruby from source to fix this. Here\'s how (replace 2.2.3 with your Ruby version):Credit to https://stackoverflow.com/a/32363597/4353 and Ian Connor.Here\'s how you can fix it on Windows: https://gist.github.com/867550 (created by Fletcher Nichol)Excerpt:Download the cacert.pem file from http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem. Save this file to C:\\RailsInstaller\\cacert.pem.Now make ruby aware of your certificate authority bundle by setting SSL_CERT_FILE. To set this in your current command prompt session, type:To make this a permanent setting, add this in your control panel.Ruby can\'t find any root certificates to trust.Take a look at this blog post for a solution: "Ruby 1.9 and the SSL error".The solution is to install the curl-ca-bundle port which contains the same root certificates used by Firefox:and tell your https object to use it:Note that if you want your code to run on Ubuntu, you need to set the ca_path attribute instead, with the default certificates location /etc/ssl/certs.The issue is that ruby can not find a root certificate to trust. As of 1.9 ruby checks this. You will need to make sure that you have the curl certificate on your system in the form of a pem file. You will also need to make sure that the certificate is in the location that ruby expects it to be. You can get this certificate at...If your a RVM and OSX user then your certificate file location will vary based on what version of ruby your using. Setting the path explicitly with :ca_path is a BAD idea as your code will not be portable when it gets to production. There for you want to provide ruby with a certificate in the default location(and assume your dev ops guys know what they are doing). You can use dtruss to work out where the system is looking for the certificate file. In my case the system was looking for the cert file inhowever MACOSX system would expect a certificate inI copied the downloaded cert to this path and it worked. HTHThe reason that you get this error on OSX is the rvm-installed ruby. If you run into this issue on OSX you can find a really broad explanation of it in this blog post:http://toadle.me/2015/04/16/fixing-failing-ssl-verification-with-rvm.htmlThe short version is that, for some versions of Ruby, RVM downloads pre-compiled binaries, which look for certificates in the wrong location. By forcing RVM to download the source and compile on your own machine, you ensure that the configuration for the certificate location is correct.The command to do this is:if you already have the version in question, you can re-install it with: (obviously, substitute your ruby version as needed).The new certified gem is designed to fix this:https://github.com/stevegraham/certifiedOn Mac OS X Lion with the latest macport:Then, rerun the failed job.  Note, the cert file location seems to have changed since Eric G answered on May 12.A one liner fixes it for Windows in an Admin prompt choco install wget (first see chocolatey.org)Or just do this:Milanio\'s method:Well this worked for me Something is wrong with openssl implementation of my ubuntu 12.04Just add gem \'certified\' in your gemfile and run bundle install.I\'ve try install curl-ca-bundle with brew, but the package is no available more:The solution that worked to me on Mac was:Add this line in your ~/.bash_profile (or ~/.zshrc for zsh):Then update your terminal:Here\'s another option for debugging purposes.  Be sure never to use this in any production environment, as it will negate benefits of using SSL in the first place.  It is only ever valid to do this in your local development environment.While knowing it\'s rather a lame solution, I\'m still sharing this because it seems like very few people answering here use Windows, and I think some of Windows users (me included) would appreciate a simple and intuitive approach.That tells where your openssl is looking for the cert file. My name is not Luis, but mine was C:/Users/Luis/Code/luislavena/knap-build/var/knapsack/software/x86-windows/openssl/1.0.0l/ssl/cert.pem. The path may be different depending on each own environments (e.g. openknapsack instead of luislavena).The path didn\'t change even after set SSL_CERT_FILE=C:\\foo\\bar\\baz\\cert.pem via the console, so... I created the directory C:\\Users\\Luis\\Code\\luislavena\\knap-build\\var\\knapsack\\software\\x86-windows\\openssl\\1.0.0l\\ssl in my local disk and put a cert file into it. Lame as it is, this will surely work.I had this same issue while working on a Ruby project. I am using Windows 7 64bit. I resolved this by:source: https://gist.github.com/fnichol/867550The most straightforward answer which worked for me was this And voila!!!OS X 10.8.x with Homebrew:Then, as this blog post suggests,"How to Cure Net::HTTP\xe2\x80\x99s Risky Default HTTPS Behavior"you might want to install the always_verify_ssl_certificates gem that allow you to set a default value for ca_file.This worked for me. If you using rvm and brew: I ran into this issue and the suggested fix of rvm osx-ssl-certs update all did not work despite that I am an RVM user on OSX. The fix that worked for me was re-installing the latest version of openssl:OSX solution: install latest rvm stable versionuse rvm command to solve the certificates automaticallyI fixed this problem by running this in terminal. Full writeup is available over hereHere\'s what I did that helped if you are specifically having a problem on Leopard.My cert was old and needed to be updated. I downloaded this:http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pemThen replaced my cert which was found here on Leopard:Reload whatever you have that\'s accessing it and you should be good to go!Just because instructions were a slight bit different for what worked for me, I thought I add my 2 cents:I\'m on OS X Lion and using macports and rvmI installed curl-ca-bundle:Then I adjusted my omniauth config to be this:If you have a symbolic link in the /usr/local/etc/openssl pointing to cert.pem try to do this:I had trouble for a number of days and was hacking around. This link proved out to be extremely helpful for me. It helped me to do a successful upgrade of the SSL on MAC OS X 9.\nAdding gem \'certified\', \'~> 1.0\' to my Gemfile and running bundle solved this issue for me.If you are running your rails app locally then just add this line at the bottom of application.rb.After this you can use the app without any issues. You may call it a hack but it is not recommended. Use only when you need to run locallyJust run the certified-update executable and this command will make sure that all your certificates are up-to-date.This worked for my Ruby on Rails application in Windows.I had to reinstall Ruby. This should solve it if you are using Ubuntu & rbenv:For more information, check out the rbenv Wiki on the matter.
