I spent an unrealistic amount of time trying to fire a function when the tab changes of the bootstrap 3 tab/navbar and literally all suggestions google spat out were wrong/did not work.How to go about this?Meta-edit: see commentEric Saupe knows how to do it:\nhttp://ericsaupe.com/tag/bootstrap-3-tabs-example-ajax/the problem is that attr(\'href\') is never empty.Or to compare the #id = "#some value" and then call the ajax. Thanks to @Gerben\'s post came to know there are two events show.bs.tab (before the tab is shown) and shown.bs.tab (after the tab is shown) as explained in the docs - Bootstrap Tab usageAn additional solution if we\'re only interested in a specific tab, and maybe add separate functions without having to add an if - else block in one function, is to use the a href selector (maybe along with additional selectors if required)demoTo add to Mosh Feu answer, if the tabs where created on the fly like in my case, you would use the following codeI hope this helps someoneThis worked for me.
