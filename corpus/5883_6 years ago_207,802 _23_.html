We have recently upgraded to IIS7 as a core web server and I need an overview in terms of the permissions. Previously, when needing to write to the file system I would have give the AppPool user (Network Service) access to the directory or file. In IIS7 I see, as default, the AppPool user is set to ApplicationPoolIdentity. So when I check the task-manager, I see that a user account called \'WebSite.com\' is running the IIS Process (\'Website.com\' being the name of the website in IIS)However this user account doesn\'t exist if I try to use that to give permissions. So, how do I determine which user to give the permissions too? Edit ==============================================================================See below for the problem in screen shot. Our website (www.silverchip.co.uk) runs on the username SilverChip.co.uk. However when I add pemissions, this user doenst exist!=================================See AppPool ImageApplicationPoolIdentity is actually the best practice to use in IIS7. It is a dynamically created, unprivileged account. To add file system security for a particular application pool see IIS.net\'s "Application Pool Identities". The quick version:If you application pool is named "DefaultAppPool" (just replace this text below if it is named differently)Remember to use the server\'s local name, not the domain name, when resolving the name "IIS AppPool\\DefaultAppPool" (just a reminder because this tripped me up for a bit):On Windows Server 2008(r2) you can\'t assign an application pool identity to a folder through Properties->Security. You can do it through an admin command prompt using the following though:Giving access to the IIS AppPool\\YourAppPoolName user may be not enough with IIS default configurations. In my case, I still had the error HTTP Error 401.3 - Unauthorized after adding the AppPool user and it was fixed only after adding permissions to the IUSR user.This is necessary because, by default, Anonymous access is done using the IUSR. You can set another specific user, the Application Pool or continue using the IUSR, but don\'t forget to set the appropriate permissions.Credits to this answer: HTTP Error 401.3 - UnauthorizedJust to add to the confusion, the (Windows Explorer) Effective Permissions dialog doesn\'t work for these logins.\nI have a site "Umbo4" using pass-through authentication, and looked at the user\'s Effective Permissions in the site root folder.\nThe Check Names test resolved the name "IIS AppPool\\Umbo4", but the Effective Permissions shows that the user had no permissions at all on the folder (all checkboxes unchecked).I then excluded this user from the folder explicitly, using the Explorer Security tab.\nThis resulted in the site failing with a HTTP 500.19 error, as expected. The Effective Permissions however looked exactly as before.Top Answer from Jon AdamsHere is how to implement this for the PowerShell folksI fixed all my asp.net problems simply by creating a new user called IUSER with a password and added it the Network Service and User Groups. Then create all your virtual sites and applications set authentication to IUSER with its password..  set high level file access to include IUSER and BAM it fixed at least 3-4 issues including this one..
