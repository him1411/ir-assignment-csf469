I do a catalog using Bootstrap 3. When displayed on tablets, the product images look ugly because of their small size (500x500) and a width of 767 pixels in the browser. I want to put the image in the center of the screen, but for some reason I can not. Who be will help solve the problem?If you\'re using Bootstrap v3.0.1 or greater, you should use this solution instead. It doesn\'t override Bootstrap\'s styles with custom CSS, but instead uses a Bootstrap feature.My original answer is shown below for posterityThis is a pleasantly easy fix. Because .img-responsive from Bootstrap already sets display: block, you can use margin: 0 auto to center the image:There is .center-block class in Twitter Bootstrap 3 (Since v3.0.1), so use:Add only the class center-block to an image, this works with Bootstrap 4 as well:Note: center-block does not work when img-responsive is usedJust use .text-center class if you\'re using Bootstrap 3.Note: This doesn\'t work with img-responsiveI would suggest a more "abstract" classification. Add a new class "img-center" which can be used in combination with .img-responsive class:This should center the image as well as make it responsive.You can still work with img-responsive without impacting other images with this style class.You can precede this tag with the section id/ div id/class to define a order within which this img is nested. This custom img-responsive will work only in that area.Suppose you have a HTML area defined as:Then, your CSS can be:Note: This answer is in relation to the potential impact of altering img-responsive as a whole. Of course, center-block is the simplest solution.To add to the answers already given, having the img-responsive in combination with img-thumbnail will set display: block to display: inline block..Try this code it will work for small icons too with bootstrap 4 because there is no center-block class is bootstrap 4 so try this method it will be helpful. You can change the position of the image by setting the .col-md-12 to .col-md-8 or .col-md-4, it\'s upto you.Try this:You can fix it with defining margin:0 autoor you can use col-md-offset alsoThe more exact way applied to all Booostrap objects using standard classes only would be to not set top and bottom margins (as image can inherit these from parent), so I am always using:I have also made a Gist for that, so if any changes will apply because of any bugs, update version will be always here:\nhttps://gist.github.com/jdrda/09a38bf152dd6a8aff4151c58679cc66
