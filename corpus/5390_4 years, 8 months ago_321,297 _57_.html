How do I ignore the following error message on git pull?Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by mergeWhat if I want to overwrite them?I\'ve tried things like git pull -f, but nothing works.To be clear, I only want to overwrite specific changes, not everything.If you want remove all local changes from your working copy, simply stash them:If you don\'t need them anymore, you now can drop that stash:If you want to overwrite only specific parts of your local changes, there are two possibilities:Alright with the help of the other two answers I\'ve come up with a direct solution:This works for me to override all local changes and does not require an identity:Here is a solution that throws away changes:You can either commit your changes before you do the merge, or you stash them:My solution to solve this issue was:Then I could overwrite the file just using:If your repo contains few files which is removed from master:In the recent Git, you can add -r/--rebase on pull command to rebase your current branch on top of the upstream branch after fetching. The warning should disappear, but there is a risk that you\'ll get some conflicts which you\'ll need to solve.Alternatively you can checkout different branch with force, then go back to master again, e.g.:Then pull it again as usual:Using this method can save you time from stashing (git stash) and potential permission issues, reseting files (git reset HEAD --hard), removing files (git clean -fd), etc. Also the above it\'s easier to remember.You can use this for overwrite fileSometimes, none of these work.  Annoyingly, due to the LF thing I think, what will work is deleting the files, then pulling.  Not that I recommend this solution, but if the file doesn\'t exist, git won\'t uselessly inform you that your changes (which may not even be changes) will get overridden, and will let you continue.Use at your own risk.If you want to overwrite specific changes, you need some way of telling it which ones you want to forget.You could try selectively stashing the changes you want to abandon using git stash --patch and then dropping that stash with git stash drop. You can then pull in the remote changes and merge them as normal.I had a special case of this: I had a file with --assume-unchanged on it. It was hard to locate, as the git status command was not showing any changes The best way to solve this problem is:After that you can overwrite the file by:This worked for me to discard changes in the live remote server and pull from the source control github I was ignoring a file in my repo and when I did git pull upstream master I got the following error:error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:\n  myfile.js\n  Please, commit your changes or stash them before you can merge.\n  AbortingTo resolve it I did the followingI then did git status and got this messageOn branch master Your branch is behind \'origin/master\' by 4 commits,\n  and can be fast-forwarded.   (use "git pull" to update your local\n  branch)Changes not staged for commit:   (use "git add ..." to update\n  what will be committed)   (use "git checkout -- ..." to discard\n  changes in working directory)modified:   myfile.jsno changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")Then I did git checkout myfile.js followed by git pull upstream master. This time the git pull operation was successful.If you want to keep production changes on the server, just merge into a new configuration items, processing method is as follows:\n\ngit stash\ngit pull\ngit stash pop\n\nmaybe you don\'t  exe all operation,you can know what you can do nextIf this error is because of line endings,will  work. I\'m not really sure why it works.I encountered this when pulling from the master.The way I handle it. Using Visual Studio, Hope this helps!Me and my colleague(Sagheer Rajpar) experienced the same issue and here is how we solved it.Problem Statement We was working on my project and changes around more than 10 files. Then we tried to PULL (git pull origin master) the project and and GIT shouted. error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten\n  by merge: Please, commit your changes or stash them before you can\n  merge.We tried to commit and then did pull but the didn\'t work also.\nThen tried no of commands using Google but nothing worked.SolutionWe was in a DIRTY stage actually, because the files were in "Staging Area" a.k.a "Index Area" and some were in "Head Area" a.k.a "local GIT directory". And we wanted to pull the changes from server.Check this link for information about different stages of Git in a clear manner GIT StagesWe followed the following stepsLets Understand When and Why you need Stashing If you are in DIRTY state, means you are making changes in your different files and then you are compelled, due to any reason, to PULL or Switch to another branch for some very Urgent work, then you can\'t PULL or Switch until you commit your change. Stash command is here as a helping hand.From the book ProGIT 2nd EditionOften, when you\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on part of your project, things are in\n  a messy state and you want to switch branches for a bit to work on\n  something else. The problem is, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do a commit of\n  half-done work just so you can get back to this point later. The\n  answer to this issue is the git stash command. Stashing takes the\n  dirty state of your working directory \xe2\x80\x93 that is, your modified tracked\n  files and staged changes \xe2\x80\x93 and saves it on a stack of unfinished\n  changes that you can reapply at any time.Hope this will be beneficial for you guys.
