I have several methods all with the same signature (parameters and return values) but different names and the internals of the methods are different.  I want to pass the name of the method to run to another method that will invoke the passed in method.This code does not work but this is what I am trying to do.  What I don\'t understand is how to write the RunTheMethod code since I need to define the parameter.You can use the Func delegate in .net 3.5 as the parameter in your RunTheMethod method. The Func delegate allows you to specify a method that takes a number of parameters of a specific type and returns a single argument of a specific type. Here is an example that should work:You need to use a delegate. In this case all your methods take a string parameter and return an int - this is most simply represented by the Func<string, int> delegate1. So your code can become correct with as simple a change as this:Delegates have a lot more power than this, admittedly. For example, with C# you can create a delegate from a lambda expression, so you could invoke your method this way:That will create an anonymous function like this:and then pass that delegate to the RunTheMethod method.You can use delegates for event subscriptions, asynchronous execution, callbacks - all kinds of things. It\'s well worth reading up on them, particularly if you want to use LINQ. I have an article which is mostly about the differences between delegates and events, but you may find it useful anyway.1 This is just based on the generic Func<T, TResult> delegate type in the framework; you could easily declare your own:and then make the parameter be of type MyDelegateType instead.You can also try Action Delegate!And then call your method using Or         Then simply call methodUsage:You should use a Func<string, int> delegate, that represents a function taking a string as argument and returning an int:Then use it:If you want the ability to change which method is called at run time I would recommend using a delegate:  http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/delegates_step1.aspxIt will allow you to create an object to store the method to call and you can pass that to your other methods when it\'s needed.While the accepted answer is absolutely correct, I would like to provide an additional method.I ended up here after doing my own searching for a solution to a similar question.\nI am building a plugin driven framework, and as part of it I wanted people to be able to add menu items to the applications menu to a generic list without exposing an actual Menu object because the framework may deploy on other platforms that don\'t have Menu UI objects. Adding general info about the menu is easy enough, but allowing the plugin developer enough liberty to create the callback for when the menu is clicked was proving to be a pain. Until it dawned on me that I was trying to re-invent the wheel and normal menus call and trigger the callback from events!So the solution, as simple as it sounds once you realize it, eluded me until now.Just create separate classes for each of your current methods, inherited from a base if you must, and just add an event handler to each.Here is an example without a parameter:\nhttp://en.csharp-online.net/CSharp_FAQ:_How_call_a_method_using_a_name_stringwith params:\nhttp://www.daniweb.com/forums/thread98148.html#you basically pass in an array of objects along with name of method. you then use both with the Invoke method.params Object[] parametersHere is an example Which can help you better to understand how to pass a function as a parameter.Suppose you have Parent page and you want to open a child popup window. In the parent page there is a textbox that should be filled basing on child popup textbox.Here you need to create a delegate.Parent.cs \n       // declaration of delegates\n       public delegate void FillName(String FirstName);Now create a function which will fill your textbox and function should map delegatesNow on button click you need to open a Child popup window.IN ChildPopUp constructor you need to create parameter of \'delegate type\'  of parent //page ChildPopUp.cs
