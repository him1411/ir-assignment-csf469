I would like to change the directory name of a Git submodule in my Git superproject.Lets suppose I have the following entry in my .gitmodules file:What do I have to type to move the .emacs.d/vimpulse directory to .emacs.d/vendor/vimpulse without deleting it first (explained \n  here and here) and then re-adding it.Does Git really need the whole path in the submodule tagor is it also possible to store just the name of the subproject?Note: As mentioned in the comments this answer refers to the steps needed with older versions of git. Git now has native support for moving submodules: Since git 1.8.5, git mv old/submod new/submod works as expected and does all the plumbing for you. You might want to use git 1.9.3 or newer, because it includes fixes for submodule moving.It\xe2\x80\x99s similar to how you remove a submodule (see How do I remove a submodule?):Edit the file new/parent/module/.git, make sure that the path in it points to the correct new location inside the main project .git folder, so in this example gitdir: ../../../.git/modules/new/parent/submodule.git status output looks like this for me afterwards:Finally, commit the changes.The most modern answer, taken from Valloric\'s comment above:Done!In my case, I wanted to move a submodule from one directory into a subdirectory, e.g. "AFNetworking" -> "ext/AFNetworking". These are the steps I followed:Finally, I saw in the git status:Et voila. The above example doesn\'t change the directory depth, which makes a big difference to the complexity of the task, and doesn\'t change the name of the submodule (which may not really be necessary, but I did it to be consistent with what would happen if I added a new module at that path.)[Update: 2014-11-26] As Yar summarizes nicely below, before you do anything, make sure you know the URL of the submodule. If unknown, open .git/.gitmodules and examine the keysubmodule.<name>.url.What worked for me was to remove the old submodule using git submodule deinit <submodule> followed by git rm <submodule-folder>. Then add the submodule again with the new folder name and commit. Checking git status before committing shows the old submodule renamed to the new name and .gitmodule modified.The trick seems to be understanding that the .git directory for submodules are now kept in the master repository, under .git/modules, and each submodule has a .git file that points to it.  This is the procedure you need now:A few notes:You can just add a new submodule and remove the old submodule using standard commands. (should prevent any accidental errors inside of .git)Example setup:Examle move \'jquery\' to \'vendor/jquery/jquery\' :Bonus method for large submodules:If the submodule is large and you prefer not to wait for the clone, you can create the new submodule using the old as origin, and then switch the origin.Example (use same example setup)The string in quotes after "[submodule" doesn\'t matter.  You can change it to "foobar" if you want.  It\'s used to find the matching entry in ".git/config".Therefore, if you make the change before you run "git submodule init", it\'ll work fine.  If you make the change (or pick up the change through a merge), you\'ll need to either manually edit .git/config or run "git submodule init" again.  If you do the latter, you\'ll be left with a harmless "stranded" entry with the old name in .git/config.The given solution did not work for me, however a similar version did...This is with a cloned repository, hence the submodule git repos are contained in the top repositories .git dir. All cations are from the top repository:Edit .gitmodules and change the "path =" setting for the submodule in question. (No need to change the label, nor to add this file to index.)Edit .git/modules/name/config and change the "worktree =" setting for the submodule in questionrun:I wonder if it makes a difference if the repositories are atomic, or relative submodules, in my case it was relative (submodule/.git is a ref back to topproject/.git/modules/submodule)Just use the shell script git-submodule-move.I just went through this ordeal yesterday and this answer worked perfectly. Here are my steps, for clarity:EXAMPLECOMMANDSNOTE: git mv doesn\'t do this. At all.
