weak references don\'t seem to work in Swift unless a protocol is declared as @objc, which I don\'t want in a pure Swift app.This code gives a compile error (weak cannot be applied to non-class type MyClassDelegate):I need to prefix the protocol with @objc, then it works.Question: What is the \'pure\' Swift way to accomplish a weak delegate?You need to declare the type of the protocol as class.My understanding is that using class, you guarantee that this protocol will be used only on classes and no other stuff like enums or structs. I was always confused about whether delegates should be weak or not. Recently I\'ve learned more about delegates and when to use weak references, so let me add some supplemental points here for the sake of future viewers.The purpose of using the weak keyword is to avoid strong reference cycles (retain cycles). Strong reference cycles happen when two class instances have strong references to each other. Their reference counts never go to zero so they never get deallocated. You only need to use weak if the delegate is a class. Swift structs and enums are value types (their values are copied when a new instance is made), not reference types, so they don\'t make strong reference cycles.weak references are always optional (otherwise you would used unowned) and always use var (not let) so that the optional can be set to nil when it is deallocated.A parent class should naturally have a strong reference to its child classes and thus not use the weak keyword. When a child wants a reference to its parent, though, it should make it a weak reference by using the weak keyword.weak should be used when you want a reference to a class that you don\'t own, not just for a child referencing its parent. When two non-hierarchical classes need to reference each other, choose one to be weak. The one you choose depends on the situation. See the answers to this question for more on this.As a general rule, delegates should be marked as weak because most delegates are referencing classes that they do not own. This is definitely true when a child is using a delegate to communicate with a parent. However, there are still some situations where a delegate can and should use a strong reference.Protocols can be used for both reference types (classes) and non-reference types (structs, enums). So in the likely case that you need to make a delegate weak, you have to add the class keyword to the protocol so that it knows it is only to be used with reference types.Reading the following articles is what helped me to understand this much better. They also discuss related issues like the unowned keyword and the strong reference cycles that happen with closures.Update: \nIt looks like the manual has been updated and the example I was referring to has been removed. See the edit to @flainez\'s answer above.Original:\nUsing @objc is the right way to do it even if you\'re not interoperating with Obj-C. It ensures that your protocol is being applied to a class and not an enum or struct. See "Checking for Protocol Conformance" in the manual.Apple uses "NSObjectProtocol" instead of "class". This also works for me and removed the errors I was seeing when trying to implement my own delegate pattern.
