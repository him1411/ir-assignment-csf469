I want to use jQuery to parse RSS feeds. Can this be done with the base jQuery library out of the box or will I need to use a plugin?WARNINGThe Google Feed API is officially deprecated and doesn\'t work anymore!No need for a whole plugin. This will return your RSS as a JSON object to a callback function:Use jFeed - a jQuery RSS/Atom plugin. According to the docs, it\'s as simple as:For those of us coming to the discussion late, starting with 1.5 jQuery has built-in xml parsing capabilities, which makes it pretty easy to do this without plugins or 3rd party services.  It has a parseXml function, and will also auto-parse xml when using the $.get function.  E.g.:jFeed doesn\'t work in IE.Use zRSSFeed. Had it working in 5 minutesUsing JFeedYou can also use jquery-rss, which comes with nice templating and is super easy to use:yields (as of Sept 18, 2013):See http://jsfiddle.net/jhfrench/AFHfn/ for a working example.Use Google AJAX Feed API unless your RSS data is private. It\'s fast, of course.https://developers.google.com/feed/UPDATE [4/25/2016] Now better written and fully supported version with more options and abilities hosted at GitHub.jQRSSI saw the Selected Answer by Nathan Strutz, however, the jQuery Plugin page link is still down and the home page for that site did not seem to load. I tried a few other solutions and found most of them to be, not only out-dated, but EASY! Thus I threw my hat out there and made my own plugin, and with the dead links here, this seems like a great place to submit an answer. If you\'re looking for this answer in 2012 (soon to b 2013) you may notice the frustration of dead links and old advice here as I did. Below is a link to my modern plugin example as well as the code to the plugin!  Simply copy the code into a JS file & link it in your header like any other plugin. Use is EXTREMELY EZ!jsFiddlePlugin Code2/9/2015 - made long overdue update to check for console before sending commands to it! Should help with older IE issues.USE    $.jQRSS(\'Search Words Here instead of a Link\', function(feed) { /* do work */ })\n   // TODO: Needs fixingOptionsI agree with @Andrew, using Google is a solid, reusable way to do it with the huge benefit that you get JSON back instead of XML.  An added advantage of using Google as a proxy is that services that might block your direct access to their data are unlikely to stop Google.  Here is an example using ski report and conditions data.  This has all of the common real world applications: 1) Third party RSS/XML 2) JSONP 3) Cleaning strings and string to array when you can\'t get the data exactly the way you want it 4) on load add elements to the DOM.  Hope this helps some people!jFeed is somewhat obsolete, working only with older versions of jQuery. It has been two years since it was updated.zRSSFeed is perhaps a little less flexible, but it is easy to use, and it works with the current version of jQuery (currently 1.4). http://www.zazar.net/developers/zrssfeed/Here\'s a quick example from the zRSSFeed docs:I\'m using jquery with yql for feed. You can retrieve twitter,rss,buzz with yql. I read from http://tutorialzine.com/2010/02/feed-widget-jquery-css-yql/ . It\'s very useful for me.Use google ajax api, cached by google and any output format you want.Code sample;\nhttp://code.google.com/apis/ajax/playground/#load_feedzRSSfeed is built on jQuery and the simple theme is awesome.\nGive it a try.The jQuery-rss project is pretty lightweight and doesn\'t impose any particular styling.The syntax can be as simple as See a working example at http://jsfiddle.net/jhfrench/AFHfn/I advice you to use FeedEk. After Google Feed API is officially deprecated most of plugins doesn\'t work. But FeedEk is still working. It\'s very easy to use and has many options to customize.With optionsjQuery Feeds is a nice option, it has a built-in templating system and uses the Google Feed API, so it has cross-domain support.Superfeedr has a jquery plugin which does that very well.\nYou won\'t have any Cross Origin Policy issue and the updates are propagated in realtime.jFeed is easy and has an example for you to test. But if you\'re parsing a feed from another server, you\'ll need to allow Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) on the feed\'s server. You\'ll also need to check browser support. I uploaded the sample but still did not get support from IE in any version when I changed the url in the example to something like example.com/feed.rss via the http protocol. CORS should be supported for IE 8 and above but the jFeed example did not render the feed.Your best bet is to use Google\'s API:\nhttps://developers.google.com/feed/v1/devguideSee:\nhttps://github.com/jfhovinne/jFeed\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy\nhttp://caniuse.com/cors
