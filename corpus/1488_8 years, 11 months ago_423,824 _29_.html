I have a script that needs to do some stuff based on file creation & modification dates but has to run on Linux & Windows.What\'s the best cross-platform way to get file creation & modification date/times in Python?Getting some sort of modification date in a cross-platform way is easy - just call os.path.getmtime(path) and you\'ll get the Unix timestamp of when the file at path was last modified.Getting file creation dates, on the other hand, is fiddly and platform-dependent, differing even between the three big OSes:On Linux, this is currently impossible, at least without writing a C extension for Python. Although some file systems commonly used with Linux do store creation dates (for example, ext4 stores them in st_crtime) , the Linux kernel offers no way of accessing them; in particular, the structs it returns from stat() calls in C, as of the latest kernel version, don\'t contain any creation date fields. You can also see that the identifier st_crtime doesn\'t currently feature anywhere in the Python source. At least if you\'re on ext4, the data is attached to the inodes in the file system, but there\'s no convenient way of accessing it.The next-best thing on Linux is to access the file\'s mtime, through either os.path.getmtime() or the .st_mtime attribute of an os.stat() result. This will give you the last time the file\'s content was modified, which may be adequate for some use cases.Putting this all together, cross-platform code should look something like this...You have a couple of choices. For one, you can use the os.path.getmtime and os.path.getctime functions:Your other option is to use os.stat:Note: ctime() does not refer to creation time on *nix systems, but rather the last time the inode data changed. (thanks to kojiro for making that fact more clear in the comments by providing a link to an interesting blog post)The best function to use for this is os.path.getmtime(). Internally, this just uses os.stat(filename).st_mtime.The datetime module is the best manipulating timestamps, so you can get the modification date as a datetime object like this:Usage example:os.stat http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/module-stat.htmledit: In newer code you should probably use os.path.getmtime() (thanks Christian Oudard)\n but note that it returns a floating point value of time_t with fraction seconds (if your OS supports it)There are two methods to get the mod time, os.path.getmtime() or os.stat(), but the ctime is not reliable cross-platform (see below).getmtime(path)\nReturn the time of last modification of path. The return value is a number giving the \nnumber of seconds since the epoch (see the time module). Raise os.error if the file does \nnot exist or is inaccessible. New in version 1.5.2. Changed in version 2.3: If \nos.stat_float_times() returns True, the result is a floating point number.stat(path)\nPerform a stat() system call on the given path. The return value is an object whose \nattributes correspond to the members of the stat structure, namely: st_mode (protection \nbits), st_ino (inode number), st_dev (device), st_nlink (number of hard links), st_uid \n(user ID of owner), st_gid (group ID of owner), st_size (size of file, in bytes), \nst_atime (time of most recent access), st_mtime (time of most recent content \nmodification), st_ctime (platform dependent; time of most recent metadata change on Unix, or the time of creation on Windows):In the above example you would use statinfo.st_mtime or statinfo.st_ctime to get the mtime and ctime, respectively.os.stat returns a named tuple with st_mtime and st_ctime attributes. The modification time is st_mtime on both platforms; unfortunately, on Windows, ctime means "creation time", whereas on POSIX it means "change time". I\'m not aware of any way to get the creation time on POSIX platforms.If following symbolic links is not important, you can also use the os.lstat builtin.os.stat does include the creation time.  There\'s just no definition of st_anything for the element of os.stat() that contains the time.So try this:os.stat(\'feedparser.py\')[8]Compare that with your create date on the file in ls -lahThey should be the same.I was able to get creation time on posix by running the system\'s stat command and parsing the output.Running stat outside of python from Terminal (OS X) returned:... where the fourth datetime is the file creation (rather than ctime change time as other comments noted).
