I was going through a document and I came across a term called DAO. I found out that it is a Data Access Object. Can someone please explain me what this actually is? I know that it is some kind of an interface for accessing data from different types of sources, in the middle of this little research of mine I bumped into a concept called data source or data source object, and things got messed up in my mind. I really want to know what a DAO is programmatically in terms of where it is used. How it is used? Any links to pages that explain this concept from the very basic stuff is also appreciated.The Data Access Object is basically an object or an interface that provides access to an underlying database or any other persistence storage. That definition from:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access_objectCheck also the sequence diagram here: \nhttp://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/dataaccessobject-138824.htmlMaybe a simple example can help you understand the concept:Let\'s say we have an entity to represent an employee:The employee entities will be persisted into a corresponding Employee table in a database.\nA simple DAO interface to handle the database operation required to manipulate an employee entity will be like:Next we have to provide a concrete implementation for that interface to deal with SQL server, and another to deal with flat files, etc.What is DATA ACCESS OBJECT (DAO) - It is a object/interface, which is used to access data from database of data storage. WHY WE USE DAO: it abstracts the retrieval of data from a data resource such as a database. The concept is to "separate a data resource\'s client interface from its data access mechanism."The problem with accessing data directly is that the source of the data can change. Consider, for example, that your application is deployed in an environment that accesses an Oracle database. Then it is subsequently deployed to an environment that uses Microsoft SQL Server. If your application uses stored procedures and database-specific code (such as generating a number sequence), how do you handle that in your application? You have two options:\nIts in all referred as DAO Pattern, It consist of following:Please check this example, This will clear things more clearly. Example\nI assume this things must have cleared your understanding of DAO up to certain extend.  DAO (Data Access Object) is a very used design pattern in enterprise applications. It basically is the module that is used to access data from every source (DBMS, XML and so on). I suggest you to read some examples, like this one:DAO ExamplePlease note that there are different ways to implements the original DAO Pattern, and there are many frameworks that can simplify your work. For example, the ORM (Object Relational Mapping) frameworks like iBatis or Hibernate, are used to map the result of SQL queries to java objects.Hope it helps,\nBye!I think the best example (along with explanations) you can find on the oracle website : here. Another good tuturial could be found here.Data Access Object Pattern or DAO pattern is used to separate low level data accessing API or operations from high level business services. Following are the participants in Data Access Object Pattern.Data Access Object Interface - This interface defines the standard operations to be performed on a model object(s).Data Access Object concrete class -This class implements above interface. This class is responsible to get data from a datasource which can be database / xml or any other storage mechanism.Model Object or Value Object - This object is simple POJO containing get/set methods to store data retrieved using DAO class.Sample code here..http://www.dzone.com/links/r/java_ee_data_access_object_design_pattern_or_dao.htmlThe Data Access Object manages the connection with the data source to obtain and store data.It abstracts the underlying data access implementation for the Business Object to enable transparent access to the data source. \nA data source could be any database such as an RDBMS, XML repository or flat file system etc.DAO is an act like  as "Persistence Manager " in 3 tier architecture as well as DAO also design pattern as you can consult "Gang of Four" book.\nYour application service layer just need to call the method of DAO class without knowing hidden & internal details of DAO\'s method.Pojo also consider as Model class in Java where we can create getter and setter for particular variable defined in private .\nRemember all variables are here declared with private modifier Dao clases are used to reuse the jdbc logic & Dao(Data Access Object) is a design pattern.\ndao is a simple java class which contains JDBC logic .Data Access Layer has proven good in separate business logic layer and persistent layer. The DAO design pattern completely hides the data access implementation from its clientsThe Java Data Access Object (Java DAO) is an important component in business applications. Business applications almost always need access to data from relational or object databases and the Java platform offers many techniques for accessingthis data. The oldest and most mature technique is to use the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)API, which provides the capability to execute SQL queries against a databaseand then fetch the results, one column at a time. Don\'t get confuse with too much explanations. DAO: From the name itself it means Accessing Data using Object. DAO is separated from other Business Logics.
