How do I un-submodule a git submodule (bring all the code back into the core) ?As in how "should" I, as in "Best procedure" ...If all you want is to put your submodule code into the main repository, you just need to remove the submodule and re-add the files into the main repo:If you also want to preserve the history of the submodule, you can do a small trick: "merge" the submodule into the main repository so that the result will be the same as it was before, except that the submodule files are now in the main repository.In the main module you will need to do the following:The resulting repository will look a bit weird: there will be more than one initial commit. But it won\'t cause any problems for git.In this second solution you will have the big advantage that you can still run git blame or git log on the files which were originally in submodules. In fact what you did here is to rename many files inside one repository, and git should autodetect this. If you still have problems with git log, try some options (--follow, -M, -C) which do better rename/copy detection.Since git 1.8.5 (Nov 2013) (without keeping the history of the submodule): That will:Once the removal of the submodule is complete (deinit and git rm), you can rename the folder back to its original name and add it to the git repo as a regular folder.Note: if the submodule was created by an old Git (< 1.8), you might need to remove the nested .git folder within the submodule itself, as commented by Simon EastIf you need to keep the history of the submodule, see jsears\'s answer, which uses git filter-branch.It happened to us that we created 2 repositories for 2 projects that were so coupled that didn\'t make any sense to have them separated, so we merged them.I\'ll show how to merge the master branches in each first and then I will explain how you can extend this to every branches you got, hope it helps you.If you got the submodule working, and you want to convert it to a directory in place you can do:Here we do a clean clone to work. For this process you don\'t need to initialize or update the submodules, so just skip it.Edit .gitmodules with your favorite editor (or Vim) to remove the submodule you plan to replace. The lines you need to remove should look something like this:After saving the file,Here we remove the submodule relation completely so we can create bring the other repo to the project in-place.Here we fetch the submodule repository to merge.Here we start a merge operation of the 2 repositories, but stop before commit.Here we send the content of master in the submodule to the directory where it was before prefixing a directory nameHere we complete the procedure doing a commit of the changes in the merge.After finishing this you can push, and start again with any other branch to merge, just checkout the branch in you repository that will receive the changes and change the branch you bringing in the merge and read-tree operations.I didn\'t find any easier way yet. You can compress 3-5 into one step via git commit -a - matter of taste.Lots of answers here but all of them seem to be overly complex and likely do not do what you want. I am sure most people want to keep their history.For this example the main repo will be git@site.com:main/main.git and the submodule repo will be git@site.com:main/child.git. This assumes that the submodule is located in the root directory of the parent repo. Adjust the instructions as needed.Start by cloning the parent repo and removing the old submodule.Now we will add the child repos upstream to the main repo.The next step assumes that you want to move the files on the merge-prep branch into the same location as the submodule was above although you can easily change the location by changing the file path.move all folders and files except the .git folder into the child folder.Now you can simply merge your files back into the master branch.Look around and make sure everything looks good before running git pushThe one thing you have to remember now is that git log does not by default follow moved files however by running git log --follow filename you can see the full history of your files.I\'ve created a script that will translate a submodule to a simple directory, while retaining all file history.  It doesn\'t suffer from the git log --follow <file> issues that the other solutions suffer from.  It\'s also a very easy one-line invocation that does all of the work for you.  G\'luck.It builds on the excellent work by Lucas Jen\xc3\x9f, described in his blog post "Integrating a submodule into the parent repository", but automates the entire process and cleans up a few other corner cases.The latest code will be maintained with bugfixes on github at https://github.com/jeremysears/scripts/blob/master/bin/git-submodule-rewrite, but for the sake of proper stackoverflow answer protocol, I\'ve included the solution in its entirety below.Usage:git-submodule-rewrite:The best answer to this I have found is here:http://x3ro.de/2013/09/01/Integrating-a-submodule-into-the-parent-repository.htmlThis article explains the procedure very well.For whenreturnsContext: I did rm -r .git* in my submodule folders before realizing that they needed to be de-submoduled in the main project to which I had just added them. I got the above error when de-submoduling some, but not all of them. Anyway, I fixed them by running, (after, of course, the rm -r .git*)Note that this doesn\'t preserve history.Here\'s a slightly improved version (IMHO) of the current top answer:In a separate dir (to make mistakes easier to clean up and try again) check out both the top repo and the subrepo.First edit the subrepo to move all files into the desired subdirectoryMake a note of the HEADNow remove the subrepo from the main repoAnd finally, just merge themAnd done!  Safely and without any magic.Based on VonC\'s answer, I have created a simple bash script that does this. The add at the end has to use wildcards otherwise it will undo the previous rm for the submodule itself. It\'s important to add the contents of the submodule directory, and not to name the directory itself in the add command.In a file called git-integrate-submodule:I found it more convenient to (also?) fetch local commit data from the submodule, because otherwise I would loose them. (Could not push them as I have not access to that remote). So I added submodule/.git as remote_origin2, fetched it commits and merged from that branch. \nNot sure if I still need the submodule remote as origin, since I am not familiar enough with git yet.
