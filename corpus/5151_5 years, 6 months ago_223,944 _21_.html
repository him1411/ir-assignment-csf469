I can\'t seem to find the correct syntax for the CSS transition shorthand with multiple properties. This doesn\'t do anything:I add the show class with javascript. The element becomes higher and visible, it just doesn\'t transition. Testing in latest Chrome, FF and Safari.What am I doing wrong?EDIT: Just to be clear, I\'m looking for the shorthand version to scale my CSS down. It\'s bloated enough with all the vendor prefixes. Also expanded the example code.Shorthand syntax:Note that the duration must come before the delay if the latter is specified.\nIndividual transitions combined in shorthand declarations:Or just transition them all:Here is a straightforward example. Here is another one with the delay property.Global support: 90.93%\n(data from http://caniuse.com/css-transitions)Unprefixed:-webkit- prefixed (WebKit engine):-moz- prefixed (Gecko engine)-o- prefixed (Presto engine)UnsupportedIf you have several specific properties that you want to transition in the same way (because you also have some properties you specifically don\'t want to transition, say opacity), another option is to do something like this (prefixes omitted for brevity):The second declaration overrides the all in the shorthand declaration above it and makes for (occasionally) more concise code.DemoBy having the .5s delay on transitioning the opacity property, the element will be completely transparent (and thus invisible) the whole time its height is transitioning. So the only thing you will actually see is the opacity changing. So you will get the same effect as leaving the height property out of the transition :"transition: opacity .5s .5s;"Is that what you\'re wanting? If not, and you\'re wanting to see the height transition, you can\'t have an opacity of zero during the whole time that it\'s transitioning.I think that work with this :
