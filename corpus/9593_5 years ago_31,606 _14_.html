I\'ve got a git repository with many branches, some of them already merged and some not. Since the number of branches is quite big, how can I know which branches have not been merged yet? I would avoid to do an octopus merge remerging all the branches again.Try this:It does what it says on the tin (lists branches which have been merged into master). You can also pull up the inverse with:If you don\'t specify master, e.g...then it will show you branches which have been merged into the current HEAD (so if you\'re on master, it\'s equivalent to the first command; if you\'re on foo, it\'s equivalent to git branch --merged foo).You can also compare upstream branches by specifying the -r flag and a ref to check against, which can be local or remote:You can also use the -r parameter to show remote branches that were not merged into master:If a branch is merged already, merging it again won\'t do anything. So you don\'t have to be worried about "re-merging" branches that are already merged.To answer your question, you can simply issue to see the merged branches or to see the unmerged branches. Your current branch is implied but you can specify other branches if you wish.will show you branches that are not yet merged into integration branch.The below script will find all origin/* branches that are ahead of current branchThe up-to-date version of the script
