How can I disable landscape mode for some of the views in my Android app?Add android:screenOrientation="portrait" to the activity in the AndroidManifest.xml. For example:EDIT: Since this has become a super-popular answer, I feel very guilty as forcing portrait is rarely the right solution to the problems it\'s frequently applied to.\nThe major caveats with forced portrait:So most apps should just let the phone sensors, software, and physical configuration make their own decision about how the user wants to interact with your app. A few cases you may still want to think about, though, if you\'re not happy with the default behavior of sensor orientation in your use case:I was not aware of the AndroidManifest.xml file switch until reading this post, so in my apps I have used this instead:add this Add android:screenOrientation="portrait" in your manifest file where you declare your activity like thisif you want to do using java code \ntrybefore you setContentView for your activity in onCreate()\nhope help and easy understandable for someone..A lot of the answers here are suggesting to use "portrait" in your AndroidManifest.xml file.  This might seem like a good solution - but as noted in the documentation, you are singling out devices that may only have landscape.  You are also forcing certain devices (that work best in landscape) to go into portrait, not getting the proper orientation.My suggestion is to use "nosensor" instead.  This will leave the device to use its default preferred orientation, will not block any purchases/downloads on Google Play, and will ensure the sensor doesn\'t mess up your (NDK, in my case) game.If you want user-settings,then I\'d recommend setRequestedOrientation (ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT);You can change the settings from a settings menu.I require this because my timers must correspond to what\'s on the screen, and rotating the screen will destroy the current activity.Just add Like this Line in Your Manifestandroid:screenOrientation="portrait" Just add this attribute in your activity tag.you should change android:screenOrientation="sensorPortait" in AndroidManifest.xml Add following snippet in your Manifest file.This support only portrait modeAdd android:screenOrientation="portrait" to the activity you want to disable landscape mode.If you want to disable Landscape mode for your android app ( or a single activity) all you need to do is add, android:screenOrientation="portrait" to the activity tag in AndroidManifest.xml file. Like:Another Way , Programmatic Approach.If you want to do this programatically ie. using Java code. You can do so by adding the below code in the Java class of the activity that you don\'t want to be displayed in landscape mode. I hope it helps you .For more details you can visit here enter link description hereUse this in onCreate() of the ActivityIf you don\'t want to go through the hassle of adding orientation in each manifest entry of activity better, create a BaseActivity class (inherits \'Activity\' or \'AppCompatActivity\') which will be inherited by every activity of your application instead of \'Activity\' or \'AppCompatActivity\' and just add the following piece of code in your BaseActivity:useYou must set the orientation of each activity.   add class inside oncreate() methodIf you are using Xamarin C# some of these solutions will not work. Here is the solution I found to work.Above the class works well, similar to the other solutions, also not globally applicable and needs to be placed in each activity header.How to change orientation in some of the view Instead of locking orientation of entire activity you can use this class to dynamically lock orientation from any of your view pragmatically:-Make your view LandscapeMake your view PortraitUnlock OrientationOrientation Util ClassSimply add\nandroid:screenOrientation="portrait" \nto the activity tag in application manifest.Eg: You can force your particular activity to always remain in portrait mode by writing this in your manifest.xmlYou can also force your activity to remain in postrait mode by writing following line in your activity\'s onCreate() methodYou should put this code in manifests file.......In the <apphome>/platform/android directory created AndroidManifest.xml (copying it from the generated one).\nThen add android:screenOrientation="portrait" to ALL of the activity elements.add android:screenOrientation="portrait" in AndroidManifest.xml file .example <activity android:name=".MapScreen" android:screenOrientation="portrait"></activity>In hopes to help someone else, the following attribute on the ACTIVITY in AndroidManifest.xml is all you need:android:configChanges="orientation"So, full activity node:if your activity related to the first device orientation state,get the current device orientation in the onCreate method and then fix it forever:In kotlin same can be programatically achieved using below we can restrict the Activity in portrait or landscape mode by using the attribute  or android:screenOrientation.if we have more than one activity in my program then you have freedom to restrict any one of activity in any one the mode and it never effect the others which you don\'t want.
