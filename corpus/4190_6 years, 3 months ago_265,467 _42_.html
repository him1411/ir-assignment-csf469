I have to use Python and Django for our application. So I have two versions of Python, 2.6 and 2.7. Now I have installed Django. I could run the sample application for testing Django succesfuly. But how do I make sure whether Django uses the 2.6 or 2.7 version and what version of modules Django uses?Django 1.5 supports Python 2.6.5 and later.If you\'re under Linux and want to check the Python version you\'re using, run python -V from the command line.If you want to check the Django version, open a Python console and typeBasically the same as bcoughlan\'s answer, but here it is as an executable command:If you have installed the application: Go to your Django project home directory and do:I am using the IDLE (Python GUI).For Python:For Django (as mentioned by others here):The potential problem with simply checking the version, is that versions get upgraded and so the code can go out of date. You want to make sure that \'1.7\' < \'1.7.1\' < \'1.7.5\' < \'1.7.10\'. A normal string comparison would fail in the last comparison:The solution is to use StrictVersion from distutils.Type the following at the command prompt:If django is installed it will print its current version (eg. 1.6.5),\notherwise the shell will print an error message.If you have pip, you can also do a You can pipe it through grep to get just the Django version. That is, As you say you have two versions of python, I assume they are in different virtual environments (e.g. venv) or perhaps conda environments.When you installed django, it was likely in only one environment.  It is possible that you have two different versions of django, one for each version of python.In from a Unix/Mac terminal, you can check your python version as follows:If you want to know the source:And to check the version of django:For checking using a Python shell, do the following.If you wish to do it in Unix/Linux shell with a single line, then doOnce you have developed an application, then you can check version directly using the following.Django will use the version of Python specified by the PYTHONPATH environment variable. You can use echo $PYTHONPATH in a shell to determine which version will be used.The module versions used by Django will be the module versions installed under the version of Python specified by PYTHONPATH.Go to console and type:There is an undocumented utils versions module in djangohttps://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/utils/version.pyWith that you can get the normal version as string or a detailed version tuple:run pip list on LINUX TERMINAL  and find Django and its version on listrun pip freeze on cmd on Windows  You can do it without Python too. Just type this in your Django directory:And you will get something like:I thought the most pythonic way was:This ties directly into setup.py: https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/setup.py#L37Its definitely the best way to get the version number of ANY package!Also there is distutilsAs for the python version, i agree with @jamesdradburyTying it all together: If you want to make Django version comparison, you could use django-nine (pip install django-nine). For example, if Django version installed in your environment is 1.7.4, then the following would be true.If you are working in a virtual environment just pip freeze would tell you if not you can use this
