I just upgraded from Yosemite to El Capitan (and replicated the problem upgrading from El Capitan to Sierra), and when I try to type for example git status inside a terminal, I get the following error:I don\'t have Xcode installed, never did. \nAnyone have a solution?Found the fix for the problem here.This will bring up a prompt to install the necessary command line tools.If you have issues with the xcode-select --install command; e.g. I kept getting a network problem timeout, then try downloading the dmg at developer.apple.com/downloads (Command line tools OS X 10.11) for Xcode 7.1
