I have an asp.net MVC 4 solution. When I try to open it using Visual studio 2012, I get following error:Microsoft Visual StudioConfiguring Web https://localhost: for ASP.NET 4.5 failed. You must\n  manually configure this site for ASP.NET 4.5 in order for the site to\n  run correctly. Could not find the server https://localhost:44300/ on\n  the local machine. Make sure the local IIS server has been configured\n  to support secure communications.OK   HelpAlthough the solution opens. Also, When I try to run it from debug menu, I get following error:and I can not debug the code. how to get rid of these errors and debug/run the web site from VS 2012 ?Please suggest.I had the exact same problem.\nThe reason - bad IIS config file.Try deleting the automatically-created IISExpress folder, which is usually located at %userprofile%/Documents, e.g. C:\\Users\\[you]\\Documents\\IISExpress.Don\'t worry, VS should create it again - correctly, this time - once you run your solution again.EDIT: Command line for deleting the folder:If using VS2015 or aboveMake sure iisexpress process is not running.Make sure no other process is using your desired port. You can do that by executing netstat -a -b in the console.Then delete the following filenote the .vs folder may be hiddenafter doing this and trying to start the app you may getThen go to {Project Properties} -> Web and Press the "Create Virtual Directory" button@roblll had it right. But for those of you who didn\'t want to dig for the answer, here it is: Note that there\'s a binding for http with the port you intend to use for https. Keep in mind, Visual Studio might have supplied different ports than you expected. Just make sure that the ports in the binding correspond to what\'s in the Web tab of your project\'s properties.http://www.hanselman.com/blog/WorkingWithSSLAtDevelopmentTimeIsEasierWithIISExpress.aspxI had the same problem but the solution that worked for me was different.That was all I needed to get things running.I had the same issue and then I opened the task manager -> processes then killed the iisexpress.exe process. After that I tried to run the application and was able to run it successfullyIn my case the project was on network drive and deleting IIS Express folder didn\'t help as described in other answers. My workaround was copying the project to local drive and it worked!Same Problem, but needed to start VS2013 in Admin Mode.I had the same problem, thanks to @Jacob for giving information about it.The Reason is - wrong entry for your project in config file applicationhost located at It worked for me and hope it should work for you also.I had the same issue, the cause was that the flag "override application root URL" was set under Properties --> Web\nAfter I removed the flag, IIS Express was starting fine with the defined port.It seems you need to do some configuring as you seem to be using SSL; here\'s a step-by-step guide by Scott Hanselman himself:http://www.hanselman.com/blog/WorkingWithSSLAtDevelopmentTimeIsEasierWithIISExpress.aspxIn my case after I allowed external request to my IIS Express website and configured windows firewall to allow iisexpress.exe, I can\'t start it from within Visual Studio 2013. I can still start it with command line, and it serves local and external requests well.I tried to create a firewall rule to allow my port, after that VS worked.The only solution that worked for me was to create another test project. Then following the next steps:Right click the project and go to Properties -> WebUnder the project URL in the Use Local IIS Web Server section, copy the project URL(http:// localhost:59002/) - this is from the test project.Navigate to the project which is giving this error. Right click the project and go to    Properties -> Web.Paste the project URL in the Use Local IIS Web Server section (URL copied from the test project). Close the test project and save.Delete the test project and run the project that gave the error. Works after that...Maybe not the best way but it was the only way I could get this to work. I received this error message after I reloaded my laptop (hard drive crashed) and got all of my projects from the server of where they where hosted.I had the same problem with VS 2013 and even after all possible tries it was not working.My problem was solved by:At least you can give this a try since it worked for me.Sharing this for future readers. Manually creating a virtual directory worked for me.check the antivirus firewall and allow access visual studio to network.\nfor example in nod32:in the "zone and rule editor" click "setup" and find the vs 2010 or 12 or ... and allow access to network.After disabling the firewall I was able to run it without any issues.I ran in to this error today. Running Win 8.1 and VS 2013. Suddenly my projects could not run anymore and i got the message "Unable to launch the IIS Express Web server" and no further information. After a while I found out that all the projects that the IIS Express could not start all were running .net 3.5. Projects running later versions did start ok.The solution for me was to remove .net 3.5 (from control panel -> turn windows features on/off), restart windows and the add .net 3.5 again.Well none of the above mentioned steps worked for me. In my case my applicationhost.config file was somehow missing the following two line of codeHope this can help some one.I had a similar problem when running my solution from VS2012:I had the incorrect project selected as Startup Project.  I made the Cloud project the Startup (right click on project -> Set as Startup Project) and everything started working fine.Jason\'s Shavers series of articles here http://jasonrshaver.com/?tag=/Client+Certificates explain exactly how to set up your applicationhost.config site entry to allow the app to run in either ssl or standard http.  One of the things he recommends is putting two binding entries for the site.  This is what I did.He also recommends changing other settings as well.  It worked on two of my three machines.  Each time I am told to manually configure a site in the application host it usually has to do with the bindings.  (example using same port for multiple web apps.)We had the same issue with our sites. We were able to fix this all inside of Visual Studio. We are using 2012 Ultimate.The underlying issue we saw was that with SSL enabled, for some reason, VS was assigning the same port for the standard and secure URLs. This issue seemed to arise when we were pulling the code down from TFS.To remedy it, we undertook the following steps:Make sure that the check box for Override application root URL is unchecked.I had the same problem after installing Visual Studio 2013 Update 3.\nVS 2013 can not load Microsoft.VisualStudio.TraceLogPackage.dll\nUnable to launch the IIS Express Web server\nMy problem solved by doing the following steps :\n1. Repair Visual Studio 2013 Update 3\n2. Start the Developer Command Prompt as administrator.\n3. Type devenv.exe /setup then press enterI had the same issue. I had deleted a lot of folders under C:/users/ path to free some space on my machine. After which I started getting this error.I just had to restart my machine and it all worked fine.My issue required a 3-fold solution:My problem was eventually solved when I looked at the IIS Express registry key:I had an entry CustomUserHome pointing to My Web Sites which was causing havoc.Try following steps:  Have a good luck!In my situation, the IIS Express applicationhost.config file had a typo in the managedRuntimeVersion attribute of several elements. This was happening for both Visual Studio 2012 and Visual Studio 2013. I only received the first part of the message, stating:Unable to launch the IIS Express Web server.It logged an error in the event log with the message:The worker process failed to pre-load .Net Runtime version v4.030319.The correct runtime version is v4.0.30319 (note the second period.)The steps I took to correct:Visual Studio successfully started IIS Express the next time I debugged a web application.There is no need to delete the entire IISExpress folder in the directory C:\\Users[you]\\Documents\\IISExpress.Just comment:in the applicationhost.config file in the IISExpress folder.Please go through the snapshot, I faced the same error but the following setting resolved itSelect Current page as Start ActionSelect specific port in Servers option and enter port 26641 , in virtual path enter /NTLM option should be uncheckedI had the same problem, in my case I just cleaned and then rebuild my solution and it worked for me
