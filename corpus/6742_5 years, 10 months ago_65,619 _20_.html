Is there a way to iterate over Java SparseArray (for Android) ? I used sparsearray to easily get values by index. I could not find one.Seems I found the solution. I hadn\'t properly noticed the keyAt(index) function.So I\'ll go with something like this:If you don\'t care about the keys, then valueAt(int) can be used to while iterating through the sparse array to access the values directly.Ooor you just create your own ListIterator:For removing all the elements from SparseArray using the above looping leads to Exception.To avoid this Follow the below code to remove all the elements from SparseArray using normal loopsSimple as Pie. Just make sure you fetch array size before actually perform the loop.Hope this helps.Here is simple Iterator<T> and Iterable<T> implementations for SparseArray<T>:If you want to iterate not only a value but also a key:It\'s useful to create utility methods that return Iterable<T> and Iterable<SparseKeyValue<T>>:Now you can iterate SparseArray<T>:The answer is no because SparseArray doesn\'t provide it. As pst put it, this thing doesn\'t provide any interfaces.You could loop from 0 - size() and skip values that return null, but that is about it.As I state in my comment, if you need to iterate use a Map instead of a SparseArray. For example, use a TreeMap which iterates in order by the key.The accepted answer has some holes in it. The beauty of the SparseArray is that it allows gaps in the indeces. So, we could have two maps like so, in a SparseArray...Notice the size here would be 2. If we iterate over size, we will only get values for the values mapped to index 0 and index 1. So the mapping with a key of 250 is not accessed. The best way to do this is to iterate over the size of your data set, then check those indeces with a get() on the array. Here is an example with an adapter where I am allowing batch delete of items.I think ideally the SparseArray family would have a getKeys() method, but alas it does not.
