Can\'t seem to figure this out.\nI\'m attempting JSON tree manipulation in GSON, but I have a case where I do not know or have a POJO to convert a string into, prior to converting to JsonObject. Is there a way to go directly from a String to JsonObject?I\'ve tried the following (Scala syntax):but a fails, the JSON is escaped and parsed as a JsonString only, and\nb returns an empty JsonObject.Any ideas?use JsonParser; for example: Try to use getAsJsonObject() instead of a straight cast used in the accepted answer:The simplest way is to use the JsonPrimitive class, which derives from JsonElement, as shown below:Just encountered the same problem.  You can write a trivial custom deserializer for the JsonElement class:I believe this is a more easy approach:And then you will be able to call it like this:This way all the hibernate objects will be converted automatically.Came across a scenario with remote sorting of data store in EXTJS 4.X where the string is sent to the server as a JSON array (of only 1 object).\nSimilar approach to what is presented previously for a simple string, just need conversion to JsonArray first prior to JsonObject.String from client: [{"property":"COLUMN_NAME","direction":"ASC"}]
