I\'m trying to configure my e-mail on Jenkins/Hudson and I constantly receive the errorI\'ve seen a good amount of information online about the error, but have not gotten any to work.  I\'m using Sun\'s JDK on fedora linux (not openJDK).  Here are a few things I\'ve tried.  I tried following the advice from this post but it copying the cacerts from windows over to my Fedora box hosting Jenkins didn\'t work.  I tried following this guide as I\'m trying to configure gmail as my SMTP server but it didn\'t work either.  I also tried to download and move those cacert files manually and move them over to my java folder using a variation of the commands on this guide.I open to any suggestions as I\'m currently stuck right now.  I have gotten it to work from a Windows Hudson server but I am struggling on Linux.This bizarre message means that the truststore you specified was not found, or couldn\'t be opened due to access permissions for example.See also @AdamPlumb\'s answer below.This fixed the problem for me on Ubuntu:(found here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ca-certificates-java/+bug/1396760)ca-certificates-java is not a dependency in the Oracle JDK/JRE so this must be explicitly installed.I ran into this solution from http://architecturalatrocities.com/post/19073788679/fixing-the-trustanchors-problem-when-running-openjdk-7:Fixing the trustAnchors problem when running OpenJDK 7 on OS X. If you\'re running OpenJDK 7 on OS X and have seen this exception:There\'s a simple fix, just link in the same cacerts file that Apple\xe2\x80\x99s JDK 1.6 uses:You need to do this for every OpenJDK version you have installed, just change -v 1.7 to the version you want to fix. Run /usr/libexec/java_home -V to see all the JREs and JDKs you have installed.Perhaps the OpenJDK guys could add this to their install scripts.EJP basically answered the question (and I realize this has an accepted answer) but I just dealt with this edge-case gotcha and wanted to immortalize my solution.  I had the InvalidAlgorithmParameterException error on a hosted jira server that I had previously set up for SSL-only access.  The issue was that I had set up my keystore in the PKCS#12 format, but my truststore was in the JKS format.  In my case, I had edited my server.xml file to specify the keystoreType to PKCS, but did not specify the truststoreType, so it defaults to whatever the keystoreType is.  Specifying the truststoreType explicitly as JKS solved it for me.I ran into this exact problem on OSX, using JDK 1.7, after upgrading to Maverick. The fix that worked for me was to simply re-install the Apple version of Java, available here: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572In Ubuntu >= 12.10, the certificates are held in the ca-certificates-java package. Using -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts will pick them up regardless of what JDK you\'re using.Ran to create cert file then and I was back in business thanks guys, a pity it\'s not included in the installation but got there in the end.I\'ve had lot of security issues after upgrading to OSX MavericksI applied this JAVA update and it fixed all my issues: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?viewlocale=en_USI expected things like this, being that I use an alternate jvm in my Talend Open Studio. (support at the moment exists only until jdk1.7) i use 8 for security purposes... anywaysudo update-ca-certificates -fthen sudo gedit $(path to your architecture specific ini i.e. TOS_DI...ini) -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts-Djavax.net.ssl.trustAnchors=/etc/ssl/certs/java/cacertsfor me, the second entry worked. I think, depending on the version of TOS/TEnt + jvm, it has a different parameter name, but looks for the same keystore file For me it was caused by the lack of a trustedCertEntry in the truststoreTo test use keytool -list -keystore keystore.jksGives meEven though my PrivateKeyEntry contains a CA it needed to be imported separatelyimports the certificate, and then re-running keytool -list -keystore keystore.jks now givesNow it has a trustedCertEntry tomcat will start successfully.Also encountered this on OS X after updating Mavericks, when the old Java 6 was being used and tried to access an https URL. Fix was the inverse of Peter Kriens, I needed to copy the cacerts from the 1.7 space to the location linked by the 1.6 version:In my case the JKS file used in client application was corrupted. I created new one and import the destination server SSL certificates in it. Then I use the new JKS file in the client application as trust store like :Source: java SSL and cert keystoreI use the (KeyStore Explorer) tool to create the new JKS. You can downloaded from this link KeyStore ExplorerYou have to add above two lines in your code. It is not able to find the truststore.For the record, none of the answers here worked for me.  My gradle build started failing mysteriously with this error, unable to fetch HEAD from maven central for a particular pom file.It turned out that I had JAVA_HOME set to my own personal build of OpenJDK, which I had built for debugging a javac issue.  Setting it back to the jdk installed on my system fixed it.If you experience this on Ubuntu with JDK9 and Maven, you can add this JVM option - first check if the path exists:If the file is missing, try to install the ca-certificates-java as someone noted:I have faced with the issue while importing a Gradle project in IntelliJ IDEA 14.\nA solution was using a local copy of Gradle instead of a wrapper from the project directory.On RedHat Linux I got this issue resolved by importing the certs to /etc/pki/java/cacertsThe error tells that the system cannot find the truststore in the path provided with the parameter javax.net.ssl.trustStore.Under Windows I copied the cacerts file from jre/lib/security location into the eclipse install directory (same place as eclipse.ini file) and added the following settings in eclipse.ini:Had some troubles with the path to the cacerts (the %java_home% env variable is somehow overwritten), so I used this trivial solve.The idea is to provide a valid path to the truststore file - ideally would be to use a relative one. You may also use an absolute path.To make sure the store type is JKS, you would run the following command:keytool -list -keystore cacertsThe answers here are very helpful for Linux and Mac.If you\'re on Windows 10, this problem can be caused by a Java update. These seem to change the directory path of the JRE (even if you have a JDK and JRE installed separately).What worked for me was creating a symlink (Use MinGW, Cygwin, or your favorite Bash shell for Windows) in the c/Program Files/Java directory with the same name as the pre-update version like this:That way, your old security settings can find the right path. This is admittedly a hack, but it works.I got the same error when sending emails, but NOT always. In my case i\'ve changed one line of code to get every time a new Session object:to Since then sending e-mails works every time. This may help someone.Error i got:javax.mail.MessagingException: Could not convert socket to TLS;\n  nested exception is:  javax.net.ssl.SSLException:\n  java.lang.RuntimeException: Unexpected error:\n  java.security.InvalidAlgorithmParameterException: the trustAnchors\n  parameter must be non-empty   at\n  com.sun.mail.smtp.SMTPTransport.startTLS(SMTPTransport.java:1907)     at\n  com.sun.mail.smtp.SMTPTransport.protocolConnect(SMTPTransport.java:666)\n    at javax.mail.Service.connect(Service.java:317)     at\n  javax.mail.Service.connect(Service.java:176)  at\n  javax.mail.Service.connect(Service.java:125)  at\n  javax.mail.Transport.send0(Transport.java:194)    at\n  javax.mail.Transport.send(Transport.java:124)On Ubuntu:sudo apt install ca-certificates-javaorsudo apt-get install ca-certificates-javasorted it for me.Another reason for this is its actually valid error. Some nefarious wifi hotspots will mess with certificates and man in the middle attack you to do who knows what (run away!). Some large employers will do this same trick, especially in sensitive network zones so they can monitor all the encrypted traffic (not great from end user perspective but there may be good reasons for this). I got this error when using a truststore which was exported using a IBM Websphere JDK keytool in #PKCS12 format and trying to communicate over ssl using that file on an Oracle JRE. My solution was to run on an IBM jre or convert the truststore to JKS using an IBM Websphere keytool so I was able to run it in an Oracle jre.In my case I was configuring a server for two way security, I didn\'t put in the keystore a public certificate or authorities certificates to recognize the client part.I was including only the server private certificate, so the solution in my case was to add a public certificate or the authority certificate.You may also encounter this error after upgrading to Spring Boot 1.4.1 (or newer) because it brings along Tomcat 8.5.5 as part of it\'s dependencies. The problem is due to the way that Tomcat deals with the trust store, if you happen to have specified your trust store location as the same as your keystore in the Spring Boot config you\'ll likely get the trustAnchors parameter must be non-empty message when starting the application.Simply remove the server.ssl.trust-store configuration unless you know that you need it, in which case consult the links below.The following issue contain more details about the problem:
