This question already has an answer here:I have some radio buttons and I want one of them to be set as selected by default when the page is loaded. How can I do that?XHTML solution:Please note, that the actual value of checked attribute does not actually matter; it\'s just a convention to assign "checked". Most importantly, strings like "true" or "false" don\'t have any special meaning.If you don\'t aim for XHTML conformance, you can simplify the code to:Use the checked attribute.orThis doesn\'t exactly answer the question but for anyone using AngularJS trying to achieve this, the answer is slightly different. And actually the normal answer won\'t work (at least it didn\'t for me).Your html will look pretty similar to the normal radio button:In your controller you\'ll have declared the mValue that is associated with the radio buttons. To have one of these radio buttons preselected, assign the $scope variable associated with the group to the desired input\'s value:This makes the "second" radio button selected on loading the page. Add this attribute:They pretty much got it there... just like a checkbox, all you have to do is add the attribute checked="checked" like so: ...and you got it.Cheers!
