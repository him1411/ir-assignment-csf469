I screen -r\'d into a django server that\'s running and I can\'t simply Ctrl-C and exit out of it. Are there any alternative ways to get out of screen?Currently, I manually close the tab on my local PC and ssh back in, but that\'s becoming tiresome.Ctrl-a d or Ctrl-a Ctrl-d.  See the screen manual # Detach.Ctrl+A then Ctrl+D. Doing this will detach you from the screen session which you can later resume by doing screen -r.You can also do: Ctrl+A then type :, this will put you in screen command mode. Type the command detach to be detached from the running screen session.
