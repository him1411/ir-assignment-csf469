Can anyone tell me if it\'s possible to find an element based on its content rather than by an id or class?I am attempting to find elements that don\'t have distinct classes or id\'s. (Then I then need to find that element\'s parent.)You can use the :contains selector to get elements based on their content.Demo herein jquery documentation it says:The matching text can appear directly within the selected element, in\n  any of that element\'s descendants, or a combinationtherefore it is not enough that you use :contains selector, you also need to check if the text you search for is the direct content of the element you are targeting for... somthing like that:Yes, use the jQuery contains selector.Fellas, I know this is old but hey I\'ve this solution which I think works better than all. First and foremost overcomes the Case Sensitivity that the jquery :contains() is shipped with:Hope someone in the near future finds it helpful.Rocket\'s answer doesn\'t work.I simply modified his DEMO here and you can see the root DOM is selected.add ":last" selector in the code to fix this.Best way in my opinion.
