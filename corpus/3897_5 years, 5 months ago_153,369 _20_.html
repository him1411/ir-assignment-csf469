I want to install an older version of a package (Newtonsoft.Json). But NuGet rolls back. Any help will be greatly appreciated.try the following:followed by:As of Nuget 2.8 there is a feature to downgrade a package.Nuget 2.8 Release NotesExample:The following command entered into the Package Manager Console will downgrade the couchbase client to version 1.3.1.0Result:Something to note as per crimbo below:"this approach doesn\'t work for downgrading from one prerelease version to other prerelease version - it only works for downgrading to a release version"I\'ve used Xavier\'s answer quite a bit. I want to add that restricting the package version to a specified range is easy and useful in the latest versions of NuGet.For example, if you never want Newtonsoft.Json to be updated past version 3.x.x in your project, change the corresponding package element in your packages.config file to look like this:Notice the allowedVersions attribute. This will limit the version of that package to versions between 3.0 (inclusive) and 4.0 (exclusive). Then, when you do an Update-Package on the whole solution, you don\'t need to worry about that particular package being updated past version 3.x.x.The documentation for this functionality is here.Now, It\'s very much simplified in the Visual Studio 2015. You can do Downgrade / Upgrade within the User interface itself, without executing commands in the Package Manager Console.Right click on your project and go to Manage Nuget Packages.Look at the below image.Very Very Simple, Isn\'t it? :) Hope this helps...
