Given an SSL key and certificate, how does one create an HTTPS service?I found following example.  It is a few months old, but it might be good:http://www.silassewell.com/blog/2010/06/03/node-js-https-ssl-server-example/Directly from that source:The Express API doc spells this out pretty clearly. Additionally this answer gives the steps to create a self-signed certificate.I have added some comments and a snippet from the Node.js HTTPS documentation:Found this question while googling "node https" but the example in the accepted answer is very old - taken from the docs of the current (v0.10) version of node, it should look like this:The above answers are good but with Express and node this will work fine.Since express create the app for you, I\'ll skip that here.I noticed that none of these answers show that adding a Intermediate Root CA to the chain, here are some zero-config examples to play with to see that:Snippet:This is one of those things that\'s often easier if you don\'t try to do it directly through connect or express, but let the native https module handle it and then use that to serve you connect / express app.Also, if you use server.on(\'request\', app) instead of passing the app when creating the server, it gives you the opportunity to pass the server instance to some initializer function that creates the connect / express app (if you want to do websockets over ssl on the same server, for example).The minimal setup for an HTTPS server in Node.js would be something like this :If you also want to support http requests, you need to make just this small modification :To enable your app to listen for both http and https on ports 80 and 443 respectively, do the followingCreate an express app:The app returned by express() is a JavaScript function. It can be be passed to Node\xe2\x80\x99s HTTP servers as a callback to handle requests. This makes it easy to provide both HTTP and HTTPS versions of your app using the same code base.You can do so as follows:For complete detail see the doc
