I\'m looking for a simple commons method or operator that allows me to repeat some String n times. I know I could write this using a for loop, but I wish to avoid for loops whenever necessary and a simple direct method should exist somewhere.Related to:repeat string javascript \nCreate NSString by repeating another string a given number of timesEditedI try to avoid for loops when they are not completely necessary because:They add to the number of lines of code even if they are tucked away in another function.Someone reading my code has to figure out what I am doing in that for loop. Even if it is commented and has meaningful variables names, they still have to make sure it is not doing anything "clever".Programmers love to put clever things in for loops, even if I write it to "only do what it is intended to do", that does not preclude someone coming along and adding some additional clever "fix".They are very often easy to get wrong. For loops involving indexes tend to generate off by one bugs.For loops often reuse the same variables, increasing the chance of really hard to find scoping bugs.For loops increase the number of places a bug hunter has to look.This is as simple as it gets:In Java 8 there is an even easier way:Here is the shortest version (Java 1.5+ required):Where n is the number of times you want to repeat the string and s is the string to repeat.No imports or libraries needed.Commons Lang StringUtils.repeat()Usage:Java 8\'s String.join provides a tidy way to do this in conjunction with Collections.nCopies:Here\'s a way to do it using only standard String functions and no explicit loops:If you\'re like me and want to use Google Guava and not Apache Commons. You can use the repeat method in the Guava Strings class.With java-8, you can also use Stream.generate.and you can wrap it in a simple utility method if needed:So you want to avoid loops?Here you have it:(of course I know this is ugly and inefficient, but it doesn\'t have loops :-p)You want it simpler and prettier? use jython:Edit: let\'s optimize it a little bit :-DEdit2: I\'ve done a quick and dirty benchmark for the 4 main alternatives, but I don\'t have time to run it several times to get the means and plot the times for several inputs... So here\'s the code if anybody wants to try it:It takes 2 arguments, the first is the number of iterations (each function run with repeat times arg from 1..n) and the second is the string to repeat.So far, a quick inspection of the times running with different inputs leaves the ranking something like this (better to worse):I wouldn\'t ever guessed that the recursive function was faster than the for loop :-oHave fun(ctional xD).This contains less characters than your questionbased on fortran\'s answer, this is a recusive version that uses a StringBuilder:using Dollar is simple as typing:PS: repeat works also for array, List, Set, etcI wanted a function to create a comma-delimited list of question marks for JDBC purposes, and found this post. So, I decided to take two variants and see which one performed better. After 1 million iterations, the garden-variety StringBuilder took 2 seconds (fun1), and the cryptic supposedly more optimal version (fun2) took 30 seconds. What\'s the point of being cryptic again?using only JRE classes (System.arraycopy) and trying to minimize the number of temp objects you can write something like:EDITand without loops you can try with:EDIT 2using Collections is even shorter:however I still like the first version.Nearly every answer proposes a static function as a solution, but thinking Object-Oriented (for reusability-purposes and clarity) I came up with a Solution via Delegation through the CharSequence-Interface (which also opens up usability on mutable CharSequence-Classes).The following Class can be used either with or without Separator-String/CharSequence and each call to "toString()" builds the final repeated String.\nThe Input/Separator are not only limited to String-Class, but can be every Class which implements CharSequence (e.g. StringBuilder, StringBuffer, etc)!If you are worried about performance, just use a StringBuilder inside the loop and do a .toString() on exit of the Loop. Heck, write your own Util Class and reuse it. 5 Lines of code max.I really enjoy this question. There is a lot of knowledge and styles. So I can\'t leave it without show my rock and roll  ;)Do you like it?Simple loopUsing recursion, you can do the following (using ternary operators, one line max):I know, it\'s ugly and probably not efficient, but it\'s one line!for the sake of readability and portability:Despite your desire not to use loops, I think you should use a loop.Your reasons for not using a for loop are not good ones.  In response to your criticisms:Try this out:    I created a recursive method that do the same thing you want.. feel free to use this...i have the same answer on Can I multiply strings in java to repeat sequences?If speed is your concern, then you should use as less memory copying as possible. Thus it is required to work with arrays of chars.To test speed, a similar optimal method using StirngBuilder is like this:and the code to test it:And here the run results from my system:Note that the test for loop is to kick in JIT and have optimal results.here is the latest Stringutils.java StringUtils.javait doesn\'t even need to be this big, can be made into this, and can be copied and pasted \ninto a utility class in your project.So e5, I think the best way to do this would be to simply use the above mentioned code,or any of the answers here. but commons lang is just too big if it\'s a small projectThis is how I did it without using loop:Sometimes simple is best.  Everyone reading the code can see what\'s happening.And the compiler will do the fancy stuff with StringBuilder behind the scenes for you.Here is a simple way to repeat a star a number of times (up to some known maximum):
