From what I\'ve been reading, Sass is a language that makes CSS more powerful with variable and math support. What\'s the difference with SCSS? Is it supposed to be the same language? Similar? Different?Sass is a CSS pre-processor with syntax advancements. Style sheets in the advanced syntax are processed by the program, and turned into regular CSS style sheets. However, they do not extend the CSS standard itself.The main reason for this is the addition of features that CSS painfully lacks (like variables).  The difference between SCSS and Sass, this text on the Sass documentation page should answer the question:There are two syntaxes available for Sass. The first, known as SCSS (Sassy CSS) and used throughout this reference, is an extension of the syntax of CSS. This means that every valid CSS stylesheet is a valid SCSS file with the same meaning. This syntax is enhanced with the Sass features described below. Files using this syntax have the .scss extension.The second and older syntax, known as the indented syntax (or sometimes just \xe2\x80\x9cSass\xe2\x80\x9d), provides a more concise way of writing CSS. It uses indentation rather than brackets to indicate nesting of selectors, and newlines rather than semicolons to separate properties. Files using this syntax have the .sass extension.However, all this works only with the Sass pre-compiler which in the end creates CSS. It is not an extension to the CSS standard itself.I\'m one of the developers who helped create Sass. The difference is UI. Underneath the textual exterior they are identical. This is why sass and scss files can import each other. Actually, Sass has four syntax parsers: scss, sass, CSS, and less. All of these convert a different syntax into an Abstract Syntax Tree which is further processed into CSS output or even onto one of the other formats via the sass-convert tool.Use the syntax you like the best, both are fully supported and you can change between them later if you change your mind.The Sass .sass file is cleaner than .scss file e.g.example.sassexample.scssAny valid CSS document can be converted to Sassy CSS (SCSS) simply by changing the extension from .css to .scss.Its syntax is different, and that\'s main pro (or con, depending on your perspective). I\'ll try not to repeat much what others said, you can easily google that but instead I\'ll like to say a couple of things from my experience using both, sometimes even in same project.SASS pro SASS consOther than this - they do the same job. Now, what I like to do is to write mixins and variables in .sass and code that will actually compile to css in .scss if possible (ie Visual studio doesn\'t have support for .sass but whenever I work on Rails projects I usually combine two of them, not in one file ofc). Lately I\'m considering giving Stylus a chance (for a fulltime css preprocessor) because it allows you to combine two syntax in one file (among some other features). That may not be good direction for a team to take but when you are maintaining it alone - it\'s ok. Stylus is actually most flexible when syntax is in question. And finaly mixin for .scss vs .sass syntax comparison: From the homepage of the languageSass has two syntaxes. The new main\n  syntax (as of Sass 3) is known as\n  \xe2\x80\x9cSCSS\xe2\x80\x9d (for \xe2\x80\x9cSassy CSS\xe2\x80\x9d), and is a\n  superset of CSS3\xe2\x80\x99s syntax. This means\n  that every valid CSS3 stylesheet is\n  valid SCSS as well. SCSS files use the\n  extension .scss.The second, older syntax is known as\n  the indented syntax (or just \xe2\x80\x9cSass\xe2\x80\x9d).\n  Inspired by Haml\xe2\x80\x99s terseness, it\xe2\x80\x99s\n  intended for people who prefer\n  conciseness over similarity to CSS.\n  Instead of brackets and semicolons, it\n  uses the indentation of lines to\n  specify blocks. Although no longer the\n  primary syntax, the indented syntax\n  will continue to be supported. Files\n  in the indented syntax use the\n  extension .sass.SASS is an interpreted language that spits out CSS. The structure of Sass looks like CSS (remotely), but it seems to me that the description is a bit misleading; it\'s not a replacement for CSS, or an extension. It\'s an interpreter which spits out CSS in the end,  so Sass still has the limitations of normal CSS, but it masks them with simple code.The basic difference is the syntax. While SASS has a loose syntax with white space and no semicolons, the SCSS resembles more to CSS.Sass (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets) have two syntaxes:So they are both part of Sass preprocessor with two different possible syntaxes.The most important differents between SCSS and original Sass:SCSS:Original Sass:These are two syntaxes available for Sass.Some prefer Sass, the original syntax - while others prefer SCSS. Either way, but it is worth noting that Sass\xe2\x80\x99s indented syntax has not been and will never be deprecated.Conversions with sass-convert:SASS REFERENCESass was the first one, and The syntax is a bit diffrent.\nFor example, including a mixin:Sass ignores curly brackets and semi colons and lay on nesting, which I found more useful.Original sass is ruby syntax like, similar to ruby, jade etc...In those syntaxes, we don\'t use {}, instead we go with white spaces, also no usage of ;...In scss syntaxes are more like CSS, but with getting more options like: nesting, declaring, etc, similar to less and other pre-processing CSS ...They basically do the same thing, but I put couple of lines of each to see the syntax difference, look at the {}, ;, and spaces:SASS:SCSS:
