I know the clear command that \'clears\' the current screen, but it does this just by printing lots of newlines - the cleared contents just get scrolled up.Is there a way to completely wipe all previous output from the terminal so that I can\'t reach it even by scrolling up?\xe2\x8c\x98+KCommand+K for newer keyboardsPut this in your .bash_profile or .bashrcIf you\'re using the OSX Terminal app (as stated by the OP), a better approach (thanks to https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/113168) is just this:which clears the scrollback buffer.  And it\'s faster than running AppleScript.  There are other options as well, see https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/113168 for more info.The AppleScript answer given in this thread works, BUT it has the nasty side effect of clearing ANY terminal window that happens to be active.  This is surprising if you\'re running the script in one window and trying to get work done in another!You avoid this by refining the AppleScript to only clear the screen if it is frontmost by doing this (taken from https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/31887):... but as when it\'s not the current window, the output will stack up until it becomes current again, which probably isn\'t what you want.The pretty way is printf \'\\33c\\e[3J\'On Mac OS X Terminal this functionality is already built in to the Terminal Application as View->Clear Scrollback (Default is CMD+K).So you can re-assign this as you like with Apple\'s Keyboard shortcuts. Just add a new shortcut for Terminal with the command "Clear Scrollback". (I use CMD+L, because it\'s similar to CTRL+L to clear the current screen contents, without clearing the buffer.)Not sure how you would use this in a script (maybe AppleScript as others have pointed out).With Mac OS X Yosemite (10.10) use Option + Command + K to clear the scrollback in Terminal.app.in terminal: \nhistory -cOr you can send a page break (ASCII form feed) by pressing:While this technically just starts a new page, this has the same net effect as all the other methods, whilst being a lot faster (except for the Apple+K solution, of course).And because this is an ASCII control command, it works in all shells.clears out everything, works well on osX as well. very neatI couldn\'t get any of the above to work (on macOS).A combination worked for me - This clears the buffer and the screen
