I\'m trying to migrate a MySQL-based app over to Microsoft SQL Server 2005 (not by choice, but that\'s life).In the original app, we used almost entirely ANSI-SQL compliant statements, with one significant exception -- we used MySQL\'s group_concat function fairly frequently.group_concat, by the way, does this: given a table of, say, employee names and projects...returns:... and here\'s what you get with group_concat:returns:So what I\'d like to know is: Is it possible to write, say, a user-defined function in SQL Server which emulates the functionality of group_concat? I have almost no experience using UDFs, stored procedures, or anything like that, just straight-up SQL, so please err on the side of too much explanation :)No REAL easy way to do this. Lots of ideas out there, though.Best one I\'ve found:Or a version that works correctly if the data might contain characters such as <I may be a bit late to the party but this method works for me and is easier than the COALESCE method.Possibly too late to be of benefit now, but is this not the easiest way to do things?Have a look at the GROUP_CONCAT project on Codeplex, I think I does exactly what you are searching for:This project contains a set of SQLCLR User-defined Aggregate functions (SQLCLR UDAs) that collectively offer similar functionality to the MySQL GROUP_CONCAT function. There are multiple functions to ensure the best performance based on the functionality required...SQL Server 2017 does introduce a new aggregate functionSTRING_AGG ( expression, separator).Concatenates the values of string expressions and places separator\n  values between them. The separator is not added at the end of string.The concatenated elements can be ordered by appending WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY some_expression)For versions 2005-2016 I typically use the XML method in the accepted answer.This can fail in some circumstances however. e.g. if the data to be concatenated contains CHAR(29) you seeFOR XML could not serialize the data ... because it\n  contains a character (0x001D) which is not allowed in XML.A more robust method that can deal with all characters would be to use a CLR aggregate. However applying an ordering to the concatenated elements is more difficult with this approach.The method of assigning to a variable is not guaranteed and should be avoided in production code.With the below code you have to set PermissionLevel=External on your project properties before you deploy, and change the database to trust external code (be sure to read elsewhere about security risks and alternatives [like certificates]) by running "ALTER DATABASE database_name SET TRUSTWORTHY ON".I\'ve tested this using a query that looks like:And yields: A, B, C, DTried these but for my purposes in MS SQL Server 2005 the following was most useful, which I found at xaprb@Mark as you mentioned it was the space character that caused issues for me.To concatenate all the project manager names from projects that have multiple project managers write:About J Hardiman\'s answer, how about:By the way, is the use of "Surname" a typo or am i not understanding a concept here?Anyway, thanks a lot guys cuz it saved me quite some time :)
