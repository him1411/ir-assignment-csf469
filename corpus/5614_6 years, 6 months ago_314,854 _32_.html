I don\'t really understand this one:according to: http://www.madboa.com/geek/openssl/#key-rsa , You can generate a public key from a private key.My initial thinking was that they are generated in a pair together.\nDoes RSA private key contain the sum? or the public key? will actually produce a public - private key pair. The pair is stored in the generated mykey.pem file.will extract the public key and print that out. Here is a link to a page that describes this better. EDIT: Check the examples section here. To just output the public part of a private key:If you\'re looking to extract the public key for use with OpenSSH, you will need to get the public key a bit differentlyThis public key format is compatible with OpenSSH. Append the public key to remote:~/.ssh/authorized_keys and you\'ll be good to go docs from SSH-KEYGEN(1)-y This option will read a private OpenSSH format file and print an OpenSSH public key to stdout.An RSA private key contains all the information needed to produce the public key. In most formats including openssl\'s the private key is represented as a PKCS#1 RSAPrivatekey object or some variant thereof:A.1.2 RSA private key syntaxAn RSA private key should be represented with the ASN.1 type\n  RSAPrivateKey:As you can see, this format has a number of fields including the modulus and public exponent and thus is a strict superset of the information in an RSA public key.The Public Key is not stored in the PEM file as some people think. The following DER structure is present on the Private Key File:openssl rsa -text -in mykey.pemSo there is enough data to calculate the Public Key (modulus and public exponent), which is what openssl rsa -in mykey.pem -pubout doeshere in this code first we are creating RSA key which is private but it has pair of its public key as well so to get your actual public key we simply do thishope you get it for more info check thisMy answer below is a bit lengthy, but hopefully it provides some details that are missing in previous answers. I\'ll start with some related statements and finally answer the initial question.To encrypt something using RSA algorithm you need modulus and encryption (public) exponent pair (n, e). That\'s your public key. To decrypt something using RSA algorithm you need modulus and decryption (private) exponent pair (n, d). That\'s your private key.To encrypt something using RSA public key you treat your plaintext as a number and raise it to the power of e modulus n:To decrypt something using RSA private key you treat your ciphertext as a number and raise it to the power of d modulus n:To generate private (d,n) key using openssl you can use the following command:To generate public (e,n) key from the private key using openssl you can use the following command:To dissect the contents of the private.pem private RSA key generated by the openssl command above run the following (output truncated to labels here):Shouldn\'t private key consist of (n, d) pair only? Why are there 6 extra components? It contains e (public exponent) so that public RSA key can be generated/extracted/derived from the private.pem private RSA key. The rest 5 components are there to speed up the decryption process. It turns out that by pre-computing and storing those 5 values it is possible to speed the RSA decryption by the factor of 4. Decryption will work without those 5 components, but it can be done faster if you have them handy. The speeding up algorithm is based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem.Yes, private.pem RSA private key actually contains all of those 8 values; none of them are generated on the fly when you run the previous command. Try running the following commands and compare output:This structure of the RSA private key is recommended by the PKCS#1 v1.5 as an alternative (second) representation. PKCS#1 v2.0 standard excludes e and d exponents from the alternative representation altogether. PKCS#1 v2.1 and v2.2 propose further changes to the alternative representation, by optionally including more CRT-related components.To see the contents of the public.pem public RSA key run the following (output truncated to labels here):No surprises here. It\'s just (n, e) pair, as promised.Now finally answering the initial question: As was shown above private RSA key generated using openssl contains components of both public and private keys and some more. When you generate/extract/derive public key from the private key, openssl copies two of those components (e,n) into a separate file which becomes your public key.
