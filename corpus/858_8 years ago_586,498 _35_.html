I have a directory structure like this:Inside main and tools, and any other directory, at any level, there can be a \'bin\' directory, which I want to ignore (and I want to ignore everything under it too). I\'ve tried each of these patterns in .gitignore but none of them work:Can anyone help me out? The first pattern (the one I think should be working) works just fine if I do this:But I don\'t want to have an entry for every top-level directory and I don\'t want to have to modify .gitignore every time I add a new one.This is on Windows using the latest msysgit.EDIT: one more thing, there are files and directories that have the substring \'bin\' in their names, I don\'t want those to be ignored :)Before version 1.8.2, ** didn\'t have any special meaning in the .gitignore. As of 1.8.2 git supports ** to mean zero or more sub-directories (see release notes).The way to ignore all directories called bin anywhere below the current level in a directory tree is with a .gitignore file with the pattern:In the man page, there an example of ignoring a directory called foo using an analogous pattern.Edit: \nIf you already have any bin folders in your git index which you no longer wish to track then you need to remove them explicitly. Git won\'t stop tracking paths that are already being tracked just because the now match a new .gitignore pattern. Execute a folder remove (rm) from index only (--cached) recursivelly (-r). Command line example for root bin folder:The .gitignore of your dream seems to be:on the top level.I think it is worth to mention for git beginners:If you already have a file checked in, and you want to ignore it, Git\n  will not ignore the file if you add a rule later. In those cases, you\n  must untrack the file first, by running the following command in your\n  terminal:git rm --cachedSo if you want add to ignore some directories in your local repository (which already exist) after editing .gitignore you want to run this on your root dirIt will basically \'refresh\' your local repo and unstage ignored files. See:http://git-scm.com/docs/git-rm,https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/The ** never properly worked before, but since git 1.8.2 (March, 8th 2013), it seems to be explicitly mentioned and supported:The patterns in .gitignore and .gitattributes files can have **/, as a pattern that matches 0 or more levels of subdirectory.E.g. "foo/**/bar" matches "bar" in "foo" itself or in a subdirectory of "foo".In your case, that means this line might now be supported:matches both upper and lower caseI didn\'t see it mentioned here, but this appears to be case sensitive. Once I changed to /Bin the files were ignored as expected.[Bb]in will solve the problem, but... \nHere a more extensive list of things you should ignore (sample list by GitExtension):If you\'re looking for a great global .gitignore file for any Visual Studio ( .NET ) solution - I recommend you to use this one: https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/VisualStudio.gitignoreAFAIK it has the most comprehensive .gitignore for .NET projects.As a notice;If you think about .gitignore does not work in a way (so added foo/* folder in it but git status still showing that folder content(s) as modified or something like this), then you can use this command;git checkout -- foo/*Adding **/bin/ to the .gitignore file did the trick for me (Note: bin folder wasn\'t added to index).for 2.13.3 and onwards,writing just bin in your .gitignore file should ignore the bin and all its subdirectories and files bin
