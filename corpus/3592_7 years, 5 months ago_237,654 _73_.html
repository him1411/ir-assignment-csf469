What is a good step by step explanation on how to use the Boost library in an empty project in Visual Studio 2010?While Nate\'s answer is pretty good already, I\'m going to expand on it more specifically for Visual Studio 2010 as requested, and include information on compiling in the various optional components which requires external libraries.If you are using headers only libraries, then all you need to do is to unarchive the boost download and set up the environment variables. The instruction below set the environment variables for Visual Studio only, and not across the system as a whole. Note you only have to do it once.If you want to use the part of boost that require building, but none of the features that requires external dependencies, then building it is fairly simple.Run b2: Go for a walk / watch a movie or 2 / ....  If you want the optional components, then you have more work to do. These are:Boost.IOStreams Bzip2 filters:Boost.IOStreams Zlib filtersBoost.MPIBoost.PythonTo completely built the 32-bits version of the library requires 32-bits Python, and similarly for the 64-bits version. If you have multiple versions installed for such reason, you\'ll need to tell b2 where to find specific version and when to use which one. One way to do that would be to edit the file project-config.jam in the directory <BOOST_PATH> that resulted from running bootstrap. Add in the following two lines adjusting as appropriate for your Python installation paths & versions (note the space before the \';\').using python : 2.6 : C:\\\\Python\\\\Python26\\\\python ;using python : 2.6 : C:\\\\Python\\\\Python26-x64\\\\python :  :  : <address-model>64 ;Do note that such explicit Python specification currently cause MPI build to fail. So you\'ll need to do some separate building with and without specification to build everything if you\'re building MPI as well.Follow the second set of instructions above to build boost.Boost.Regex ICU supportWhile the instructions on the Boost web site are helpful, here is a condensed version that also builds x64 libraries.This installs the Boost header files under C:\\Boost\\include\\boost-(version), and the 32-bit libraries under C:\\Boost\\lib\\i386. Note that the default location for the libraries is C:\\Boost\\lib but you\xe2\x80\x99ll want to put them under an i386 directory if you plan to build for multiple architectures.This installs the Boost header files under C:\\Boost\\include\\boost-(version), and the 64-bit libraries under C:\\Boost\\lib\\x64. Note that the default location for the libraries is C:\\Boost\\lib but you\xe2\x80\x99ll want to put them under an x64 directory if you plan to build for multiple architectures.You can also try -j%NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS% as an argument it will use all your cores. Makes things super fast on my quad core.I could recommend the following trick: Create a special boost.props fileThis procedure has the value that boost is included only in projects where you want to explicitly include it. When you have a new project that uses boost, do:EDIT (following edit from @jim-fred):The resulting boost.props file looks something like this...It contains a user macro for the location of the boost directory (in this case, D:\\boost_1_53_0) and two other parameters: IncludePath and LibraryPath. A statement #include <boost/thread.hpp> would find thread.hpp in the appropriate directory (in this case, D:\\boost_1_53_0\\boost\\thread.hpp). The \'stage\\lib\\\' directory may change depending on the directory installed to.This boost.props file could be located in the D:\\boost_1_53_0\\ directory.What parts of Boost do you need? A lot of stuff is part of TR1 which is shipped with Visual Studio, so you could simply say, for example:According to James, this should also work (in C++0x):Also a little note: If you want to reduce the compilation-time, you can add the flag -j2to run two parallel builds at the same time. This might reduce it to viewing one movie ;)This thread has been around a while, and I thought I\'d add something about HOW to build Boost as fast as possible on your specific hardware.If you have a 4 or 6-core use -j5 or -j7 respectively. Certainly not the standard build nor -j2 unless you indeed have dual core.I\'m running a Sandy Bridge Extreme with stock clocked 3930K (6-core) on my main station, but have a 2600k (4-core) on older backup box, and the trend is I get the best Boost compile times with N + 1 build processes where N is the number of physical cores. N+2 reaches a point of diminishing returns and the times go up.Notes: Hyperthreading is enabled, 32GB RAM DDR3, Samsung 840 EVO SSD.-j7 on 6-core (2 minutes and 51 seconds) (Win7 Ultimate x64)(Visual Studio 2013)-j6 on 6-core (3 minutes and 2 seconds) (Win7 Ultimate x64)(Visual Studio 2013)-j8 on 6-core (3 minutes and 17 seconds) (Win7 Ultimate x64)(Visual Studio 2013)ConfigI note the 64-bit build takes a bit longer, I need to do the same comparison for those and update.Here is how I was able to use Boost:You will be able to build your project without any errors !Download boost from:\nhttp://www.boost.org/users/download/\ne.g. by svn After that :\ncmd -> go to boost directory ("D:\\boostTrunk" - where You checkout or download and extract package):\ncommand :\nbootstrapwe created bjam.exe in ("D:\\boostTrunk")\nAfter that :\ncommand :\n    bjam toolset=msvc-10.0 variant=debug,release threading=multi link=static \n(It will take some time ~20min.)After that:\nOpen Visual studio 2010 -> create empty project -> go to project properties -> set:Paste this code and check if it is working?Resources :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AmwIwedTCMThe Windows installers located here worked perfectly for me. I took the following steps:Good luck!A small addition to KTC\'s very informative main answer:If you are using the free Visual Studio c++ 2010 Express, and managed to get that one to compile 64-bits binaries, and now want to use that to use a 64-bits version of the Boost libaries, you may end up with 32-bits libraries (your mileage may vary of course, but on my machine this is the sad case).I could fix this using the following: inbetween the steps described above asI inserted a call to \'setenv\' to set the environment. For a release build, the above steps become:I found this info here:\nhttp://boost.2283326.n4.nabble.com/64-bit-with-VS-Express-again-td3044258.htmlA minimalist example to get you started in Visual Studio:1.Download and unzip Boost from here.2.Create a Visual Studio empty project, using an example boost library that does not require separate compilation:3.In your Visual Studio project properties set the Additional Include Directories:For a very simple example:How to Install the Boost Libraries in Visual StudioIf you don\'t want to use the entire boost library, just a subset:Using a subset of the boost libraries in WindowsIf you specifically want to now about the libraries that require compilation:How to use the Boost compiled libraries in WindowsIn addition, there is something I find very useful. Use environment variables for your boost paths. (How to set environment variables in windows, link at bottom for 7,8,10) The BOOST_ROOT variable seems to be common place anymore and is set to the root path where you unzip boost.Then in Properties, c++, general, Additional Include Directories use $(BOOST_ROOT). Then if/when you move to a newer version of the boost library you can update your environment variable to point to this newer version. As more of your projects, use boost you will not have to update the \'Additional Include Directories\' for all of them.You may also create a BOOST_LIB variable and point it to where the libs are staged. So likewise for the Linker->Additional Library Directories, you won\'t have to update projects. I have some old stuff built with vs10 and new stuff with vs14 so built both flavors of the boost lib to the same folder. So if I move a project from vs10 to vs14 I don\'t have to change the boost paths.NOTE: If you change an environment variable it will not suddenly work in an open VS project. VS loads variables on startup. So you will have to close VS and reopen it.
