I\'m trying to perform a LINQ query on a DataTable object and bizarrely I am finding that performing such queries on DataTables is not straightforward. For example:This is not allowed. How do I get something like this working?I\'m amazed that LINQ queries are not allowed on DataTables!You can\'t query against the DataTable\'s Rows collection, since DataRowCollection doesn\'t implement IEnumerable<T>. You need to use the AsEnumerable() extension for DataTable. Like so:And as Keith says, you\'ll need to add a reference to System.Data.DataSetExtensionsAsEnumerable() returns IEnumerable<DataRow>. If you need to convert IEnumerable<DataRow> to a DataTable, use the CopyToDataTable() extension.As @ch00k said:You also need to add a project reference to System.Data.DataSetExtensionsIt\'s not that they were deliberately not allowed on DataTables, it\'s just that DataTables pre-date the IQueryable and generic IEnumerable constructs on which Linq queries can be performed. Both interfaces require some sort type-safety validation. DataTables are not strongly typed. This is the same reason why people can\'t query against an ArrayList, for example.For Linq to work you need to map your results against type-safe objects and query against that instead.Using LINQ to manipulate data in DataSet/DataTableYou can use LINQ to objects on the Rows collection, like so:I realize this has been answered a few times over, but just to offer another approach, I like to use the .Cast<T>() method, it helps me maintain sanity in seeing the explicit type defined, and deep down I think .AsEnumerable() calls it anyways:orTry this simple line of query:Hope it helps;Try thisMost likely, the classes for the DataSet, DataTable and DataRow are already defined in the solution. If that\'s the case you won\'t need the DataSetExtensions reference.Ex. DataSet class name-> CustomSet, DataRow class name-> CustomTableRow (with defined columns: RowNo, ...)Or (as I prefer)Happy coding!This is a simple way that works for me and uses lambda expressions:Then if you want a particular value:For VB.NET The code will look like this:In my application I found that using LINQ to Datasets with the AsEnumerable() extension for DataTable as suggested in the answer was extremely slow.  If you\'re interested in optimizing for speed, use James Newtonking\'s Json.Net library (http://james.newtonking.com/json/help/index.html)You can get it work elegant via linq like this:Or like dynamic linq this (AsDynamic is called directly on DataSet):I prefer the last approach while is is the most flexible.\nP.S.: Don\'t forget to connect System.Data.DataSetExtensions.dll referenceTry this...
