What is the best way to copy text to the clipboard? (multi-browser)I have tried: but in Internet Explorer it gives a syntax error. In Firefox, it says unsafeWindow is not defined.Edit A nice trick without flash: How does Trello access the user's clipboard?The JavaScript document.execCommand(\'copy\') support has grown, see the links below for browser updates:The above simple example works great if there is a textarea or input element  visible on screen. In some cases you might wish to copy text to the clipboard without displaying an input / textarea element. This is one example of a way to work around this (basically insert element, copy to clipboard, remove element):Tested with Google Chrome 44, Firefox 42.0a1 and IE 11.0.8600.17814.All document.execCommand(\'copy\') calls must take place as a direct result of a user action, e.g. click event handler. This is a measure to prevent messing with the users clipboard when they don\'t expect it.See the Google Developers post here for more info.Note the full Clipboard API draft specification can be found here:\nhttps://w3c.github.io/clipboard-apis/However as an example of browser compatibility issues, Google Chrome from ~April to ~October 2015 only returned true from document.queryCommandSupported(\'copy\') if the command was called from a user-initiated thread.Note compatibility detail below.Whilst a simple call to document.execCommand(\'copy\') wrapped in a try/catch block called as a result of a user click will get you the most compatibility use the following has some provisos:Any call to document.execCommand, document.queryCommandSupported or document.queryCommandEnabled should be wrapped in a try/catch block.Different browser implementations and browser versions throw differing types of exceptions when called instead of returning false.Different browser implementations are still in flux and the Clipboard API is still in draft, so remember to do your testing.Automatic copying to clipboard may be dangerous, therefore most browsers (except IE) make it very difficult. Personally, I use the following simple trick:The user is presented with the prompt box, where the text to be copied is already selected. Now it\'s enough to press Ctrl+C and Enter (to close the box) -- and voila!Now the clipboard copy operation is SAFE, because the user does it manually (but in a pretty straightforward way). Of course, works in all browsers.The following approach works in Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Edge, and in recent versions of Safari (Copy support was added in version 10 which was released Oct 2016).Note: you will not see the textarea, as it is added and removed within the same synchronous invocation of Javascript code.Some things to watch out for if you are implementing this yourself:The function below should handle all of the following issues as cleanly as possible. Please leave a comment if you find any problems or have any suggestions for improving it.https://jsfiddle.net/fx6a6n6x/If you want a really simple solution (takes less than 5 minutes to integrate) and looks good right out of the box, then Clippy is a nice alternative to some of the more complex solutions.  ClippyIt was written by a co-founder of Github.  Example Flash embed code below:Remember to replace #{text} with the text you need copied, and #{bgcolor} with a color.Reading and modifying the clipboard from a webpage raises security and privacy concerns. However, in InternetÂ Explorer, it is possible to do it. I found this example snippet:I have recently written a technical blog post on this very problem (I work at Lucidchart and we recently did an overhaul on our clipboard).Copying plain text to the clipboard is relatively simple, assuming you want to do it during a system copy event (user presses ctrl-c or uses the browser\'s menu). Putting text on the clipboard not during a system copy event is much more difficult. It looks like some of these other answers reference ways to do it via Flash, which is the only cross-browser way to do it (so far as I understand).Other than that, there are some options on a browser-by-browser basis.This is the most simple in IE, where you can access the clipboardData object at anytime from Javascript via:(When you attempt to do this outside of a system cut, copy, or paste event, however, IE will prompt the user to grant the web application clipboard permission.)In Chrome, you can create a chrome extension that will give you clipboard permissions (this is what we do for Lucidchart). Then for users with your extension installed you\'ll just need to fire the system event yourself:It looks like Firefox has some options that allow users to grant permissions to certain sites to access the clipboard, but I haven\'t tried any of these personally.clipboard.js is a small, non-flash, utility that allows copying of text or html data to the clipboard.  It\'s very easy to use, just include the .js and use something like this: clipboard.js is also on GitHubZeroClipboard is the best cross-browser solution I\'ve found:If you need non-flash support for iOS you just add a fall-back:http://zeroclipboard.org/https://github.com/zeroclipboard/ZeroClipboardFrom one of the projects I\'ve been working on, a jQuery copy-to-clipboard plugin that utilizes the Zero Clipboard library.It is easier to use than the native Zero Clipboard plugin if you\'re a heavy jQuery user.I found the following solution:On key down handler creates "pre" tag. We set the content to copy to this tag, then make a selection on this tag and return true in handler. This calls standard handler of chrome and copies selected text.And if you need you may be set the timeout for function for restoring previous selection. My implementation on Mootools:Usage:On paste it creates textarea and works the same way.PS may be this solution can be used for creating fully cross-browser solution without flash. Its works in FF and Chrome.The other methods will copy plain text to the clipboard. To copy HTML (ie, you can paste results into a WSIWYG editor), you can do the following in IE ONLY. This is is fundamentally different from the other methods, as the browser actually visibly selects the content.Since recently Chrome 42+ and Firefox 41+ now support the document.execCommand(\'copy\') command. So I created a couple of functions for cross browser copy to clipboard ability using a combination of Tim Down\'s old answer and Google Developer\'s answer:As of Flash 10, you can only copy to clipboard if the action originates from user interaction with a Flash object. (Read related section from Adobe\'s Flash 10 announcement)The solution is to overly a flash object above the Copy button, or whatever element initiates the copy. Zero Clipboard is currently the best library with this implementation. Experienced Flash developers may just want to make their own library.In browsers other than IE you need to use a small flash object to manipulate the clipboard, e.g.I found the following solution:I have the text in a hidden input. Because setSelectionRange doesn\'t work on hidden inputs, I changed temporarily the type to text, copy the text and then make it hidden again. If you want to copy the text from an element, you can pass it to the function and save it\'s content in the target variable.This is an expansion of @Chase\'s answer, with the advantage that it will work for IMAGE and TABLE elements, not just DIVs on IE9.I had the same problem building a custom grid edit from (something like Excel) and compatibility with Excel. I had to support selecting multiple cells, copying and pasting. Solution: create a textarea where you will be inserting data for the user to copy (for me when the user is selecting cells), set focus on it (for example, when user press Ctrl) and select the whole text. So, when the user hit Ctrl + C he gets copied cells he selected. After testing just resizing the textarea to 1 pixel (I didn\'t test if it will be working on display:none). It works nicely on all browsers, and it is transparent to the user.Pasting - you could do same like this (differs on your target) - keep focus on textarea and catch paste events using onpaste (in my project I use textareas in cells to edit).I can\'t paste an example (commercial project), but you got the idea.I have used clipboard.jswe can get it on npmand also on bowerUsage & examples are  at https://zenorocha.github.io/clipboard.js/ng-clip was the simplest solution for AngularJS.Many answers already but I like to add one (jQuery). Works like a charm on any browser, also mobile ones (ie prompts about security but when you accept it just works fine).In your code:I found another nice solution LMCButton - small animated flash cross browser button. One JavaScript functions and swf button. Simple options (caption, custom JavaScript).  Link: Copy to Clipboard LMCButtonMy bad. This only works in IE.Here\'s yet another way to copy text:I had to copy the non-input boxes text (text within any div/span tag) from the page and came up with following code. Only trick is to have a hidden field but as type TEXT, wont work with type hidden. And in the HTML add the followinginput type="text" id="hiddenField" style="width:5px;border:0" />\n...None of these answers take into account iOS not allowing execCommand. Here is one for all modern browsers (and IE11+) as well as iOS and Android. Based on the accepted answer. Unlike that answer it also sets readonly to false so a mobile keyboard doesn\'t pop up when copying.I would like to share my solution too, it\'s a bit of a combination between the other answers.It uses jQuery but it doesn\'t have to of course, you can change that if you want. I just had jQuery to my disposal. You can also add some CSS to make sure the input doesn\'t show. For instance something like:Or ofcourse you could also do some inline stylingLooks like you took the code from Greasemonkey\\JavaScript Copy to Clipboard button or the original source of this snippet...This code was for Greasemonkey, hence the unsafeWindow. And I guess the syntax error in IE comes from the const keyword which is specific to Firefox (replace it with var).It seems I misread the question, but for reference, you can extract a range of the DOM (not to clipboard; compatible with all modern browsers), and combine it with the oncopy and onpaste and onbeforepaste events to get clipboard behaviour. Here\'s the code to achieve this: As far as I know that only works in InternetÂ Explorer.See also Dynamic Tools - JavaScript Copy To Clipboard, but it requires the user to change the configuration first and even then it doesn\'t seems to work.Update 2015: currently theres a way to use document.execCommand to work with the clipboard.\nclipboard.js provides a cross browser way to work with the clipboard ( browser support )I was going to use clipboard.js, but it doesn\'t have any mobile solution in place (yet) ... so I wrote a super small library:https://github.com/ryanpcmcquen/chevalThis will either copy the text (Desktop/Android/Safari 10+), or at the very least, select the text (older versions of iOS). Minified it is just over 1kB. In desktop Safari (Press Command + C to copy. You also don\'t need to write any JavaScript to use it.
