Consider the following:How can I make it so that when the user clicks the span, it does not fire the div\'s click event?event.stopPropagation()EDIT:\nFor IE: window.event.cancelBubble = trueThere are two ways to get the event object from inside a function:If you need to support legacy browsers that don\'t follow the W3C recommendations, generally inside a function you would use something like the following:which would check first one, and then the other and store whichever was found inside the event variable. However in an inline event handler there isn\'t an e object to use. In that case you have to take advantage of the arguments collection which is always available and refers to the complete set of arguments passed to a function:However, generally speaking you should be avoiding inline event handlers if you need to to anything complicated like stopping propagation. Writing your event handlers separately and the attaching them to elements is a much better idea in the medium and long term, both for readability and maintainability.Keep in mind that window.event is not supported in FireFox, and therefore it must be something along the lines of:Or, you can use the W3C standard for FireFox:If you want to get fancy, you can do this:Use this function, it will test for the existence of the correct method.I had the same issue - js error box in IE - this works fine in all browsers as far as I can see (event.cancelBubble=true does the job in IE)This worked for meFor ASP.NET web pages (not MVC), you can use Sys.UI.DomEvent object as wrapper of native event. or, pass event as a parameter to inner function:and in someFunction:According to this page, in IE you need:event.cancelBubble = trueThis also works - In the link HTML use onclick with return like this :And then the comfirmClick() function should be like:Why not just check which element was clicked? If you click on something, window.event.target is assigned to the element which was clicked, and the clicked element can also be passed as an argument. If the target and element aren\'t equal, it was an event that propagated up.
