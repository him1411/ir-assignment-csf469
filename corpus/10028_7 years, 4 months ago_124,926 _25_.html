Are there any events fired by an element to check wether a css3 transition has started or end?The completion of a CSS Transition generates a corresponding DOM Event. An event is fired for each property that undergoes a transition. This allows a content developer to perform actions that synchronize with the completion of a transition.You can set a handler for a DOM event\n  that is sent at the end of a\n  transition. The event is an instance\n  of WebKitTransitionEvent and its type\n  is webKitTransitionEnd in JavaScript.There is a single event that is fired when transitions complete. In Firefox, the event is transitionend, in Opera, oTransitionEnd, and in WebKit it is webkitTransitionEnd.There is one type of transition event\n  available. The oTransitionEnd event\n  occurs at the completion of the\n  transition.The transitionend event occurs at the completion of the transition. If the transition is removed before completion, the event will not fire.SO: How do I normalize CSS3 Transition functions across browsers?I was using the approach given by Pete, however I have now started using the following Alternatively if you use bootstrap then you can simply do This is becuase they include the following in bootstrap.js Note they also include an emulateTransitionEnd function which may be needed to ensure a callback always occurs.Be aware that sometimes this event doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fire, usually in the case\n  when properties don\xe2\x80\x99t change or a paint isn\xe2\x80\x99t triggered. To ensure we\n  always get a callback, let\xe2\x80\x99s set a timeout that\xe2\x80\x99ll trigger the event\n  manually.http://blog.alexmaccaw.com/css-transitionsAll modern browsers now support the unprefixed event:element.addEventListener(\'transitionend\', callback, false);Works in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and Safari. Even IE10+.In Opera 12 when you bind using the plain JavaScript, \'oTransitionEnd\' will work:however if you bind through jQuery, you need to use \'otransitionend\'In case you are using Modernizr or bootstrap-transition.js you can simply do a change:You can find some info here as well http://www.ianlunn.co.uk/blog/articles/opera-12-otransitionend-bugs-and-workarounds/Just for fun, don\'t do this!If you simply want to detect only a single transition end, without using any JS framework here\'s a little convenient utility function:Usage:then if you wish to cancel at some point you can still do it withIt\'s good for other event usages as well :)
