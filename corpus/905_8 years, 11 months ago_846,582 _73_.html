I have a simple page that has some iframe sections (to display RSS links). How can I apply the same CSS format from the main page to the page displayed in the iframe?Edit: This does not work cross domain unless the appropriate CORS header is set.There are two different things here: the style of the iframe block and the style of the page embedded in the iframe. You can set the style of the iframe block the usual way:The style of the page embedded in the iframe must be either set by including it in the child page:Or it can be loaded from the parent page with Javascript:I met this issue with Google Calendar. I wanted to style it on a darker background and change font.Luckily, the URL from the embed code had no restriction on direct access, so by using PHP function **file_get_contents** it is possible to get the \nentire content from the page. Instead of calling the google url, it is possible to call a php file located on your server, ex. google.php, which will contain the original content with modifications:Adding the path to your stylesheet:(This will place your stylesheet last just before the head end tag.)Specify the base url form the original url in case css and js are called relatively:The final google.php file should look like this:Then you change the iframe embed code to:Good luck!If the content of the iframe is not completely under your control or you want to access the content from different pages with different styles you could try manipulating it using JavaScript.Note that depending on what browser you use this might only work on pages served from the same domain.An iframe is universally handled like a different HTML page by most browsers. If you want to apply the same stylesheet to the content of the iframe, just reference it from the pages used in there.If you control the page in the iframe, as hangy said, the easiest approach is to create a shared CSS file with common styles, then just link to it from your html pages.Otherwise it is unlikely you will be able to dynamically change the style of a page from an external page in your iframe.  This is because browsers have tightened the security on cross frame dom scripting due to possible misuse for spoofing and other hacks.This tutorial may provide you with more information on scripting iframes in general.  About cross frame scripting explains the security restrictions from the IE perspective.Here is how to apply CSS code directly without using <link> to load an extra stylesheet. This hides the banner in the iframe page. Thank you for your suggestions!The above with a little change works:Works fine with ff3 and ie8 at leastIf you want to reuse CSS and JavaScript from the main page maybe you should consider replacing <IFRAME> with a Ajax loaded content. This is more SEO friendly now when search bots are able to execute JavaScript.This is jQuery example that includes another html page into your document. This is much more SEO friendly than iframe. In order to be sure that the bots are not indexing the included page just add it to disallow in robots.txtYou could also include jQuery directly from Google: http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlibs/documentation/ - this means optional auto-inclusion of newer versions and some significant speed increase. Also, means that you have to trust them for delivering you just the jQuery ;)The following worked for me.My compact version:However, sometimes the iframe is not ready on window loaded, so there is a need of using a timer.Ready-to-use code (with timer):...and jQuery link:Expanding on the above jQuery solution to cope with any delays in loading the frame contents.You will not be able to style the contents of the iframe this way. My suggestion would be to use serverside scripting (PHP, ASP, or a Perl script) or find an online service that will convert a feed to JavaScript code. The only other way to do it would be if you can do a serverside include.When you say "doc.open()" it means you can write whatever HTML tag inside the iframe, so you should write all the basic tags for the HTML page and if you want to have a CSS link in your iframe head just write an iframe with CSS link in it. I give you an example:We can insert style tag into iframe. Posted also here...I found another solution to put the style in the main html like thisand then in iframe do this (see the js onload)and in jsIt may not be the best solution, and it certainly can be improved, but it is another option if you want to keep a "style" tag in parent windowOther answers here seem to use jQuery and CSS links.This code uses vanilla JavaScript. It creates a new <style> element. It sets the text content of that element to be a string containing the new CSS. And it appends that element directly to the iframe document\'s head. I think the easiest way is to add another div, in the same place as the iframe, then make its z-index bigger than the iframe container, so you can easly just style your own div. If you need to click on it, just use pointer-events:none on your own div, so the iframe would be working in case you need to click on it ;)I hope It will help someone ;)  Incase if you have access to iframe page and want a different CSS to apply on it only when you load it via iframe on your page, here I found a solution for these kind of thingsthis works even if iframe is loading a different domaincheck about postMessage()plan is, send the css to iframe as a message like* is to send this message irrespective of what domain it is in iframeand receive the message in iframe and add the received message(CSS) to that document head.code to add in iframe page There is a wonderful script that replaces a node with an iframe version of itself.\nCodePen DemoUsage Examples:The best way may be the following (if you control target site):1) set the iframe link with style parameter, like:(the last phrase is a{color:red}  encoded by urlencode function.2) set the receiver page target.php like this:Here, There are two things inside the domainSo you want to style those two sections as follows,1. Style for the iFrame SectionIt can style using CSS with that respected id or class name. You can just style it in your parent Style sheets also.2. Style the Page Loaded inside the iFrameThis Styles can be loaded from the parent page with the help of Javascriptthen set that CSS file to the respected iFrame sectionHere, You can edit the Head Part of the Page inside the iFrame using this way alsoAs an alternative, you can use CSS-in-JS technology, like below lib:https://github.com/cssobj/cssobjIt can inject JS object as CSS to iframe, dynamicallyuse can try this:Well, I have followed these steps:This works in IE 6. Should work in other browsers, do check!
