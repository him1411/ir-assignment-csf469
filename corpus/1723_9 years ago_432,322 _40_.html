This question already has an answer here:How do I enumerate the properties of a JavaScript object?I actually want to list all the defined variables and their values, but I\'ve learned that defining a variable actually creates a property of the window object.Simple enough:Now, you will not get private variables this way because they are not available.EDIT: @bitwiseplatypus is correct that unless you use the hasOwnProperty() method, you will get properties that are inherited - however, I don\'t know why anyone familiar with object-oriented programming would expect anything less! Typically, someone that brings this up has been subjected to Douglas Crockford\'s warnings about this, which still confuse me a bit. Again, inheritance is a normal part of OO languages and is therefore part of JavaScript, notwithstanding it being prototypical.Now, that said, hasOwnProperty() is useful for filtering, but we don\'t need to sound a warning as if there is something dangerous in getting inherited properties.EDIT 2: @bitwiseplatypus brings up the situation that would occur should someone add properties/methods to your objects at a point in time later than when you originally wrote your objects (via its prototype) - while it is true that this might cause unexpected behavior, I personally don\'t see that as my problem entirely. Just a matter of opinion. Besides, what if I design things in such a way that I use prototypes during the construction of my objects and yet have code that iterates over the properties of the object and I want all inherited properties? I wouldn\'t use hasOwnProperty(). Then, let\'s say, someone adds new properties later. Is that my fault if things behave badly at that point? I don\'t think so. I think this is why jQuery, as an example, has specified ways of extending how it works (via jQuery.extend and jQuery.fn.extend).Use a for..in loop to enumerate an object\'s properties, but be careful. The enumeration will return properties not just of the object being enumerated, but also from the prototypes of any parent objects.To avoid including inherited properties in your enumeration, check hasOwnProperty():Edit: I disagree with JasonBunting\'s statement that we don\'t need to worry about enumerating inherited properties. There is danger in enumerating over inherited properties that you aren\'t expecting, because it can change the behavior of your code.It doesn\'t matter whether this problem exists in other languages; the fact is it exists, and JavaScript is particularly vulnerable since modifications to an object\'s prototype affects child objects even if the modification takes place after instantiation.This is why JavaScript provides hasOwnProperty(), and this is why you should use it in order to ensure that third party code (or any other code that might modify a prototype) doesn\'t break yours. Apart from adding a few extra bytes of code, there is no downside to using hasOwnProperty().The standard way, which has already been proposed several times is:However Internet Explorer 6, 7 and 8 have a bug in the JavaScript interpreter, which has the effect that some keys are not enumerated. If you run this code:If will alert "12" in all browsers except IE. IE will simply ignore this key. The affected key values are:To be really safe in IE you have to use something like:The good news is that EcmaScript 5 defines the Object.keys(myObject) function, which returns the keys of an object as array and some browsers (e.g. Safari 4) already implement it.In modern browsers (ECMAScript 5) to get all enumerable properties you can do:Object.keys(obj)\n(Check the link to get a snippet for backward compatibility on older browsers)Or to get also non-enumerable properties:Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj)Check ECMAScript 5 compatibility tableAdditional info:\nWhat is a enumerable attribute?I think an example of the case that has caught me by surprise is relevant:But to my surprise, the output isWhy? Another script on the page has extended the Object prototype:I found it... for (property in object) { // do stuff } will list all the properties, and therefore all the globally declared variables on the window object..Simple JavaScript code:jQuery:If you are using the Underscore.js library, you can use function keys:Here\'s how to enumerate an object\'s properties:Python\'s dict has \'keys\' method, and that is really useful. I think in JavaScript we can have something this:EDIT: But the answer of @carlos-ruana works very well. I tested Object.keys(window), and the result is what I expected.If you\'re trying to enumerate the properties in order to write new code against the object, I would recommend using a debugger like Firebug to see them visually. Another handy technique is to use Prototype\'s Object.toJSON() to serialize the object to JSON, which will show you both property names and values. http://www.prototypejs.org/api/object/tojsonYou can use the for of loop.If you want an array use Object.keys(object1)I\'m still a beginner in JavaScript, but I wrote a small function to recursively print all the properties of an object and its children:
