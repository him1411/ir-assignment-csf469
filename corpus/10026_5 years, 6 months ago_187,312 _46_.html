I am learning nodejs at the moment on Windows. Several modules are installed globally with npm.cmd, and nodejs failed to find the installed modules. Take jade for example,Jade is installed in directory "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\nodejs\\node_modules", but the following code will fail with a "Cannot find module \'jade\'" error,However, the code will run successfully when jade is locally installed (without -g option in npm). I don\'t want to use locally-installed modules, it\'s a waste of disk space for me, can someone help me to make the globally-installed modules work on Windows?Add an environment variable called NODE_PATH and set it to %USERPROFILE%\\Application Data\\npm\\node_modules (Windows XP), %AppData%\\npm\\node_modules (Windows 7/8/10), or wherever npm ends up installing the modules on your Windows flavor. To be done with it once and for all, add this as a System variable in the Advanced tab of the System Properties dialog (run control.exe sysdm.cpl,System,3).Quick solution in Windows 7+ is to just run:Old storyI\'m pretty much new to node.js myself so I can be not entirely right but from my experience it\'s works this way:See similar question for more details: How do I install a module globally using npm?if you are in the windows7 platform maybe you should change the NODE_PATH like this:\n%AppData%\\npm\\node_modulesI know i can awake a zombie but i think this is still a problem, if you need global access to node modules on Windows 7  you need to add this to your global variable path: Important: only this without the node_modules part, took me half hour to see this.I\'ll just quote from this node\'s blog post...In general, the rule of thumb is:...Of course, there are some cases where you want to do both.\n  Coffee-script and Express both are good examples of apps that have a\n  command line interface, as well as a library. In those cases, you can\n  do one of the following:To make it short, use npm link jade in your app directory.For making it work on windows 10 I solved it by adding the folder %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm to my PATH. Having \\node_modules appended like this: %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\ did not work for me.Tried to add/edit environment variables and come to conclude that:Test environment:I ran into this issue on Windows 7, runningas administrator while being logged on as a normal user.Solution: When executing the same installation as normal user (not "run as admin" for cmd) all was fine. I guess it is related to the default install and search path.For windows, everybody said you should set environment variables for nodejs and npm modules, but do you know why?\nFor some modules, they have command line tool, after installed the module, there\'are [module].cmd file in C:\\Program Files\\nodejs, and it\'s used for launch in window command. So if you don\'t add the path containing the cmd file to environment variables %PATH% , you won\'t launch them successfully through command window.From my expierience with win8.1 npm installs modules on \nC:\\Users\\[UserName]\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules \n  but dumply searches them on\nC:\\Users\\[UserName]\\node_modules.One simple solution reference module in application by full path:I had a terrible time getting global modules to work. Eventually, I explicitly added C:\\Users\\yourusername\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm to the PATH variable under System Variables. I also needed to have this variable come before the nodejs path variable in the list.I am running Windows 10.Alternatively you could add to ~/.npmrc right prefix. I\'ve got C:\\Program Files\\nodejs for 64 Win7.I stumbled on this question because I want to use node.js with visual studio 2015 on my new computer with windows 10. I used node.js on windows 7 and 8 and 8.1 Never a problem node.js finding a module. I use a legacy node.js 0.10.39 because I have to use this version  because of the serial and RFXCOM module.The answer for windows 10 is to set the NODE_PATH in the enviroment variables with C:\\Users\\User\\node_modules.For Windows 10, I had to locally install gulp in the folder:C:\\Users\\myaccount\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modulesThis fixed my issue of "gulp is not recognized"I had the same issue, trying to install bower with npm install -g bowerI think this was because node was installed by another user, not me.I uninstalled node, and then I reinstalled it. During installation, I saw this text for the option Add to PATH > npm modules:Message in node installationAfter node installation, I executed npm install -g bower again. And now bower works.Sure is not necessary reinstall node with own user, like me. Solution must be via NODE_PATH or PATH variables, as other users have explained.This is only to remark that this problem occurs only if node has been installed by another user (or if during installation the option Add to PATH > npm modules has not been marked).if you are using windows , it takes some steps ,\n1) create a file called package.jsonwhere hello is the name of the package   and * means the latest version of your dependency2) code to you project directory and run the following commandnpm installIt installs the dependencies
