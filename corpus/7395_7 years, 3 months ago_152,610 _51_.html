I am trying to follow the Android mapping tutorial and got to this part where I had to get an API key.I have found my debug.keystore but there does not appear to be a keytool application in the directory:There is also no keytool in this directory:I am using Eclipse as my editor and believe that I have downloaded all the latest SDK.What am I doing wrong?keytool comes with the Java SDK. You should find it in the directory that contains javac, etc.Okay, so this post is from six months ago, but I thought I would add some info here for people who are confused about the whole API key/MD5 fingerprint business. It took me a while to figure out, so I assume others have had trouble with it too (unless I\'m just that dull).These directions are for Windows XP, but I imagine it is similar for other versions of Windows.  It appears Mac and Linux users have an easier time with this so I won\'t address them.So in order to use mapviews in your Android apps, Google wants to check in with them so you can sign off on an Android Maps APIs Terms Of Service agreement. I think they don\'t want you to make any turn-by-turn GPS apps to compete with theirs or something. I didn\'t really read it. Oops.So go to http://code.google.com/android/maps-api-signup.html and check it out. They want you to check the "I have read and agree with the terms and conditions" box and enter your certificate\'s MD5 fingerprint. Wtf is that, you might say. I don\'t know, but just do what I say and your Android app doesn\'t get hurt.Go to Start>Run and type cmd to open up a command prompt. You need to navigate to the directory with the keytool.exe file, which might be in a slightly different place depending on which version JDK you have installed. Mine is in C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.6.0_21\\bin but try browsing to the Java folder and see what version you have and change the path accordingly.After navigating to C:\\Program Files\\Java\\<"your JDK version here">\\bin in the command prompt, type with the quotes.  Of course <"your user name here"> would be your own Windows username.(If you are having trouble finding this path and you are using Eclipse, you can check Window>preferences>Android>Build and check out the "Default Debug keystore")Press enter and it will prompt you for a password.  Just press enter.  And voila, at the bottom is your MD5 fingerprint. Type your fingerprint into the text box at the Android Maps API Signup page and hit Generate API Key.And there\'s your key in all its glory, with a handy sample xml layout with your key entered for you to copy and paste.Ok I did this in Windows 7 32-bit system.step 1: go to - C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.6.0_26\\bin  - and run jarsigner.exe first ( double click) step2: locate  debug.keystore, in my case it was - C:\\Users\\MyPcName\\.androidstep3: open command prompt and go to dir - C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.6.0_26\\bin   and give the following command: \n         keytool -list -keystore "C:\\Users\\MyPcName\\.android\\debug.keystore" step4: it will ask for Keystore password now.\n            ( which I am figuring out... :-? )update: OK in my case password was \xc2\xb4 android \xc2\xb4.\n- (I am using Eclipse for android, so I found it here) \nFollow the steps in eclipse: \n                  Windows>preferences>android>build>..\n( Look in `default Debug Keystore\xc2\xb4 field.)Command to change the keystore password (look here): Keystore change passwordsThe 4-Step Answer above worked for me, but it returns the SH1-key... but Google asks for the MD5-key to generate your API key.One needs simply to add a \'-v\' in the command in step 3. -like so:Updated 4-Step AnswerOk I did this in Windows 7 32-bit system.step 1: go to - C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0\\bin - and run jarsigner.exe first ( double click)step2: locate debug.keystore (in Eclipse: Windows/Preferences/Android/build..), in my case it was - C:\\Users\\MyPcName.androidstep3: open command prompt and go to dir - C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0\\bin and give the following command: keytool -v -list -keystore "C:\\Users\\MyPcName.android\\debug.keystore"step4: it will ask for Keystore password now. The default is \'android\'This seemed far harder to find than it needs to be for OSX. Too many conflicting posts For MAC OSX Mavericks Java JDK 7, follow these steps to locate keytool:Firstly make sure to install Java JDK:http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/mac/mac-jdk.htmlThen type this into command prompt:/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.7it will spit out something like:keytool is located in the same directory as javac. ie: From bin directory you can use the keytool.In fact, eclipse export will calland then call com.android.sdklib.internal.build.SignedJarBuilder.One thing that wasn\'t mentioned here (but kept me from running keytool altogether) was that you need to run the Command Prompt as Administrator. Just wanted to share it...No need to use the command line.If you FILE-> "Export Android Application" in the ADK then it will allow you to create a key and then produce your .apk file.If you\'re using Android Studio for Windows to create a release keystore and signed .apk, just follow these steps:1) Build > Generate Signed APK2) Choose "Create New...", choose the path to the keystore, and enter all the required data3) After your keystore (your_keystore_name.jks) has been created, you will then use it to create your first signed apk at a destination of your choosingI haven\'t seen a need to use the command tool if you have an IDE like Android Studio.
