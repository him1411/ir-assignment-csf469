I have done the obvious -- the USB driver was installed from the latest Android SDK, and USB debugging was turned on in the tablet.When the Nexus 7 is connected, the device shows up in the Windows Device Manager as "Android Phone" / "Android Composite ADB Device", with the properties showing driver version 6.0.0.0, so the correct driver is installed and working.This also proves the device is in USB debugging mode, because if it is not it shows up in Windows under "Portable Devices" / "Nexus 7".The problem is that "adb devices" shows no devices, and Eclipse also (not surprisingly) also does not offer the Nexus 7 as a hardware device to run an app on.I have rebooted both devices without effect.The only debugging I can figure out is enable ADB_TRACE=all, but this tells me nothing:What am I doing wrong?When the Nexus 7 is plugged in there is a persistent notification that indicates "CONNECT AS / Media Device (MTP)". In this state adb devices will not show the Nexus, or undoubtedly any other device. Not exactly obvious, but if you select the second option "Camera (PTP)" the device is available for debugging (the lesson is ignore the camera, and focus on the protocol PTP). This configuration is persistent, and I\'m guessing that with a brand new device it will connect as MTP until told otherwise.Thanks to @Ciaran Gallagher\nSettings --> Storage --> Top Left Option (Computer USB Connection) tap--> choose MTPCheck out blog post Nexus 7 Android development which has the steps in detail.In addition to setting USB connection/storage mode to "Camera (PTP)", I also had to enable developer mode, which has been hidden since 4.2.Source: How to enable developer settings on Android 4.2To fix/install Android USB driver on Windows 7/8 32bit/64bit:If it still doesn\'t work try changing from MTP to PTP.I discovered that you can also do Device Manager -> Update Driver Software -> Browse my computer for driver software -> Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer -> Android Phone -> [ADB driver version 6 near top of list... sorry, I can\'t remember exact name]As soon as I did that, it connected, and I was able to sideload version 4.2 on Windows 7 64 bit.I\'m using Nexus 7 (4.2) on Windows 7 x64. None of the other methods described here worked for me. The tab was already in PTP mode. Finally, I could get it working when I added the below line to \'android_winusb.inf\' under <android-sdk>\\extras\\google\\usb_driver and did an \'update driver\':To get the exact hardware ID (USB\\VID_18D1&PID_4E44&REV_9999&MI_01 in my case), you can go to Computer Management -> Device Manager -> Details tab -> select Hardware Id from the drop-down.I had a similar issue and tried the other suggestions.Utilizing the PdaNet driver in the download from http://www.junefabrics.com/android/download.php is what finally did the job and allowed me to finally connect via ADB.  Prior to installing the driver from here I was unable to recognize my Nexus in order to sideload the new Android 4.2 on my device.I am running Windows 7 64 bit with my Nexus 7.I had similar problems and I found that unchecking all of the options (both MTP and PTP) allowed the device to get the RSA Fingerprint from my computer and after that point "adb devices" worked.Keep in mind, the RSA fingerprint is required to be accepted before an Android 4.2+ device can connect via ADB, this is obviously for security reasons.Try this. If your device is not getting detected, use PdaNet. You can download it from here. Download it and install on your machine. Connect your phone. It automatically detects the driver from Internet.PDANet driver was the only solution for me to successfully connect to Google Galaxy Nexus 4.2.1 on Windows 7 x64 which was rejecting/ignoring official USB drivers from the latest 4.2 ADK (revision 7) - http://junefabrics.com/android/index.phpIn my case I had two problems:My PC got a previous "Samsung Galaxy II" driver and assigned it to my Nexus 7. I needed uninstall it many times. Finally I could bind the correct Nexus 7 driver. The need to set the PTP option.I also have a Nexus 7 and Windows 7 64-bit and got ADB working by stumbling around in this thread and others about a month ago. Then it stopped working. The only thing odd I remember happening before was Windows installing some Bluetooth drivers as I started up (I do not have Bluetooth devices).I floundered for a day this time. Now it is working again! The last thing I did was to use Device Manager to "disable" the device and reboot.I had an HTC One driver installed, and I thought that was the reason for not working. However, it turned out that the reason was I disabled both MTP/PTP.I did not find the place for the settings, but then I found How to Configure the USB on Your Nexus 7.It\'s quite confusing to me, it is in the Storage tab. Either MTP or PTP works for me.Another option is if windows updates are turned totally off on your PC. In this case even if you download the USB driver & try update it manually as described above it will not work. The only way in this case is enabling windows updating drivers automatically. Once you enabled this, remove the non-working driver from device manager & connect you tablet to the PC via USB cable. The drivers will be automatically downloaded & installed by Windows.\nThis way worked on my Windows 7 PC.I\'m on Win 7 64-bit and I see that most people with the same problem here also on 64-bit. To rule out the hardware and the OS, I used VMware to run Win 7 32-bit on the same PC. Except for having to edit the .inf file with the correct VID/PID everything else went perfectly on Win 7 32-bit so that tells me the PC is fine and Win 7 32-bit is fine also.Going back to my Win 7 64-bit none of the suggestions above worked for me. However I noticed one thing though, ADB is installed under Program Files (x86) but the driver installer is installing the 64-bit. Win 7 64-bit is recognizing the Nexus 7 as Android Composite ADB Interface but ADB does not detect it.So is there an ADB 64-bit version somewhere? if my installation is under (x86) on Win 7 64-bit, does it mean I messed up with the installation somewhere.Would my problem be related to USB drivers 64-bit installed but ADB is 32-bit?Another issue I noticed when the Nexus 7 USB driver gets installed in the Properties I only see Android Composite ADB Interface for device functions.\nUnder Win 7 32-bit Properties is showing 3 device functions.\nit looks like the issue is the USB driver still.Complete checklist:The solution that seemed to fix this for me, on top of PTP, is not selecting Always allow from this computer when allowing USB debugging. Revoking the authorisations and manually accepting each time the device is connected fixed this for me. (Settings -> Developer options -> Revoke USB debugging authorisations)For those of you who with Nexus 5x who only see Kedacom usb device in Device Manager and cannot get adb to see the phone...the trick is to Update driver... on the Kedacom device and change it to "Android ADB interface/device"
