This question already has an answer here:In Java, How to compose a HTTP request message and send it to a HTTP WebServer?You can use java.net.HttpUrlConnection.Example (from here), with improvements. Included in case of link rot:From Oracle\'s java tutorialI know others will recommend Apache\'s http-client, but it adds complexity (i.e., more things that can go wrong) that is rarely warranted. For a simple task, java.net.URL will do.Apache HttpComponents. The examples for the two modules - HttpCore and HttpClient will get you started right away.Not that HttpUrlConnection is a bad choice, HttpComponents will abstract a lot of the tedious coding away. I would recommend this, if you really want to support a lot of HTTP servers/clients with minimum code. By the way, HttpCore could be used for applications (clients or servers) with minimum functionality, whereas HttpClient is to be used for clients that require support for multiple authentication schemes, cookie support etc.Here\'s a complete Java 7 program:The new try-with-resources will auto-close the Scanner, which will auto-close the InputStream.This will help you. Don\'t forget to add the JAR HttpClient.jar to the classpath.Google java http client has nice API for http requests. You can easily add JSON support etc. Although for simple request it might be overkill.You may use Socket for this likeThere\'s a great link about sending a POST request here by Example Depot::If you want to send a GET request you can modify the code slightly to suit your needs. Specifically you have to add the parameters inside the constructor of the URL. Then, also comment out this wr.write(data);One thing that\'s not written and you should beware of, is the timeouts. Especially if you want to use it in WebServices you have to set timeouts, otherwise the above code will wait indefinitely or for a very long time at least and it\'s something presumably you don\'t want. Timeouts are set like this conn.setReadTimeout(2000); the input parameter is in milliseconds
