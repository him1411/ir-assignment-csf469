Has anyone using RecyclerView found a way to set an onClickListener to items in the RecyclerView?\nI thought of setting a listener to each of the layouts for each item but that seems a little too much hassle\nI\'m sure there is a way for the RecyclerView to listen for the onClick event but I can\'t quite figure it out.As the API\'s have radically changed, It wouldn\'t surprise me if you were to create an OnClickListener for each item. It isn\'t that much of a hassle though. In your implementation of RecyclerView.Adapter<MyViewHolder>, you should have: The onClick method:Here is a better and less tightly coupled way to implement an OnClickListener for a RecyclerView.  Snippet of usage:RecyclerItemClickListener implementation:Based on Jacob Tabak\'s answer (+1 for him), I was able to add onLongClick listener:Then you can use it like this:Check out a similar question @CommonsWare\'s comment links to this, which implements the OnClickListener interface in the viewHolder.Here\'s a simple example of the ViewHolder:The Adapter then looks like this:I do it in this way, without undue classes, detectors etc. Simple code inside our adapter. Especially better solution for longClick than presented before.Then inside fragment or activity, just hit:This is what worked for me. Attach the OnClickListener to the onBindView. I don\'t really know if this will impact the performance, but it seems to work fine with little code.This was so hard for me to have on item click listener in the activity and also to have click listener for single view of the item that will not trigger on item click listener. After playing around with Jacob Tabak\'s answer I respect his answer for on item click if no other touch actions inside item are presented.I have a custom OnClickListener interface that have on item click event which holds the clicked item\'s view and the item position from the adapter. I present an instance of it in the constructor(or it can be with setter) and attach it to the view holder container click listener.I also have other click listener in the Adapter(Can be in the view holder) which will handle current View click from the container.In the activity you need to initialize the adapter by passing instance of the OnItemClickListenerAnd my ViewHolderI have nice solution for RecyclerView\'s onItemClickListener for the items and subitemsStep 1- Create an interface Step 2- Then use it in adapter\'s onBindViewHolder method in the following wayStep 3- find and setup recycler view in activity or fragment where you are using thisStep 4- Finally implement interface in activity or fragment where you are using the recyclerviewThis is what I ended up needing, in case someone finds it useful:    Source: http://blog.csdn.net/jwzhangjie/article/details/36868515Here is what I did. This solution supports both onClick and onLongClick on both RecyclerView Items and Views insides RecyclerView Items (internal views).I tag viewHolder on the views of my choice :And I use holder.getPosition() to retrieve the position in onClick() method  (onLongClick is similar) :A variant with getChildPosition also works. Please note that for the internal views, in onClick() use  :To my mind, the avantage of this solution is that when one clicks on the image, only the onclick() image listener is called whereas when I combined Jacob\'s  solution for a RecyclerView Item view and  my solution for internal views the  RecyclerView Item view onclick() is also called (when click on image). There is far easier way to do this. Just apply on click in onBindViewHolder on root view.Consider this is your view for adapter,Then do following in your adapterWay too simple and effective.Instead of implementing interface View.OnClickListener inside view holder or creating and interface and implementing interface in your activity -\nI used this code for simple on OnClickListener implementation.All the answers posted so far are great solutions, however if you do not want to deal with too many implementation details, and just want it to work similarly to how ListView does, I would recommend using TwoWay-View, as seen here:https://github.com/lucasr/twoway-viewNote that this implementation also supports long press on items, as well as support for pressed states (which is something important that other solutions to this question lack).If you don\'t want to use the entire library, take a look at the ClickItemTouchListener class, which can be used as a standalone if needed. The only issue I found with it at the moment is with long press + scrolling, it seems to have incorrect behaviour. You can implement OnClickListener to your ViewHolder classAnd onBindViewHolder set your view holder\'s itemIf you want to catch click event On Individual items then just implement OnClickListener in ViewHolder class and then set click listeners on individual views or whole itemView.Following example shows the sameThe RecyclerView does not have a OnClickListener and will have to implement it ourselves.I like to add a OnItemClickListener interface in Adapter with an onClick method invoked when you click on the item view from the ViewHolder. Thus the responsibility of managing the click on an item is outside the ViewHolder and Adapter. Will the activity or fragment which will decide what to doAdd an interface to the listener and the listener object. We capture the click of the root view of the item and when the callback is triggered onClick listener call on the adapter .Since the activity or fragment , fragment in our case , we assign a listener to the adapter and the onClick callback we will get the selected item by position and opened a detailed activity of item.You can pass a clickListener to Adapter.In your Activity:then pass it to Adapter:In Adapter\'s onCreateViewHolder:Unfortunately RecyclerView is missing a couple of features that ListView had built-in.\n    For example the ability to add an OnItemClickListener that triggers when an item is clicked. \n    RecyclerView allows you to set an OnClickListener in your adapter, but passing on that click\n    listener from your calling code, to the adapter and to the ViewHolder, is complicated\n    for catching a simple item click.You also need to define R.id.item_click_support using ids.xml:The resulting code click listener now looks like this:For Brief Explanation about recyclerview clicks please have a look at this littlerobots_blogFor me, this is the best way:Here is what I did Read more & download the gist hereAdding the same hereCustomItemClickListener.javaItemsListAdapter.javaFrom most of the answers above, they seem to be setting their onclicklisteners to individual items. However, the solution am about to offer is very simple but yet not intuitive to many. Many are forgetting that the other components are always in a parent component which is used to display items in the List or Recycler views. This solution is just about setting a single onclick listener to this parent view and the turn is played. The solution also includes a way to pass the position of the item being clicked on from the list or recycler view. Here, our main rootview is a CardView from the android support library. Here is sample codeI have developed a light weighted library for android, you can visit https://github.com/ChathuraHettiarachchi/RecycleClickand follow for following samplehere is complete code for my custom adapter  this code will inflate the rows with list items defined in the xml file named "list_item" it will also perform click event on all list items rows with respective positions.public class MyCustomAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter<AdapterMyCustomAdapter.ViewHolder> {}For me the clean way to do that is this one.Adapter constructor`private class EnvironmentTypeRecyclerViewAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter\n{The Linked Interface I\'m aware there are a lot of answers, but I thought I might just provide my implementation of it as well. (Full details can be found on another question I answered).So, to add a click listener, your inner ViewHolder class needs to implement View.OnClickListener. This is because you will set an OnClickListener to the itemView parameter of the ViewHolder\'s constructor. Let me show you what I mean:The only other things you need to add are a custom interface for your Adapter and a setter method:So your new, click-supporting Adapter is complete.Now, let\'s use it...It\'s basically how you would set up a normal Adapter, except that you use your setter method that you created to control what you will do when your user clicks a particular list item.You can also look through a set of examples I made on this Gist on GitHub:https://gist.github.com/FarbodSalamat-Zadeh/7646564f48ee708c1582c013e1de4f07 you can easily define setOnClickListener in your ViewHolder class as follow :Mark the class as abstract and implement an OnClick method}Implement click handler in binding event to only have one event implementationImplementation of this:Same can be done for long clickHere is my Code Snippetv is View from onCreateViewHolderc is ContextHere is a strategy that gives a result similar to the ListView implementation in that you can define the listener in the Activity or Fragment level instead of the Adapter or ViewHolder level. It also defines some abstract classes that take care of a lot of the boilerplate work of adapters and holders.First, define an abstract Holder that extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder and defines a generic data type, T, used to bind data to the views. The bindViews method will be implemented by a subclass to map data to the views.Also, create an abstract Adapter that extends RecyclerView.Adapter<Holder<T>>.  This defines 2 of the 3 interface methods, and a subclass will need to implement the last, onViewHolderCreated method.Now create a new concrete class that extends Holder. This method only has to define the Views and handle the binding. Here I\'m using the ButterKnife library, but feel free to use itemView.findViewById(...) methods instead.Finally, in your Activity or Fragment class that holds the RecyclerView you would have this code:Very simple, add this class:Get an instance of \'OnItemClickCallback\' interface and put it in your activity or fragment:Then, pass that callback to your recyclerView:Finally, this would be your adapter:
