I\'m new to MySQL administration. I want to create a new user in MySQL and give it full access only to 1 database, say dbTest, that I create. What would be the MySQL commands to do that?Try this:If you are running the code/site accessing MySQL on the same machine, hostname would be localhost.Now, the break down.GRANT - This is the command used to create users and grant rights to databases, tables, etc.ALL PRIVILEGES - This tells it the user will have all standard privileges. This does not include the privilege to use the GRANT command however.dbtest.* - This instructions MySQL to apply these rights for use in the entire dbtest database. You can replace the * with specific table names or store routines if you wish.TO \'user\'@\'hostname\' - \'user\' is the username of the user account you are creating. Note: You must have the single quotes in there. \'hostname\' tells MySQL what hosts the user can connect from. If you only want it from the same machine, use localhostIDENTIFIED BY \'password\' - As you would have guessed, this sets the password for that user.To create user in MySQL/MariaDB 5.7.6 and higher, use CREATE USER syntax:then to grant all access to the database (e.g. my_db), use GRANT Syntax, e.g.Where ALL (priv_type) can be replaced with specific privilege such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, ALTER, etc.Then to reload newly assigned permissions run:To run above commands, you need to run mysql command and type them into prompt, then logout by quit command or Ctrl-D.To run from shell, use -e parameter (replace SELECT 1 with one of above commands):or print statement from the standard input:If you\'ve got Access denied with above, specify -u (for user) and -p (for password) parameters, or for long-term access set your credentials in ~/.my.cnf, e.g.For people not familiar with MySQL syntax, here are handy shell functions which are easy to remember and use (to use them, you need to load the shell functions included further down).Here is example:To use above commands, you need to copy&paste the following functions into your rc file (e.g. .bash_profile) and reload your shell:Log in to MySQL:Now create and grantAlternately, if you just want to grant full unrestricted access to a database (e.g. on your local machine for a test instance, you can grant access to the anonymous user, like so:You can create new users using the CREATE USER statement, and give rights to them using GRANT.ignore -p option, if mysql user has no password or just press "[Enter]" button to by-pass. strings surrounded with curly braces need to replaced with actual values.The below command will work if you want create a new user give him all the access to a specific database(not all databases in your Mysql) on your localhost.This will grant all privileges to one database test_database (in your case dbTest) to that user on localhost.Check what permissions that above command issued to that user by running the below command.Just in case, if you want to limit the user access to only one single table
