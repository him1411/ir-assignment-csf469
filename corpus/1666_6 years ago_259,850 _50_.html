Is there an easy way to include jQuery in the Chrome JavaScript console for sites that do not use it? For example, on a website I would like to get the number of rows in a table. I know this is really easy with jQuery.The site does not use jQuery. Can I add it in from the command line?\nRun this in your browser\'s JavaScript console, then jQuery should be available...NOTE: if the site has scripts that conflict with jQuery (other libs, etc.) you could still run into problems.Making the best better, creating a Bookmark makes it really convenient, let\'s do it, and a little feedback is great too:javascript:(function(e,s){e.src=s;e.onload=function(){jQuery.noConflict();console.log(\'jQuery injected\')};document.head.appendChild(e);})(document.createElement(\'script\'),\'//code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js\')Below is the formatted code:Here the official jQuery CDN URL is used, feel free to use your own CDN/version.Run this in your consoleIt creates new script tag, fills it with jQuery and appends to headUse the jQueryify booklet:http://marklets.com/jQuerify.aspxInstead of copy pasting the code in the other answers, this\'ll make it a clickable bookmark.Copy http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js file content and paste it into console. Works perfect.Adding to @jondavidjohn\'s answer, we can also set it as a bookmark with URL as the javascript code.Name: Include JqueryUrl:and then add it to the toolbar of Chrome or Firefox so that instead of pasting the script again and again, we can just click on the bookmarklet.I\'m a rebel.Solution: don\'t use jQuery. jQuery is a library to abstract the DOM inconcistencies across the browsers. Since you\'re in your own console, you don\'t need this kind of abstraction.For your example:($$ is an alias to document.querySelectorAll in the console.)For any other example: I\'m sure I can find anything. Especially if you\'re using a modern browser (Chrome, FF, Safari, Opera).Besides, knowing how the DOM works wouldn\'t hurt anyone, it would only increase your level of jQuery (yes, learning more about javascript makes you better at jQuery).I just made a jQuery 3.2.1 bookmarklet with error-handling (only load if not already loaded, detect version if already loaded, error message if error while loading). Tested in Chrome 27. There is no reason to use the "old" jQuery 1.9.1 on Chrome browser since jQuery 2.0 is API-compatible with 1.9.Just run the following in Chrome\'s developer console or drag & drop it in your bookmark bar:Readable source-code is available hereThe top answer, by jondavidjohn is good but I\'d like to tweak it to address a couple of points:My only issue is that I have to include a version number where in the console I really always want the latest.It\'s pretty easy to do this manually, as the other answers explain. But there\'s also the jQuerify plug-in.FWIW, Firebug embeds the include special command, and jquery is aliased by default:\nhttps://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/IncludeSo in your case, you just have to type : FlorentOne of the shortest ways would be just copy pasting the code below to the console.this answer based on @genesis answer, at first I tried the bookmark version @jondavidjohn, and it is not working, so I change it to this (add it to your bookmark):words of caution, is not tested in chrome but work in firefox, and not tested in conflict environment.Per this answer:For some reason I have to execute it twice to get the new \'$\' (which I have to do with the other methods as well), but it works.This is the equivalent if your browser isn\'t so modern:If you\'re looking to do this for a userscript, I wrote this: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/123588It\'ll let you include jQuery, plus UI and any plugins you\'d like.  I\'m using it on a site that has 1.5.1 and no UI; this script gives me 1.7.1 instead, plus UI, and no conflicts in Chrome or FF.  I\'ve not tested Opera myself, but others have told me it\'s worked there for them as well, so this ought to be pretty well a complete cross-browser userscript solution, if that\'s what you need to do this for.Here is alternative code:which can be pasted either directly in Console or create a new Bookmark page (in Chrome right-click on the Bookmark Bar, Add Page...) and paste this code as URL.To test if that worked, see below.Before:After:If you want to use jQuery frequently from the console you can easily write a userscript.\nFirst, install Tampermonkey if you are on Chrome and Greasemonkey if you are on Firefox. Write a simple userscript with a use function like this:intuitive one-linerYou can change the src address.\nI referred to ReferenceError: Can't find variable: jQuery
