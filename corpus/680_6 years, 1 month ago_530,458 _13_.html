Before installing gnuplot I set the environment variable GNUPLOT_DRIVER_DIR = /home/gnuplot/build/src.During the installation something went wrong; now I want to remove the GNUPLOT_DRIVER_DIR environment variable.unset is the command you\'re looking for.Test if the DUALCASE variable exists:It does not, so create the variable and export it:Check if it is there:It is there.  So get rid of it:Check if it\'s still there:The DUALCASE exported environment variable is deleted.Unset all local variables back to default on login:exec bash command cleared all the local variables but not environment variables.Unset all environment variables back to default on login:env -i bash command cleared all the environment variables to default on login.
