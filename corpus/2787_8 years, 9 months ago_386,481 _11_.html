How do I call the parent function from a derived class using C++? For example, I have a class called parent, and a class called child which is derived from parent. Within \neach class there is a print function.  In the definition of the child\'s print function I would like to make a call to the parents print function.  How would I go about doing this?I\'ll take the risk of stating the obvious: You call the function, if it\'s defined in the base class it\'s automatically available in the derived class (unless it\'s private).If there is a function with the same signature in the derived class you can disambiguate it by adding the base class\'s name followed by two colons base_class::foo(...). You should note that unlike Java and C#, C++ does not have a keyword for "the base class" (super or base) since C++ supports multiple inheritance which may lead to ambiguity.Incidentally, you can\'t derive directly from the same class twice since there will be no way to refer to one of the base classes over the other.Do something like this:If your base class is called Base, and your function is called FooBar() you can call it directly using Base::FooBar()In MSVC there is a Microsoft specific keyword for that: __superMSDN:\nAllows you to explicitly state that you are calling a base-class implementation for a function that you are overriding. If access modifier of base class member function is protected OR public, you can do call member function of base class from derived class. \nCall to the base class non-virtual and virtual member function from derived member function can be made.\nPlease refer the program.  Output:Reference example.
