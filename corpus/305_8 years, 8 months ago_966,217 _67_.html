I have a layout similar to:I would like for the div to only expand to as wide as my table becomes.The solution is to set your div to display: inline-block.You want a block element that has what CSS calls shrink-to-fit width and the spec does not provide a blessed way to get such a thing. In CSS2, shrink-to-fit is not a goal, but means to deal with a situation where browser "has to" get a width out of thin air. Those situations are: when there are no width specified. I heard they think of adding what you want in CSS3. For now, make do with one of the above.The decision not to expose the feature directly may seem strange, but there is a good reason. It is expensive. Shrink-to-fit means formatting at least twice: you cannot start formatting an element until you know its width, and you cannot calculate the width w/o going through entire content. Plus, one does not need shrink-to-fit element as often as one may think. Why do you need extra div around your table? Maybe table caption is all you need.I think usingwould work, however I\'m not sure about the browser compatibility.Another solution would be to wrap your div in another div (if you want to maintain the block behavior):HTML:CSS:display: inline-block adds an extra margin to your element.I would recommend this:Foo Hack \xe2\x80\x93 Cross Browser Support for inline-block Styling (2007-11-19).What works for me is:in the div. (Tested on Firefox and Google Chrome).There are two better solutions display: inline-block;ORdisplay: table;Out of these two display:table; is better. For display:inline-block; you can use the negative margin method to fix the extra spaceYou can try fit-content (CSS3): The answer for your question lays in the future my friend ...namely "intrinsic" is coming with the latest CSS3 updateunfortunately IE is behind with it so it doesn\'t support it yet More about it: CSS Intrinsic & Extrinsic Sizing Module Level 3 and Can I Use?: Intrinsic & Extrinsic Sizing. For now you have to be satisfied with <span> or <div> set to works fine for me :)Not knowing in what context this will appear, but I believe the CSS-style property float either left or right will have this effect. On the other hand, it\'ll have other side effects as well, such as allowing text to float around it.Please correct me if I\'m wrong though, I\'m not 100% sure, and currently can\'t test it myself.A CSS2 compatible solution is to use:You can also float your div which will force it as small as possible, but you\'ll need to use a clearfix if anything inside your div is floating:You can do it simply by using display: inline; (or white-space: nowrap;). I hope you find this useful.I know people don\'t like tables sometimes, but I gotta tell you, I tried the css inline hacks, and they kinda worked in some divs but in others didn\'t, so, it was really just easier to enclose the expanding div in a table...and...it can have or not the inline property and still the table is the one that\'s gonna hold the total width of the content. =)An working demo is here-You can use inline-block as @user473598, but beware of older browsers..Mozilla doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support inline-block at all, but they have -moz-inline-stack which is about the sameSome cross-browser around inline-block display attribute:\nhttps://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/cross-browser-inline-block/You can see some tests with this attribute in: https://robertnyman.com/2010/02/24/css-display-inline-block-why-it-rocks-and-why-it-sucks/Tampering around with Firebug I found the property value -moz-fit-content which exactly does what the OP wanted and could be used as follow:Although it only works on Firefox, I couldn\'t find any equivalent for other browsers such as Chrome.My CSS3 flexbox solution in two flavors: The one on top behaves like a span and the one at the bottom behaves like a div, taking all the width with the help of a wrapper. Their classes are "top", "bottom" and "bottomwrapper" respectively.This will make parent div width same as the largest element width.I have solved a similar problem (where I didn\'t want to use display: inline-block because the item was centered) by adding a span tag inside the div tag, and moving the CSS formatting from the outer div tag to the new inner span tag. Just throwing this out there as another alternative idea if display: inline block isn\'t a suitable answer for you.I tried div.classname{display:table-cell;} and it worked!I would just set padding: -whateverYouWantpx;Try display: inline-block;. For it to be cross browser compatible please use the below css code.We can use any of the two ways on the div element:   or,I prefer to use display: table;, because it handles, all extra spaces on its own. While display: inline-block needs some extra space fixing.  Revised (works if you have multiple children):\nYou can use jQuery (Look at the JSFiddle link)Do not forget to include the jQuery... See the JSfiddle hereIf you have containers breaking lines, after hours looking for a good CSS solution and finding none, I now use jQuery instead:SimplyOK, in many cases you even don\'t need to do anything as by default div has height and width as auto, but if it\'s not your case, applying inline-block display gonna work for you... look at the code I create for you and it\'s do what you looking for:Personnaly, I simply do this : HTML code: CSS code: If you apply a float on your div, it works too but obviously, you need to apply a "clear both" CSS rules at the next HTML element.
