I\'m using jQuery in my site and I would like to trigger certain actions when a certain div is made visible.Is it possible to attach some sort of "isvisible" event handler to arbitrary divs and have certain code run when they the div is made visible?I would like something like the following pseudocode:The alert("do something") code should not fire until the contentDiv is actually made visible.Thanks.You could always add to the original .show() method so you don\'t have to trigger events every time you show something or if you need it to work with legacy code:This effectively lets you do something beforeShow and afterShow while still executing the normal behavior of the original .show() method.You could also create another method so you don\'t have to override the original .show() method.There is no native event you can hook into for this however you can trigger an event from your script after you have made the div visible using the .trigger functione.gThe problem is being addressed by DOM mutation observers. They allow you to bind an observer (a function) to events of changing content, text or attributes of dom elements.With the release of IE11, all major browsers support this feature, check http://caniuse.com/mutationobserverThe example code is a follows:You can use jQuery\'s livequery plugin. \nAnd write code as follows:Then everytime the contentDiv is visible, "do something" will be alerted!redsquare\'s solution is the right/logic answer.  but as an IN-THEORY solution you can code a function which is selecting the elements classed by .visibilityCheck class (not all visible elements) and check their visibility property value; if true then do something. ok?\nAfterward the function should be performed periodically using the setInterval() function. As you know, you can stop the timer using clearInterval() and the timer ID upon the function\'s successful call-out.Also you can do some performance improvements on this, but the solution is basically ignored to be used in action, I think.If you want to trigger the event on all elements (and child elements) that are actually made visible, by $.show, toggle, toggleClass, addClass, or removeClass:And now your element:You could add overrides to additional jQuery functions by adding them to the array at the top (like "attr")a hide/show event trigger based on Glenns ideea:\nremoved toggle because it fires show/hide and we don\'t want 2fires for one eventThe following code (pulled from http://maximeparmentier.com/2012/11/06/bind-show-hide-events-with-jquery/) will enable you to use $(\'#someDiv\').on(\'show\', someFunc);.I had this same problem and created a jQuery plugin to solve it for our site. https://github.com/shaunbowe/jquery.visibilityChangedHere is how you would use it based on your example:Use jQuery Waypoints :Other examples on the site of jQuery Waypoints.You can also try jQuery appear plugin as mentioned in parallel thread https://stackoverflow.com/a/3535028/741782This support easing and trigger event after animation done! [tested on jQuery 2.2.4]Inspired By http://viralpatel.net/blogs/jquery-trigger-custom-event-show-hide-element/There is a jQuery plugin available for watching change in DOM attributes,https://github.com/darcyclarke/jQuery-Watch-PluginThe plugin wraps All you need do is bind MutationObserverYou can then use it to watch the div using: I changed the hide/show event trigger from Catalint based on Glenns idea.\nMy problem was that I have a modular application. I change between modules showing and hiding divs parents. Then when I hide a module and show another one, with his method I have a visible delay when I change between modules. I only need sometimes to liten this event, and in some special childs. So I decided to notify only the childs with the class "displayObserver"Then when a child wants to listen for "show" or "hide" event I have to add him the class "displayObserver", and when It does not want to continue listen it, I remove him the classI wish help One way to do this.\nWorks only on visibility changes that are made by css class change, but can be extended to watch for attribute changes too.my solution:example usage:Hope this will do the job in simplest manner:What helped me here is recent ResizeObserver spec polyfill:Note that it\'s crossbrowser and performant (no polling).This code auto control not required query visible or unvisible control
