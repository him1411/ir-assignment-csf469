I want to keep a backup of all my MySQL databases. I have more than 100 MySQL databases. I want to export all of them at the same time and again import all of them into my MySQL server at one time. How can I do that?Look up the documentation for mysqldump. You may want to use some of the options mentioned in comments:Other solution:It backs up each database into a different fileWhy parsing formatted output while the mysql command can do directly what you want?Lists the database names and only this.All the answers I see on this question can have problems with the character sets in some databases due to the problem of redirecting the exit of mysqldump to a file within the shell operator >.To solve this problem you should do the backup with a command like thisAnd for do a good BD restore without any problem with character setsBased on these answers I\'ve made script which backups all databases into separate files, but then compress them into one archive with date as name.This will not ask for password, can be used in cron. To store password in .my.cnf check this answer https://serverfault.com/a/143587/62749Made also with comments for those who are not very familiar with bash scripts.Be careful when exporting from and importing to different MySQL versions as the mysql tables may have different columns.\nGrant privileges may fail to work if you\'re out of luck.\nI created this script (mysql_export_grants.sql ) to dump the grants for importing into the new database, just in case:When you are dumping all database. Obviously it is having large data. So you can prefer below for better:Creating Backup:If error-- Warning: Skipping the data of table mysql.event. Specify the --events option explicitly.Use:Restoring Backup:Hope it will help :)mysqldump -uroot -proot databasename > databasename.sqlnote: -u"your username"\n-p"your password"
