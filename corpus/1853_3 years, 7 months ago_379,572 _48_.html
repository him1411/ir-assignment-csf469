I am trying to build a shared library using a C extension file but first I have to generate the output file using the command below:After executing the command, I get this error message:utilsmodule.c:1:20: fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory\n  compilation terminated.in fact I have tried all the suggested solutions over the internet but the problem still exists ... also I have no problem with Python.h. I managed to locate the file on my machine ... anybody has faced the same problem before??Looks like you haven\'t properly installed the header files and static libraries for python dev.  Use your package manager to install them system-wide.  For apt (ubuntu, debian...):For yum (centos, redhat, fedora...):On Ubuntu, I was running Python 3 and I had to install Two things you have to do.Install development package for Python, in case of Debian/Ubuntu/Mint it\'s done with command:Second thing is that include files are not by default in the include path, nor is Python library linked with executable by default. You need to add these flags (replace Python\'s version accordingly):In other words your compile command ought to be:If you are using a Raspberry Pi:on Fedora run this for Python 2:and for Python 3:If you are using tox to run tests on multiple versions of Python, you may need to install the Python dev libraries for each version of Python you are testing on.I would also like to add the solution for Cygwin:You need to install the package python2-devel or python3-devel, depending on the Python version you\'re using. You can quickly install it using the 32-bit or 64-bit setup.exe (depending on your installation) from Cygwin.com.Example (modify setup.exe\'s filename and Python\'s major version if you need):You can also check my other answer for a few more options to install Cygwin\'s packages from the command-line.Make sure that the Python dev files come with your OS.You should not hard code the library and include paths. Instead, use pkg-config, which will output the correct options for your specific system:You may add it to your gcc line:In AWS API (centOS) its In my case, what fixed it in Ubuntu was to install the packages libpython-all-dev (or libpython3-all-dev if you use Python 3).For me, changing it to this worked:I found the file /usr/include/python2.7/Python.h, and since /usr/include is already in the include path, then python2.7/Python.h should be sufficient.You could also add the include path from command line instead - gcc -I/usr/lib/python2.7 (thanks @erm3nda).I managed to solve this issue and generate the .so file in one command If you use a virtualenv with a 3.6 python (edge right now), be sure to install the matching python 3.6 dev sudo apt-get install python3.6-dev, otherwise executing sudo python3-dev will install the python dev 3.3.3-1, which won\'t solve the issue.For the OpenSuse comrades out there:AWS EC2 install running python34:sudo yum install python34-develtry apt-file. It is difficult to remember the package name where the missing file resides. It is generic and useful for any package files.For example:Now you can make an expert guess as to which one to choose from.It\'s not the same situation, but it also works for me and now I can use SWIG with Python3.5:I was trying to compile:gcc -fPIC -c existe.c existe_wrap.c -I /usr/include/python3.5m/With Python 2.7 works fine, not with my version 3.5:existe_wrap.c:147:21: fatal error: Python.h: No existe el archivo o el\n  directorio compilation terminated.After run in my Ubuntu 16.04 installation:Now I can compile without problems Python3.5:This means that Python.h isn\'t in your compiler\'s default include paths. Have you installed it system-wide or locally? What\'s your OS?You could use the -I<path> flag to specify an additional directory where your compiler should look for headers. You will probably have to follow up with -L<path> so that gcc can find the library you\'ll be linking with using -l<name>.Sure python-dev or libpython-all-dev are the first thing to (apt )install, but if that doesn\'t help as was my case, I advice you to install the foreign Function Interface packages by sudo apt-get install libffi-dev and pip install cffi.This should help out especially if you see the error as/from c/_cffi_backend.c:2:20: fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory.
