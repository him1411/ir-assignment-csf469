This question already has an answer here:When debugging in PHP, I frequently find it useful to simply stick a var_dump() in my code to show me what a variable is, what its value is, and the same for anything that it contains.What is a good Python equivalent for this?To display a value nicely, you can use the pprint module. The easiest way to dump all variables with it is to doIf you are running in CGI, a useful debugging feature is the cgitb module, which displays the value of local variables as part of the traceback.I think the best equivalent to PHP\'s var_dump($foo, $bar) is combine print with vars:The closest thing to PHP\'s var_dump() is pprint() with the getmembers() function in the built-in inspect module:PHP\'s var_export() usually shows a serialized version of the object that can be exec()\'d to re-create the object.    The closest thing to that in Python is repr()"For many types, this function makes an attempt to return a string that would yield an object with the same value when passed to eval() [...]"So I have taken the answers from this question and another question and came up below.  I suspect this is not pythonic enough for most people, but I really wanted something that let me get a deep representation of the values some unknown variable has.  I would appreciate any suggestions about how I can improve this or achieve the same behavior easier.Here is the usageand the results.I wrote a very light-weight alternative to PHP\'s var_dump for using in Python and made it open source later.GitHub: https://github.com/sha256/python-var-dumpYou can simply install it using pip:Old topic, but worth a try.Here is a simple and efficient var_dump function:Sample output:printFor your own classes, just def a __str__ methodI don\'t have PHP experience, but I have an understanding of the Python standard library.For your purposes, Python has several methods:logging module;Object serialization module which is called pickle. You may write your own wrapper of the pickle module.If your using var_dump for testing, Python has its own doctest and unittest modules. It\'s very simple and fast for design.I use self-written Printer class, but dir() is also good for outputting the instance fields/values.The sample of usage:
