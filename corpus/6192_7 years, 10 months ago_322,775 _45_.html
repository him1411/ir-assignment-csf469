I\'m writing some migration scripts for an Oracle database, and was hoping Oracle had something similar to MySQL\'s IF EXISTS construct.Specifically, whenever I want to drop a table in MySQL, I do something likeThis way, if the table doesn\'t exist, the DROP doesn\'t produce an error, and the script can continue.Does Oracle have a similar mechanism?  I realize I could use the following query to check if a table exists or notbut the syntax for tying that together with a DROP is escaping me.The best and most efficient way is to catch the "table not found" exception: this avoids the overhead of checking if the table exists twice; and doesn\'t suffer from the problem that if the DROP fails for some other reason (that might be important) the exception is still raised to the caller:ADDENDUM\nFor reference, here are the equivalent blocks for other object types:SequenceViewTriggerIndexColumnDatabase LinkMaterialized ViewTypeConstraintScheduler JobUser / SchemaPackageProcedureFunctionTablespaceThat\'s for checking whether a table in the current schema exists.\nFor checking whether a given table already exists in a different schema, you\'d have to use all_tables instead of user_tables and add the condition all_tables.owner = upper(\'schema_name\')I have been looking for the same but I ended up writing a procedure to help me out:Hope this helpsjust wanted to post a full code that will create a table and drop it if it already exists using Jeffrey\'s code (kudos to him, not me!).There is no \'DROP TABLE IF EXISTS\' in oracle, you would have to do the select statement.try this (i\'m not up on oracle syntax, so if my variables are ify, please forgive me):You could always catch the error yourself.It is considered bad practice to overuse this, similar to empty catch()\'es in other languages.Regards\nKWith SQL*PLUS you can also use the WHENEVER SQLERROR command:With CONTINUE NONE an error is reported, but the script will continue. With EXIT SQL.SQLCODE the script will be terminated in the case of an error.see also: WHENEVER SQLERROR DocsAnother method is to define an exception and then only catch that exception letting all others propagate. // Doing this code, checks if the table exists and later it creates the table max. this simply works in single compilationSadly no, there is no such thing as drop if exists, or CREATE IF NOT EXISTYou could write a plsql script to include the logic there.http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B12037_01/server.101/b10759/statements_9003.htmI\'m not much into Oracle Syntax, but i think @Erich\'s script would be something like this.I prefer to specify the table and the schema owner.Watch out for case sensitivity as well. (see "upper" clause below).I threw a couple of different objects in to show that is can be used in places besides TABLEs..............And a TABLE example:
