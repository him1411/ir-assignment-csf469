When I start, Eclipse says "Workspace Cannot Be Locked""Could not launch the product because the associated workspace is currently in use by another Eclipse application." or \xe2\x80\x9cWorkspace in use or cannot be created, chose a different one.\xe2\x80\x9dBut I know it isn\'t.How do I "unlock" it?Just delete the .lock file in the .metadata directory in your eclipse workspace directory. Precaution - If you delete the .metadata folder  all preference will be deleted.I\'ve seen 3 other fixes so far:The solution boils down to cleaning up the .metadata folder.Another possible cause of the \xe2\x80\x9cWorkspace in use or cannot be created, chose a different one\xe2\x80\x9d issue is that the real path to your workspace may have changed.In my case, the real location of the workspace had changed, but I had used a symlink to make it look like it was in the same location.  I saw errors in logs indicating that eclipse was looking at the previous "real" location, as opposed to following the symlink, and this was causing the errors.In my case, I just moved the workspace back to its old location.Go to TaskManager(Right Click in the Task Bar) and select Processess menu bar and select eclipse.exe and Click EndProcessThere is another case where the path to the workspace may not exist, e.g., if you have imported preferences from another workspace, then some imported workspace addresses may appear in your "open workspace" dialog; then if you didn\'t pay attention to those addresses, you would get the exact same error once you tried to open them.Running eclipse in Administrator Mode fixed it for me. You can do this by [Right Click] -> Run as Administrator on the eclipse.exe from your install dir.I was on a working environment with win7 machine having restrictive permission. I also did remove the .lock and .log files but that did not help. It can be a combination of all as well that made it work.At times, if you are on Windows, you may not see all the processes - or the culprit process in Task manager. I had to click \'Show process from all users\' and there was this java.exe that I had to kill in order to get back my workspace.Another possible case if none works is to see that there is a running Java application . may  be your previous open and close has left unkilled java instances. Do look for any java instance is running if there are two at least you need to kill one.But ,most of the time i kill any java running :) because that java is using the work space earlier and still will if don\'t kill it.Change another work space in case if you want a multiple IDE to use and work on diffrent or same project , but you should import project form workspace after you open your IDE.deleting logs and .lock didn\'t work but-clean option fixed it for me.The answer @Boris gave is correct 99% of the time, however it can also happen if you open the workspace in an older version of Eclipse. A workspace imported into/created with Juno will throw this error when opened in Galileo.Another all-too-common reason for this problem is if you attempt to load a directory on a drive that is no longer connected. For example, Say you program in C:\\Code\\Java, but occasionally work off of a flash drive, H:\\Code\\Java. If you do not have the drive connected it can be easy to believe you are trying to load a valid directory without noticing your typo.Another problem is when eclipse doesn\'t have write access to your src folder. Change the security permission and make sure "Authenticated Users" are added with all permissions checked but Full Control & Special Permissions.I had this error after I restarted the system (after a long time. Normally I just make it sleep).\nFound out that once I mounted the drives (by clicking and opening it) where project folder is located, and relaunching eclipse, solved the issue for me.PS: I\'m an ubuntu user.Here are a few steps to solve it the no. 4 step is works for me. Choosing a "different one" is actually a pretty easy solution.  I had been running Eclipse as an administrator (sudo eclipse from the command line) because the "workspace" folder was throwing the Workspace in use or cannot be created\xe2\x80\xa6 error (and running as administrator seemed to be the only solution that fixed it).  A coworker (working on this same issue with me) wanted to run Eclipse by clicking on an icon.  So when he ran Eclipse, and the dialogue box came up with the choose your workspace, he just added a "2" to the end of "workspace".  This created  a new folder:  "workspace2".  Eclipse ran fine with that; and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had any of the locking problems since.  It will occur when you not closed eclipse.exe correctly.*Open Task manager->End task your eclipse->Now open eclipse.exe it will work.Hope its help someone.I have observed one case when eclipse when in forced quit, or Alt-f2 xkilled in linux, an attempt to immediately open eclipse shows that error. Even the metadat/.lock file is not present in that case. \nHowever it starts working after a span of about two minutes
