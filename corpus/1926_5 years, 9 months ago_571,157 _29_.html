I use the following code segment to read a file in pythoninput file isand when I print data I getAs I see data is in list form. How do I make it string. And also how do I remove "\\n", "[", and "]" characters from it ?You could use:use read(), not readline()Read from file in one linejoin() will join a list of strings, and rstrip() with no arguments will trim whitespace, including newlines, from the end of strings.The simple way:It\'s hard to tell exactly what you\'re after, but something like this should get you started:I have fiddled around with this for a while and have prefer to use use read in combination with rstrip. Without rstrip("\\n"), Python adds a newline to the end of the string, which in most cases is not very useful.I don\'t feel that anyone addressed the [ ] part of your question. When you read each line into your variable, because there were multiple lines before you replaced the \\n with \'\' you ended up creating a list. If you have a variable of x and print it out just byx or print(x)or str(x)You will see the entire list with the brackets. If you call each element of the (array of sorts)x[0]\nthen it omits the brackets. If you use the str() function you will see just the data and not the \'\' either.\nstr(x[0])You can also strip each of the line and concatenate into a final string.This would also work out just fine.This code will help you to read the first line and then using the list and split option you can convert the first line word separated by space to be stored in a list.Than you can easily access any word, or even store it in a string.You can also do the same thing with using a for loop.python3: Google "list comphrension" if the square bracket syntax is new to you.This works:\nChange your file to:Then:This creates a list named words that equals:That got rid of the "\\n". To answer the part about the brackets getting in your way, just do this:Or:This returns:
