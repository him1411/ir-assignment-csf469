I am using Django (version 1.3) and have forgotten both admin username and password. How to reset both?And is it possible to make a normal user into admin, and then remove admin status?see docs To give a normal user privileges, open a shell with python manage.py shell and try:You may try through console:then use following script in shellwill list you all super users on the system. if you recognize yur username from the list:and you set a new password (:You can create a new superuser with createsuperuser command. new setup should first run python manage.py createsuperuser to create user. It seems like there is no default username password to login into admin. This is very good question. python manage.py changepassword user_nameExample :- You may also have answered a setup question wrong and have zero staff members.  In which case head to postgres:To fix, edit directly:If you forgot create admin user first build one with createsuperuser command on manage.py then change the password.Another thing that is worth noting is to set your user\'s status is_staff as active. At least, that\'s what makes it works for me. For more detail, I created another superuser as people explained above. Then I go to the database table auth_user and search for that username to make sure its is_staff flag is set to 1. That finally allowed me to log into admin site.python manage.py changepassword username
