How can I write a regex that matches only letters?Use a character set: [a-zA-Z] matches one letter from A\xe2\x80\x93Z in lowercase and uppercase. [a-zA-Z]+ matches one or more letters and ^[a-zA-Z]+$ matches only strings that consist of one or more letters only (^ and $ mark the begin and end of a string respectively).If you want to match other letters than A\xe2\x80\x93Z, you can either add them to the character set: [a-zA-Z\xc3\xa4\xc3\xb6\xc3\xbc\xc3\x9f\xc3\x84\xc3\x96\xc3\x9c]. Or you use predefined character classes like the Unicode character property class \\p{L} that describes the Unicode characters that are letters.\\p{L} matches anything that is a Unicode letter if you\'re interested in alphabets beyond the Latin oneDepending on your meaning of "character":[A-Za-z] - all letters (uppercase and lowercase) [^0-9] - all non-digit charactersThe closest option available is which matches a sequence of uppercase and lowercase letters. However, it is not supported by all editors/languages, so it is probably safer to use as other users suggestFor PHP, following will work fineSuper simple example. Regular expressions are extremely easy to find online.http://www.regular-expressions.info/reference.htmlRegular expression which few people has written as "/^[a-zA-Z]$/i" is not correct because at the last they have mentioned /i which is for case insensitive and after matching for first time it will return back. Instead of /i just use /g which is for global and you also do not have any need to put ^ $ for starting and ending.Just use \\w or [:alpha:]. It is an escape sequences which matches only symbols which might appear in words.Use character groupsMatches any character except digits 0-9See example hereYou would use[]--checks for any characters between given inputsa-z---covers the entire alphabetg-----globally throughout the whole stringi-----getting upper and lowercaseIf you mean any letters in any character encoding, then a good approach might be to delete non-letters like spaces \\s, digits \\d, and other special characters like:Or use negation of above negation to directly describe any letters:Pros:Cons:pattern = /[a-zA-Z]/puts "[a-zA-Z]: #{pattern.match("mine blossom")}"  OKputs "[a-zA-Z]: #{pattern.match("456")}"puts "[a-zA-Z]: #{pattern.match("")}"puts "[a-zA-Z]: #{pattern.match("#$%^&*")}"puts "[a-zA-Z]: #{pattern.match("#$%^&*A")}"       OKYou can try this regular expression : [^\\W\\d_] or [a-zA-Z].
