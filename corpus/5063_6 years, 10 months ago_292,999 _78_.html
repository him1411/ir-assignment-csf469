I\'ve spent days trying to launch any Android program. Even "Hello World" gives me the same error: "The connection to adb is down, and a severe error has occured".I\'m running Eclipse Galileo, Google APIs 2.2 8, on a Windows XP machine. I\'ve used all the tricks I can find on the web: the command line "adb kill-server", the DDMS "reset ADB", I started the emulator both before and after Eclipse, and searched for ports being used by other programs. What is going on here? Is there a magic combo of versions of Eclipse, Java, adb, emulator, and whatever else that works?Try below steps:it worked for me this way.Restart your phone as well! Open Task Manager >  Processes > adb.exe > End Process > restart eclipse This worked for me. hope this works for you as well.EDIT Open Task Manager >  Processes > eclipse.exe > End Process > restart eclipse Open up the Windows task manager, and kill the process named adb.exe, re-launch your program.[2012-07-04 11:24:25 - The connection to adb is down, and a severe error has occurred.\n  [2012-07-04 11:24:25 - You must restart adb and Eclipse.\n  [2012-07-04 11:24:25 - Please ensure that adb is correctly located at \'/home/ASDK/platform-tools/adb\' and can be executedI realized the folder of the project in eclipse was closed. I expanded the directory and the project launched. I know this may sound like a "no-brainer". I had the .java files open on the workspace, that was enough to make me think the project was open.I tried this using Eclipse Juno and it worked fine:UPDATE: It also helps to kill the process adb.exe from the task manager and restart it.  adb.exe can be found here: Android\\android-sdk\\platform-tools.Good luckUpdate your eclipse android dev tools. It worked for me.Make sure its not running in the task-manager processes. If so, end the process and then start it from command prompt as in the above answer. This worked for meI know this question has already been answered, but thought I might add that I found the problem to be folder permissions on my android-sdk directory.  I tested it out by granting Full Control to Everyone (dodgy, I know...), and the problem went away.  Not sure yet what the specific mix of permissions might be that it was looking for, but I assume some or other service in Eclipse didn\'t have execute permissions on adb.exe.  That said, I\'m a complete noob to this - just wanted to put it out there in case someone else had some insights into this.Running Windows 7, 64-bit, 4.2.0 Eclipse, 20.0.0v201206242043 ADT.1.Go to the folder platform-tools in cmd\nfolder platform tools available in Android folder where you have android backup files.2.Type the following andthen typeyou can see your device.In my situation: I have the same warning:\nThe connection to adb is down, and a severe error has occuredI have found the solution:The adb.exe was moved from: android-sdk-windows\\tools\\adb.exe to\n                              android-sdk-windows\\platform-tool\\adb.exe.Only thing. Move file adb.exe to \\tools. And restart Eclipse.This problem has been plaguing me for days until I finally figured out what was causing it. It got so bad I couldn\'t even update my apps even after trying all the above suggestions.HTC Sync also runs a process called adb.exe. HTC Sync is an optional program available when installing the HTC USB driver. I had recently updated my installation of the HTC bundle and apparently hadn\'t installed HTC Sync before. Checking properties on adb.exe in the Task Manager showed it to belong to HTC Sync not Android.As soon as I uninstalled HTC Sync from control panel the problem disappeared! (It\'s listed separately from the USB driver so that can stay.) I never saw more than one instance of adb.exe running. I\'m curious to know if people having to kill the process from Task Manager, check to see if its actually the Android process you are killing?Please read user comments (I too have a HTC Thunderbolt):\nhttp://www.file.net/process/adb.exe.htmlSimply go in Task Manager (windows users) and kill the abd.exe (it is remaining active somehow).\nAfter that start Eclipse.The error"The connection to adb is down, and a severe error has occured"happened after installing plugin for Android of Netbeans. After closing Netbeans the process abd.exe remained active. When you want to start again Eclipse ... you will get the error.You have to manually kill the adb.exe and then start Eclipse. It worked for me.I had the same problems, and it turned out that my antivirus (Comodo) sandboxed the adb.exe and that is why it didn\'t worked. I closed the antivirus, and it worked just fine. Consider that I have had a lot of problems with ADB frequently disconnecting since I updated to a recent version (8?) of the SDK, both from the emulator and from my phone.  (but this was on linux)Sometimes if I don\'t want to restart the emulator, I tell adb to reconnect to the emulator over tcp by specifying the port that it is listening on which I found buried somewhere in the docs - might be 127.0.0.1 and 5554 or 5555, forget what exactly it was that worked.  At this point the adb device list no longer shows it as an emulator, but as a generic tcp-connected android device.In my case the disconnections seem to be a bug in the SDK as it was working fine with an older version.My problem was that my firewall was preventing ADB from binding to the port it wanted to.i had a similar problem. I found out that there was another adb.exe running which was started from BirdieSync (Sync Tool for Thunderbird). I found out with process Explorer from systernals (http://download.sysinternals.com/Files/ProcessExplorer.zip) , that Windows was running another incompatible adb.exe. Just put the Mouse Cursor above the process (inProcessExplorer) und you\xc2\xb4ll see which adb.exe is startet. I had to kill the BirdieSync Process as well  because it startet the wrong adb.exe again.Then i could start the right adb.exe and it works fine.Perhaps this might help.Bye\nJBthe killing of the mysteriously running abd.exe worked. this sudden roadblock stopped me for a long time. i was doing all sorts of command line stuff and removed the lock icon from my user folder, but nothing worked until your simple suggestion of looking for the abd in the running processes of the task manager and killing it.another newbie roadblock i discovered an answer to: don\'t run eclipse when any file other than the main .java file is active. if you run it when, for example, the main.xml file is active, you will get unhelpful error messeages, an odd file created like main.xml.out, and it wont run.I had the same problemThat\'s allThe above solutions will probably work, I solved it downloading lastest ADT (Android Developer Tools) and overwritting all files in the SDK folder. \nhttp://developer.android.com/sdk/index.htmlOnce you overwrite it, Eclipse may give a warning saying that the path for SDK hasnt been found, go to Preferences and change the path to other folder (c:), click Apply and then change it again and set the SDK path and click Apply again.close eclipseuse this in terminalrun eclipseIf you are using genymotion emulator\nmake sure that the SDK path used for the genymotion is also the same path used for the eclipse.\nthis error also occurs if that two paths be different.What worked for me was to start my AVD emulator first (from the AVD manager), and then to run my program. The other stuff mentioned here.(Restarting adb server didn\'t work though)Eclipse->preferences->Android->NDKCheck the "NDK Location" path is set correctly, use the browse button to set it.androidSDK ->platform tools-> kill not work.\nbut\nrestart my computer ,then it workingNothing worked for me, even restarting a computer. I couldn\'t install app on my device. But I solved this problem by myself:\nGo to DDMS and choose connected device. Now try again!I found the Path of SDK Location(Preferences -> Android -> SDK Location) was the cause. My SDK Path was the following:The Spaces in the Path are the problems. To get it work, you must change Program Files (x86) to Progra~2The complete right path is C:\\Progra~2\\Android\\android-sdk.Now it should work.I got the same error. My resolution is to set the directory platform-tools to system path then restart the OS.Or in DOS cmd prompt:It works for me.maydenec is correct (in my case...) the file was moved.I even found this file :Which explained this issue.\nSuggestions in this file:Add path to android-sdks/platform-tools in windows PATH environment var
