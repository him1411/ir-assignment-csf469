I understand that an id must be unique within an HTML/XHTML page.My question is, for a given element, can I assign multiple ids to it?I realize I have an easy solution with simply using a class. I\'m just curious about using ids in this manner.No. From the XHTML 1.0 SpecIn XML, fragment identifiers are of\n  type ID, and there can only be a\n  single attribute of type ID per\n  element. Therefore, in XHTML 1.0 the\n  id attribute is defined to be of type\n  ID. In order to ensure that XHTML 1.0\n  documents are well-structured XML\n  documents, XHTML 1.0 documents MUST\n  use the id attribute when defining\n  fragment identifiers on the elements\n  listed above. See the HTML\n  Compatibility Guidelines for\n  information on ensuring such anchors\n  are backward compatible when serving\n  XHTML documents as media type\n  text/html.Contrary to what everyone else said, the correct answer is YESThe Selectors spec is very clear about this:If an element has multiple ID attributes, all of them must be treated as IDs for that element for the purposes of the ID selector.Such a situation could be reached using mixtures of xml:id, DOM3 Core, XML DTDs, and namespace-specific knowledge.EditJust to clarify: Yes, an XHTML element can have multiple ids, e.g.but assigning multiple ids to the same id attribute using a space-separated list is not possible.My understanding has always been:ID\'s are single use and are only applied to one element...Classes can be used more than once...No.  While the definition from w3c for HTML 4 doesn\'t seem to explicitly cover your question, the definition of the name and id attribute says no spaces in the identifier:ID and NAME tokens must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods (".").You can only have one ID per element, but you can indeed have more than one class. But don\'t have multiple class attributes, put multiple class values into one attribute.is perfectly legal.No.  Every DOM element, if it has an id, has a single, unique id.   You could approximate it using something like:and then use navigation to get what you really want.If you are just looking to apply styles, class names are better.No you cannot have multiple ids for a single tag, but I have seen a tag with a name attribute and an id attribute which are treated the same by some applications.No, you should use nested DIVs if you want to head down that path.  Besides, even if you could, imagine the confusion it would cause when you run document.getElementByID().  What ID is it going to grab if there are multiple ones?On a slightly related topic, you can add multiple classes to a DIV.  See Eric Myers discussion at,http://meyerweb.com/eric/articles/webrev/199802a.html http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/global.html#h-7.5.2The id attribute assigns a unique identifier to an element (which may\n  be verified by an SGML parser).and ID and NAME tokens must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be\n  followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"),\n  underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods (".").So "id" must be unique and can\'t contain a space.No.Having said that, there\'s nothing to stop you doing it. But you\'ll get inconsistent behaviour with the various browsers. Don\'t do it. 1 ID per element.If you want multiple assignations to an element use classes (separated by a space).That\'s interesting, but as far as I know the answer is a firm no.  I don\'t see why you need a nested ID, since you\'ll usually cross it with another element that has the same nested ID.  If you don\'t there\'s no point, if you do there\'s still very little point.I know this is a year old but I was curious about this myself and I\'m sure others will find their way here. \nThe simple answer is no, as others have said before me. An element can\'t have more than one ID and an ID can\'t be used more than once in a page. Try it out and you\'ll see how well it doesn\'t work.In reponse to tvanfosson\'s answer regarding the use of the same ID in two different elements. As far as I\'m aware an ID can only be used once in a page regardless of whether it\'s attached to a different tag.By definition, an element needing an ID should be unique but if you need two ID\'s then it\'s not really unique and needs a class instead.I\'d like to say technically yes, since really what gets rendered is technically always browser dependent.  Most browsers try to keep to the specifications as best they can and as far as I know there is nothing in the css specifications against it. I\'m only going to vouch for the actual html,css,javascript code that gets sent to the browser before any other interpretter steps in.However I also say no since every browser I typically test on doesn\'t actually let you.\nIf you need to see for yourself save the following as a .html file and open it up in the major browsers.  In all browsers I tested on the javascript function will not match to an element. However, remove either "hunkojunk" from the id tag and all works fine.\nSample Codeclasses are specially made for this,\nhere is the code from which you can understand I don\xc2\xb4t think you can have two Id\xc2\xb4s but it should be possible. Using the same id twice is a different case... like two people using the same passport. However one person could have multiple passports... Came looking for this since I have a situation where a single employee can have several functions. Say "sysadm" and "team coordinator" having the id="sysadm teamcoordinator" would let me reference them from other pages so that employees.html#sysadm and employees.html#teamcoordinator would lead to the same place... One day somebody else might take over the team coordinator function while the sysadm remains the sysadm... then I only have to change the ids on the employees.html page ... but like I said - it doesn\xc2\xb4t work :(
