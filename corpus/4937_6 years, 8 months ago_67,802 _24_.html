Is there a PHP Sandbox, something like JSFiddle is to JS?The Runkit extension aims to provide a PHP Sandbox:Instantiating the Runkit_Sandbox class creates a new thread with its own scope and program stack. Using a set of options passed to the constructor, this environment may be restricted to a subset of what the primary interpreter can do and provide a safer environment for executing user supplied code. If you dont want to use Runkit but still want a PHP Console on your server, tryIf you are just looking for an online site to play around with PHP code, try The most sophisticated is probably:It lets you test your code in all PHP versions starting from PHP4.http://codepad.viper-7.com/The system allows full access to all PHP functions - no restrictions and no safe mode. Many common extensions are loaded and available for use. Security is provided on an OS level by strict user permissions inside a setuid chroot jail protected by system call tracing, which should all be transparent to PHP code. You can write files in the /temp folder, but they will be periodically deleted. The Profile code option will use XDebug to trace every function call in your code and measure the time taken, and will also use VLD to generate a full opcode listing to see how PHP executes your code \'under the hood\'!Try:WriteCodeOnline.com/php/I personally prefer eXorithm\'s.
