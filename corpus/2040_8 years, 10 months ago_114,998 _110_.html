Let\'s make a list of answers where you post your excellent and favorite extension methods. The requirement is that the full code must be posted and a example and an explanation on how to use it.Based on the high interest in this topic I have setup an Open Source Project called extensionoverflow on Codeplex. Please mark your answers with an acceptance to put the code in the Codeplex project.Please post the full sourcecode and not a link.Codeplex News:24.08.2010 The Codeplex page is now here:  http://extensionoverflow.codeplex.com/11.11.2008 XmlSerialize / XmlDeserialize is now Implemented and Unit Tested.11.11.2008 There is still room for more developers. ;-) Join NOW!11.11.2008 Third contributer joined ExtensionOverflow, welcome to BKristensen11.11.2008 FormatWith is now Implemented and Unit Tested.09.11.2008 Second contributer joined ExtensionOverflow. welcome to chakrit.09.11.2008 We need more developers. ;-)09.11.2008 ThrowIfArgumentIsNull in now Implemented and Unit Tested on Codeplex.Allows me to replace:With:I have various extension methods in my MiscUtil project (full source is available there - I\'m not going to repeat it here). My favourites, some of which involve other classes (such as ranges):Date and time stuff - mostly for unit tests. Not sure I\'d use them in production :)Ranges and stepping - massive thanks to Marc Gravell for his operator stuff to make this possible:Comparisons:Argument checking:LINQ to XML applied to anonymous types (or other types with appropriate properties):Push LINQ - would take too long to explain here, but search for it.string.Format shortcut:Example:For quick copy-and-paste go here.Don\'t you find it more natural to type "some string".F("param") instead of string.Format("some string", "param") ?For a more readable name, try one of these suggestion:..Are these any use?Example:The extension method:The method applies for all types and lets you add a range of items to a list as parameters.Example:By all means put this in the codeplex project.Serializing / Deserializing objects to XML:ForEach for IEnumerablesNaive example:Cool example:Note:This is not like Select because Select expects your function to return something as for transforming into another list.ForEach simply allows you to execute something for each of the items without any transformations/data manipulation.I made this so I can program in a more functional style and I was surprised that List has a ForEach while IEnumerable does not.Put this in the codeplex projectMy conversion extensions which allow you to do:Here it is, as posted on TheSoftwareJedi.comYou can ask for default (calls blank constructor or "0" for numerics) on failure, specify a "default" value (I call it "other"), or ask for null (where T : class). I\'ve also provided both silent exception models, and a typical TryParse model that returns a bool indicating the action taken, and an out param holds the new value.\nSo our code can do things like thisI couldn\'t get Nullable types to roll into the whole thing very cleanly. I tried for about 20 minutes before I threw in the towel.I have an extension method for logging exceptions:And it is used like this:[sorry for posting twice; the 2nd one is better designed :-)]Useful to parse a string into an Enum.Credit goes to Scott Dorman--- Edit for Codeplex project ---I have asked Scott Dorman if he would mind us publishing his code in the Codeplex project. This is the reply I got from him:Thanks for the heads-up on both the SO post and the CodePlex project. I have upvoted your answer on the question. Yes, the code is effectively in the public domain currently under the CodeProject Open License (http://www.codeproject.com/info/cpol10.aspx).I have no problems with this being included in the CodePlex project, and if you want to add me to the project (username is sdorman) I will add that method plus some additional enum helper methods.I find this one pretty useful:You may use it on CodePlex.DateTimeExtensionsExamples:gitorious.org/cadenza is a full library of some of the most useful extension methods I\'ve seen.Here is one I use frequently for presentation formatting.Here\'s a to-and-from for Roman numerals.  Not often used, but could be handy.  Usage:The source:A convenient way to deal with sizes: For Winform Controls:IsDesignTime Usage:SetDropdownWidth Usage:I forgot to mention, feel free to use these on Codeplex...The ThrowIfArgumentIsNull is a nice way to do that null check we all should do.Below is the way to use it and it works on all classes in your namespace or wherever you use the namespace its within.It\'s ok to use this code on the CodePlex project. I miss the Visual Basic\'s With statement when moving to C#, so here it goes:And here\'s how to use it in C#:Saves a lot of typing!Compare this to:put in codeplex projectTakes a camelCaseWord or PascalCaseWord and "wordifies" it, ie camelCaseWord => camel Case WordI often use it in conjuction with CapitalizeExample usageFree to use in codeplex projectI found this one helpfulIt removes the null check in the calling code. You could now doConvert a double to string formatted using the specified culture:Example:Below is an extension method that adapts Rick Strahl\'s code (and the comments too) to stop you having to guess or read the byte order mark of a byte array or text file each time you convert it to a string.The snippet allows you to simply do:If you find any bugs please add to the comments. Feel free to include it in the Codeplex project.Here\'s one I just created today.It lets you do this:which is more fluent and (IMO) easier to read than this:"Please mark your answers with an acceptance to put the code in the Codeplex project."Why? All the Stuff on this site under CC-by-sa-2.5, so just put your Extension overflow Project under the same license and you can freely use it.Anyway, here is a String.Reverse function, based on this question.I got tired of tedious null-checking while pulling values from MySqlDataReader, so:Of course this could be used with any SqlDataReader.Both hangy and Joe had some good comments on how to do this, and I have since had an opportunity to implement something similar in a different context, so here is another version:It irritated me that LINQ gives me an OrderBy that takes a class implementing IComparer as an argument, but does not support passing in a simple anonymous comparer function. I rectified that.This class creates an IComparer from your comparer function......and these extension methods expose my new OrderBy overloads on enumerables. I doubt this works for LINQ to SQL, but it\'s great for LINQ to Objects.You\'re welcome to put this on codeplex if you like.This one is for MVC it adds the ability to generate a <label /> tag to the Html variable that is available in every ViewPage. Hopefully it will be of use to others trying to develop similar extensions.Use:Output:Code:Turn this:... into this:... using this extension method:More ADO.NET extension methods: DbExtensions
