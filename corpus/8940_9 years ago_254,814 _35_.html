As compared to say:This is simply an inefficient use of SQL, no matter how you do it. perhaps something like where X is your padding character and @n is the number of characters in the resulting string (assuming you need the padding because you are dealing with a fixed length).  But as I said you should really avoid doing this in your database.I know this was originally asked back in 2008, but there are some new functions that were introduced with SQL Server 2012.  The FORMAT function simplifies padding left with zeros nicely.  It will also perform the conversion for you:Update:I wanted to test the actual efficiency of the FORMAT function myself.  I was quite surprised to find the efficiency was not very good compared to the original answer from AlexCuse.  Although I find the FORMAT function cleaner, it is not very efficient in terms of execution time. The Tally table I used has 64,000 records.  Kudos to Martin Smith for pointing out execution time efficiency.SQL Server Execution Times:\n   CPU time = 2157 ms,  elapsed time = 2696 ms.SQL Server Execution Times:CPU time = 31 ms,  elapsed time = 235 ms.Several people gave versions of this:be careful with that because it will truncate your actual data if it is longer than n.Perhaps an over kill I have these UDFs to pad left and rightand to rightI\'m not sure that the method that you give is really inefficient, but an alternate way, as long as it doesn\'t have to be flexible in the length or padding character, would be (assuming that you want to pad it with "0" to 10 characters:In SQL Server 2005 and later you could create a CLR function to do this.probably overkill, I often use this UDF:So that you can do things like:I liked vnRocks solution, here it is in the form of a udfthis is a simple way to pad left:Where x is the pad number and y is the pad character.sample:I hope this helps someone. STUFF ( character_expression , start , length ,character_expression )select stuff(@str, 1, 0, replicate(\'0\', @n - len(@str)))How about this:3 is the number of zeros to padTo provide numerical values rounded to two decimal places but right-padded with zeros if required I have:If anyone can think of a neater way, that would be appreciated - the above seems clumsy.Note: in this instance, I\'m using SQL Server to email reports in HTML format and so wish to format the information without involving an additional tool to parse the data.  I use this one. It allows you to determine the length you want the result to be as well as a default padding character if one is not provided. Of course you can customize the length of the input and output for whatever maximums you are running into.Your mileage may vary. :-)\nJoey Morgan\nProgrammer/Analyst Principal I\nWellPoint Medicaid Business UnitHere\'s my solution, which avoids truncated strings and uses plain ol\' SQL.  Thanks to @AlexCuse, @Kevin and @Sklivvz, whose solutions are the foundation of this code.Here is how I would normally pad a varchar
