Very quick n00b question, in PHP can I include a directory of scripts.i.e. Instead of:is there something like:Couldn\'t seem to find a good way of including a collection of about 10 sub-classes for a particular class.Here is the way I include lots of classes from several folders in PHP 5. This will only work if you have classes though.I realize this is an older post BUT... DON\'T INCLUDE YOUR CLASSES... instead use __autoloadThen whenever you call a new class that hasn\'t been included yet php will auto fire __autoload and include it for youIf you are using php 5 you might want to use autoload instead.this is just a modification of Karsten\'s codeYou can use set_include_path:http://php.net/manual/en/function.set-include-path.phpHow to do this in 2017:Recommended by PHP documentation here: Autoloading classesIf you want include all in a directory AND its subdirectories:Don\'t forget that it will use alphabetic order to include your files.If there are NO dependencies between files... here is a recursive function to include_once ALL php files in ALL subdirs:I suggest you use a readdir() function and then loop and include the files (see the 1st example on that page).If your looking to include a bunch of classes without having to define each class at once you can use:This way you can just define the class on the php file containing the class and not a whole list of $thisclass = new thisclass();As for how well it handles all the files? I\'m not sure there might be a slight speed decrease with this.Do no write a function() to include files in a directory. You may lose the variable scopes, and may have to use "global". Just loop on the files.Also, you may run into difficulties when an included file has a class name that will extend to the other class defined in the other file - which is not yet included. So, be careful.
