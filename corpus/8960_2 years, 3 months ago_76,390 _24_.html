I\'m new to webpack, and I need a hand in setting up to generate sourcemaps. I\'m running webpack serve from the command line, which compiles successfully. But I really need sourcemaps. This is my webpack.config.js.I\'m really new to webpack, and looking though the docs hasn\'t really helped as I\'m not sure what this problem is specific to.In order to use source map, you should change devtool option value from true to the value which available in this list., for instance source-mapdevtool: \'source-map\' - A SourceMap is emitted.Maybe someone else has this problem at one point. If you use the UglifyJsPlugin in webpack 2 you need to explicitly specify the sourceMap flag. For example:Minimal webpack config for jsx with sourcemaps:Running it:If optimizing for dev + production, you could try something like this in your config:From the docs:I am using webpack 2.1.0-beta.19Even same issue I faced, in browser it was showing compiled code. I have made below changes in webpack config file and it is working fine now.and in loaders I kept babel-loader as first option On Webpack 2 I tried all 12 devtool options. The following options link to the original file in the console and preserve line numbers. See the note below re: lines only.https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtooldevtool best dev optionslines onlySource Maps are simplified to a single mapping per line.\nThis usually means a single mapping per statement (assuming you author is this way).\nThis prevents you from debugging execution on statement level and from settings breakpoints on columns of a line.\nCombining with minimizing is not possible as minimizers usually only emit a single line.You can try Dawn, it\'s simplerhttps://github.com/alibaba/dawnexample:InstallAdd a .dawn.yml file to your projectExecute the following commandYou can complete the build
