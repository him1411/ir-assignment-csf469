How do I stop Notepad++ from loading all files from the past session?Every time I open a file I have 10 other open tabs with all my past files. I don\'t want that. When I hit the close button I expect the program to do what I want and close it. If I wanted to save a session I would use the built in session save feature. I don\'t want to hit the gray x 20 times when I am done so next time I don\'t have a bunch of files opening and taking up memory. I tried the -nosession parameter and that works. But it only works if I use the shortcut. It won\'t work if I use the right-click edit method. How do I set Notepad++ to do this?For versions 6.6+ you need to uncheck "Remember the current session for next launch" on Settings -> Preferences -> Backup.For older versions you need to uncheck "Remember the current session for next launch" \non Settings -> Preferences.In Notepad++ v6.6 this setting is moved to the Backup tab of the Preferences menu.My problem was that Notepad++ was crashing on a file I had previously opened; I was unable to open the application at all. This blog post discusses how to delete the data from the "Sessions" file so that Notepad++ will open without having any prior files open:From the blog post: Method 1 - edit session.xmlMethod 2 - add the -nosession parameter to Notepad++ shortcutNote: This is not a permanent setting, this simply deletes the prior session\'s information / opened files and starts over.Alternatively, if you know the file which is causing notepad++ to hang, you can simply rename the file and open notepad++. This will solve the problem.I hadn\'t seen this solution listed when I was googling my problem so I wanted to add it here!Ok, I had a problem with Notepad++ not remembering that I had chosen not the "Remember Current Session". I tried hacking the config file, but that didn\'t work. Then I found out that there is a secret config file in your C:\\Users\\myuseraccount\\AppData\\Roaming\\Notepad++ directory (Windows 7 x64). Mine was empty, meaning who know where the config was really coming from, but I copied over the file with the one in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Notepad++ and now everything works just like you would expect it to.Go to: Settings > Preferences > Backup > and Uncheck Remember current session for next launchIn older versions (6.5-), this option is located on Settings > Preferences > MISC.Use the menu item Settings>Preferences. On the MISC tab of the resulting dialog, uncheck "Remember current session for next launch."
