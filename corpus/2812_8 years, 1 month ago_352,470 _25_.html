Here\'s what I did on my supposed-to-be-stable branch...That was all a mistake as I later realized. I\'d like to undo this entire process, and revert the alpha-0.3.0 branch back to what it was.What should I do?You need to make sure that no other users of this repository are fetching the incorrect changes or trying to build on top of the commits that you want removed because you are about to rewind history.Then you need to \'force\' push the old reference.or in your caseYou may have receive.denyNonFastForwards set on the remote repository. If this is the case, then you will get an error which includes the phrase [remote rejected].In this scenario, you will have to delete and recreate the branch.If this doesn\'t work - perhaps because you have receive.denyDeletes set, then you have to have direct access to the repository. In the remote repository, you then have to do something like the following plumbing command.I believe that you can also do this:This is very similar to the last method, except you don\'t have to muck around in the remote repo.git revert is less dangerous than some of the approaches suggested here:Replace 35f6af6f77f116ef922e3d75bc80a4a466f92650 with your own commit.The accepted solution (from @charles bailey) is highly dangerous if you are working in a shared repo. As a best practice, all commits pushed to a remote repo that is shared should be considered \'immutable\'.\nUse \'git revert\' instead: \nhttp://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#fixing-mistakeshttps://git-scm.com/book/be/v2/Git-Basics-Undoing-ThingsA way to do it without losing the changes you wanted:Then you can choose the files you meant to pushAnother way to do this:This will revert your repo to mentioned commit numberUndo multiple commits\ngit reset --hard 0ad5a7a6 (Just provide commit SHA1 hash)Undo last commitgit reset --hard HEAD~1 (changes to last commit will be removed )  git reset --soft HEAD~1 (changes to last commit will be available as uncommited local modifications)This will delete the last pushed commit in the remote branch (master or your branch): git push origin +HEAD^:master
