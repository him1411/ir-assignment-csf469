There are many ways the value of a <input type="text"> can change, including:I want my JavaScript function to be called (with the current input value) any time it changes.  And I want it to be called right away, not just when the input loses focus.I\'m looking for the cleanest and most robust way to do this across all browsers (using jQuery preferably).Example use case: On the Twitter Signup page, the username field\'s value gets shown in the url "http://twitter/username" below it.This jQuery code catches immediate changes to any element, and should work across all browsers:A realtime fancy solution for jquery >= 1.9if you also want to detect "click" event, just:if your jquery <=1.4, just use "live" instead of "on".Unfortunately, I think setInterval wins the prize:It\'s the cleanest solution, at only 1 line of code.  It\'s also the most robust, since you don\'t have to worry about all the different events/ways an input can get a value.The downsides of using \'setInterval\' don\'t seem to apply in this case:Binding to the oninput event seems to work fine in most sane browsers. IE9 supports it too, but the implementation is buggy (the event is not fired when deleting characters).With jQuery version 1.7+ the on method is useful to bind to the event like this:Unfortunately there is no event or set of events that matches your criteria.  Keypresses and copy/paste can both be handled with the keyup event.  Changes through JS are trickier.  If you have control over the code that sets the textbox, your best bet is to modify it to either call your function directly or trigger a user event on the textbox:If you don\'t have control over that code, you could use setInterval() to \'watch\' the textbox for changes:This sort of active monitoring won\'t catch updates \'immediately\', but it seems to be fast enough that there is no perceptible lag.  As DrLouie pointed out in comments, this solution probably doesn\'t scale well if you need to watch lots of inputs.  You can always adjust the 2nd parameter to setInterval() to check more or less frequently.2017 answer: the input event does exactly this for anything more recent that IE8.Here is a slightly different solution if you didn\'t fancy any of the other answers:  Consider that you cannot rely on click and keyup to capture context menu paste. I have created a sample. May it will work for you.http://jsfiddle.net/utbh575s/Well, best way is to cover those three bases you listed by yourself. A simple :onblur, :onkeyup, etc won\'t work for what you want, so just combine them.KeyUp should cover the first two, and if Javascript is modifying the input box, well I sure hope it\'s your own javascript, so just add a callback in the function that modifies it.Here\'s a working example that I\'m using to implement an autocomplete variation the populates a jqueryui selector (list), but I don\'t want it to function exactly like the jqueryui autocomplete which does a drop-down menu.We actually don\'t need to setup loops for detecting javaScript changes.\nWe already setting up many event listeners to the element we want to detect. just triggering any un harmful event will make the job.and ofc this is only available if you have the full control on javascript changes on your project.you can see this example and choose which are the events that interest you:I may be late to the party here but can you not just use the .change() event that jQuery provides.You should be able to do something like ...You could always bind it to a list of controls with something like ...The live binder ensures that all elements that exist on the page now and in the future are handled.This is the fastest& clean way to do that :I\'m using Jquery-->It is working pretty fine for me.
