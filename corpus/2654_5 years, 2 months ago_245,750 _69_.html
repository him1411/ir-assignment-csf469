I am having trouble installing psycopg2. I get the following error when I try to pip install psycopg2:But the problem is pg_config is actually in my PATH; it runs without any problem:I tried adding the pg_config path to the setup.cfg file and building it using the source files I downloaded from their website (http://initd.org/psycopg/) and I get the following error message!But it is actually THERE!!!I am baffled by these errors. Can anyone help please?By the way, I sudo all the commands. Also I am on RHEL 5.5.pg_config is in postgresql-devel (libpq-dev in Debian/Ubuntu, libpq-devel on Cygwin/Babun.)On Mac OS X, I solved it withHave you installed python-dev?\nIf you already have, try also installing libpq-devFrom the article: How to install psycopg2 under virtualenvAlso on OSX. Installed Postgress.app from http://postgresapp.com/ but had the same issue.I found pg_config in that app\'s contents and added the dir to $PATH.It was at /Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/bin. So this worked: export PATH="/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/bin:$PATH".Just to sum up, I also faced exactly same problem. After reading a lot of stackoverflow posts and online blogs, the final solution which worked for me is this:1) PostgreSQL(development or any stable version) should be installed before installing psycopg2.2) The pg_config file (this file normally resides in the bin folder of the PostgreSQL installation folder) PATH had to be explicitly setup before installing psycopg2. In my case, the installation PATH for PostgreSQL is:so in order to explicitly set the PATH of pg_config file, I entered following command in my terminal:This command ensures that when you try to pip install psycopg2, it would find the PATH to pg_config automatically this time.I have also posted a full error with trace and its solution on my blog which you may want to refer. Its for Mac OS X but the pg_config PATH problem is generic and applicable to Linux also. sudo apt-get install libpq-dev works for me on Ubuntu 15.4UPDATE /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo, [base] and [updates] sections\nADD exclude=postgresql*For those running OS X, this solution worked for me:1) Install Postgres.app:http://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx/2) Then open the Terminal and run this command, replacing where it says {{version}} with the Postgres version number:export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/{{version}}/bine.g.export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.4/binAli\'s solution worked for me but I was having trouble finding the bin folder location. A quick way to find the path on Mac OS X is to open psql (there\'s a quick link in the top menu bar). This will open a separate terminal window and on the second line the path of your Postgres installation will appear like so:Your pg_config file is in that bin folder. Therefore, before installing psycopg2 set the path of the pg_config file:or for newer version:Then install psycopg2. This is what worked for me on CentOS, first install:On Ubuntu just use the equivilent apt-get packages.And now include the path to your postgresql binary dir with you pip install, this should work for either Debain or RHEL based Linux:Make sure to include the correct path. Thats all :)Try to add it to PATH:On Windows,\nYou may want to install the Windows port of Psycopg, which is recommended in psycopg\'s documentation.Just solved the problem in Cent OS 7 by:make sure your PostgreSql version matches the right version above.sudo yum install postgresql-devel   (centos6X)pip install psycopg2==2.5.2Here, for OS X completeness: if you install PostgreSQL from MacPorts, pg_config will be in /opt/local/lib/postgresql94/bin/pg_config. When you installed MacPorts, it already added /opt/local/bin to your PATH. So, this will fix the problem:\n\n$ sudo ln -s /opt/local/lib/postgresql94/bin/pg_config /opt/local/bin/pg_config\nNow pip install psycopg2 will be able to run pg_config without issues.You need to upgrade your pip before installing psycopg2. Use this commandOn Mac OS X and If you are using Postgres App (http://postgresapp.com/):No need to specify version of Postgres in this command. It will be always pointed to latest.and do P.S: If Changes doesn\'t reflect you may need to restart the Terminal/Command promptSourceThis is how I managed to install psycopg2On alpine, the library containing pg_config is postgresql-dev. To install, run:I am pretty sure you\'ve experienced the same "problem" i did, therefore I\'ll offer you the extremely easy solution...In your case, the actual path that you need to add to $PATH (or as a command param) is:notE.g. if you run the python setup.py script afterwards, you would run it like this:Probably too late, but still the easiest solution.LATER EDIT:Under further test I found out that if you initially add the path to pg_config in the form (without /pg_config after ...../bin) and run the pip install command it will work.However, if you then decide to follow the indication to run python setup.py, you will have to specify the path with /pg_config after ...../bin, i.e.On Gentoo You have to execute the followingThis works for me:I found that this page provided the best instructions for installing PostgreSQL on my mac and that the pip install command worked perfectly afterwards:https://www.codefellows.org/blog/three-battle-tested-ways-to-install-postgresqlInstalling python-psycopg2 solved it for me on Arch Linux:for CentOS/RedHat make sure that /etc/alternatives/pgsql-pg_config is a non-broken symlink
