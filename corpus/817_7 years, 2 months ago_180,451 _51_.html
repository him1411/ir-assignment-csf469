A tweet reads: Don\'t use easy_install, unless you\n  like stabbing yourself in the face.\n  Use pip.Why use pip over easy_install? Doesn\'t the fault lie with PyPI and package authors mostly? If an author uploads crap source tarball (eg: missing files, no setup.py) to PyPI, then both pip and easy_install will fail. Other than cosmetic differences, why do Python people (like in the above tweet) seem to strongly favor pip over easy_install?(Let\'s assume that we\'re talking about easy_install from the Distribute package, that is maintained by the community)Many of the answers here are out of date for 2015 (although the initially accepted one from Daniel Roseman is not). Here\'s the current state of things:The only good reason that I know of to use easy_install in 2015 is the special case of using Apple\'s pre-installed Python versions with OS X 10.5-10.8. Since 10.5, Apple has included easy_install, but as of 10.10 they still don\'t include pip. With 10.9+, you should still just use get-pip.py, but for 10.5-10.8, this has some problems, so it\'s easier to sudo easy_install pip. (In general, easy_install pip is a bad idea; it\'s only for OS X 10.5-10.8 that you want to do this.) Also, 10.5-10.8 include readline in a way that easy_install knows how to kludge around but pip doesn\'t, so you also want to sudo easy_install readline if you want to upgrade that.From Ian Bicking\'s own introduction to pip:pip was originally written to improve on easy_install in the following waysAnother\xe2\x80\x94as of yet unmentioned\xe2\x80\x94reason for favoring pip is because it is the new hotness and will continue to be used in the future. The infographic below\xe2\x80\x94from the Current State of Packaging section in the The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to Packaging v1.0\xe2\x80\x94shows that setuptools/easy_install will go away in the future.Here\'s another infographic from distribute\'s documentation showing that Setuptools and easy_install will be replaced by the new hotness\xe2\x80\x94distribute and pip. While pip is still the new hotness, Distribute merged with Setuptools in 2013 with the release of Setuptools v0.7.Two reasons, there may be more:pip provides an uninstall commandif an installation fails in the middle, pip will leave you in a clean state.REQUIREMENTS files.Seriously, I use this in conjunction with virtualenv every day.QUICK DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT TUTORIAL, GUYSRequirements files allow you to create a snapshot of all packages that have been installed through pip.  By encapsulating those packages in a virtualenvironment, you can have your codebase work off a very specific set of packages and share that codebase with others.From Heroku\'s documentation https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pythonYou create a virtual environment, and set your shell to use it. (bash/*nix instructions)Now all python scripts run with this shell will use this environment\'s packages and configuration.  Now you can install a package locally to this environment without needing to install it globally on your machine.Now you can dump the info about which packages are installed withIf you checked that file into version control, when someone else gets your code, they can setup their own virtual environment and install all the dependencies with:Any time you can automate tedium like this is awesome.pip won\'t install binary packages and isn\'t well tested on Windows.As Windows doesn\'t come with a compiler by default pip often can\'t be used there. easy_install can install binary packages for Windows.UPDATE: setuptools has absorbed distribute as opposed to the other way around, as some thought. setuptools is up-to-date with the latest distutils changes and the wheel format. Hence, easy_install and pip are more or less on  equal footing now.Source: http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/merge-faq.html#why-setuptools-and-not-distribute-or-another-nameAs an addition to fuzzyman\'s reply:pip won\'t install binary packages and isn\'t well tested on Windows.As Windows doesn\'t come with a compiler by default pip often can\'t be\n  used there. easy_install can install binary packages for Windows.Here is a trick on Windows:you can use easy_install <package> to install binary packages to avoid building a binaryyou can use  pip uninstall <package> even if you used easy_install.This is just a work-around that works for me on windows.\nActually I always use pip if no binaries are involved.See the current pip doku: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/other-tools.html#pip-compared-to-easy-installI will ask on the mailing list what is planned for that.Here is the latest update:The new supported way to install binaries is going to be wheel!\nIt is not yet in the standard, but almost. Current version is still an alpha: 1.0.0a1https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wheelhttp://wheel.readthedocs.org/en/latest/I will test wheel by creating an OS X installer for PySide using wheel instead of eggs. Will get back and report about this.cheers - ChrisThe transition to wheel is almost over. Most packages are supporting wheel.I promised to build wheels for PySide, and I did that last summer. Works great!HINT:\nA few developers failed so far to support the wheel format, simply because they forget to\nreplace distutils by setuptools.\nOften, it is easy to convert such packages by replacing this single word in setup.py.Just met one special case that I had to use easy_install instead of pip, or I have to pull the source codes directly.For the package GitPython, the version in pip is too old, which is 0.1.7, while the one from easy_install is the latest which is 0.3.2.rc1.I\'m using Python 2.7.8. I\'m not sure about the underlay mechanism of easy_install and pip, but at least the versions of some packages may be different from each other, and sometimes easy_install is the one with newer version.
