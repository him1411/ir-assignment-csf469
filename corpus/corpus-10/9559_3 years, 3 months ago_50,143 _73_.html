I get this error after adding a Swift class to an old Xcode project.dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libswift_stdlib_core.dylibHow can I make the project run again?For me none of the previous solutions worked. We discovered that there is an flag ALWAYS_EMBED_SWIFT_STANDARD_LIBRARIES (in earlier versions: "Embedded Content Contains Swift Code") in the Build Settings that needs to be set to YES. It was NO by default!This error can occur if something went wrong during the conversion of an Objective-C project to start using Swift. The issue is that the Linker build settings never got configured properly, so you\'ll have to do it by hand. Look for the Runpath Search Paths build setting and set it to:EDIT: I should also add that there has been recent spate of these errors caused by something else entirely - Apple made a change in Swift itself, starting in perhaps Xcode 6.1 or 6.1.1. The only solution seems to be to quit Xcode, destroy your certificates in Keychain Access, go to the Member Center and delete all certificates and profiles (except the profiles for apps in the Store - you can\'t delete them), and then start the entire certificate request process from scratch.I\'m not really sure why this question is being downvoted, I had this problem as well when I first tried to use Swift with an existing project.  An Xcode restart also fixed this for me.I searched long on this issue. There are several reasons causes this issue. If you are facing when you and Swift code/library in an Objectice C project you should try Solution 1-2-3If you are facing this issue with a new a Swift project Solution 4 will fit you best. Restart Xcode, then computer and iPhoneGo to project build settings and set Always Embed Swift Standard Libraries (previously Embedded Content Contains Swift Code) flag to YESGo to project build settings and add @executable_path/Frameworks to Runpath Search Paths optionIf none of above works, this should. Apple seems to be ninja patched certificates as mentioned in AirSign\'s post At InHouse certificates Subject: UID=269J2W3P2L, CN=iPhone Distribution: Company Name, O=Company Name, C=FRthey added a new field named OUSubject: UID=269J2W3P2L, CN=iPhone Distribution: Company Name, OU=269J2W3P2L, O=Company Name, C=FRso you should just recreate certificate and provisionIn my case I was trying to import a custom framework and was getting the similar error.\nTurns out I had to import the framework in the Embedded Binaries rather than in to the Linked Frameworks and Libraries.Embedded Binaries are under Projects Settings ->  -> GeneralFor developers who have had this issue with a Adhoc/Enterprise distribution builds, Create the production certificate from dev portal and then regenerate the distribution profile. Download and install both of them on your Mac. Ensure you selected the right profile in your Xcode build settings and rebuild your app.Source: https://devforums.apple.com/message/1022908#1022908Solution 5:In my case, all solutions mentioned in the answer of accfews were very helpful but none has worked. I solved my problem by adding my swift library in the section "Embedded Binaries" in the "General" section of my Project\'s target. Perhaps is this due to the fact that I have included my swift framework in my workspace? Whatever it compiles now! Get ready Swift, I\'m here!A simple restart of Xcode solved the issue for me.I had an Obj-C project where I started adding swift source files.\nThe following fixed the issue for me:I just created a new project from the templates Xcode 6.3 and compared the project settings with my old original project.For me, the issue was due to the fact that my Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification Authority was invalid. Download it from here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/certificationauthority/AppleWWDRCA.cerDrag and drop it into Keychain Access, clean the project, and run. I tried all the answers given above, nothing worked.Finally worked after updating to YosemiteI had this issue using an Ad Hoc (or enterprise) mobileprovision with a production certificate. Switching to a development certificate and mobileprovision solved the issue.My project is a Swift project with some Objective-C classes.\nI had the same problem when signed with old inHouse (enterprise) certificate.The following steps fixed this for me.Solution 6:In our case, the Enterprise Distribution Certificate had been revoked. Generating a new certificate and updating the provisioning profile fixed the issue.(There seems to be many different causes for this error. Hope this helps someone.)I have faced the same issue, setting the right code sign identity solved the problem(Build settings->Code Signing Identity).As per Apple technical question "All Enterprise and standard iOS developer certificates that are created after iOS 8 was released have the new Team ID field in the proper place to allow Swift language apps to run"If you add the three frameworks via Embedded Binaries, they will be added to Linked Frameworks and Libraries also. Delete the three entries in Linked Frameworks and Libraries will solve the problem.Magic methods such as relaunch Xcode and restart the Mac doesn\'t work on me.Try to hold Alt, then go to Product -> Clean Build Folder...Hope it will help someone..The reasons for this occurring are many. Having just spent a fun weekend finding yet another issue that causes this (the order of code signing), I wanted to create a summary answer that brings all the possible solutions together:That\'s the easy stuff.  If you are doing your own command line build you may be creating your own .ipa files to upload.  In that case you need to ensure the following:Hopefully when Swift 3.0 comes out and we no longer need to bundle Swift with our apps this whole issue will go away.Upgrade to Latest Version of OS X (Yosemite)After hours of trial & error I came to the resolution of this problem.\n- If this applies to your case of course.I had the same problem until I upgraded my Mac OS X from Mavericks to Yosemite.\n- It fixed my problem, hope it fixes yours as well I tried all the solutions that found on web, including to Apple and new certificates. Without success.The only way I could run xcode, after 6 months of trying, was creating a new account on my macbook.Usually this error will disappear if you add this library to the "Copy Files" segment in your Build Phases.And if all of the above doesn\'t help you and you really get frustrated... Try the best trick of all: Clean and just to be sure also Clean Build Folder. :) Hope it helps somebody!Adding Framework as "Embedded Binary" instead of just "Linked Frameworks and Libraries" - Fixed my issue.I also set Embedded Content Contains Swift Code flag to YES. None of these solutions seemed to be consistently working for me; after every couple of successful runs, it would fail again. The "Embedded Content Contains Swift Code" flag was always set to YES for me.Turns out I\'d set Xcode to be 6.3-compatible. Changing it back to be 3.2-compatible solved it:I\'ve had this problem as well, only it wasn\'t locating libswiftXCTest.dylib. The solution was to add XCTest.framework to the Tests target, in Build Phases/Link Binary with Library. I was getting this error even when I was trying to build the main target.This showed up when I added a new Today extension target with Swift language to an old project. \nFixed easily by updating the project to recommended settings. Xcode 6.0.1I got the same issue using Mavericks, Xcode 6.1.1, testing on an iPhone5 with iOS 8.1.1. I tried all possible solution including new certificates and provisioning profiles, but nothing helped. I did the changes to Embedded Content Contains Swift Code and Runpath Search Paths both on Project level and Target level.  I have now installed Yosemite, and without any further changes, it started to work. Same issue here, for me it was Crashlytics/Fabric/Beta/Twitter/Whatever-they-call-themselves uploading a binary that was missing the embedded frameworks. If I made an archive and then exported an Enterprise build in the standard way, they worked a charm.My environment: Cocos2d 2.0, Box2d, Objective CIn addition to doing the other answers above I finally went to the General tab and made WatchKit Optional.After months and months trying everything here... Definition of insanity... starting Xcode under a new Mac user solved it for me. I removed ~/Library/Developer/* and reinstalled Xcode- so no clue what else to format to make it work.
