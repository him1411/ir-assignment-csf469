I am porting some code to Parallel.ForEach and got an error with a continue I have in the code. Is there something equivalent I can use in a Parallel.ForEach functionally equivalent to continue in a foreach loop?(the body is just a function called for each item)When you converted your loop into a compatible definition for the Parallel.Foreach logic, you ended up making the statement body a lambda. Well, that is an action that gets called by the Parallel function.So, replace continue with return, and break with Stop() or Break() statements.
