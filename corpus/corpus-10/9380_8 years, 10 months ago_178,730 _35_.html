I would like to customize the background (and maybe the border too) of all of the UITableViewCells within my UITableView. So far I have not been able to customize this stuff, so I have a bunch of white background cells which is the default.Is there a way to do this with the iPhone SDK?You need to set the backgroundColor of the cell\'s contentView to your color. If you use accessories (such as disclosure arrows, etc), they\'ll show up as white, so you may need to roll custom versions of those.Here is the most efficient way I have come across to solve this problem, use the willDisplayCell delegate method (this takes care of the white color for the text label background as well when using cell.textLabel.text and/or cell.detailTextLabel.text):When this delegate method is called the color of the cell is controlled via the cell rather than the table view, as when you use:So within the body of the cell delegate method add the following code to alternate colors of cells or just use the function call to make all the cells of the table the same color.This solution worked well in my circumstance...This is really simple, since OS 3.0 just set the background color of the cell in the willDisplayCell method.\nYou must not set the color in the cellForRowAtIndexPath.This works for both the plain and grouped style :Code:P.S: Here the documentation extract for willDisplayCell :"A table view sends this message to\n  its delegate just before it uses cell\n  to draw a row, thereby permitting the\n  delegate to customize the cell object\n  before it is displayed. This method\n  gives the delegate a chance to\n  override state-based properties set\n  earlier by the table view, such as\n  selection and background color. After\n  the delegate returns, the table view\n  sets only the alpha and frame\n  properties, and then only when\n  animating rows as they slide in or\n  out."I\'ve found this information in this post from colionel. Thank him!The best approach I\'ve found so far is to set a background view of the cell and clear background of cell subviews. Of course, this looks nice on tables with indexed style only, no matter with or without accessories.  Here is a sample where cell\'s background is panted yellow:  Simply put this in you UITableView delegate class file (.m):I concur with Seba,\n   I tried to set my alternating row color in the rowForIndexPath delegate method but was getting inconsistent results between 3.2 and 4.2. The following worked great for me.After trying out all different solutions, the following method is the most elegant one.\nChange the color in the following delegate method:vlado.grigorov has some good advice - the best way is to create a backgroundView, and give that a colour, setting everything else to the clearColor.  Also, I think that way is the only way to correctly clear the colour (try his sample - but set \'clearColor\' instead of \'yellowColor\'), which is what I was trying to do.Customizing the background of a table view cell eventually becomes and "all or nothing" approach. It\'s very difficult to change the color or image used for the background of a content cell in a way that doesn\'t look strange.The reason is that the cell actually spans the width of the view. The rounded corners are just part of its drawing style and the content view sits in this area.If you change the color of the content cell you will end up with white bits visible at the corners. If you change the color of the entire cell, you will have a block of color spanning the width of the view.You can definitely customize a cell, but it\'s not quite as easy as you may think at first.Create a view and set this as background view of the cellCreate an image to use as background with photoshop or gimp and name it myimage\nThen add this method to your tableViewController classThis will work also if you have set the UITableView to custom in attribute inspectorMy solution is to add the following code to the cellForRowAtIndexPath event:Works under any circumstance even with disclosure buttons and is better for your logic to act on cells color state in cellForRowAtIndexPath than in cellWillShow event I think.To extend on N.Berendt\'s answer - If you want to set cell color based on some state in the actual cell data object, at the time you are configuring the rest of the information for the table cell, which is typically when you are in the cellForRowAtIndexPath method, you can do this by overriding the willDisplayCell method to set the cell background color from the content view background color - this gets around the issue of the disclosure button backgrounds etc. not being right but still lets you control color in the cellForRowAtIndexPath method where you are doing all of your other cell customisation.So: \nIf you add this method to your table view delegate:Then in your cellForRowAtIndexPath method you can do:This saves having to retrieve your data objects again in the willDisplayCell method and also saves having two places where you do tailoring/customisation of your table cell - all customisation can go in the cellForRowAtIndexPath method.Subclass UITableViewCell and add this in the implementation:This will work on latest XCodesTry this:
