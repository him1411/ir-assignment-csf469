I\'m trying to determine what instances of sql server/sql express I have installed (either manually or programmatically) but all of the examples are telling me to run a SQL query to determine this which assumes I\'m already connected to a particular instance.At a command line:or (Note: must be a capital L)This will list all the sql servers installed on your network.  There are configuration options you can set to prevent a SQL Server from showing in the list.  To do this...At command line:In the enabled protocols list, select \'TCP/IP\', then click properties.  There is a check box for \'Hide server\'.You could query this registry value to get the SQL version directly:Alternatively  you can query your instance name and then use sqlcmd with your instance name that you would like: To see your instance name:Then execute this:If you are using C++ you can use this code to get the registry information.All of the instances installed should show up in the Services Snap-In in the Microsoft Management Console.  To get the instance names, go to Start | Run | type Services.msc and look for all entries with "Sql Server (Instance Name)".-- T-SQL Query to find list of Instances Installed on a machineIf you just want to see what\'s installed on the machine you\'re currently logged in to, I think the most straightforward manual process is to just open the SQL Server Configuration Manager (from the Start menu), which displays all the SQL Services (and only SQL services) on that hardware (running or not).  This assumes SQL Server 2005, or greater; dotnetengineer\'s recommendation to use the Services Management Console will show you all services, and should always be available (if you\'re running earlier versions of SQL Server, for example).If you\'re looking for a broader discovery process, however, you might consider third party tools such as SQLRecon and SQLPing, which will scan your network and build a report of all SQL Service instances found on any server to which they have access.  It\'s been a while since I\'ve used tools like this, but I was surprised at what they found (namely, a handful of instances that I didn\'t know existed).  YMMV.  You might Google for details, but I believe this page has the relevant downloads: http://www.sqlsecurity.com/Tools/FreeTools/tabid/65/Default.aspxI know this thread is a bit old, but I came across this thread before I found the answer I was looking for and thought I\'d share.  If you are using SQLExpress (or localdb) there is a simpler way to find your instance names.\nAt a command line type:This will list the instance names you have installed locally.  So your full server name should include (localdb)\\ in front of the instance name to connect.  Also, sqllocaldb allows you to create new instances or delete them as well as configure them.  See: SqlLocalDB Utility.SQL Server Browser Service http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181087.aspxSQL Server permits applications to find SQL Server instances within the current network. The SqlDataSourceEnumerator class exposes this information to the application developer, providing a DataTable containing information about all the visible servers. This returned table contains a list of server instances available on the network that matches the list provided when a user attempts to create a new connection, and expands the drop-down list containing all the available servers on the Connection Properties dialog box. The results displayed are not always complete.\nIn order to retrieve the table containing information about the available SQL Server instances, you must first retrieve an enumerator, using the shared/static Instance property:from msdn http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/a6t1z9x2(v=vs.80).aspxIf you are interested in determining this in a script, you can try the following:Note: grep is part of gnuwin32 toolsI had the same problem. The "osql -L" command displayed only a list of servers but without instance names (only the instance of my local SQL Sever was displayed).\nWith Wireshark, sqlbrowser.exe (which can by found in the shared folder of your SQL installation) I found a solution for my problem.The local instance is resolved by registry entry. The remote instances are resolved by UDP broadcast (port 1434) and SMB.\nUse "sqlbrowser.exe -c" to list the requests.My configuration uses 1 physical and 3 virtual network adapters. \nIf I used the "osql -L" command the sqlbrowser displayed a request from one of the virtual adaptors (which is in another network segment), instead of the physical one.\nosql selects the adpater by its metric. You can see the metric with command "route print".\nFor my configuration the routing table showed a lower metric for teh virtual adapter then for the physical. So I changed the interface metric in the network properties by deselecting automatic metric in the advanced network settings.\nosql now uses the physical adapter.From Windows command-line, type:Where "server_name" is the name of any remote server on which you wish to display the SQL instances.This requires enough permissions of course.This query should get you the server name and instance name : I had this same issue when I was assessing 100+ servers, I had a script written in C# to browse the service names consist of SQL. When instances installed on the server, SQL Server adds a service for each instance with service name. It may vary for different versions like 2000 to 2008 but for sure there is a service with instance name. I take the service name and obtain instance name from the service name. Here is the sample code used with WMI Query Result:If your within SSMS you might find it easier to use:I just installed Sql server 2008, but i was unable to connect to any database instances.\nThe commands @G Mastros posted listed no active instances.So i looked in services and found that the SQL server agent was disabled. I fixed it by setting it to automatic and then starting it.Here is a simple method:\ngo to \nStart then\nPrograms then \nMicrosoft SQL Server 2005 then\nConfiguration Tools then\nSQL Server Configuration Manager then\nSQL Server 2005 Network Configuration then\nHere you can locate all the instance installed onto your machine.I know its an old post but I found a nice solution with PoweShell where you can find SQL instances installed on local or a remote machine including the version and also be extend get other properties.
