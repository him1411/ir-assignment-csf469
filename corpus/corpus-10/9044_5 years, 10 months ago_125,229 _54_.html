Could any body explain, when to use I have a  requirement, where I need to set a value in a controller one, that controller will redirect to Controller Two and Controller Two will render the View.I have tried to use ViewBag, the value gets lost by the time I reach Controller Two.Can I know when to use and advantages or disadvantages? Thanks1)TempData Allows you to store data that will survive for a redirect. Internally it uses the Session as baking store, it\'s just that after the redirect is made the data is automatically evicted. The pattern is the following:2)ViewBag, ViewDataAllows you to store data in a controller action that will be used in the corresponding view. This assumes that the action returns a view and doesn\'t redirect. Lives only during the current request. The pattern is the following:and in the view:or with ViewData:and in the view:ViewBag is just a dynamic wrapper around ViewData and exists only in ASP.NET MVC 3.This being said, none of those two constructs should ever be used. You should use view models and strongly typed views. So the correct pattern is the following:View model:Action:Strongly typed view:After this brief introduction let\'s answer your question:My requirement is I want to set a value in a controller one, that\n  controller will redirect to ControllerTwo and Controller2 will render\n  the View.and the corresponding view (~/Views/Two/Index.cshtml):There are drawbacks of using TempData as well: if the user hits F5 on the target page the data will be lost.Personally I don\'t use TempData neither. It\'s because internally it uses Session and I disable session in my applications. I prefer a more RESTful way to achieve this. Which is: in the first controller action that performs the redirect store the object in your data store and user the generated unique id when redirecting. Then on the target action use this id to fetch back the initially stored object:The view stays the same.ASP.NET MVC offers us three options ViewData, ViewBag, and TempData for passing data from controller to view and in next request. ViewData and ViewBag are almost similar and TempData performs additional responsibility. Lets discuss or get key points on those three objects:Similarities between ViewBag & ViewData :Difference between ViewBag & ViewData:ViewBag & ViewData Example:In View:TempData:TempData is also a dictionary derived from TempDataDictionary class and stored in short lives session and it is a string key and object value. The difference is that the life cycle of the object. TempData keep the information for the time of an HTTP Request. This mean only from one page to another. This also work with a 302/303 redirection because it\xe2\x80\x99s in the same HTTP Request. Helps to maintain data when you move from one controller to other controller or from one action to other action. In other words when you redirect, \xe2\x80\x9cTempData\xe2\x80\x9d helps to maintain data between those redirects. It internally uses session variables. Temp data use during the current and subsequent request only means it is use when you are sure that next request will be redirecting to next view. It requires typecasting for complex data type and check for null values to avoid error. Generally used to store only one time messages like error messages, validation messages.The last mechanism is the Session which work like the ViewData, like a Dictionary that take a string for key and object for value. This one is stored into the client Cookie and can be used for a much more long time. It also need more verification to never have any confidential information. Regarding ViewData or ViewBag you should use it intelligently for application performance. Because each action goes through the whole life cycle of regular asp.net mvc request. You can use ViewData/ViewBag in your child action but be careful that you are not using it to populate the unrelated data which can pollute your controller.Basically it\'s like a DataReader, once read, data will be lost.If you pay attention to the above code, RedirectToAction has no impact over the TempData until TempData is read. So, once TempData is read, values will be lost. Check the output in Action Method Test 1 and Test 2If you pay attention to the above code, data is not lost after RedirectToAction as well as after Reading the Data and the reason is, We are using TempData.Keep().  is that The Data will persist to the corresponding ViewViewBag, ViewData, TempData and View State in MVChttp://royalarun.blogspot.in/2013/08/viewbag-viewdata-tempdata-and-view.htmlASP.NET MVC offers us three options ViewData, VieBag and TempData for passing data from controller to view and in next request. ViewData and ViewBag are almost similar and TempData performs additional responsibility. Similarities between ViewBag & ViewData :Helps to maintain data when you move from controller to view. Used to\n  pass data from controller to corresponding view. Short life means\n  value becomes null when redirection occurs. This is because their goal\n  is to provide a way to communicate between controllers and views. It\xe2\x80\x99s\n  a communication mechanism within the server call.Difference between ViewBag & ViewData:ViewData is a dictionary of objects that is derived from\n  ViewDataDictionary class and accessible using strings as keys. ViewBag\n  is a dynamic property that takes advantage of the new dynamic features\n  in C# 4.0. ViewData requires typecasting for complex data type and\n  check for null values to avoid error. ViewBag doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require\n  typecasting for complex data type.ViewBag & ViewData Example:In View, we call like below:TempData:Helps to maintain data when you move from one controller to other\n  controller or from one action to other action. In other words when you\n  redirect, \xe2\x80\x9cTempdata\xe2\x80\x9d helps to maintain data between those redirects.\n  It internally uses session variables. TempData is meant to be a very\n  short-lived instance, and you should only use it during the current\n  and the subsequent requests onlyThe only scenario where using TempData will reliably work is when you are redirecting. This is because a redirect kills the current request (and sends HTTP status code 302 Object Moved to the client), then creates a new request on the server to serve the redirected view.It requires typecasting for complex data type and check for null values to avoid error.TempData in Asp.Net MVC is one of the very useful feature. It is used to pass data from current request to subsequent request. In other words if we want to send data from one page to another page while redirection occurs, we can use TempData, but we need to do some consideration in code to achieve this feature in MVC. Because the life of TempData is very short and lies only till the target view is fully loaded. But, we can use Keep() method to persist data in TempData.Read MoreTempData \nwill be always available until first read, once you read it its not available any more can be useful to pass quick message also to view that will be gone after first read.\nViewBag\nIts more useful when passing quickly piece of data to the view, normally you should pass all data to the view through model , but there is cases when you model coming direct from class that is map into database like entity framework\nin that case you don\'t what to change you model to pass a new piece of data, you can stick that into the viewbag \nViewData is just indexed version of ViewBag and was used before MVC3 Also the scope is different between viewbag and temptdata. viewbag is based on first view (not shared between action methods) but temptdata can be shared between an action method and just one another.
