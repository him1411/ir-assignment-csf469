I am trying to show / hide some HTML using the ng-show and ng-hide functions provided by AngularJS.According to the documentation, the respective usage for these functions are as follows:ngHide \xe2\x80\x93 {expression} - If the expression truthy then the element is shown or hidden respectively.\n  ngShow \xe2\x80\x93 {expression} - If the expression is truthy then the element is shown or hidden respectively.This works for the following usecase:However, should we use a parameter from an object as the expression then the ng-hide and ng-show are given the correct true/false value but the values are not treated as a boolean so always return false:SourceResultThis is either a bug or I am not doing this correctly.I cannot find any relative information on referencing object parameters as expressions so I was hoping anyone with a better understanding of AngularJS might be able to help me out?The foo.bar reference should not contain the braces:Angular expressions need to be within the curly-brace bindings, where as Angular directives do not.See also Understanding Angular Templates.You can\'t use {{}} when using angular directives for binding with ng-model but for binding non-angular attributes you would have to use {{}}..Eg: Try wrapping expression with:  Since ng-show is an angular attribute i think, we don\'t need to put the evaluation flower brackets ({{}})..For attributes like class we need to encapsulate the variables with evaluation flower brackets ({{}}).If you want to show/hide an element based on the status of one {{expression}} you can use ng-switch:The paragraph will be displayed when foo.bar is true, hidden when false.remove {{}} braces around foo.bar because angular expressions cannot be used in angular directives.For More: https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngShowexample
