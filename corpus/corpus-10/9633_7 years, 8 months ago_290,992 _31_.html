How to get the current username in Windows Powershell?Found it:There is also:$env:username is the easiest wayI\'d like to throw in the whoami command, which basically is a nice alias for doing %USERDOMAIN%\\%USERNAME% as proposed in other answers.I thought it would be valuable to summarize and compare the given answers.From @Thomas Bratt:From @Eoin:From @galaktor:From @Mark Seemann(and not the name of the user running the PowerShell instance)From @Twon of An on this other forum@Kevin Panko\'s comment on @Mark Seemann\'s answer deals with choosing one of the categories over the other: [The windows access token approach] is the most secure answer because $env:USERNAME can be altered by the user, but this will not be fooled by doing that.In short, the environment variable option is more succinct, and the windows access token option is more dependable. I\'ve had to use @Mark Seemann\'s windows access token approach in a PowerShell script that I was running from a C# application with impersonation. The C# application is run with my user account, and it runs the powershell script as a service account. Because of a limitation of the way I\'m running the PowerShell script from C#, the PowerShell instance uses my user account\'s environment variables, even though it is run as the service account user. In this setup, the environment variable options return my account name, and the windows access token option returns the service account name (which is what I wanted), and the logged in user option returns my account name. Also, if it helps, I used this script to run a script as another user. You need to use the Get-Credential cmdlet to get a credential object, and then run this script with the script to run as another user as argument 1, and the credential object as argument 2. Usage:Run-AsUser.ps1:[Environment]::UserName returns just the user name. E.g. bob\n[System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent().Name returns the user name, prefixed by its domain where appropriate. E.g. SOMEWHERENICE\\bobJust building on the work of others here:And thank you for the info as I like getting the data simply and from an authoritative source.I have used $env:username in the past, but a colleague pointed out, it\'s an environment variable and can be changed by the user and therefore, if you really want to get the current user\'s username, you shouldn\'t trust it.I\'d upvote Mark Seemann\'s answer:but I\'m not allowed to. With Mark\'s answer, if you need just the username, you may have to parse it out since on my system, it returns hostname\\username and on domain joined machines with domain accounts it will return domain\\username.I would not use whoami.exe since it\'s not present on all versions of Windows and it\'s a call out to another binary and may give some security teams fits.If you\'re used to batch, you can callThis basically steals the output from what you would get if you had a batch file with just "echo %username%".I didn\'t see any add-type based examples, here is one utilizing the GetUserName directly from advapi32.dll.  In my case, I needed to retrieve the username to enable the script to change the path, ie. c:\\users\\%username%\\.  I needed to start the script by changing the path to the users desktop. I was able to do this, with help from above and elsewhere, by using the get-location applet.You may have another, or even better way to do it, but this worked for me:
