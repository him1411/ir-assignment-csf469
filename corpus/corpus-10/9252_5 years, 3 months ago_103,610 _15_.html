The Include() method works quite well for Lists on objects. But what if I need to go two levels deep? For example, the method below will return ApplicationServers with the included properties shown here. However, ApplicationsWithOverrideGroup is another container that holds other complex objects. Can I do an Include() on that property as well? Or how can I get that property to fully load?As it stands now, this method:Will populate only the Enabled property (below) and not the Application or CustomVariableGroup properties (below). How do I make this happen?For EF 6See Remarks for more examples.Make sure to add using System.Data.Entity; to get the version of Include that takes in a lambda.If you are using EF Core you can use the new method ThenIncludeIf I understand you correctly you are asking about including nested properties. If so :ororUsing "ThenInclude" to load mutiple levels:\nFor example:I made a little Helper for Entity Framework 6 (.Net core style), to include sub-entities in a nice way.It is on Nuget now : Install-Package ThenInclude.EF6I also had to use multiple includes and at 3rd level I needed multiple properties This may help someone :)
