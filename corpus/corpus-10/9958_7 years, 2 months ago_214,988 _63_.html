Is it possible to make the ListView horizontally? I have done this Using gallery view, but the selected item comes to the center of the screen automatically. I don\'t want the selected item at the same spot I clicked. How can I Rectify this Problem? My Idea was to set the ListView with horizontal scroll. Share your idea?As per Android Documentation RecyclerView is the new way to organize the items in listview and to be displayed horizontallyAdvantages:More Information about RecyclerView:Sample:survivingwithandroid.comJust add the below block to make the ListView to horizontal from verticalCode-snippetPaul doesn\'t bother to fix bugs of his library or accept users fixes. That\'s why I am suggesting another library which has similar functionality: https://github.com/sephiroth74/HorizontalVariableListViewUpdate: on Jul 24, 2013 author (sephiroth74) released completely rewritten version based on code of android 4.2.2 ListView. I must say that it doesn\'t have all the errors which previous version had and works great!@Paul answer links to a great solution, but the code doesn\'t allow to use onClickListeners on items children (the callback functions are never called). I\'ve been struggling for a while to find a solution and I\'ve decided to post here what you need to modify in that code (in case somebody need it).Instead of overriding dispatchTouchEvent override onTouchEvent. Use the same code of dispatchTouchEvent and delete the method (you can read the difference between the two here http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/ui-events.html#EventHandlers )Then, add the following code which will decide to steal the event from the item children and give it to our onTouchEvent, or let it be handled by them.Finally, don\'t forget to declare the variables in your class:This is a little (very) late, but I\'m posting this in case someone comes by this later.The Support Library as of the Android L preview has a RecyclerView that does exactly what you want.Right now, you can only get it through the L preview SDK and you need to set your minSdk to L. But you can copy all of the necessary files into your project and use them that way until L is officially out.You can download the preview docs here.Warning: The API for Recycler View may change and it may have bugs.UpdatedThe source code for horizontal listview is:Since Google introduced Android Support Library v7 21.0.0, you can use RecyclerView to scroll items horizontally. The RecyclerView widget is a more advanced and flexible version of ListView.To use RecyclerView, just add dependency:Here is a sample:More info about RecyclerView:Download the jar file from herenow put it into your libs folder, right click it and select \'Add as library\' now in main.xml put this codenow in Activity class if you want Horizontal Listview with images then put this codeIts actually very simple:\nsimply Rotate the list view to lay on its sidemlistView.setRotation(-90);Then upon inflating the children, that should be inside the getView method. you rotate the children  to stand up straight: Edit: \nif your  ListView doesnt fit properly after rotation, place the ListView inside this RotateLayout like this:My solution is to simply use ViewPager widget. It isn\'t center-locked as Gallery and has a built-in features for recycling views (as ListView). You may see similar approach at Google Play app, whenever you deal with horizontally scrollable lists.You just need to extend PagerAdapter and perform a couple of tweaks there:As result, you\'ll have horizontally scrollable widget with adapter, like this:\nYou can use RecyclerView in the support library. RecyclerView is a generalized version of ListView that supports:Android Recycler View DocsThis isn\'t much of an answer, but how about using a Horizontal Scroll View?I have developed a logic to do it without using any external horizontal scrollview library, here is the horizontal view that I achieved and I have posted my answer here:https://stackoverflow.com/a/33301582/5479863My json response is this: Layout file :class file:trick that is working here is the id that I have assigned to ImageView "imgView.setId(v)" and after that applying onClickListener to that I am again fetching the id of the view....I have also commented inside the code so that its easy to understand, \nI hope this may be very useful...\nHappy Coding... :)I\'ve done a lot of searching for a solution to this problem.  The short answer is, there is no good solution, without overriding private methods and that sort of thing.  The best thing I found was to implement it myself from scratch by extending AdapterView.  It\'s pretty miserable.  See my SO question about horizontal ListViews.I had to do the same for one of my projects and I ended up writing my own as well. I called it HorzListView is now part of my open source Aniqroid library. http://aniqroid.sileria.com/doc/api/  (Look for downloads at the bottom or use google code project to see more download options: http://code.google.com/p/aniqroid/downloads/list)The class documentation is here: http://aniqroid.sileria.com/doc/api/com/sileria/android/view/HorzListView.htmlwell you can always create your textviews etc dynamically and set your onclicklisteners like you would do with an adapterHorizontialListView can\'t work when the data in the adapter is involved in another thread. Everything runs 100% on UI thread.This is a big problem in multithread.  I think using HorizontialListView is not the best solution for your problem.HorzListView is a better way.You   just replace your previous Gallery with HorzListView.You neednot modify the code about the adapter.Then everything goes the way you hope.See https://stackoverflow.com/a/12339708/1525777 about HorzListView.I had used  horizontal listview link in my project & I got good results. I had been used devsmart library initially but it gave me some issues. So best way to use horizontal listview link as it recovered my issues & also I recently launched my app on Google PlayStore using this library & got nice response from users. So I recommend you to use the same library which I mentioned above to show listview horizontally. Enjoy :)For my application, I use a HorizontalScrollView containing LinearLayout inside, which has orientation set to horizontal. In order to add images inside, I create ImageViews inside the activity and add them to my LinearLayout. For example:An this works perfectly fine for me. In the activity all I have to do is something like the code below:As I said that works for me, and I hope it helps somebody looking to achieve this as well.There is a great library for that, called TwoWayView, it\'s very easy to implement, just include the project library into your work space and add it as a library project to your original project, and then follow the following steps which are originally mentioned here:First, let\'s add a style indicating the orientation of the ListView\n  (horizontal or vertical) in (res/values/styles.xml):Then,In your Layout XML, use the following code to add the TwoWayView:and finally, just declare it and deal with it like any regular ListView:All the methods of ListView will work here as usual, but there is only one difference I noticed, which is when setting the choice mode, the method setChoiceMode not takes an int value but a value from enum called ChoiceMode, so list_view.setChoiceMode(ListView.CHOICE_MODE_SINGLE); will be lvTest.setChoiceMode(ChoiceMode.SINGLE); // or MULTIPLE or NONE.You may use ViewFlipper to include the layout XML and add images , listview for each layout XML
