Can someone please explain what the partition by keyword does and give a simple example of it in action, as well as why one would want to use it?  I have a SQL query written by someone else and I\'m trying to figure out what it does.An example of partition by:The examples I\'ve seen online seem a bit too in-depth.The PARTITION BY clause sets the range of records that will be used for each "GROUP" within the OVER clause.In your example SQL, DEPT_COUNT will return the number of employees within that department for every employee record.  (It is as if your de-nomalising the emp table; you still return every record in the emp table.)If there was another column (e.g., state) then you could count how many departments in that State.It is like getting the results of a GROUP BY (SUM, AVG, etc.) without the aggregation of the result set.It is useful when you use the LAST OVER or MIN OVER functions to get, for example, the lowest and highest salary in the department and then use that in a calulation against this records salary without a sub select, which is much faster.Read the linked AskTom article for further details. The concept is very well explained by the accepted answer, but I find that the more example one sees, the better it sinks in. Here\'s an incremental example:1) Boss says "get me number of items we have in stock grouped by brand"You say: "no problem"Result:2) The boss says "Now get me a list of all items, with their brand AND number of items that have that brand"You may try:But you get:This is where the OVER (PARTITION BY BRAND) comes in:Whic means:And the result is:etc...It is the SQL extension called analytics.  The "over" in the select statement tells oracle that the function is a analytical function, not a group by function.  The advantage to using analytics is that you can collect sums, counts, and a lot more with just one pass through of the data instead of looping through the data with sub selects or worse, PL/SQL.  It does look confusing at first but this will be second nature quickly.  No one explains it better then Tom Kyte.  So the link above is great.Of course, reading the documentation is a must.Here we are getting count for respective deptno.\nAs for deptno 10 we have 4 records in table emp similar results for deptno 20 and 30 also.the over partition keyword is as if we are partitioning the data by  client_id\ncreation a subset of each client idthis query will return the number of operations done by the client_id
