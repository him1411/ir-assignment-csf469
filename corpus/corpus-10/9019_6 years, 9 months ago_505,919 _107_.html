I am getting the following error when I try to connect to mysql: Can\'t connect to local MySQL server through socket \'/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock\' (2)Is there a solution for this error? What might be the reason behind it?Are you connecting to "localhost" or "127.0.0.1" ? I noticed that when you connect to "localhost" the socket connector is used, but when you connect to "127.0.0.1" the TCP/IP connector is used. You could try using "127.0.0.1" if the socket connector is not enabled/working.Ensure that your mysql service is runningThen, try the one of the following following:(if you have not set password for mysql)if you have set password alreadyIf your file my.cnf (usually in the etc folder) is correctly configured withyou can check if mysql is running with the following command:try changing your permission to mysql folder. If you are working locally, you can try:that solved it for meThe MySQL server is not running, or that is not the location of its socket file (check my.cnf).Most likely mysql.sock does not exist in /var/lib/mysql/.If you find the same file in another location then symlink it:For ex: I have it in /data/mysql_datadir/mysql.sockSwitch user to mysql and execute as mentioned below:That solved my problemIn my case I have moved socket file to another location inside /etc/my.cnf \nfrom /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock to /tmp/mysql.sockEven after restarting the mysqld service, I still see the error message when I try to connect.\nERROR 2002 (HY000): Can\'t connect to local MySQL server through socket \'/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock\' (2)The problem is with the way that the client is configured. Running diagnostics will actually show the correct socket path. eg ps aux | grep mysqldWorks:Does not Work:You can fix this problem by adding the same socket line under [client] section inside mysql config.If you are on a recent RHEL, you may need to start mariadb (an open source mysql db) instead of the mysql db:You should then be able to access mysql in the usual fashion:Make sure you have enough space left in /var. If Mysql demon is not able to write additional info to the drive the mysql server won\'t start and it leads to the error Can\'t connect to local MySQL server through socket \'/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock\' (2)Consider using This will help you keep disk usage down.Check if your mysqld service is running or not, if not run, start the service.If your problem isn\'t solved, look for /etc/my.cnf and modify as following, where you see a line starting with socket. Take a backup of that file before doing this update.  Change toJust edit /etc/my.cnf\nAdd following lines to my.cnfRestart mysql and connect again mysql -u user -p password database -h host;Here\'s what worked for me:Please check whether another mysql service is running.MariaDB, a community developed fork of MySQL, has become the default implementation of MySQL in many distributions.So first you should start,If this fails rather try,Then to start mysql,As of today, in Fedora the package is named mariadb\nAnd in Ubuntu it is called mariadb-server.So you may have to install it if its not already installed in your system.If your mysql was previously working and has stopped suddenly just "reboot" the server.Was facing this issue on my CentOS VPS.->Was constantly getting Can\'t connect to local MySQL server through socket \'/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock\'(2)Tried all techniques, finally restarting the server fixed the issues ->shutdown -r nowHope this helps !!tryMake sure you started the server:Then connect with root user:First enter "service mysqld start" and loginPlease ensure you have installed MySQL server correctly, I met this error many times and I think it\'s complicated to debug from the socket, I mean it might be easier to reinstall it.If you are using CentOS 7, here is the correct way to install it:First of all, add the mysql community source\nyum install http://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql-community-release-el7-5.noarch.rpmThen you can install it by yum install mysql-community-serverStart it with systemctl: systemctl start mysqldif you change files in /var/lib/mysql [ like copy or replace that ],  you must set owner of files to mysql this is so important if mariadb.service restart has been faildchown -R mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql/*chmod -R 700 /var/lib/mysql/*My problem was that I installed mysql successfully and it worked fine.But one day, the same error occurred.Can\'t connect to local MySQL server through socket \'/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock\' (2)And no mysql.sock file existed.This sollution solved my problem and mysql was up and running again:Log in as root:Run:Test as root:mysql should now be up and running.I hope this can help someone else as well.Note that while mysql reads the info of the location of the socketfile from the my.cnf file, the mysql_secure_installation program seems to not do that correctly at times.So if you are like me and shuffle things around at installationtime you might get into the situation where you can connect to the database with mysql just fine, but the thing can not be secured (not using that script anyway).To fix this the suggestion from sreddy works well: make a softlink from where the script would expect the socket to where it actually is. Example:(I use /tmp/ as a default location for sockets)One way to reproduce this error:  If you meant to connect to a foreign server but instead connect to the non existent local one: So you have to specify the host like this:ran into this issue while trying to connect mysql in SSH client, found adding the socket path to the command helpful when switching between sockets is necessary.It worked for me with the following changesWhatever path for socket is mentioned in [mysqld] and same in [client] in my.cnf and restart mysql[mysqld]\nsocket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock [client]\nsocket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sockThis is a problem if you are running out of disk space.\nSolution is to free some space from the HDD.Please read more to have the explanation :If you are running MySQL at LINUX check the free space of HDD with the command disk free :if you are getting something like that :Then this is the problem and now you have the solution!Since mysql.sock wants to be created at the mysql folder which is almost always under the root folder could not achieve it because lack of space.If you are periodicaly give the ls command under the mysql directory (at openSUSE 11.1 is at /var/lib/mysql) you will get something like :The mysql.sock file appearing and disappearing often (you must to try allot with the ls to hit a instance with the mysql.sock file on folder).This caused by not enough disk space.I hope that i will help some people!!!!\nThanks!I had to disable explicit_defaults_for_timestamp from my.cnf.Try first 2, 3 solutions. Error is stil popup & If you can not find /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock Check the space available in /var/ If the directory is full remove some unusefull files/directoriesProbably your issue will sorted now.If you are in the shell of sf.net, try:Change {LETTER} and {GROUP ID} as shown in your MySQL Database of project admin profile.This might be a stupid suggestion but make 100% sure your DB is still hosted at localhost. For example, if a Network Admin chose (or changed to) Amazon DB hosting, you will need that hostname instead!Just rain into the same problem -- and here\'s how I addressed it.Assuming mysqld is running, then the problem might just be the mysql client not knowing where to look for the socket file.The most straightforward way to address this consists in adding the following line to your user\'s profile .my.cnf file (on linux that\'s usually under /home/myusername):If you don\'t have a .my.cnf file there, then create one containing the following:In my case, since I moved the mysql default data folder (/var/lib/mysql) in a different location (/data/mysql), I added to .my.cnf the following:Hope this helps.
