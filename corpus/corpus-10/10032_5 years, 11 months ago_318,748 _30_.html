I am trying to get the certificate of a remote server, which I can then use to add to my keystore and use within my java application.A senior dev (who is on holidays :(  ) informed me I can run this:To get a raw certificate dumped out, which I can then copy and export. I receive the following output:I have also tried with this optionand this one (running on debian mind you)But get the same error.This source says I can use that CApath flag but it doesn\'t seem to help. I tried multiple paths to no avail.Please let me know where I\'m going wrong.The server certificate is the first certificate returned, and will be PEM formatted. The CA certificate is the final certificate returned, and is also PEM formatted.I tested that against a self-signed certificate using OpenSSL 1.0.0e and it worked perfectly.If the remote server is using SNI (that is, sharing multiple SSL hosts on a single IP address) you will also need to send the correct hostname in order to get the right certificate.To view the full details of a site\'s cert you can use this chain of commands as well:While I agree with Ari\'s answer (and upvoted it :), I needed to do an extra step to get it to work with Java on Windows (where it needed to be deployed):Before adding the openssl x509 -outform DER conversion, I was getting an error from keytool on Windows complaining about the certificate\'s format.  Importing the .der file worked fine.It turns out there is more complexity here: I needed to provide many more details to get this rolling. I think its something to do with the fact that its a connection that needs client authentication, and the hankshake needed more info to continue to the stage where the certificates were dumped.Here is my working command:Hopefully this is a nudge in the right direction for anyone who could do with some more info. The easiest command line for this, which includes the PEM output to add it to the keystore, as well as a human readable output and also supports SNI, which is important if you are working with an HTTP server is:The -servername option is to enable SNI support and the openssl x509 -text prints the certificate in human readable format.To get the certificate of remote server you can use openssl tool and you can find it between BEGIN CERTIFICATE and END CERTIFICATE which you need to copy and paste into your certificate file (CRT).Here is the command demonstrating it:To return all certificates from the chain, just add g (global) like:Then you can simply import your certificate file (file.crt) into your keychain and make it trusted, so Java shouldn\'t complain.On OS X you can double-click on the file or drag and drop in your Keychain Access, so it\'ll appear in login/Certificates. Then double-click on the imported certificated and make it Always Trust for SSL.On CentOS 5 you can append them into /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt file (and run: sudo update-ca-trust force-enable), or in CentOS 6 copy them into /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/ and run sudo update-ca-trust extract.In Ubuntu, copy them into /usr/local/share/ca-certificates and run sudo update-ca-certificates.For the benefit of others like me who tried to follow the good advice here when accessing AWS CloudFront but failed, the trick is to add -servername domain.name...Source: https://serverfault.com/a/780450/8972You can get and store the server root certificate using next bash script:Just overwrite required variables.
