Is it possible somehow to return 0 instead of NaN when parsing values in JavaScript?In case of the empty string parseInt returns NaN.Is it possible to do something like that in JavaScript to check for NaN?Or maybe there is another function or jQuery plugin which may do something similar?You can also use the isNaN() function:I was surprised to not see anyone mention using Number().  Granted it will parse decimals if provided, so will act differently than parseInt(), however it already assumes base 10 and will turn "" or even "   " in to 0.For people who are not restricted to parseInt, you can use the bitwise OR operator (which implicitly calls ToInt32 to its operands).Note: ToInt32 is different from parseInt. (i.e. parseInt(\'33Ab\') === 33)Why not override the function? In that case you can always be sure it returns 0 in case of NaN:Now, anywhere in your code:The problemOther answers don\'t take into account that 0 is falsy, and thus the following will be 20 instead of 0:The solutionI propose a helper function, that solves most of the issues:The helper function will give the following results:Do a separate check for an empty string ( as it is one specific case ) and set it to zero in this case.You could appeand "0" to the start, but then you need to add a prefix to indicate that it is a decimal and not an octal numberI had a similar problem (firefox v34) with simple strings like:So I came up with a quick hack of:And then got all stupid complicated to deal with floats + ints for non-simple stuff:It will return 0 for things like:Also this way,  why not write a function and call it where ever required . I\'m assuming it\'s the entry into the form fields to perform calculations.what\'s wrong doing this?
