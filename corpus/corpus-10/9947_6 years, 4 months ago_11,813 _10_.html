I remember when I was using Eclipse that when holding CTRL and using left or right arrows Eclipse would navigate over the LongCamelCaseWrittenWord in several steps. One camel case word at time.So it will go like follows (pipe | represents the actual cursor position):Is there a way how to achieve this in IntelliJ? Currently IntelliJ steps over the whole word at once.Using IntelliJ 9.0Yes, enable Use "CamelHumps" words in Settings | Editor | General | Smart Keys.As answered elsewhere, you can enable Use "CamelHumps" words in Settings | Editor | General | Smart Keys to switch the shortcuts to work with camelCase instead of whole-word.  You can also access the previous behavior by assigning keyboard shortcuts to the appropriate actions under Settings | Appearance & Behavior | Keymap | Editor Actions.  This image shows an example where I access the previous behavior by adding ctrl:You can have both functionalities at the same time:Note that these correspond to Intellij 14, so they might be slightly different in other versions.
