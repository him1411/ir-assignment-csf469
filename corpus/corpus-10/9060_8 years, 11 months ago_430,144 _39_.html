Can somebody remember what was the command to create an empty file in MSDOS using BAT file?DOS has a few special files (devices, actually) that exist in every directory, NUL being the equivalent of UNIX\'s /dev/null: it\'s a magic file that\'s always empty and throws away anything you write to it.  Here\'s a list of some others; CON is occasionally useful as well.To avoid having any output at all, you can use/y prevents copy from asking a question you can\'t see when output goes to NUL.After reading the previous two posts, this blend of the two is what I came up with. It seems a little cleaner. There is no need to worry about redirecting the "1 file(s) copied." message to NUL, like the previous post does, and it looks nice next to the ECHO OutputLineFromLoop >> Emptyfile.txt that will usually follow in a batch file.Techniques I gathered from other answers:Makes a 0 byte file a very clear, backward-compatible way:idea via: anonymous, Danny Backett, possibly others, myself inspired by JdeBP\'s workA 0 byte file another way, it\'s backward-compatible-looking:idea via: JohannesA 0 byte file 3rd way backward-compatible-looking, too:idea via: TheSmurfA 0 byte file the systematic way probably available since Windows 2000:idea via: EmmA 0 bytes file overwriting readonly filesidea via: copyitrightA single newline (2 bytes: 0x0D 0x0A in hex notation, alternatively written as \\r\\n):Note: no space between echo, . and >.idea via: How can you echo a newline in batch files?edit It seems that any invalid command redirected to a file would create an empty file. heh, a feature!\ncompatibility: uknownA 0 bytes file: invalid command/ with a random name (compatibility: uknown):via: great source for random by Hung Huynh edit 2 Andriy M points out the probably most amusing/provoking way to achieve this via invalid commandA 0 bytes file: invalid command/ the funky way (compatibility: unknown)idea via: Andriy MA 0 bytes file 4th-coming way: idea via: foxidrive thanks to comment of Double Gras!REM. > empty.fileIf there\'s a possibility that the to be written file already exists and is read only, use the following code:If no file exists, simply do:To supress any errors that may arise:One more to add to the books - short and sweet to type.You can use a TYPE command instead of COPY.  Try this:Where File1.txt is empty.You can also use SET to create a null byte file as followsOr if you don\'t want to create an extra variable reassign an existing variable likeor like this:The easiest way is:echo. > Filename.txt
