Does anyone know how to change the document root of the Apache server? I basically want localhost to come from /users/spencer/projects directory instead of /var/www.I ended up figuring it out. Some suggested I change the httpd.conf file, but I ended up finding a file in /etc/apache2/sites-available/default and changed the root directory from /var/www to /home/myusername/projects_folder and that worked. You need to change the DocumentRoot setting in your httpd.conf file.  Chances are it will be under something like /etc/apache2/conf/httpd.confUse your favourite editor (I recommend Vim) and look for the DocumentRoot and change it to /users/spencer/projects. Also look a little further down for a setting that looks like this:You will also want to change what is in the quotes to your new directory. This gives Apache access to read from that directory when a user makes a request that call on it.Now restart your apache service (httpd -k restart) and you should be good to go.Edit: Apache2 site config files are now typically kept in /etc/apache2/sites-available/  (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.).Please note, that this only applies for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and newer releases.In my Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, the document root was set to /var/www/html. It was configured in the following file: So just do aand change the following line to what you want:Also do a and find this and change /var/www/html to your preferred directoryand save it.After you saved your changes, just restart the apache2 webserver and you\'ll be done :)I had to edit /etc/apache2/sites-available/default. The lines are the same as mentioned by RDL.This is for Ubunutu 14.04:In file /etc/apache2/apache2.conf it should be as below without the directory name:and in file /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf you should include the custom directory name i.e. www:If not as above it will give you an error when loading the server:\nForbidden  You don\'t have permission to access / on this serverFor apache2 on Linux Mint 17.3 Cinnamon 64-bit the following works:In /etc/apache2/sites-available/ open the 000-default.conf file, and change the Document Root to the absolute path of your directory.sudo vim /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.confIn /etc/apache2/ open httpd.conf, and add a <Directory> tag referencing your directory and containing the exact same settings as the tag for var/www. sudo vim /etc/apache2/apache2.confOn my machine it looked like this:Note: In the first step you probably want to change Document Root in the default-ssl.conf file as well for SSL purposes. But as far as I can tell this isn\'t required to get a general development environment running.I was working with LAMP and To change the Document Root folder i have edited default file which is there in \n/etc/apache2/sites-available folder.\nIf you want to do the same just edit as followsAfter this if you type localhost in browser it will load */home/username/new_root_folder* content.If you couldn\'t find http.conf and followed Nick\'s way. Restart Apache using sudo service apache2 restartIf someone has installed LAMP in the /opt folder then the /etc/apache2 is not what you are looking for.Look for httpd.conf file in /opt/lampp/etc/httpd.conf.Change the line in this folder and save it from terminal.In apache version 2.4.18 (Ubuntu).1.go to this file /etc/apache2/apache2.conf \nsearch for <Directory /var/www/> and replace to your directory ......2.go to /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf\nsearch for DocumentRoot /var/www/html and replace to your DocumentRoot....The right way to change directory or run from multiple directories under different port for apache2 is as follows:For apache2 the configuration files are located under /etc/apache2 and doesnt use a single configuration file as in older versions but is split into smaller configuration files, with /etc/apache2/apache2.conf being the main configuration file. To serve files from a different directory we need a new virtualhost conf file. The virtualhost conf files are located in /etc/apache2/sites-available (do not edit files within sites-enabled). The default apache installation uses virtualhost conf file 000-default.conf.Start by creating a new virtualhost file by copying the default virtualhost file used by the default installation of apache(the one that runs at localhost on port 80). Change into directory /etc/apache2/sites-available and then make copy by sudo cp 000-default.conf example.com.conf, now edit the file by sudo gedit example.com.conf to:I have deleted the non important lines from the above file for brevity.Create the directory from which you want to serve the files, for eg; mkdir example.com and change owner and default group of the directory, for eg if your logged in user name is ubuntu change permissions as sudo chown ubuntu:www-data example.com. This grants full access to the user ubuntu and allows read and execute access to the group www-data.Now edit the apache conf file /etc/apache2/apache2.conf by issuing command sudo gedit apache2.conf and find the line <Directory /var/www/> and below the closing tag </Directory>, add the following below:Now there are two commands to enable or disable the virtualhost configuration files, which are a2ensite and a2dissite respectively. Now since our example.com.conf file uses the same port(80) as used by the default configuration file(000-default.conf), we have to disable the default configuration file by issuing the command sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf and enable our virtualhost conf file by sudo a2ensite example.com.confNow restart or reload the server with command sudo service apache2 restart. Now apache serves files from directory example.com at localhost on default port of 80.The a2ensite command basically creates a symbolic link to the conf file under the site-enabled directoryDo not edit files within sites-enabled(or *-enabled) directoy, as pointed out in this answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/41568701/2532763Now if you need to run the directory on a different port, change the port number from 80 to 8080 by editing the virtualhost file as:and editing /etc/apache2/ports.conf and adding Listen 8080 just below the line Listen 80Now we can enable the default virtualhost conf file that runs on port 80 since example.com directory uses port 8080, as sudo a2ensite 000-default.confNow restart or reload the server with command sudo service apache2 restart. Now both the directories can be accessed from localhost and localhost:8080In RedHat 7.0: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.confI had made the /var/www to be a soft link to the required directory ( eg. /users/username/projects) and things were fine after that.However, naturally, the original /var/www needs to be deleted -- or renamed.If you\'r using Linux Mint (personal opinion, from all distros this one is making me happy), follow this:1- Go to /etc/apache2/sites-available and edit 000-default.conf\n2- Search for DocumentRoot, example DocumentRoot /var/www/html you change to your respective directory;\n3- Open terminal and type: sudo service apache2 restartEDITED-----\nI realize that in Mint you go for /etc/apache2/apache.conf, replace /var/www to your respective path, than restart server (step 3).That\'s it.If you are (like me) finding this post via Google:I found it at /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
