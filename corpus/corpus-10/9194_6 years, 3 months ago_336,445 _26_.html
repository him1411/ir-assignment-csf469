All I am trying to do is to get the current class name, and java appends a useless non-sense $1 to the end of my class name. How can I get rid of it and only return the actual class name?The "$1" is not "useless non-sense". If your class is anonymous, a number is appended.If you don\'t want the class itself, but its declaring class, then you can use getEnclosingClass(). For example:You can move that in some static utility method.But note that this is not the current class name. The anonymous class is different class than its enclosing class. The case is similar for inner classes.Try,This will work as long as you don\'t use it in a static method.Try using\nthis.getClass().getCanonicalName() or this.getClass().getSimpleName().  If it\'s an anonymous class, use this.getClass.getSuperclass.getName()You can use this.getClass().getSimpleName(), like so:this answer is late, but i think there is another way to do this in the context of anonymous handler class.let\'s say:it will achieve the same result. additionally, it\'s actually quite convenience since every class is defined at compile time, so no dynamicity is damaged.above that, if the class is really nested, i.e. A actually is enclosed by B, the class of B can be easily known as:In your example, this probably refers to an anonymous class instance. Java gives a name to those classes by appending a $number to the name of the enclosing class.I\'m assuming this is happening for an anonymous class. When you create an anonymous class you actually create a class that extends the class whose name you got.The "cleaner" way to get the name you want is:If your class is an anonymous inner class, getSuperClass() should give you the class that it was created from. If you created it from an interface than you\'re sort of SOL because the best you can do is getInterfaces() which might give you more than one interface.The "hacky" way is to just get the name with getClassName() and use a regex to drop the $1.The combination of both answers. Also prints a method name:I\'ve found this to work for my code,, however my code is getting the class out of an array within a for loop.Reflection APIsThere are several Reflection APIs which return classes but these may\n  only be accessed if a Class has already been obtained either directly\n  or indirectly.Returns all the public classes, interfaces, and enums that are members\n  of     the class including inherited members.Character contains two member classes Character.Subset and\n  Character.UnicodeBlock.Character.CharacterCache.have an enclosing class.
