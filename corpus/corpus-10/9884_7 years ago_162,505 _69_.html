I have a simple node.js program running on my machine and I want to get local IP address of PC on which is my program running. How do I get it with node.js?os.networkInterfaces as of right now doesn\'t work on windows. Running programs to parse the results seems a bit iffy. Here\'s what I use.This should return your first network interface local ip.https://github.com/indutny/node-ipHere is a snippet of node.js code that will parse the output of ifconfig and (asynchronously) return the first IP address found:(tested on MacOS Snow Leopard only; hope it works on linux too)Usage example:If the second parameter is true, the function will exec a system call every time; otherwise the cached value is used.Returns an array of all local network addresses.Tested on Ubuntu 11.04 and Windows XP 32Any IP of your machine you can find by using the os module - and that\'s native to NodeJSAll you need to do is call os.networkInterfaces() and you\'ll get an easy manageable list - easier than running ifconfig by leagueshttp://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_networkinterfacesBestEdoardoCalling ifconfig is very platform-dependent, and the networking layer does know what ip addresses a socket is on, so best is to ask it.  Node doesn\'t expose a direct method of doing this, but you can open any socket, and ask what local IP address is in use.  For example, opening a socket to www.google.com:Usage case:Your local IP is always 127.0.0.1.Then there is the network IP, which you can get from ifconfig (*nix) or ipconfig (win). This is only useful within the local network.Then there is your external/public IP, which you can only get if you can somehow ask the router for it, or you can setup an external service which returns the client IP address whenever it gets a request. There are also other such services in existence, like whatismyip.com.In some cases (for instance if you have a WAN connection) the network IP and the public IP are the same, and can both be used externally to reach your computer.If your network and public IPs are different, you may need to have your network router forward all incoming connections to your network ip.Update 2013:There\'s a new way of doing this now, you can check the socket object of your connection for a property called localAddress, e.g. net.socket.localAddress. It returns the address on your end of the socket.Easiest way is to just open a random port and listen on it, then get your address and close the socket.Update 2015:The previous doesn\'t work anymore.Here\'s my utility method for getting the local IP address, assuming you are looking for an IPv4 address and the machine only has one real network interface. It could easily be refactored to return an array of IPs for multi-interface machines.The correct one liner for both underscore and lodash is:Install a module called ip like then use this code.use npm ip module Here\'s a simplified version in vanilla javascript to obtain a single ip:for Linux and MacOS uses, if you want to get your IPs by a synchronous way, try this.the result will be something like this.For anyone interested in brevity, here are some "one-liners" that do not require plugins/dependencies that aren\'t part of a standard Node installation:Public IPv4 and IPv6 of eth0 as an Array:First Public IP of eth0 (usually IPv4) as String:Based on a comment above, here\'s what\'s working for the current version of Node:The comment on one of the answers above was missing the call to values(). It looks like os.networkInterfaces() now returns an object instead of an array.Here is a variation of the above examples. It takes care to filter out vMware interfaces etc. If you don\'t pass an index it returns all addresses otherwise you may want to set it default to 0 then just pass null to get all, but you\'ll sort that out. You could also pass in another arg for the regex filter if so inclined to addGoogle directed me to this question while searching for "node.js get server ip", so let\'s give an alternative answer for those who are trying to achieve this in their node.js server program (may be the case of the original poster).In the most trivial case where the server is bound to only one IP address, there should be no need to determine the IP address since we already know to which address we bound it (eg. second parameter passed to the listen() function).In the less trivial case where the server is bound to multiple IPs addresses, we may need to determine the IP address of the interface to which a client connected. And as briefly suggested by Tor Valamo, nowadays, we can easily get this information from the connected socket and its localAddress property.For example, if the program is a web server:And if it\'s a generic TCP server:When running a server program, this solution offers very high portability, accuracy and efficiency.For more details, see:If you\'re into the whole brevity thing, here it is using lodash:Here is a multi-ip version of jhurliman\'s answer above:I realise this is an old thread, but I\'d like to offer an improvement on the top answer for the following reasons:for...in... enumeration should be validated to ensure the object\'s being enumerated over contains the property you\'re looking for. As javsacript is loosely typed and the  for...in... can be handed any arbitory object to handle; it\'s safer to validate the property we\'re looking for is available. hope this helpsHere\'s my variant that allows getting both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in a portable manner:Here\'s a CoffeeScript version of the same function:Example output for console.log(getLocalIPs())Similar to other answers but more succinct:I wrote a Node.js module that determines your local IP address by looking at which network interface contains your default gateway.This is more reliable than picking an interface from os.networkInterfaces() or DNS lookups of the hostname. It is able to ignore VMware virtual interfaces, loopback, and VPN interfaces, and it works on Windows, Linux, Mac OS, and FreeBSD. Under the hood, it executes route.exe or netstat and parses the output.When developing apps on mac os, and want to test it on the phone, and need your app to pick the localhost ip automatically. This is just to mention how you can find out the ip address automatically. \n  To test this you can go to terminal hit output will be your localhost ip Address.I\'m using node.js 0.6.5Here is what I doThe bigger question is "Why?"If you need to know the server on which your NODE is listening on, you can use req.hostname.The accepted answer is asynchronous, I wanted a synchronous version, hope this helps someone.Here\'s a variation that allows you to get local ip address (tested on Mac and Win):
