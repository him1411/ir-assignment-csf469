The below code will not join, when debugged the command does not store the whole path but just the last entry.When I test this it only stores the /new_sandbox/ part of the code.The latter strings shouldn\'t start with a slash. If they start with a slash, then they\'re considered an "absolute path" and everything before them is discarded.Quoting the Python docs for os.path.join:If a component is an absolute path, all previous components are thrown away and joining continues from the absolute path component.Note on Windows, the behaviour in relation to drive letters, which seems to have changed compared to earlier Python versions:On Windows, the drive letter is not reset when an absolute path component (e.g., r\'\\foo\') is encountered. If a component contains a drive letter, all previous components are thrown away and the drive letter is reset. Note that since there is a current directory for each drive, os.path.join("c:", "foo") represents a path relative to the current directory on drive C: (c:foo), not c:\\foo.The idea of os.path.join() is to make your program cross-platform (linux/windows/etc).Even one slash ruins it.So it only makes sense when being used with some kind of a reference point like\nos.environ[\'HOME\'] or os.path.dirname(__file__).os.path.join() can be used in conjunction with os.path.sep to create an absolute rather than relative path.do not use forward slashes at the beginning of path components, except when refering to the root dir:see also: http://docs.python.org/library/os.path.html#os.path.joinIt\'s because your \'/new_sandbox/\' begins with a / and thus is assumed to be relative to the root directory. Remove the leading /.To help understand why this surprising behavior isn\'t entirely terrible, consider an application which accepts a config file name as an argument:If the application is executed with:The config file /etc/myapp.conf/foo.conf will be used.But consider what happens if the application is called with:Then myapp should use the config file at /some/path/bar.conf (and not /etc/myapp.conf/some/path/bar.conf or similar).It may not be great, but I believe this is the motivation for the absolute path behaviour.To make your function more portable, use it as such:orTry with new_sandbox onlydo it like this, without too the extra slashesNote that a similar issue can bite you if you use os.path.join() to include an extension that already includes a dot, which is what happens automatically when you use os.path.splitext(). In this example:Even though extension might be .jpg you end up with a folder named "foobar" rather than a file called "foobar.jpg". To prevent this you need to append the extension separately:
