I have a git repository which tracks an svn repository. I cloned it using --stdlayout.I created a new local branch via git checkout -b foobarNow I want this branch to end up in \xe2\x80\xa6/branches/foobar in the svn repository.How do I go about that?(snipped lots of investigative text. see question history if you care)I know this question has been answered a while ago, but after reading it, I it might help adding examples of the specific git svn branch command and relate it to a typical workflow.Like kch answered, use git svn branch. Here is a full example, (note the -n for dry-run to test):If this goes well, server replies with answer like this:Copying https://scm-server.com/svn/portal/trunk at r8914 to https://scm-server.com/svn/portal/branches/auth_bug...And without the -n switch the server probably adds something like:Found possible branch point: https://scm-server.com/svn/portal/trunk => https://scm-server.com/portal/branches/auth_bug, 8914Found branch parent:\n  (refs/remotes/auth_bug)d731b1fa028d30d685fe260f5bb912cbf59e1971Following parent with do_switchSuccessfully followed parent r8915 = 6ed10c57afcec62e9077fbeed74a326eaa4863b8(refs/remotes/auth_bug)The best part of it, now you can create a local branch based on your remote branch like so:Which means "check out and create local branch named auth_bug and make it follow the remote branch (last parameter) auth_bugTest that your local branch works on that remote branch by using dcommit with --dry-run (-n):And SVN server should reply with the new branch name:Committing to https://scm-server.com/svn/portal/branches/auth_bug ...as of git v1.6.1, git svn branch is available.From the git docs:Previous versions of git do not provide a way to create an svn branch.@kch I just (7 December 2008) compiled the v1.6.1-rc1 tag of git and it does contain the git svn branch command and the documentation for it. So the v1.6.1 release of git should (hopefully) contain this command.
