Is there a way to determine when a Git branch was created? I have a branch in my repo and and I don\'t remember creating it and thought maybe seeing the creation timestamp would jog my memory. UseIf you\xe2\x80\x99d rather see it in context, then useAs ponted out in the comments and in Jackub\'s answer, as long as your branch is younger than the number of days set in the config setting gc.reflogexpire (the default is 90 days), then you can utilize your reflog to find out when a branch reference was first created.Note that git reflog can take most git log flags. Further note that the HEAD@{0} style selectors are effectively notions of time and, in fact, are handled (in a hacked sort of way) as date strings. This means that you can use the flag --date=local and get output like this:It may also be useful at times to use --date=relative:One last note: the --all flag (which is really a git-log flag understood by git-reflog) will show the reflogs for all known refs in refs/ (instead of simply, HEAD) which will show you branch events clearly:First, if you branch was created within gc.reflogexpire days (default 90 days, i.e. around 3 months), you can use git log -g <branch> or git reflog show <branch> to find first entry in reflog, which would be creation event, and looks something like below (for git log -g):You would get who created a branch, how many operations ago, and from which branch (well, it might be just "Created from HEAD", which doesn\'t help much).That is what MikeSep said in his answer.Second, if you have branch for longer than gc.reflogexpire and you have run git gc (or it was run automatically), you would have to find common ancestor with the branch it was created from.  Take a look at config file, perhaps there is branch.<branchname>.merge entry, which would tell you what branch this one is based on.If you know that the branch in question was created off master branch (forking from master branch), for example, you can use the following command to see common ancestor:You can also try git show-branch <branch> master, as an alternative.This is what gbacon said in his response.Pro Git ยง 3.1 Git Branching - What a Branch Is has a good explanation of what a git branch really isA branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to [a] commit.Since a branch is just a lightweight pointer, git has no explicit notion of its history or creation date. "But hang on," I hear you say, "of course git knows my branch history!" Well, sort of.If you run either of the following:you will see what looks like the "history of your branch", but is really a list of commits reachable from \'branch\' that are not reachable from master. This gives you the information you want, but if and only if you have never merged \'branch\' back to master, and have never merged master into \'branch\' since you created it. If you have merged, then this history of differences will collapse.Fortunately the reflog often contains the information you want, as explained in various other answers here. Use this:to show the history of the branch. The last entry in this list is (probably) the point at which you created the branch.If the branch has been deleted then \'branch\' is no longer a valid git identifier, but you can use this instead, which may find what you want:Or in a Windows cmd shell:Note that reflog won\'t work effectively on remote branches, only ones you have worked on locally.I\'m not sure of the git command for it yet, but I think you can find them in the reflogs.My files appear to have a unix timestamp in them.Update: There appears to be an option to use the reflog history instead of the commit history when printing the logs:You can follow this log as well, back to when you created the branch. git log is showing the date of the commit, though, not the date when you made the action that made an entry in the reflog. I haven\'t found that yet except by looking in the actual reflog in the path above.Use:to show all the living cycle of your repository in current folder.\nThe branch name that first appear (from down to up) is the source that was created.That mean: Branch development is created (checkout -b) from masterBranch feature-jira35 is created (checkout -b) from developmentBranch feature-jira-sut-46 is created (checkout -b) from developmentTry thisThis is something that I came up with before I found this thread.
