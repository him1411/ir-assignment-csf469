What do I need to do to save an image my program has generated (possibly from the camera, possibly not) to the system photo library on the iPhone?You can use this function:You only need completionTarget, completionSelector and contextInfo if you want to be notified when the UIImage is done saving, otherwise you can pass in nil.See the official documentation for UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum().Deprecated in iOS 9.0.There`s much more fast then UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum way to do it using iOS 4.0+ AssetsLibrary frameworkThe simplest way is:One thing to remember: If you use a callback, make sure that your selector conforms to the following form:Otherwise, you\'ll crash with an error such as the following:[NSInvocation setArgument:atIndex:]: index (2) out of bounds [-1, 1]Just pass the images from an array to it like soSorry for typo\'s kinda just did this on the fly but you get the pointWhen saving an array of photos, don\'t use a for loop, do the followingIn Swift:Below function would work. You can copy from here and paste there...my last answer will do it..for each image you want to save, add it to a NSMutableArrayI created a UIImageView category for this, based on some of the answers above.Header File:ImplementationNow simply call this function on your imageview:Optionally you can alter the minimumPressDuration parameter.You can use thisIn Swift 2.2If you do not want to be notified when the image is done saving then you may pass nil in the completionTarget, completionSelector and contextInfo parameters.Example:The important thing to note here is that your method that observes the image saving should have these 3 parameters else you will run into NSInvocation errors. Hope it helps.
