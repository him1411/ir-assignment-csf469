Within a module, a controller can inherit properties from an outside controller:Example via: Dead link: http://blog.omkarpatil.com/2013/02/controller-inheritance-in-angularjs.htmlCan also a controller inside a module inherit from a sibling?The second code does not work since $injector.invoke requires a function as first parameter and does not find the reference to ParentCtrl.Yes, it can but you have to use the $controller service to instantiate the controller instead:-In case you are using vm controller syntax, here is my solution:Unfortunately, you can\'t use $controller.call(vm, \'BaseGenericCtrl\'...), to pass current context into closure (for reload()) function, hence only one solution is to use this inside inherited function in order to dynamically change context.I think,you should use factory or service,to give accessible functions or data for both controllers.here is similar question ---> AngularJS controller inheritanceIn response to the issue raised in this answer by gmontague, I have found a method to inherit a controller using $controller(), and still use the controller "as" syntax. Firstly, use "as" syntax when you inherit calling $controller():Then, in HTML template, if the property is defined by parent, then use parent. to retrieve properties inherited from parent; if defined by child, then use child. to retrieve it. Well, I did this in another way. In my case I wanted a function that apply the same functions and properties in other controllers. I liked it, except by parameters. In this way, all yours ChildCtrls need to receive $location.As mentioned in the accepted answer, you can "inherit" a parent controller\'s modifications to $scope and other services by calling: $controller(\'ParentCtrl\', {$scope: $scope, etc: etc}); in your child controller.However, this fails if you are accustomed to using the controller \'as\' syntax, for example inIf foo was set in the parent controller (via this.foo = ...), the child controller will not have access to it.As mentioned in comments you can assign the result of $controller directly to the scope:Note: You then must remove the \'as\' part from ng-controller=, because you are specifying the instance name in the code, and no longer the template.For those wondering, you can extend component controllers in the same fashion, using the method in the accepted answer. Use the following approach:Parent component (to extend from):Child component (the one extending):The trick is to use named controllers, instead of defining them in the component definition.I was using the "Controller as" syntax with vm = this and wanted to inherit a controller. I had issues if my parent controller had a function that modified a variable.Using IProblemFactory\'s and Salman Abbas\'s answers, I did the following to have access to parent variables:You can use a simple JavaScript inheritence mechanism. Also don\'t forget pass a needly angular services to invoke of .call method.
