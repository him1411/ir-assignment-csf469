I\'m using the node-mongodb-native driver with MongoDB to write a website.I have some questions about how to manage connections:Is it enough using only one MongoDB connection for all requests? Are there any performance issues? If not, can I setup a global connection to use in the whole application?If not, is it good if I open a new connection when request arrives, and close it when handled the request? Is it expensive to open and close a connection?Should I use a global connection pool? I hear the driver has a native connection pool. Is it a good choice?If I use a connection pool, how many connections should be used?Are there other things I should notice?The primary committer to node-mongodb-native says:You open do MongoClient.connect once when your app boots up and reuse\n  the db object. It\'s not a singleton connection pool each .connect\n  creates a new connection pool.So, to answer your question directly, reuse the db object that results from MongoClient.connect(). This gives you pooling, and will provide a noticeable speed increase as compared with opening/closing connections on each db action.Open a new connection when the Node.js application starts, and reuse the existing db connection object:Here is some code that will manage your MongoDB connections.When you start the server, call initPoolThen in any other module you can do the following:This is based on MongoDB documentation. Take a look at it.If you have Express.js, you can use express-mongo-db for caching and sharing the MongoDB connection between requests without a pool (since the accepted answer says it is the right way to share the connection).If not - you can look at its source code and use it in another framework.I have been using generic-pool with redis connections in my app - I highly recommend it. Its generic and I definitely know it works with mysql so I don\'t think you\'ll have any problems with it and mongohttps://github.com/coopernurse/node-poolManage mongo connection pools in a single self contained module. This approach provides two benefits. Firstly it keeps your code modular and easier to test. Secondly your not forced to mix your database connection up in your request object which is NOT the place for a database connection object. (Given the nature of JavaScript I would consider it highly dangerous to mix in anything to an object constructed by library code). So with that you only need to Consider a module that exports two methods. connect = () => Promise and get = () => dbConnectionObject.With such a module you can firstly connect to the databaseWhen in flight your app can simply call get() when it needs a DB connection.If you set up your db module in the same way as the following not only will you have a way to ensure that your application will not boot unless you have a database connection you also have a global way of accessing your database connection pool that will error if you have not got a connection.http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.htmlCheck out the source of Mongoose. They open a connection and bind it to a Model object so when the model Object is required, a connection is made to the DB. The driver takes care of connection pooling.
