I am trying to read a *.csv-file.The *.csv-file consist of two columns separated by semicolon (";"). I am able to read the *.csv-file using StreamReader and able to separate each line by using the Split() function. I want to store each column into a separate array and then display it. Is it possible to do that?You can do it like this:LINQ way:        ^^Wrong - Edit by NickIt appears the original answerer was attempting to populate csv with a 2 dimensional array - an array containing arrays. Each item in the first array contains an array representing that line number with each item in the nested array containing the data for that specific column.My favourite csv parser is one built into .net library. This is a hidden treasure inside Microsoft.VisualBasic namespace.\nBelow is a sample code:More details about the parser is given here: http://codeskaters.blogspot.ae/2015/11/c-easiest-csv-parser-built-in-net.htmlI usually use this parser from codeproject, since there\'s a bunch of character escapes and similar that it handles for me.Here is my variation of the top voted answer:The csv variable can then be used as in the following example:You can\'t create an array immediately because you need to know the number of rows from the beginning (and this would require to read the csv file twice)You can store values in two List<T> and then use them or convert into an array using List<T>.ToArray()Very simple example:Just came across this library: https://github.com/JoshClose/CsvHelperVery intuitive and easy to use. Has a nuget package too which made is quick to implement: http://nuget.org/packages/CsvHelper/1.17.0. Also appears to be actively maintained which I like.Configuring it to use a semi-colon is easy: https://github.com/JoshClose/CsvHelper/wiki/Custom-ConfigurationsIf you need to skip (head-)lines and/or columns, you can use this to create a 2-dimensional array:This is quite useful if you need to shape the data before you process it further (assuming the first 2 lines consist of the headline, and the first column is a row title - which you don\'t need to have in the array because you just want to regard the data).N.B. You can easily get the headlines and the 1st column by using the following code:This code example assumes the following structure of your *.csv file:Note: If you need to skip empty rows - which can by handy sometimes, you can do so by insertingbetween the from and the select statement in the LINQ code examples above.You can use Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.TextFieldParser dll in C# for better performance get below code example from above articleThe open-source Angara.Table library allows to load CSV into typed columns, so you can get the arrays from the columns. Each column can be indexed both by name or index. See http://predictionmachines.github.io/Angara.Table/saveload.html.The library follows RFC4180 for CSV; it enables type inference and multiline strings.Example:You can see a column type using the type Column, e.g.Since the library is focused on F#, you might need to add a reference to the FSharp.Core 4.4 assembly; click \'Add Reference\' on the project and choose FSharp.Core 4.4 under "Assemblies" -> "Extensions".Here\'s a special case where one of data field has semicolon (";") as part of it\'s data in that case most of answers above will fail.Solution it that case will be I have been using csvreader.com(paid component) for years, and I have never had a problem.  It is solid, small and fast, but you do have to pay for it.  You can set the delimiter to whatever you like.I have a library that is doing exactly you need.Some time ago I had wrote simple and fast enough library for work with CSV files. You can find it by the following link: https://github.com/ukushu/DataExporterI\'s works with CSV like with 2 dimensions array. Exactly like you need.As example, in case of you need all of values of 3rd row only you need is to write:or to read 2nd cell of I am just student working on my master\'s thesis, but this is the way I solved it and it worked well for me. First you select your file from directory (only in csv format) and then you put the data into the lists.Still wrong.  You need to compensate for "" in quotes.\nHere is my solution Microsoft style csv.
