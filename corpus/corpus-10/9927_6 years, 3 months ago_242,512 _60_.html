I Found some codes for quit an Android application programatically. By calling any one of the following code in onDestroy() will it quit application entirely?    I dont want to run my application in background after clicking quit button. \nPls suggest me can i use any one of these code to quit my app? If so which code can i use? Is it good way to quit the app in Android?Since api 16 you can use the finishAffinity method, which seems to be pretty close to closing all related activities by its name and javadoc description:this.finishAffinity();Finish this activity as well as all activities immediately below it in the current task that have the same affinity. This is typically used when an application can be launched on to another task (such as from an ACTION_VIEW of a content type it understands) and the user has used the up navigation to switch out of the current task and in to its own task. In this case, if the user has navigated down into any other activities of the second application, all of those should be removed from the original task as part of the task switch. Note that this finish does not allow you to deliver results to the previous activity, and an exception will be thrown if you are trying to do so.Since api 21 you can use a very similar commandfinishAndRemoveTask ();Finishes all activities in this task and removes it from the recent tasks list.this is the best way to exit your app.!!!The best solution for me.Please think really hard about if you do need to kill the application: why not let the OS figure out where and when to free the resources?Otherwise, if you\'re absolutely really sure, useAs a reaction to @dave appleton\'s comment: First thing read the big question/answer combo @gabriel posted: Is quitting an application frowned upon?Now assuming we have that, the question here still has an answer, being that the code you need if you are doing anything with quitting is finish(). Obviously you can have more than one activity etc etc, but that\'s not the point. Lets run by some of the use-casesSo in the end, ofcourse, finish() doesn\'t kill everthing, but it is still the tool you need I think. If there is a usecase for "kill all activities", I haven\'t found it yet.There is no application quitting in android,\nSampleActivity.this.finish(); will finish the current activity.When you switch from one activity to another keep finish the previous oneI think that application should be kill in some case. For example, there is an app can be used only after login. The login activity has two buttons, \'login\' and \'cancel\'. When you click \'cancel\' button, it definitely means \'Terminate the app\'. Nobody wants the app alive in the background. So I agree that some cases need to shut down the app.I\'m not sure if this is frowned upon or not, but this is how I do it...Step 1 - I usually have a class that contains methods and variables that I want to access globally.  In this example I\'ll call it the "App" class.  Create a static Activity variable inside the class for each activity that your app has.  Then create a static method called "close" that will run the finish() method on each of those Activity variables if they are NOT null.  If you have a main/parent activity, close it last:Step 2 - in each of your activities, override the onStart() and onDestroy() methods.  In onStart(), set the static variable in your App class equal to "this".  In onDestroy(), set it equal to null. For example, in the "Activity1" class:Step 3 -  When you want to close your app, simply call App.close() from anywhere.  All instantiated activities will close!  Since you are only closing activities and not killing the app itself (as in your examples), Android is free to take over from there and do any necessary cleanup.Again, I don\'t know if this would be frowned upon for any reason.  If so, I\'d love to read comments on why it is and how it can be improved!I think what you are looking for is thisIt depends on how fast you want to close your app.A safe way to close your app is finishAffinity();It closes you app after all processes finished processing.\nThis may need some time.\nIf you close your app this way, and restart it after a short time, it is possible that your new application runs in the same process. With all the not finished processes and singleton objects of the old application.If you want to be sure, that your app is closed completly use System.exit(0);This will close your app immediatly.\nBut it is possible, that you damage files that your app has open or an edit on shared preferences does not finish. So use this carefully.If you use watchdog in combination with a long running task, you can see the influences of the different methods.This kills your app after 2 seconds without displaying an ANR dialog or something like that. If you remove System.exit(0), run this code and restart the app after it is closed, you will experience some strange behaviour, because the endless loop is still running.You can use finishAndRemoveTask () from API 21public void finishAndRemoveTask ()Finishes all activities in this task and removes it from the recent tasks list.You had better use finish() if you are in Activity, or getActivity().finish() if you are in the Fragment.  If you want to quit the app completely, then use:finishAffinity();System.exit(0);If you will use only finishAffinity(); without System.exit(0); your application will quit but the allocated memory will still be in use by your phone, so... if you want a clean and really quit of app, use both of them.This is the simplest method and works anywhere, quit the app for real, you can have a lot of activity opened will still quitting all with no problem.example on a button clickor if you want something nice, example with an alert dialog with 3 buttons YES NO and CANCELIs quitting an application frowned upon?. Go through this link. It answers your question. The system does the job of killing an application. Suppose you have two activities A an B. You navigate from A to B. When you click back button your activity B is popped form the backstack and destroyed. Previous activity in back stack activity A takes focus.You should leave it to the system to decide when to kill the application.public void finish()Call this when your activity is done and should be closed. Suppose you have many activities. you can use Action bar. On click of home icon naviagate to MainActivity of your application. In MainActivity click back button to quit from the application.It\'s not a good decision, cause it\'s against the Android\'s application processing principles. Android doesn\'t kill any process unless it\'s absolutely inevitable. This helps apps start faster, cause they\'re always kept in memory. So you need a very special reason to kill your application\'s process.This may be very late and also as per the guidelines you\'re not supposed to handle the life cycle process by yourself(as the os does that for you). A suggestion would be that you register a broadcast receiver in all your activities with "finish()" in their onReceive()  & whenever you wish to quit you can simple pass an intent indicating that all activities must shut down.....\nAlthough make sure that you do "unregister" the receiver in your onDestroy() methods.The correct and exact solution to quit the app on button click is using the below code://On Button Back pressed eventFrom your top-level activity:This will kill anything ;)you can your full apps quite. thus it will work 100%. Best of luck!Just use finish() on back key press onKeypressed()Write this code in your on backpressed override method
