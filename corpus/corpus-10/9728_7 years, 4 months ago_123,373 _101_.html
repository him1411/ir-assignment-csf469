I have a very similar problem as described here.I also upgraded a mixed solution of C++/CLI and C# projects from VS2008 to VS2010. And now in VS2010 one C++/CLI project always runs out of date. Even if it has been compiled and linked just before and F5 is hit the messagebox "The project is out of date. Would you like to build it?" appears. This is very annoying because the dll is very low-tiered and forces almost all projects of the solution to rebuild.My pdb settings are set to default value (suggested solution of this problem).Is it possible the get the reason why VS2010 forces a rebuild or thinks a project is up to date?\nAny other ideas why VS2010 behaves like that? For Visual Studio/Express 2010 only. See other (easier) answers for VS2012, VS2013, etcTo find the missing file(s), use info from the article Enable C++ project system logging to enable debug logging in Visual Studio and let it just tell you what\'s causing the rebuild:Add the following after the </configSections> line:Search the debug log for any lines of the form:devenv.exe Information: 0 : Project \'Bla\\Bla\\Dummy.vcxproj\' not up to date because build input \'Bla\\Bla\\SomeFile.h\' is missing.(I just hit Ctrl+F and searched for not up to date) These will be the references causing the project to be perpetually "out of date".To correct this, either remove any references to the missing files from your project, or update the references to indicate their actual locations.Note: If using 2012 or later then the snippet should be:In VS2012 I was able to achieve easier the same result as in the accepted solution.I changed the option in "Tools->Options->Projects and Solutions->Build and Run->MSBuild project build output verbosity" from Minimal to Diagnostic. Then in the build output I found the same lines by searching for "not up to date":Project \'blabla\' is not up to date. Project item \'c:\\foo\\bar.xml\' has \'Copy to Output Directory\' attribute set to \'Copy always\'.This happened to me today. I was able to track down the cause: The project included a header file which no longer existed on disk.Removing the file from the project solved the problem.We also ran into this issue and found how to resolve it.The issue was as stated above "The file no longer exists on the disk."This is not quite correct the file does exist on the disk but the .VCPROJ file is referencing the file somewhere else.You can \'discover\' this by going to the "include file view" and clicking on each include file in turn untill you find the one that VS can not find.  You then ADD that file (as an existing item) and delete the reference that can not be found and everything is ok.A valid question is: How can VS even build if it does not know where the include files are?We think the .vcproj file has some relative path to the offending file somewhere that it does not show in the VS GUI and this accounts for why the project will actually build even though the tree-view of the includes is incorrect.The accepted answer helped me on the right path to figuring out how to solve this problem for the screwed up project I had to start working with. However, I had to deal with a very large number of bad include headers. With the verbose debug output, removing one caused the IDE to freeze for 30 seconds while outputting debug spew, which made the process go very slowly.I got impatient and wrote a quick and dirty python script to check the (VS 2010) project files for me and output all the missing files at once, along with the filters they\'re located in. You can find it as a Gist here: https://gist.github.com/antiuniverse/3825678 (or this fork that supports relative paths)Example:Source code:I\'ve deleted a cpp and some header files from the solution (and from the disk) but still had the problem.Thing is, every file the compiler uses goes in a *.tlog file in your temp directory. \nWhen you remove a file, this *.tlog file is not updated. That\'s the file used by incremental builds to check if your project is up to date.Either edit this .tlog file manually or clean your project and rebuild.I had a similar problem, but in my case there were no files missing, there was an error in how the pdb output file was defined: I forgot the suffix .pdb (I found out with the debug logging trick).To solve the problem I changed, in the vxproj file, the following line:toAnother simple resolving referenced by Visual Studio Forum.Changing configuration: "TOOLS->Options->Projects and Solutions->VC++ Project Settings->Solution Explorer Mode" to "Show all files".Then You can see all files in Solution Explorer.Find the files marked by Yellow icon and remove them from the project.It\'s OK.I had this problem in VS2013 (Update 5) and there can be two reasons for that, both of which you can find by enabling "Detailed" build output under "Tools"->"Projects and Solutions"->"Build and Run"."Forcing recompile of all source files due to missing PDB "..."\nThis happens when you disable debug information output in your compiler options (Under Project settings: \xe2\x80\x9eC/C++\xe2\x80\x9c->\xe2\x80\x9cDebug Information Format\xe2\x80\x9c to \xe2\x80\x9eNone\xe2\x80\x9c and \xe2\x80\x9eLinker\xe2\x80\x9c->\xe2\x80\x9cGenerate Debug Info\xe2\x80\x9c to \xe2\x80\x9eNo\xe2\x80\x9c: ).

I known of no workaround, but if you do, by all means, post it here.For me it was the presence of a non-existing  header file on "Header Files" inside the project. After removing this entry (right-click > Exclude from Project) first time recompiled, then directly ========== Build: 0 succeeded, 0 failed, 5 up-to-date, 0 skipped ==========and no attempt of rebuilding without modification was done. I think is a check-before-build implemented by VS2010 (not sure if documented, could be) which triggers the "AlwaysCreate" flag.I had similar problem and followed the above instructions (the accepted answer) to locate the missing files but not without scratching my head. Here is my summary of what I did. To be accurate these are not missing files since they are not required by the project  to build (at least in my case) but they are references to files that don\'t exist on disk which are not really required.Here is my story:1) Under windows 7 the file is located at %ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\\Common7\\IDE\\%. There are two similar files devenv.exe.config.config and devenv.exe.config. You want to change later one.2) Under windows 7, you don\'t have permission to edit this file being in program files. Just copy it somewhere else (desktop) change it and than copy it back to the program files location.3) I was trying to figure how how do I connect DbgView to IDE to see the missing files. Well you don\'t have to do anything. Just run it and it will capture all the messages. Make sure Capture Events menu option is selected in Capture menu which by default should be selected.4) The DbgView will NOT display all the missing files at once (at least it didn\'t for me)! You would have DbgView running and than run the project in VS2010. It will prompt project out of date message, select yes to build and DbgView will show the first file that is missing or causing the rebuild. Open the project file (not solution file) in notepad and search for that file and delete it. You are better of closing your project and reopening it again while doing this delete. Repeat this process until DbgView no longer shows any files missing.5) It\'s kind of helpful to set the message filter to not up to date from DbgView toolbar button or Edit > Filter/Highlight option. That way the only messages it displays are the one that has `not up to date\' string in it.I had lots of files that were unnecessary references and removing them all fixed the issue following the above steps.Second way to find all the missing files at onceThere is a second way to find these files all at once but it involves (a) source control and (b) integration of it with VS2010.  Using VS2010 add your project to a desired location or dummy location in source control. It will try to all all the files including those that don\'t exist on disk as well but referenced in the project file. Go to your source control software like perforce and it should these files which don\'t exist on disk in a different color scheme. Perforce shows them with a black lock on them.  These are your missing references. Now you have a list of them all and you can delete all of them from your project file using notepad and your project would not complain about being out of dateI met this problem today, however it was a bit different.\nI had a cuda dll project in my solution.\nCompiling in a clean solution was ok, otherwise it failed and the compiler always treated the cuda dll project as not up to date.I tried the solution from this post.but there is no missing header file in my solution.\nThen I found out the reason in my case.I have changed the project\'s Intermediate Directory before, although it didn\'t cause trouble.\nAnd now when I changed the CUDA dll Project\'s Intermediate Directory back to $(Configuration)\\, everything works right again.I guess there is some minor problem between CUDA Build Customization and non-default Intermediate Directory.I had this problem and found this:http://curlybrace.blogspot.com/2005/11/visual-c-project-continually-out-of.htmlVisual C++ Project continually out-of-date (winwlm.h macwin32.h rpcerr.h macname1.h missing)In Visual C++ .Net 2003, one of my projects always claimed to be out of date, even though nothing had changed and no errors had been reported in the last build.Opening the BuildLog.htm file for the corresponding project showed a list of PRJ0041 errors for these files, none of which appear on my system anywhere:\n  winwlm.h macwin32.h rpcerr.h macname1.h Each error looks something like this:Your project may still build, but may continue to appear out of date until this file is found.Include afxres.h instead of resource.h inside the project\'s .rc file.The project\'s .rc file contained "#include resource.h". Since the resource compiler does not honor preprocessor #ifdef blocks, it will tear through and try to find include files it should be ignoring. Windows.h contains many such blocks. Including afxres.h instead fixed the PRJ0041 warnings and eliminated the "Project is out-of-date" error dialog.I don\'t know if anyone else has this same problem, but my project\'s properties had "Configuration Properties" -> C/C++ -> "Debug Information Format" set to "None", and when I switched it back to the default "Program Database (/Zi)", that stopped the project from recompiling every time.In my case one of the projects contains multiple IDL files. The MIDL compiler generates a DLL data file called \'dlldata.c\' for each of them, regardless of the IDL file name. This caused Visual Studio to compile the IDL files on every build, even without changes to any of the IDL files.The workaround is to configure a unique output file for each IDL file (the MIDL compiler always generates such a file, even if the /dlldata switch is omitted):If you are using the command-line MSBuild command (not the Visual Studio IDE), for example if you are targetting AppVeyor or you just prefer the command line, you can add this option to your MSBuild command line:As documented here (warning: usual MSDN verbosity). When the build finishes, search for the string will be compiled in the log file created during the build, MyLog.log.I\'m using Visual Studio 2013 Professional with Update 4 but didn\'t find resolution with any of the other suggestions, however, I did manage to resolve the issue for my Team project.Here\'s what I did to cause the problem - Here\'s what I did to solve the problem - If this is the case for you then just be extra sure that you\'re deleting the phantom file rather than the actual one you want to keep in the project.Visual Studio VS 2013 -- "Forcing recompile of all source files due to missing PDB". I turned on detailed build output to locate the issue: I enabled "Detailed" build output under "Tools"->"Projects and Solutions"->"Build and Run".I had several projects, all c++, I set the option for Under Project settings: (C/C++ -> Debug Information Format) to Program Database (/Zi) for the problem project. However, this did not stop the problem for that project. The problem came from one of the other C++ projects in the solution. I set all C++ projects to "Program Database (/Zi)". This fixed the problem.Again, the project reporting the problem was not the problem project. Try setting all projects to "Program Database (/Zi)" to fix the problem.Most build systems use data time stamps to determine when rebuilds should happen - The date/time stamp of any output files is checked against the last modified time of the dependencies - if any of the dependencies are fresher, then the target is rebuilt.This can cause problems if any of the dependencies somehow get an invalid data time stamp as its difficult for the time stamp of any build output to ever exceed the timestamp of a file supposedly created in the future :PI had a similar issue with VS2005, my solution consisted of five projects in the following dependancy (first built at top):I was finding that the Video_Codec project wanted a full build even after a full clean then rebuild of the solution.I fixed this by ensuring the pdb output file of both the C/C++ and linker matched the location used by the other working projects. I also switched RTTI on.I spent many hours spent tearing out my hair over this. The build output wasn\'t consistent; different projects would be "not up to date" for different reasons from one build to the next consecutive build.\nI eventually found that the culprit was DropBox (3.0.4). I junction my source folder from ...\\DropBox into my projects folder (not sure if this is the reason), but DropBox somehow "touches" files during a build. Paused syncing and everything is consistently up-to-date.There are quite a few potential reasons and - as noted - you need to first diagnose them by setting MSBuild verbosity to \'Diagnostic\'. Most of the time the stated reason would be self explanatory and you\'d be able to act on it immediatelly, BUT occasionally MSBuild would erroneously claim that some files are modified and need to be copied.If that is the case, you\'d need to either disable NTFS tunneling or duplicate your output folder to a new location.  Here it is in more words.If you change the Debugging Command arguments for the project, this will also trigger the project needs to be rebuilt message. Even though the target itself is not affected by the Debugging arguments, the project properties have changed. If you do rebuild though, the message should disappear.This happened to me multiple times and then went away, before I could figure out why. In my case it was:Wrong system time in the dual boot setup!Turns out, my dual boot with Ubuntu was the root cause!! I\'ve been too lazy to fix up Ubuntu to stop messing with my hardware clock. When I log into Ubuntu, the time jumps 5 hours forward. Out of bad luck, I built the project once, with the wrong system time, then corrected the time. As a result, all the build files had wrong timestamps, and VS would think they are all out of date and would rebuild the project.The MSBuild team is collecting information on how to investigate build incrementality issues at this wiki page:\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/MSBuild/wiki/Rebuilding%20when%20nothing%20changedAnother one on VS2015 SP3, but have encountered similar issue on VS2013 a few years back.My issue was that somehow a wrong cpp file was used for precompiled headers (so I had 2 cpp files that created the precompiled headers). Now why did VS change the flags on the wrong cpp to \'create precompiled headers\' without my request I have no clue, but it did happen... maybe some plugin or something???Anyway the wrong cpp file includes the version.h file which is changed on every build. So VS rebuild all headers and because of that whole project.Well now it\'s back to normal behavior.The .net projects are always recompiled regardless. Part of this is to keep the IDE upto date (such as intellisense). I remember asking this question on an MS forum years ago and this was the answer I was given.
