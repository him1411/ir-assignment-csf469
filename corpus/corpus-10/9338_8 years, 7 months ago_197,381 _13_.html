I have the following code: How can I get it to parse XML contained within a String instead of a file?I have this function in my code base, this should work for you.also see this similar questionOne way is to use the version of parse that takes an InputSource rather than a fileA SAX InputSource can be constructed from a Reader object. One Reader object is the StringReaderSo something likejavadocs show that the parse method is overloaded.Create a StringStream or InputSource using your string XML and you should be set.Convert the string to an InputStream and pass it to DocumentBuilderEDITIn response to bendin\'s comment regarding encoding, see shsteimer\'s answer to this question.I\'m using this methodYou can use the Scilca XML Progession package available at GitHub.
