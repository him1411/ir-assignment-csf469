There are a lot of different ways to read and write files (text files, not binary) in C#. I just need something that is easy and uses the least amount of code, because I am going to be working with files a lot in my project. I only need something for string since all I need is to read and write strings.Use File.ReadAllText and File.WriteAllText.It could not be simpler...MSDN examples:In addition to File.ReadAllText, File.ReadAllLines, and File.WriteAllText (and similar helpers from File class) shown in another answer you can use StreamWriter/StreamReader classes.Writing a text file:Reading a text file:Notes:Simple, easy and also disposes/cleans up the object once you are done with it.@AlexeiLevenkov pointed me at another "easiest way" namely the extension method. It takes just a little coding, then provides the absolute easiest way to read/write, plus it offers the flexibility to create variations according to your personal needs. Here is a complete example:This defines the extension method on the string type. Note that the only thing that really matters is the function argument with extra keyword this, that makes it refer to the object that the method is attached to. The namespace and class declarations are optional.This is how to use the string extension method, note that it refers automagically to the class Strings:I would never have found this myself, but it works great, so I wanted to share this. Have fun!The easiest way to read and write in a fileOr, if you are really about lines:System.IO.File also contains a static method WriteAllLines, so you could do:You\'re looking for the File, StreamWriter, and StreamReader classes.It\'s good when reading to use the OpenFileDialog control to browse to any file you want to read. Find the code below:Don\'t forget to add the following using statement to read files: using System.IO;To write files you can use the method File.WriteAllText.
