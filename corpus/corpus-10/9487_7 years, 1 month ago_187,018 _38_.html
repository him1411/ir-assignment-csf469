I need to convert a unix timestamp to a date object.\nI tried this:Timestamp value is: 1280512800The Date should be "2010/07/30 - 22:30:00" (as I get it by PHP) but instead I get Thu Jan 15 23:11:56 IRST 1970.How should it be done?Multiply by 1000, since java is expecting milliseconds:From the documentation:Allocates a Date object and\n  initializes it to represent the\n  specified number of milliseconds since\n  the standard base time known as "the\n  epoch", namely January 1, 1970,\n  00:00:00 GMT.This is the right way:Java 8 introduced a new API for working with dates and times: the java.time package.With java.time you can use:An Instant represents a timestamp in Java 8. With the static Date.from() method you can convert an Instant to a java.util.Date instance.Looks like Calendar is the new way to go:The last line is just an example how to use it, this one would print eg "14.06.2012".If you have used System.currentTimeMillis() to save the Timestamp you don\'t need the "*1000" part.If you have the timestamp in a string you need to parse it first as a long: Long.parseLong(timestamp).https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html2010-07-30T18:00:00ZThe new java.time framework built into Java 8 and later is the successor to Joda-Time. These new classes include a handy factory method to convert a count of whole seconds from epoch. You get an Instant, a moment on the timeline in UTC with up to nanoseconds resolution.instant.toString(): 2010-07-30T18:00:00ZSee that code run live at IdeOne.com.You reported getting a time-of-day value of 22:30 instead of the 18:00 seen here. I suspect your PHP utility is implicitly applying a default time zone to adjust from UTC. My value here is UTC, signified by the Z (short for Zulu, means UTC). Any chance your machine OS or PHP is set to Asia/Kabul or Asia/Tehran time zones? I suppose so as you report IRST in your output which apparently means Iran time. Currently in 2017 those are the only zones operating with a summer time that is four and a half hours ahead of UTC.Specify a proper time zone name in the format of continent/region, such as America/Montreal, Africa/Casablanca, or Pacific/Auckland. Never use the 3-4 letter abbreviation such as EST or IST or IRST as they are not true time zones, not standardized, and not even unique(!). If you want to see your moment through the lens of a particular region\'s time zone, apply a ZoneId to get a ZonedDateTime. Still the same simultaneous moment, but seen as a different wall-clock time.2010-07-30T22:30+04:30[Asia/Tehran]You should stick with the new java.time classes. But you can convert to old if required.UPDATE: The Joda-Time project is now in maintenance mode, with the team advising migration to the java.time classes. FYI, the constructor for a Joda-Time DateTime is similar: Multiply by a thousand to produce a long (not an int!).Best to avoid the notoriously troublesome java.util.Date and .Calendar classes. But if you must use a Date, you can convert from Joda-Time.The java.time framework is built into Java 8 and later. These classes supplant the troublesome old legacy date-time classes such as java.util.Date, Calendar, & SimpleDateFormat.The Joda-Time project, now in maintenance mode, advises migration to the java.time classes.To learn more, see the Oracle Tutorial. And search Stack Overflow for many examples and explanations. Specification is JSR 310.Where to obtain the java.time classes? The ThreeTen-Extra project extends java.time with additional classes. This project is a proving ground for possible future additions to java.time. You may find some useful classes here such as Interval, YearWeek, YearQuarter, and more.Date\'s constructor expects the timeStamp value to be in milliseconds.\nMultiply your timestamp\'s value with 1000, then pass is to the constructor.If you are converting a timestamp value on a different machine, you should also check the timezone of that machine. For example;The above decriptions will result different Date values, if you run with EST or UTC timezones.To set the timezone; aka to UTC,\nyou can simply rewrite;
