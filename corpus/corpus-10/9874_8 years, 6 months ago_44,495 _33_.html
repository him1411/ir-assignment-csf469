I am trying to serialize a .NET TimeSpan object to XML and it is not working. A quick google has suggested that while TimeSpan is serializable, the XmlCustomFormatter does not provide methods to convert TimeSpan objects to and from XML.One suggested approach was to ignore the TimeSpan for serialization, and instead serialize the result of TimeSpan.Ticks (and use new TimeSpan(ticks) for deserialization). An example of this follows:While this appears to work in my brief testing - is this the best way to achieve this?Is there a better way to serialize a TimeSpan to and from XML?The way you\'ve already posted is probably the cleanest. If you don\'t like the extra property, you could implement IXmlSerializable, but then you have to do everything, which largely defeats the point. I\'d happily use the approach you\'ve posted; it is (for example) efficient (no complex parsing etc), culture independent, unambiguous, and timestamp-type numbers are easily and commonly understood.As an aside, I often add:This just hides it in the UI and in referencing dlls, to avoid confusion.This is only a slight modification on the approach suggested in the question, but this Microsoft Connect issue recommends using a property for serialization like this:This would serialize a TimeSpan of 0:02:45 as:Alternatively, the DataContractSerializer supports TimeSpan.Something that can work in some cases is to give your public property a backing field, which is a TimeSpan, but the public property is exposed as a string.  eg:This is ok if the property value is used mostly w/in the containing class or inheriting classes and is loaded from xml configuration.The other proposed solutions are better if you want the public property to be a usable TimeSpan value for other classes.Combining an answer from Color serialization and this original solution (which is great by itself) I got this solution:where XmlTimeSpan class is like this:You could create a light wrapper around the TimeSpan struct:Sample serialized result:A more readable option would be to serialize as a string and use the TimeSpan.Parse method to deserialize it. You could do the same as in your example but using TimeSpan.ToString() in the getter and TimeSpan.Parse(value) in the setter.Another option would be to serialize it using the SoapFormatter class rather than the XmlSerializer class.The resulting XML file looks a little different...some "SOAP"-prefixed tags, etc...but it can do it.Here\'s what SoapFormatter serialized a timespan of 20 hours and 28 minutes serialized to:To use SOAPFormatter class, need to add reference to System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap and use the namespace of the same name.My version of the solution :)Edit: assuming it is nullable...Timespan stored in xml as number of seconds, but it is easy to adopt, I hope.\nTimespan serialized manually (implementing IXmlSerializable):There is more comprehensive example:\nhttps://bitbucket.org/njkazakov/timespan-serializationLook at Settings.cs.\nAnd there is some tricky code to use XmlElementAttribute.For data contract serialization I use the following.  Can\'t comment or rank up, but the comment SoapDurationorIf you do not want any workarounds, use the DataContractSerializer class from System.Runtime.Serialization.dll.Try this :
