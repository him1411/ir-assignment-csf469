As you know, both angular and twig has common control construction - double curly braces. How can I change default value of Angular?I know that I can do it in Twig, but in some projects I can\'t, only JS.You can change the start and end interpolation tags using interpolateProvider service. One convenient place for this is at the module initialization time.http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$interpolateProviderThis question appears answered, but a more elegant solution that hasn\'t been mentioned is to simply enclose the curly braces in quote marks between the twig curly braces, like so:If you are using a variable for the contents, do this instead:You should use single quotes, not double quotes. Double quotes enable string interpolation by Twig so you have to be more careful with the contents, especially if you are using expressions.If you still hate seeing all those curly braces, you can also create a simple macro to automate the process:Save it as a file and import it into your template. I am using ng for the name because it is short and sweet.Or you can put the macro at the top of your template and import it as _self (see here):Then use it as follows:This outputs:...and a follow up for those that use MtHaml alongside Twig. MtHaml enables the use of AngularJS curlies in the normal manner because any Twig code is accessed though - and = instead of {{ }}. For example:Plain HTML + AngularJS:MtHaml + AngularJS:MtHaml + AngularJS with MtHaml-style Twig:As mentioned in similar question about Django and AngularJS, trick with changing default symbols (in Twig or AngularJS) can provide incompatibility with third-party software, which will use these symbols.\nSo best advice I found in google: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/symfony2/kyebufz4M00/8VhF1KWsSAEJTwigBundle does not provide a configuration for the lexer delimiters\n  as changing them would forbid you to use any templates provided by\n  shared bundles (including the exception templates provided by\n  TwigBundle itself).However, you could use the raw tag around your angular templates to\n  avoid the pain of escaping all curly braces:\n  http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/tags/raw.html\n  --  Christophe | StofTag was renamed to verbatimYou can use too the attribute-based directive <p ng-bind="yourText"></p> is the same as <p>{{yourText}}</p>You can use \\{{product.name}} to get the expression ignored by Handlebars and used by Angular instead.According to this post you should be able to do it like this :If you\'re not interested in changing the template tags of the existing angular syntax which would require some confusing rewriting of your existing angular templates.One can just use the twig template tags with angular tags like so:Found this on another similar thread answer: Angularjs on a symfony2 application Alternatively you can change the characters used by Twig. This is controlled by the Twig_Lexer.This is a compiled version of the best answers and a example for verbatim blocks:For single insertions, use:or if you use a twig variableVerbatim, is very elegant and readable for several angular variables:I like @pabloRN, but I would prefer to use span instead of p, because for me p will add line to the result.I will use this: I also use aText with the cursor inside the double quote so I don\'t have to rewrite the whole thing over and over again. You can create a function in twig to surround your angular directives, so like instead of going ...{{"angular"}}you go ...{{angular_parser("angular stuff here output curlies around it")}}You can simple put an \'@\' before your AngularJS expressions, like:By this way Twig will ignore this string and Angular can finally do their job with the double curly braces expressions.
