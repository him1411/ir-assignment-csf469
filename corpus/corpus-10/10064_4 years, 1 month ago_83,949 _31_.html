I have incorporate SpatialIite into a Xcode project which uses a header file from Proj.4, just one header. Both are Xcode projects and have static targets.I\'m trying to migrate from git submodule to Cocoapods. Since static targets seems to be difficult to use with Cocoapods, I just want to have the project built in the usual way. I made podspec for Proj.4. After writing podfile for SpatialLite I got the warnings:I read this issue but I\'m pretty clueless to what the warnings mean and what can I do to fix it.Additionally problem, when I open the workspace as well as opening SpatiaLite project alone, both are targeted to Mac OSX 64, when it is suppose to be an iOS project. My podfile does say "platform :ios".This definitely works most of the time:Go to your target Build Settings -> Other linker flags -> double click . Add $(inherited) to a new line.If you have problem with "...target overrides the GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS build setting defined in..." then you must add $(inherited) to your target Build Settings -> Preprocessor MacrosThere is a conflict between your build settings and the default build settings that Cocoapods wants. To see the Cocoapods build settings, view the file at Pods/Pods.xcconfig in your project. For me this file contains:If you are happy with the Cocoapods settings, then go to Build Settings for your project, find the appropriate setting and hit the Delete key. This will use the setting from Cocoapods.On the other hand, if you have a custom setting that you need to use, then add $(inherited) to that setting.I\'ve seen these 3 errors for pod command in terminal[!] The MY_APP [Debug/Release] target overrides the\n  HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS ...\n  [!] The MY_APP [Debug/Release] target\n  overrides the OTHER_LDFLAGS ...\n  [!] The MY_APP [Debug/Release] target\n  overrides the GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS ...All these 3 errors would be gone by adding $(inherited) toin Project -> Target -> Build SettingsAnd now the command would run without giving any errorsIn your project, find Target -> Build Settings -> Other Linker Flags, select Other Linker Flags, press delete(Mac Keyboard)/Backspace(Normal keyboard) to recover the setting. It works for me.Example:Before\nAfter\nJust had a similar issue when I ran pod install, I saw the following warnings/errors (related to CLANG_CXX_LIBRARY):The line should not be bolded anymore and if you run pod install the warnings/errors should have disappeared.If Xcode complains when linking, e.g. Library not found for -lPods, it doesn\'t detect the implicit dependencies:Go to Product > Edit Scheme\nClick on Build\nAdd the Pods static library\nClean and build againThe first line of link below saved my day:To add values to options from your project\xe2\x80\x99s build settings, prepend the value list with $(inherited).https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/wiki/Creating-a-project-that-uses-CocoaPods#faqAlso, do not forget to insert this line at the beginning of your pod file: I added $(inherited) but my project was still not compiling. For me problem was flag "Build for active Architecture only", I had to set it to YES.For me the problem was with my targets tests. I already had the $(inherited) flag in my main app target.I added it to MyAppTests Other Linker flags. After that when I ran pod install the warning message was gone. \n
