I have a page with a textbox where a user is supposed to enter a 24 character (letters and numbers, case insensitive) registration code.  I used maxlength to limit the user to entering 24 characters.The registration codes are typically given as groups of characters separated by dashes, but I would like for the user to enter the codes without the dashes.How can I write my JavaScript code without jQuery to check that a given string that the user inputs does not contain dashes, or better yet, only contains alphanumeric characters?To find "hello" in your_stringFor the alpha numeric you can use a regular expression:http://www.regular-expressions.info/javascript.htmlAlpha Numeric Regular ExpressionIf you have the text in variable foo:This will test and make sure the user has entered at least one character, and has entered only alphanumeric characters.check if string(word/sentence...) contains specific word/characterUse a regular expression to accomplish this.You\'re all thinking too hard. Just use a simple Regular Expression, it\'s your best friend.Learn Regex in 5 minutes?With ES6 includesTo test for alphanumeric characters only:The regex is testing for 1 or more (+) of the set of characters 0-9, A-Z, and a-z, starting with the beginning of input (^) and stopping with the end of input ($).Try this:Here is an example: http://jsfiddle.net/oliverni/cb8xw/String\'s search function is useful too. It searches for a character as well as a sub_string in a given string.\'apple\'.search(\'pl\') returns 2\'apple\'.search(\'x\') return -1Working perfectly.This exmple will help alot.Kevins answer is correct but it requires a "magic" number as follows:\nvar containsChar = s.indexOf(somechar) !== -1; In that case you need to know that -1 stands for not found.\nI think that a bit better version would be:\nvar containsChar = s.indexOf(somechar) >= 0;
