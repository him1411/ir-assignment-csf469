If I have a PHP string in the format of mm-dd-YYYY (for example, 10-16-2003), how do I properly convert that to a Date and then a DateTime in the format of YYYY-mm-dd? The only reason I ask for both Date and DateTime is because I need one in one spot, and the other in a different spot.Use strtotime() on your first date then date(\'Y-m-d\') to convert it back:Make note that there is a difference between using forward slash / and hyphen - in the strtotime() function. To quote from php.net:Dates in the m/d/y or d-m-y formats\n  are disambiguated by looking at the\n  separator between the various\n  components: if the separator is a\n  slash (/), then the American m/d/y is\n  assumed; whereas if the separator is a\n  dash (-) or a dot (.), then the\n  European d-m-y format is assumed.You need to be careful with m/d/Y and m-d-Y formats. PHP considers / to mean m/d/Y and - to mean d-m-Y. I would explicitly describe the input format in this case:That way you are not at the whims of a certain interpretation.Edit: you can also pass a DateTimeZone to DateTime() constructor to ensure the creation of the date for the desired time zone, not the server default one.To parse the date, you should use:\n    DateTime::createFromFormat();Ex:However, careful, because this will crash with:You actually need to check the formatting went fine, first:Now instead of crashing, you will get an exception, which you can catch, propagate, etc.$dateDE has the wrong format, it should be "16.10.2013";If you are using PHP 5.2 or high, use DateTime as mentioned above.
