I want to use PhantomJS in Python. I googled this problem but couldn\'t find proper solutions.I find os.popen()  may be a good choice. But I couldn\'t pass some arguments to it.Using subprocess.Popen() may be a proper solution for now. I want to know whether there\'s a better solution or not.Is there a way to use PhantomJS in Python?The easiest way to use PhantomJS in python is via Selenium. The simplest installation method isAfter installation, you may use phantom as simple as:If your system path environment variable isn\'t set correctly, you\'ll need to specify the exact path as an argument to webdriver.PhantomJS().  Replace this:... with the following:References:PhantomJS recently dropped Python support altogether. However, PhantomJS now embeds Ghost Driver.A new project has since stepped up to fill the void: ghost.py. You probably want to use that instead:Now since the GhostDriver comes bundled with the PhantomJS, it has become even more convenient to use it through Selenium.I tried the Node installation of PhantomJS, as suggested by Pykler, but in practice I found it to be slower than the standalone installation of PhantomJS. I guess standalone installation didn\'t provided these features earlier, but as of v1.9, it very much does so. Now you can use like thisHere\'s how I test javascript using PhantomJS and Django:mobile/test_no_js_errors.js:mobile/tests.py:Run tests:manage.py test mobilethis is what I do, python3.3.  I was processing huge lists of sites, so failing on the timeout was vital for the job to run through the entire list.If using Anaconda, install with:in your script:works perfectly.  In case you are using Buildout, you can easily automate the installation processes that Pykler describes using the gp.recipe.node recipe.That part installs node.js as binary (at least on my system) and then uses npm to install PhantomJS. Finally it creates an entry point bin/phantomjs, which you can call the PhantomJS webdriver with. (To install Selenium, you need to specify it in your egg requirements or in the Buildout configuration.)The answer by @Pykler is great but the Node requirement is outdated. The comments in that answer suggest the simpler answer, which I\'ve put here to save others time:Install PhantomJSAs @Vivin-Paliath points out, it\'s a standalone project, not part of Node.Mac:Ubuntu:etcSet up a virtualenv (if you haven\'t already):If your machine has both Python 2 and 3 you may need run virtualenv-3.6 mypy or similar.Install selenium:Try a simple test, like this borrowed from the docs:
