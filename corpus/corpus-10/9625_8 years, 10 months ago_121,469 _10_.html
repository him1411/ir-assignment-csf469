Is there a tool out there which can convert SQL syntax to LINQ syntax? I just want to rewrite basic queries with join, etc., to LINQ. It would save me a lot of time.Linqer is a SQL to LINQ converter tool. It helps you to learn LINQ and convert your existing SQL statements.Not every SQL statement can be converted to LINQ, but Linqer covers many different types of SQL expressions. Linqer supports both .NET languages - C# and Visual Basic.I know that this isn\'t what you asked for but LINQPad is a really great tool to teach yourself LINQ (and it\'s free :o).When time isn\'t critical, I have been using it for the last week or so instead or a query window in SQL Server and my LINQ skills are getting better and better.It\'s also a nice little code snippet tool. Its only downside is that the free version doesn\'t have IntelliSense.Bill Horst\'s - Converting SQL to LINQ is a very good resource for this task (as well as LINQPad).LINQ Tools has a decent list of tools as well but I do not believe there is anything else out there that can do what Linqer did.Generally speaking, LINQ is a higher-level querying language than SQL which can cause translation loss when trying to convert SQL to LINQ. For one, LINQ emits shaped results and SQL flat result sets. The issue here is that an automatic translation from SQL to LINQ will often have to perform more transliteration than translation - generating examples of how NOT to write LINQ queries. For this reason, there are few (if any) tools that will be able to reliably convert SQL to LINQ.  Analogous to learning C# 4 by first converting VB6 to C# 4 and then studying the resulting conversion.
