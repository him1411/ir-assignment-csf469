I\'ve looked at numerous other questions and found very simple answers, including the code below.  I simply want to detect when someone changes the content of a text box but for some reason it\'s not working...  I get no console errors.  When I set a breakpoint in the browser at the change() function it never hits it.  Entire page code below:You can use oninput event like this:Or like this:try keyup instead of change.Here\'s the official jQuery documentation for .keyup().Each answer misses some points, so here is my solution:This Event fires on Keyboard input and Mouse drag and autofill and Pasting tested on Chrome and Firefox.\nAnd it detects real changes, not firing when pasting the same thing again or ..!Working example: http://jsfiddle.net/g6pcp/473/update:And if you like to run your change function only when user finishes typing you could try this:If user starts typing (e.g. "foobar") this code prevents your change action to run for every letter user types and and only runs when user stops typing, This is good specially for when you send the input to the server (e.g. search inputs), that way server does only one search for foobar and not six searches for f and then fo and then foo and foob and ...check it out here: http://jsfiddle.net/xstqLkz4/2/Text inputs do not fire the change event until they lose focus. Click outside of the input and the alert will show.If the callback should fire before the text input loses focus, use the .keyup() event.onkeyup, onpaste, onchange, oninput seems to be failing when the browser performs autofill on the textboxes. To handle such a case include "autocomplete=\'off\'" in your textfield to prevent browser from autofilling the textbox,Eg,In my case, I had a textbox that was attached to a datepicker. The only solution that worked for me was to handle it inside the onSelect event of the datepicker.I think you can use keydown too:
