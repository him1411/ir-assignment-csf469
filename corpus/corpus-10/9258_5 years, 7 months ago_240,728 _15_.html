I have a foreach loop and an if statement. If a match is found i need to ultimately break out of the foreach. if is not a loop structure, so you cannot "break out of it". You can, however, break out of the foreach by simply calling break. In your example it has the desired effect:Just for completeness for others that stumble upon this question looking for an answer.. break takes an optional argument, which defines how many loop structures it should break. Example:Resulting output:1 3 2 1 !If - for some obscure reason - you want to break out of an if statement (which is not a loop structure and thus not breakable per definition), you can simply wrap your if in a tiny loop structure so you can jump out of that code block.Please note that this is a total hack and normally you would not want to do this:The example above is taken from a comment in the PHP docsIf you wonder about the syntax: It works because an abbreviated syntax is used here. The outer curly braces can be left out because the loop structure contains only a single statement: if ($foo) { .. }.Another example for this:do $i++; while ($i < 100) is equivalent to do { $i++; } while ($i < 100).Simply use break. That will do it.A safer way to approach breaking a foreach or while loop in PHP is to nest an incrementing counter variable and if conditional inside of the original loop. This gives you tighter control than break; which can cause havoc elsewhere on a complicated page.Example:
