This question already has an answer here:I am having a problem parsing simple JSON strings. I have checked them on JSONLint and it shows that they are valid. But when I try to parse them using either JSON.parse or the jQuery alternative it gives me the error unexpected token o:Note: I\'m encoding my strings using json_encode() in PHP.Your data is already an object. No need to parse it. The javascript interpreter has already parsed it for you.Try parse so: cur_ques_details is already a JS object, you don\'t need to parse itThe source of your error, however, is that you need to place the full JSON string in quotes. The following will fix your sample: As the other respondents have mentioned, the object  is already parsed into a JS object so you don\'t need to parse it. To demonstrate how to accomplish the same thing without parsing, you can do the following: I had the same problem when I submitted data using jQuery AJAX:  If the response is JSON, and you use this method, the data you get is a JavaScript object, but if you use dataType:"text", data is a JSON string. Then the use of $.parseJSON is okay.Using JSON.stringify(data);:Response is already parsed, you don\'t need to parse it again. if you parse it again it will give you "unexpected token o". if you need to get it as string, you could use JSON.stringify()I was seeing this unexpected token o error because my (incomplete) code had run previously (live reload!) and set the particular keyed local storage value to [object Object] instead of {}. It wasn\'t until I changed keys, that things started working as expected. Alternatively, you can follow these instructions to delete the incorrectly set localStorage value.
