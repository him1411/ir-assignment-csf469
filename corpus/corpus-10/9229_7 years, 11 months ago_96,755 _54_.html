I\'m looking for a way to determine if the user has, via settings, enabled or disabled their push notifications for my application.call enabledRemoteNotificationsTypes and check the mask.ex:  iOS8 and above:I can\'t comment (not enough reputation), but re: quantumpotato\'s issue:Where types is given byone can useinstead of will allow you to check only whether notifications are enabled (and don\'t worry about sounds, badges, notification center, etc.). The first line of code (types & UIRemoteNotificationTypeAlert) will return YES if "Alert Style" is set to "Banners" or "Alerts", and NO if "Alert Style" is set to "None", irrespective of other settings.In the latest version of iOS this method is now deprecated. To support both iOS 7 and iOS 8 use:Updated code for swift3.0 , iOS10From iOS9 , swift 2.0 UIRemoteNotificationType is deprecated, use following codesimply check whether Push notifications are enabledBelow you\'ll find a complete example that covers both iOS8 and iOS7 (and lower versions). Please note that prior to iOS8 you can\'t distinguish between "remote notifications disabled" and "only View in lockscreen enabled".Swift 3+ iOS 10In trying to support both iOS8 and lower, I didn\'t have much luck using isRegisteredForRemoteNotifications as Kevin suggested. Instead I used currentUserNotificationSettings, which worked great in my testing.Unfortunately none of these solutions provided really solve the problem because at the end of the day the APIs are seriously lacking when it comes to providing the pertinent information. You can make a few guesses however using currentUserNotificationSettings (iOS8+) just isn\'t sufficient in its current form to really answer the question. Although a lot of the solutions here seem to suggest that either that or isRegisteredForRemoteNotifications is more of a definitive answer it really is not.Consider this:with isRegisteredForRemoteNotifications documentation states:Returns YES if the application is currently registered for remote notifications, taking into account any systemwide settings...However if you throw a simply NSLog into your app delegate to observe the behavior it is clear this does not behave the way we are anticipating it will work. It actually pertains directly to remote notifications having been activated for this app/device. Once activated for the first time this will always return YES. Even turning them off in settings (notifications) will still result in this returning YES this is because, as of iOS8, an app may register for remote notifications and even send to a device without the user having notifications enabled, they just may not do Alerts, Badges and Sound without the user turning that on. Silent notifications are a good example of something you may continue to do even with notifications turned off.As far as currentUserNotificationSettings it indicates one of four things:Alerts are on\nBadges are on\nSound is on\nNone are on.This gives you absolutely no indication whatsoever about the other factors or the Notification switch itself.A user may in fact turn off badges, sound and alerts but still have show on lockscreen or in notification center. This user should still be receiving push notifications and be able to see them both on the lock screen and in the notification center. They have the notification switch on. BUT currentUserNotificationSettings will return: UIUserNotificationTypeNone in that case. This is not truly indicative of the users actual settings.A few guesses one can make:To complete the answer, it could work something like this...edit: This is not right. since these are bit-wise stuff, it wont work with a switch, so I ended using this:Here we get the UIRemoteNotificationType from UIApplication. It represents the state of push notification of this app in the setting, than you can check on its type easilyFor iOS7 and before you should indeed use enabledRemoteNotificationTypes and check if it equals (or doesn\'t equal depending on what you want) to UIRemoteNotificationTypeNone.However for iOS8 it is not always enough to only check with isRegisteredForRemoteNotifications as many state above. You should also check if application.currentUserNotificationSettings.types equals (or doesn\'t equal depending on what you want) UIUserNotificationTypeNone!isRegisteredForRemoteNotifications might return true even though currentUserNotificationSettings.types returns UIUserNotificationTypeNone.Though Zac\'s answer was perfectly correct till iOS 7, it has changed since iOS 8 arrived. Because enabledRemoteNotificationTypes has been deprecated from iOS 8 onwards. For iOS 8 and later, you need to use isRegisteredForRemoteNotifications.I try to support iOS 10 and above using solution provide by @Shaheen Ghiassy but find deprivation issue enabledRemoteNotificationTypes. So, the solution I find by using isRegisteredForRemoteNotifications instead of enabledRemoteNotificationTypes which deprecated in iOS 8. Below is my updated solution that worked perfectly for me:}And we can call this function easily and be accessing its Bool value and can convert it into the string value by this:Hope it will help others too :)\nHappy coding.This Swifty solution worked well for me (iOS8+),Method: Usage:RefiOS8+ OBJECTIVE Cre:this is correctbut following is correct too !  (as UIRemoteNotificationTypeNone is 0 )see the followingHere\'s how to do this in Xamarin.ios.If you are supporting iOS 10+ only go with the UNUserNotificationCenter method.In Xamarin, all above solution does not work for me.\nThis is what I use instead:It\'s getting a live update also after you\'ve changed the notification status in Settings.Full easy copy and paste code built from @ZacBowling\'s solution (https://stackoverflow.com/a/1535427/2298002)this will also bring the user to your app settings and allow them to enable immediatelyI also added in a solution for checking if location services is enabled (and brings to settings as well)GLHF!
