I know it can be done, but I never remember how.How can you reimport a module in python? \nThe scenario is as follows: I import a module interactively and tinker with it, but then I face an error. I fix the error in the .py file and then I want to reimport the fixed module without quitting python. How can I do it ?This should work:From the Python docsReload a previously imported module. The argument must be a module object, so it must have been successfully imported before. This is useful if you have edited the module source file using an external editor and want to try out the new version without leaving the Python interpreter.In python 3, reload is no longer a built in function.If you are using python 3.4+ you should use reload from the importlib library instead.If you are using python 3.2 or 3.3 you should:instead. See http://docs.python.org/3.0/library/imp.html#imp.reloadIf you are using ipython, definitely consider using the autoreload extension:Actually, in Python 3 the module imp is marked as DEPRECATED. Well, at least that\'s true for 3.4.Instead the reload function from the importlib module should be used:https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.reloadBut be aware that this library had some API-changes with the last two minor versions.
