According to this, !==! is the not-equal string operator.\nTrying it, I get:What am I doing wrong?tryif NOT "asdf" == "fdas" echo asdfUse NEQ instead.I know this is quite out of date, but this might still be useful for those coming late to the party. (EDIT: updated since this still gets traffic and @Goozak has pointed out in the comments that my original analysis of the sample was incorrect as well.)I pulled this from the example code in your link: !%1==! is simply an idiomatic use of == intended to verify that the thing on the left, that contains your variable, is different from the thing on the right, that does not. The ! in this case is just a character placeholder. It could be anything. If %1 has content, then the equality will be false, if it does not you\'ll just be comparing ! to ! and it will be true.!==! is not an operator, so writing "asdf" !==! "fdas" is pretty nonsensical.The suggestion to use if not "asdf" == "fdas" is definitely the way to go.Try:That works for me on Windows XP (I get the same error as you for the code you posted).
