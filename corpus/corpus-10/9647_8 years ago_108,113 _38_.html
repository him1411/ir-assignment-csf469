I am trying to convert DO to DTO using java and looking for automated tool before start writing my own. I just wanted to know if there any free tool available for the same.You could try Dozer.Dozer is a Java Bean to Java Bean\n  mapper that recursively copies data\n  from one object to another. Typically,\n  these Java Beans will be of different\n  complex types.Dozer supports simple property\n  mapping, complex type mapping,\n  bi-directional mapping,\n  implicit-explicit mapping, as well as\n  recursive mapping. This includes\n  mapping collection attributes that\n  also need mapping at the element\n  level.There are some libraries around there:Transmorph: Transmorph is a free java library used to convert a Java object of one type into an object of another type (with another signature, possibly parameterized). EZMorph: EZMorph is simple java library for transforming an Object to another Object. It supports transformations for primitives and Objects, for multidimensional arrays and transformations with DynaBeans Commons-BeanUtils: ConvertUtils -> Utility methods for converting String scalar values to objects of the specified Class, String arrays to arrays of the specified Class. Commons-Lang: ArrayUtils -> Operations on arrays, primitive arrays (like int[]) and primitive wrapper arrays (like Integer[]). Commons-Convert: Commons-Convert aims to provide a single library dedicated to the task of converting an object of one type to another. The first stage will focus on Object to String and String to Object conversions. Morph: Morph is a Java framework that eases the internal interoperability of an application. As information flows through an application, it undergoes multiple transformations. Morph provides a standard way to implement these transformations.Lorentz: Lorentz is a generic object-to-object conversion framework. It provides a simple API to convert a Java objects of one type into an object of another type. (seems dead)Spring framework: Spring has an excellent support for PropertyEditors, that can also be used to transform Objects to/from Strings.Dozer: Dozer is a powerful, yet simple Java Bean to Java Bean mapper that recursively copies data from one object to another. Typically, these Java Beans will be of different complex types. ModelMapper: ModelMapper is an intelligent object mapping framework that automatically maps objects to each other. It uses a convention based approach to map objects while providing a simple refactoring safe API for handling specific use cases.OTOM: With OTOM, you can copy any data from any object to any other object. The possibilities are endless. Welcome to "Autumn". (seems dead)Smooks: The Smooks JavaBean Cartridge allows you to create and populate Java objects from your message data (i.e. bind data to) (suggested by superfilin in comments).MapStruct: MapStruct is a compile-time code generator for bean mappings, resulting in fast (no usage of reflection or similar), dependency-less and type-safe mapping code at runtime.Transmorph (pretty recent), EZMorph, Dozer, ModelMapper, OTOM are all serious candidates. Dozer seems to be the most active project though (and maybe the most advanced).Another one is Orika - https://github.com/orika-mapper/orikaOrika is a Java Bean mapping framework that recursively copies (among other capabilities) data from one object to another. It can be very useful when developing multi-layered applications.Orika focuses on automating as much as possible, while providing customization through configuration and extension where needed.Orika enables the developer to :Orika uses byte code generation to create fast mappers with minimal overhead.ModelMapper is another library worth checking out. ModelMapper\'s design is different from other libraries in that it:Check out the ModelMapper site for more info:http://modelmapper.orgUse Apache commons beanutils:static void copyProperties(Object dest, Object orig) \n  -Copy property values from the origin bean to the destination bean for all\n  cases where the property names are the\n  same.http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-beanutils/There is one more Java mapping engine/framework Nomin: http://nomin.sourceforge.net.I suggest you try JMapper Framework.It is a Java bean to Java bean mapper, allows you to perform the passage of data dynamically with annotations and / or XML.With JMapper you can:I\'m happy to add Moo as an option, although clearly I\'m biased towards it:\nhttp://geoffreywiseman.github.com/Moo/It\'s very easy to use for simple cases, reasonable capable for more complex cases, although there are still some areas where I can imagine enhancing it for even further complexities.You can also try mapping framework based on Dozer, but with Excel mapping declaration. They\'ve got some tools and additional cool features. \nCheck at http://openl-tablets.sf.net/mapperTry OMapper..\nhttp://code.google.com/p/omapper/
