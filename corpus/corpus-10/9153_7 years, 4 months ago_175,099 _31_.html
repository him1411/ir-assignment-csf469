Could someone tell me how to get the parent directory of a path in Python in a cross platform way. E.g.andIf the directory doesn\'t have a parent directory, it returns the directory itself. The question might seem simple but I couldn\'t dig it up through Google.Try this:where yourpath is the path you want the parent for.Using os.path.dirname:Caveat: os.path.dirname() gives different results depending on whether a trailing slash is included in the path. This may or may not be the semantics you want. Cf. @kender\'s answer using os.path.join(yourpath, os.pardir).In Python 3.4+doc pageAdditional InfoThe new pathlib library brings together and simplifies using paths and common file operations.\nHere are some examples from the docs.Navigating inside a directory tree:Querying path properties:C:\\Program Files ---> C:\\\\\\C:\\ ---> C:\\\\\\Observe:An alternate solution of @kenderwhere yourpath is the path you want the parent for.Just adding something to the Tung\'s answer (you need to use rstrip(\'/\') to be more of the safer side if you\'re on a unix box).But, if you don\'t use rstrip(\'/\'), given your input is would output,which is probably not what you\'re looking at as you want both "../data/replies/" and "../data/replies" to behave the same way.If you want only the name of the folder that is the immediate parent of the file provided as an argument and not the absolute path to that file:os.path.split(os.path.dirname(currentDir))[1]i.e. with a currentDir value of /home/user/path/to/myfile/file.extThe above command will return:myfileYou can use this to get the parent directory of the current location of your py file.GET Parent Directory Path and make New directory (name new_dir)So a .. helpsIf you want more practical solution as well, you can do the following option,
