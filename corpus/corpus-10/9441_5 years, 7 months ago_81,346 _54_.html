Assume I have a histogram script that builds a 960 500 svg graphic. How do I make this responsive so on resize the graphic widths and heights are dynamic?Full example histogram gist is:\nhttps://gist.github.com/993912There\'s another way to do this that doesn\'t require redrawing the graph, and it involves modifying the viewBox and preserveAspectRatio attributes on the <svg> element: Update 11/24/15: most modern browsers can infer the aspect ratio of SVG elements from the viewBox, so you may not need to keep the chart\'s size up to date. If you need to support older browsers, you can resize your element when the window resizes like so:And the svg contents will be scaled automatically. You can see a working example of this (with some modifications) here: just resize the window or the bottom right pane to see how it reacts.I\'ve coded up a small gist to solve this.The general solution pattern is this:I also added the minified d3.js script for speed.\nThe gist is here: https://gist.github.com/2414111jquery reference back code:Debounce code:Enjoy!Look for \'responsive SVG\' it is pretty simple to make a SVG responsive and you don\'t have to worry about sizes any more. Here is how I did it: The CSS code:More info / tutorials: http://demosthenes.info/blog/744/Make-SVG-Responsivehttp://soqr.fr/testsvg/embed-svg-liquid-layout-responsive-web-design.phpIf you are using d3.js through c3.js the solution to the responsiveness issue is quite straightforward :where the generated HTML looks like :Here is an example of a solution that does not rely on using a viewBox:The key is in updating the range of the scales which are used to place data. First, calculate your original aspect ratio:Then, on each resize, update the range of x and y:Note that the height is based on the width and the aspect ratio, so that your original proportions are maintained.Finally, "redraw" the chart \xe2\x80\x93 update any attribute that depends on either of the x or y scales:Note that in re-sizing the rects you can use the upper-bound of the range of y, rather than explicitly using the height:Shawn Allen\'s answer was great. But you may not want to do this every single time. If you host it on vida.io, you get automatic responsive for your svg visualization.You can get responsive iframe with this simple embed code:http://jsfiddle.net/dnprock/npxp3v9d/1/Disclosure: I build this feature at vida.io.One of the basic principles of the D3 data-join is that it is idempotent. In other words, if you repeatedly evaluate a data-join with the same data, the rendered output is the same. Therefore, as long as you render your chart correctly, taking care withe your enter, update and exit selections - all you have to do when the size changes, is re-render the chart in its entirety.There are a couple of other things you should do, one is de-bounce the window resize handler in order to throttle it. Also, rather than hard-coding widths / heights, this should be achieved by measuring the containing element.As an alternative, here is your chart rendered using d3fc, which is a set of D3 components that correctly handle data-joins. It also has a cartesian chart that measures it containing element making it easy to create \'responsive\' charts:You can see it in action in this codepen:https://codepen.io/ColinEberhardt/pen/dOBvOywhere you can resize the window and verify that the chart is correctly re-rendered.Please note, as a full disclosure, I am one of the maintainers of d3fc.In case people are still visiting this question - here\xe2\x80\x99s what worked for me:Enclose the iframe in a div and use css to add a padding of, say, 40% to that div (the percentage depending on the aspect ratio you want). Then set both width and height of the iframe itself to 100%.In the html doc containing the chart to be loaded in the iframe, set width to the width of the div that the svg is appended to (or to the width of the body) and set height to width * aspect ratio.Write a function that reloads the iframe content upon window resize, so as to adapt the size of the chart when people rotate their phone. Example here:\nhttp://dirkmjk.nl/en/2016/05/embedding-d3js-charts-responsive-websiteUPDATE 30 Dec 2016The approach I described above has some drawbacks, especially that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take the height into account of any title and captions that are not part of the D3-created svg. I\xe2\x80\x99ve since come across what I think is a better approach:Example here: http://dirkmjk.nl/en/2016/12/embedding-d3js-charts-responsive-website-better-solutionYou can also use bootstrap 3 to adapt the size of a visualization. For example, we can set up the HTML code as:I have set up a fixed height because of my needs, but you can leave the size auto as well. The "col-sm-6 col-md-4" makes the div responsive for different devices. You can learn more at http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-example-basicWe can access the graph with the help of the id month-view.I won\'t go into much detail about the d3 code, I will only input the part that is needed for adapting to different screen sizes.The width is set by getting the width of the div with the id month-view.The height in my case should not include the entire area. I also have some text above the bar so I need to calculate that area as well. That\'s why I identified the area of the text with the id responsivetext. For calculating the allowed height of the bar, I subtracted the height of the text from the height of the div.This allows you to have a bar that will adopt all the different screen/div sizes. It might not be the best way of doing it, but it surely works for the needs of my project.
