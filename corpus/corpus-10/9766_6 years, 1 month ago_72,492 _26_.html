I am working on a regression in the source code.  I\'d like to tell git: "checkout the source based on a parameterized date/time".  Is this possible?  I also have staged changes in my current view that I don\'t want to lose.  Ideally I would like to toggle back and forth between the current source, and some version I\'m interested in based on a previous date.You can keep your work stashed away, without commiting it, with git stash. You\nwould than use git stash pop to get it back. Or you can (as carleeto said) git commit it to a separate branch.You can checkout a commit by a specific date using rev-parse like this:More details on the available options can be found in the git-rev-parse.As noted in the comments this method uses the reflog to find the commit in your history. By default these entries expire after 90 days. Although the syntax for using the reflog is less verbose you can only go back 90 days.The other option, which doesn\'t use the reflog, is to use rev-list to get the commit at a particular point in time with:Andy\'s solution does not work for me. Here I found another way:Git: checkout by dateLooks like you need something along the lines of this:\nGit checkout based on dateIn other words, you use rev-list to find the commit and then use checkout to\nactually get it.If you don\'t want to lose your staged changes, the easiest thing would be to\ncreate a new branch and commit them to that branch. You can always switch back\nand forth between branches.Edit: The link is down, so here\'s the command:To those who prefer a pipe to command substitutionGoing further with the rev-list option, if you want to find the most recent merge commit from your master branch into your production branch (as a purely hypothetical example):I needed to find the code that was on the production servers as of a given date. This found it for me.In my case the -n 1 option doesn\'t work. On Windows I\'ve found that the following sequence of commands works fine:git rev-list -1 --before="2012-01-15 12:00" masterThis returns the appropriate commit\'s SHA for the given date, and then:git checkout SHAThe git rev-parse solution proposed by @Andy works fine if the date you\'re interested is the commit\'s date.  If however you want to checkout based on the author\'s date, rev-parse won\'t work, because it doesn\'t offer an option to use that date for selecting the commits.  Instead, you can use the following.git checkout $(\n  git log --reverse --author-date-order --pretty=format:\'%ai %H\' master |\n  awk \'{hash = $4} $1 >= "2016-04-12" {print hash; exit 0 }\n)\n(If you also want to specify the time use $1 >= "2016-04-12" && $2 >= "11:37" in the awk predicate.)If you want to be able to return to the precise version of the repository at the time you do a build it is best to tag the commit from which you make the build.The other answers provide techniques to return the repository to the most recent commit in a branch as of a certain time-- but they might not always suffice. For example, if you build from a branch, and later delete the branch, or build from a branch that is later rebased, the commit you built from can become "unreachable" in git from any current branch. Unreachable objects in git may eventually be removed when the repository is compacted.Putting a tag on the commit means it never becomes unreachable, no matter what you do with branches afterwards (barring removing the tag).take the printed string (for instance XXXX) and do:
