I\'ve installed a library using the commandwhich installs it directly from a Github repository.  This works fine and I want to have that dependency in my requirements.txt.  I\'ve looked at other tickets like this but that didn\'t solve my problem.  If I put something likein the requirements.txt file, a pip install -r requirements.txt results in the following output:The documentation of the requirements file does not mention links using the git+git protocol specifier, so maybe this is just not supported.Does anybody have a solution for my problem?\xe2\x80\x9cEditable\xe2\x80\x9d packages syntax can be used in requirements.txt to import packages from a variety of VCS (git, hg, bzr, svn):Also, it is possible to point to particular commit:requirements.txt allows the following ways of specifying a dependency on a package in a git repository as of pip 7.0:1For Github that means you can do (notice the omitted -e):Why the extra answer?\nI got somewhat confused by the -e flag in the other answers so here\'s my clarification:The -e or --editable flag means that the package is installed in <venv path>/src/SomeProject and thus not in the deeply buried <venv path>/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages/SomeProject it would otherwise be placed in.2DocumentationFirst, install with git+git.

The text between @ and # denotes the specifics of the package.Note that #egg=package-two is not a comment here, it is to explicitly state the package nameThis blog post has some more discussion on the topic.Since pip v1.5, (released Jan 1 2014: CHANGELOG, PR) you may also specify a subdirectory of a git repo to contain your module.  The syntax looks like this:Note: As a pip module author, ideally you\'d probably want to publish your module in it\'s own top-level repo if you can. Yet this feature is helpful for some pre-existing repos that contain python modules in subdirectories.  You might be forced to install them this way if they are not published to pypi too.
