I\'m having trouble exporting an app for Ad Hoc Distribution on Xcode 6 beta 2..When exporting my project for ad hoc development on xcode 6, I receive this alert. I\'ve tried exporting it on xcode 5 and had no problems at all saving the .ipa. Is anyone experiencing this problem as well?This is what worked for me. On my machine I kept both Xcode 5 and Xcode 6 beta.From Xcode 6 beta, Archive the project. Close Xcode 6.Open Xcode 5, go to Organizer and export as Ad Hoc build with proper provisioning profile.That\'s it!I\'ve had the same issue two days ago. Turns out the problem was:The solution is: get a private key for enterprise account of my client. There are 2 possible options:How to find out if you have a private key for a certificate: Open Keychain Access application. Choose certificates. Find your certificate. If you see small grey triangle on the left side of the certificate, open it and you see your private key. No triangle = no private key.I had the same problem, I had to use the command line "xcodebuild" tool as a workaround, with only XCode6 installed (didn\'t have to re-install XCode5).http://www.thecave.com/2014/09/16/using-xcodebuild-to-export-a-ipa-from-an-archive/Example:In my case, what solved the problem was deleting all Distribution Certificates from my Apple Developer Account. Then, Xcode managed to create development and distribution certificates again, and that did the trick.I get a solution without renew the certificate:1 - Archive the target with the appropiate Code Signing Identity and Provisioning Profile2 - Right button in the created file in Organizer --> Show in Finder3 - Right button in the xcarchive file --> Show package content4 - There, in Finder, go to Products/Applications/5 - Upload the file Products/Applications/appName to iTunes6 - When the app appear in iTunes, right click on it --> Show in Finder. This is the ipa file7 - Send this ipa through App Loader 3.0I dont think that it is a lasting solution but do not want to delete my certificates1) Create a NEW production certificate through developer.apple.com which requires you to use Keychain Access to create a new private key on your computer2) In the same developer portal, open your distribution Provisioning Profile used with this app and select the new production certificate which you just created. Generate the provision then download it and run it3) Run your app, Archive it, then export the archive.This took me days if not weeks to figure out, I hope it helps you.Create new iOS Distributon Certificate and choose Production> App Store & AdHoc  section.  Also don\'t forget to change  Target>Build Settings> Code Signing all to iOS Distribution.(but after created ipa set it back to iOS Developer)\nOnly this solved my problem.I faced the same issue today with Xcode 6.1.1When I tried to add iOS Distribution certificate via Xcode the error I got was the same. There were already several issued distribution certificates in Member Center and I did not want to invalidate them because if they are used for Ad Hoc distribution in an Enterprise environment this would also invalidate the applications that are installed on the devices (at least this is what I\'ve read).What I did was:\n 1. Through Keychain Access generated a request for a certificate from a certification authority. And saved the request to a file;\n 2. Logged in to Member Center certificates area Production section and requested a new "App Store and Ad Hoc" production certificate, this requested the file from step 1;\n 3. Downloaded the new certificate and when imported in Keychain Access it now had a private key.Afterwords I cleaned Xcode, restarted it, checked that in my account the profile is visible and built a new Archive. And now I was able to validate the archive.Now if I try to request a new "App Store and Ad Hoc" certificate this option is grayed out for me and I suppose this is because my account already has the certificate issued. If this is your case you will most probably need to invalidate your previous certificate before you can issue a new one. This is why Apple recommend backing up your certificate. But it is very likely that you will not need to invalidate all production certificates as I already have a number of those in the profile.Hope this helps someone :)Apple has changed the way of Ad Hoc build. Now you can\'t make Ad Hoc distribution builds using dev cert. You should use a distribution cert with an "Ad Hoc" provisioning profile instead.I believe the actual reason you ended up in this screen is while trying to get the .ipa file to be distributed to your testers and clients.\nIn Xcode 6, to get the .ipa file you may use the old method for iPA generation:Now you have the .ipa file which you can send to your testers for testing.\nHope this helps.There has been changes in way apple manages our private and public key.\nThe previous method to share account on two machine was\n1.download provisioning \n2.export/checkout certificateinstall them both on the other macbut now you dont have to do that you export your entire account.\n1.XCode -> preferences -> account (select account) on bottom left there is option to export that\nyou will be prompted to give a password give any it will be required while importing on other system.A .developerprofile file will be downloaded on location of your choice.2.download it on other mac and when you see the prompt your device already have valid signing identity click on import Developer Profile and import this .developerprofile file. enter password when prompted.got help from hereI resolved it following the next steps:1)in your apple developer account: Create a new Production Certificate Choose the App Store and Ad Hoc Option2)in your apple developer account: Create a new provisioning profile with you current bundle id and the certificate created in the step one3)in your xcode: Seems that xcode 6 now requires an ad hoc distribution certificate in order to export your IPA.I got the same issue today, and found a good solution I think.First of all, there\'re something unnormal:the normal is:and in the keychain:the normal is:then, I realize that I lack the the correct provisioning profile which contains the correct iOS Distribution certificate.Finally, my solution is: use my CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest file to generate a new iOS distribution certificate, and use the new iOS distribution certificate to generate a new provisioning profile. Note, I don\'t delete the old certification and provisioning profile, because my colleague works well with them. Does this affect the apps I already published? The answer is NO. I just change the code signing certificate, and some important certificate like push notification certificate is ties with app ID:So don\'t worry about that.Hope the above is helpful.As pointed out by a commenter this has proven to be a solution for myself and others:I deleted and re-downloaded all my required certificates along with the keys needed to generate and i was able to get past this errorI  revoke my producion certificates, and request another one, solve this problem.\nMaybe you need restart your xcode.I just encountered this after upgrading from Xcode 5 to 6.In my case creating a new production certificate and then recreating the distribution provisioning profile for my app did the trick.In the official latest Xcode 6.0, this will happen if you accidentally created a record in your entitlements file that has a key like this:I am not sure if Xcode automatically created it by default. But deleting that key solved my problem. I didn\'t have to recreate any certificates. It was not my problem.I solved this by simply regenerating the provisioning profile on the developer portal (in my case an App Store profile) and adding to my computer via iPhone Configuration Utility. I didn\'t want to mess with the certificates and successfully avoided that.I noticed this error message logged from Xcode in my console:None of the valid provisioning profiles allowed the specified entitlements: application-identifier, beta-reports-active, keychain-access-groups.After downloading a the new provisioning profile, the missing beta-reports-active = true was present and Xcode signed the build.My Solution was Delete the only iOS Production Certificate which I\'m using and create it again. Doing this, you must create a new Provisioning profile assigning the certificate just created.then I did the process of Archive again and works!Additionally I found that Xcode Accounts come into play -It turned out that I did have a valid distribution certificate on my personal account (mobilology) so I deleted that account temporarily from the Accounts section (you may wish to leave only that account that you are distributing from).Suddenly the signing / archiving process worked!Step1:-Login to your apple developer accountStep2:-Choose CertificatesStep3:-Delete if there are more than one distribution certificatesStep4:-Then retry archiving ( if error still exist, revoke all certificates and create new distribution certificate and edit your provision profiles.)I think its a bug from Xcode. to make it work, i need delete the actual distribution provisional profile and i had to make a new provisional distribution profile from devcenter. This works from me I also faced the same problem, i was using development certificate instead of Adhoc. Issue is fixed after using Adhoc certificate.Delete you ios Distribution certificate from the apple developer site and regenrate the ios Distribution with the certSignReq file. Works for me always. Your other apps wouldnt be affected . Atleast in my case it never did.In my case I generated a new distribution profile and added it to XCode, then tried to submit the build.  Turns out, all I had to do to get rid of this message is restart XCode and attempt again to submit.  Worked.In my case, I got the error message when trying to export and AdHoc build from Organizer.  I did two things, either of which may have fixed the issue:1) Exported the existing certificate it claimed I did not have from my keychain, deleted it from keychain, re-imported.2) Created an ad-hoc distribution certificate, refreshed XCode account to obtain the new distribution provisioning profile.After that I was able to export the exact same archive to an AdHoc build.  I really think it was only that fact I was missing an ad-hoc distribution that targeted that specifc bundleID that led to XCode being confused.Followup:  The archive I had created before did not work, I had to re-generate it.  A clue this was an issue was that when selecting the archive and opting to export an Ad-Hoc build, the default account selected was the wrong account for the build (the project had no default account selected when I archived the build).This is what worked for me (Enterprise Account) Import the developer profile from the other machine, which loaded the certificate I needed with the secret key. \n  Rename the app bundle to the enterprise name (it was named under the app store name).\n  Change the team name in the "General" tab to my company\'s team - it was defaulting to my personal developer account! With these changes, I could export an ipa as both ad-hoc and enterprise, upload it to Hockey Rink, and download it on my phone
