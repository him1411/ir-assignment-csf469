Is there any known way to make the CSS style background-size work in IE?A bit late, but this could also be useful. There is an IE filter, for IE 5.5+, which you can apply:However, this scales the entire image to fit in the allocated area, so if you\'re using a sprite, this may cause issues.Specification: AlphaImageLoader Filter @microsoftI created jquery.backgroundSize.js: a 1.5K jquery plugin that can be used as a IE8 fallback for "cover" and "contain" values. Have a look at the demo.Thanks to this post, my full css for cross browser happiness is:It\'s been so long since I\'ve worked on this piece of code, but I\'d like to add for more browser compatibility I\'ve appended this to my CSS for more browser compatibility:Even later, but this could be usefull too. There is the jQuery-backstretch-plugin you can use as a polyfill for background-size: cover. I guess it must be possible (and fairly simple) to grab the css-background-url property with jQuery and feed it to the jQuery-backstretch plugin. Good practice would be to test for background-size-support with modernizr and use this plugin as a fallback.The backstretch-plugin was mentioned on SO here.The jQuery-backstretch-plugin-site is here.In similar fashion you could make a jQuery-plugin or script that makes background-size work in your situation (background-size: 100%) and in IE8-. So to answer your question: Yes there is a way but atm there is no plug-and-play solution (ie you have to do some coding yourself).(disclaimer: I didn\'t examine the backstretch-plugin thoroughly but it seems to do the same as background-size: cover)There is a good polyfill for that: louisremi/background-size-polyfillTo quote the documentation:Upload backgroundsize.min.htc to your website, along with the\n  .htaccess that will send the mime-type required by IE (Apache only \xe2\x80\x94\n  it\'s built in nginx, node and IIS).Everywhere you use background-size in your CSS, add a reference to\n  this file.you can use this file\n(https://github.com/louisremi/background-size-polyfill \xe2\x80\x9cbackground-size polyfill\xe2\x80\x9d) for IE8 that is really simple to use:I tried with the following script - It worked for me!I think the best way is adding following line in top of your HTML file. \nit works fine for me!
