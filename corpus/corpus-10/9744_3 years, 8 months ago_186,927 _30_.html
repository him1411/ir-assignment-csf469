I have Article entity in my project which have ApplicationUser property named Author. How can I get full object of currently logged ApplicationUser. While creating new article I have to set Author property in Article to current ApplicationUser.In old Membership mechanism it was simple but in the new Identity approach I don\'t know how to do this.I tried to do this that way:But I get exception :LINQ to Entities does not recognize the method \'System.String GetUserId(System.Security.Principal.IIdentity)\' method, and this method cannot be translated into a store expression.\n    Source=EntityFrameworkThat introduces a new dependency of having an extra context for starters, but going forward the user database tables change (3 times in the past 2 years) but the API is consistent. For example the users table is now called AspNetUsers in Identity Framework, and the names of several primary key fields kept changing, so the code in several answers will no longer work as-is.Another problem is that the underlying OWIN access to the database will use a separate context, so changes from separate SQL access can produce invalid results (e.g. not seeing changes made to the database). Again the solution is to work with the supplied API and not try to work-around it.The correct way to access the current user object in ASP.Net identity (as at this date) is:or, if you have an async action, something like:FindById requires you have the following using statement so that the non-async UserManager methods are available (they are extension methods for UserManager, so if you do not include this you will only see FindByIdAsync):If you are not in a controller at all (e.g. you are using IOC injection), then the user id is retrieved in full from:If you are not in the standard Account controller you will need to add the following (as an example) to your controller:Update March 2015Note: The most recent update to Identity framework changes one of the underlying classes used for authentication. You can now access it from the Owin Context of the current HttpContent.When using EF and Identity Framework with Azure, over a remote database connection (e.g. local host testing to Azure database), you can randomly hit the dreaded \xe2\x80\x9cerror: 19 - Physical connection is not usable\xe2\x80\x9d. As the cause is buried away inside Identity Framework, where you cannot add retries (or what appears to be a missing .Include(x->someTable)), you need to implement a custom SqlAzureExecutionStrategy in your project.My mistake, I shouldn\'t have used a method inside a LINQ query.Correct code:Its in the comments of the answers but nobody has posted this as the actual solution.You just need to add a using statement at the top:The code of Ellbar works! You need only add using.1 - using Microsoft.AspNet.Identity;And... the code of Ellbar:2 - string currentUserId = User.Identity.GetUserId();\nApplicationUser currentUser = db.Users.FirstOrDefault(x => x.Id == currentUserId);With this code (in currentUser), you work the general data of the connected user, if you want extra data... see this linkAs of ASP.NET Identity 3.0.0, This has been refactored intoRight now the asp.mvc project template creates an account controller that gets the usermanager this way:The following works for me:For MVC 5 just look inside the EnableTwoFactorAuthentication method of ManageController in WebApplication template scaffold, its being done there:The answer is right there as suggested by Microsoft itself:It will have all the additional properties you defined in ApplicationUser class.
