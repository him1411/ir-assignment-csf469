Using SQL Server, I have...I want This query isn\'t getting me there. How can I SELECT DISTINCT on just one column?Assuming that you\'re on SQL Server 2005 or greater, you can use a CTE with ROW_NUMBER():The simplest solution would be to use a subquery for finding the minimum ID matching your query. In the subquery you use GROUP BY instead of DISTINCT:try this:EDIT\nonce the OP corrected his samle output (previously had only ONE result row, now has all shown), this is the correct query:I know it was asked over 6 years ago, but knowledge is still knowledge.\nThis is different solution than all above, as I had to run it under SQL Server 2000:Try this:SELECT * FROM [TestData]  WHERE Id IN(SELECT DISTINCT MIN(Id) FROM [TestData] GROUP BY Product)
