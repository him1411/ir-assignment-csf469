After upgrading Eclipse from Helios to Indigo with EGit plugin 1.0.0, all my projects seem to have lost their metadata about their git repositories, respectively.In Helios, every Eclipse project was a git repository on its own. When updating to Indigo, i hoped i could continue using the workspace from Helios. After the update, all projects are still present in the workspace; and in each project directory, there\'s still the .git subdirectory, but Eclipse seems to treat each project as if it wasn\'t a git repository already.So, there\'s still all git metadata in the project folders, but eclipse doesn\'t recognize them. Is there another way to "reactivate" the git functionality?Thanks to Jeremy, i found how to reactivate the repos myself. Basically, two steps were required:The second step won\'t work if the repo isn\'t available in the repository view. So, after an eclipse upgrade, do the following:Select Git Project, and in the next dialogue, select "Use or create Repository in parent folder of project". Important: don\'t try to select the repository from the combo box that\'s visible when "Use or create Repository in parent folder of project" isn\'t selected - it won\'t work.The wizard suggests the local git repository that\'s located in the current project, so just hit Finish.Even after adding git repos I cannot do Team/Share on project, but what helped was to close and open project -  you can also select multiple projects so action is quick
