How can one get the name of the class from a static method in that class. For exampleTo put it in context, I actually want to return the class name as part of a message in an exception.In order to support refactoring correctly (rename class), then you should use either:or (thanks to @James Van Huis):Do what toolkit says. Do not do anything like this:In Java 7+ you can do this in static method/fields:This instruction works fine:You could do something really sweet by using JNI like this:MyObject.java:then:then:MyObject.c:Then compile the C up into a shared library called libclassname.so and run the java!*chuckleI use this to init the Log4j Logger at the top of my classes (or annotate).PRO: Throwable is already loaded and you might save resources by not using the "IO heavy" SecurityManager.CON: Some question as to whether this will work for all JVMs. Abuse the SecurityManagerOr, if not set, use an inner class that extends it (example below shamefully copied from Real\'s HowTo):If you want the entire package name with it, call:If you only want the last element, call:Verbatim use of caller\'s class like MyClass.class.getName() actually does the job, but is prone to copy/paste errors if you propagate this code to numerous classes/subclasses where you need this class name.And Tom Hawtin\'s recipe is in fact not bad, one just needs to cook it the right way :)In case you have a base class with a static method that may be called from subclasses, and this static method needs to know the actual caller\'s class, this may be achieved like the following:A refactoring-safe, cut&paste-safe solution that avoids the definition of ad-hoc classes below.Write a static method that recover the class name having care to include the class name in the method name:then recall it in your static method:Refactoring safety is given by avoiding the use of strings, cut&paste safety is granted because if you cut&paste the caller method you won\'t find the getMyClassName() in the target "MyClass2" class, so you will be forced to redefine and update it.Since the question Something like `this.class` instead of `ClassName.class`? is marked as a duplicate for this one (which is arguable because that question is about the class rather than class name), I\'m posting the answer here:It is important to define thisClass as private because:\n1) it must not be inherited: derived classes must either define their own thisClass or produce an error message\n2) references from other classes should be done as ClassName.class rather than ClassName.thisClass.With thisClass defined, access to the class name becomes:I needed the class name in the static methods of multiple classes so I implemented a JavaUtil Class with the following method :Hope it will help !If you are using reflection, you can get the Method object and then:To get the Method itself, you can probably use:
