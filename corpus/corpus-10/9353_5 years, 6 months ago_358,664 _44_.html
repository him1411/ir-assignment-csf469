I am trying to develop a system where there are different nodes that are run on different system or on different ports on the same system. Now all the nodes create a Socket with a target IP as the IP of a special node known as a bootstrapping node. The nodes then create their own ServerSocket and start listening for connections. The bootstrapping node maintains a list of Nodes and returns them on being queried.Now what I need is the node must register its IP to the bootstrapping node. I tried using cli.getInetAddress() once the client connects to the ServerSocket of bootstrapping node but that didn\'t work.Using the code:orMy PPP Connection IP address is: 117.204.44.192 but the above returns me 192.168.1.2EDITI am using the following code:I am able to get all the IP addresses associated all NetworkInterfaces, but how do I distinguish them? This is the output I am getting:This could be a bit tricky in the most general case.  On the face of it, InetAddress.getLocalHost() should give you the IP address of this host.  The problem is that a host could have lots of network interfaces, and an interface could be bound to more than one IP address.  And to top that, not all IP addresses will be reachable outside of your machine or your LAN.  For example, they could be IP addresses for virtual network devices, private network IP addresses, and so on.What this means is that the IP address returned by InetAddress.getLocalHost() might not be the right one to use.How can you deal with this?In summary, InetAddress.getLocalHost() will typically work, but you may need to provide an alternative method for the cases where your code is run in an environment with "complicated" networking.I am able to get all the IP addresses associated all Network Interfaces, but how do i distinguish them?In fact, the InetAddress API provides methods for testing for loopback, link local, site local, multicast and broadcast addresses.  You can use these to sort out which of the IP addresses you get back is most appropriate.Posting here tested IP ambiguity workaround code from https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCS-40 (InetAddress.getLocalHost() ambiguous on Linux systems):You can use java\'s InetAddress class for this purpose.Output for my system = IP of my system is := 10.100.98.228getHostAddress() returns Returns the IP address string in textual presentation.OR you can also do Output = IP of my system is := RanRag-PC/10.100.98.228This way works well when there are multiple network interfaces. It always returns the preferred outbound IP. The destination 8.8.8.8 is not needed to be reachable. Example in scala (useful in sbt file):EDIT 1: Updated code, since the previous link, exists no moreACTUAL VERSION: This stopped workingHopefully this snippet might help you to achieve this : firstly import the classin classUse InetAddress.getLocalHost() to get the local addressYou can use java.net.InetAddress API.\nTry this : This is a working example of the ACCEPTED answer above!\nThis NetIdentity class will store both the internal host ip, as well as the local loopback. If you\'re on a DNS based server, as mentioned above, you may need to add some more checks, or possible go the Configuration File Route.When I run this code I actually get a print out like this:For my use I\'m setting up a Upnp Server, it helped to understand the \'pattern\' that i was looking for. Some of the objects returned are Ethernet Adapters, Network Adapters, Virtual Network Adapters, Drivers, and VPN Client Adapters. Not everything has an Address either. So you\'ll want to skip out on interface objects that don\'t.You can also add this to the loop for the current NetworkInterface iAnd You\'ll see information in your output much like this:When you are looking for your "local" address, you should note that each machine has not only a single network interface, and each interface could has its own local address. Which means your machine is always owning several "local" addresses.  Different "local" addresses will be automatically chosen to use when you are connecting to different endpoints. For example, when you connect to google.com, you are using an "outside" local address; but when you connect to your localhost, your local address is always localhost itself, because localhost is just a loopback.Below is showing how to find out your local address when you are communicating with google.com:A rather simplistic approach that seems to be working...Usually when i try to find my public IP Address like cmyip.com or www.iplocation.net, i use this way: You may try isReachable() method of InetAddress class to figure out which IP address is your real publicly available IP address. I think other type of addresses (site local,link local) are not reachable from outside.
