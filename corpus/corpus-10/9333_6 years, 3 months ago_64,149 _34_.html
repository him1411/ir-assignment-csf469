But how do I describe how the parameters object should be structured? For example it should be something like:From the @param wiki page:If a parameter is expected to have a particular property, you can document that immediately after the @param tag for that parameter, like so: There used to be a @config tag which immediately followed the corresponding @param, but it appears to have been deprecated (example here). I see that there is already an answer about the @return tag, but I want to give more details about it.First of all, the official JSDoc 3 documentation doesn\'t give us any examples about the @return for a custom object. Please see http://usejsdoc.org/tags-returns.html. Now, let\'s see what we can do until some standard will appear.Function returns object where keys are dynamically generated. Example: {1: \'Pete\', 2: \'Mary\', 3: \'John\'}. Usually, we iterate over this object with the help of for(var key in obj){...}.Possible JSDoc according to https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml#JsTypesFunction returns object where keys are known constants. Example: {id: 1, title: \'Hello world\', type: \'LEARN\', children: {...}}. We can easily access properties of this object: object.id.Possible JSDoc according to https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jsdoc-users/TMvUedK9tC4Fake It.The Full Monty.Define a type.According to https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml#JsTypesThe record type.By now there are 4 different ways to document objects as parameters/types. Each has its own uses. Only 3 of them can be used to document return values, though.For objects with a known set of properties (Variant A)This syntax is ideal for objects that are used only as parameters for this function and don\'t require further description of each property.\nIt can be used for @returns as well.For objects with a known set of properties (Variant B)Most often, you\'ll want to use the parameters with properties syntax:This syntax is ideal for objects that are used only as parameters for this function and that require further description of each property.\nThis can not be used for @returns.For objects that will be used at more than one point in sourceIn this case a @typedef is useful. You can define the type at one point in your source and use it as a type for @param or @returns or other JSDoc tags that can make use of a type.You can then use this in a @param tag:For objects whose values are all the same typeThe first type (string) documents the type of the keys which in JavaScript is always a string or at least will always be coerced to a string. The second type (number) is the type of the value; this can be any type.\nThis syntax can be used for @returns as well.ResourcesUseful information about documenting types can be found here:http://usejsdoc.org/tags-type.htmlPS: to document an optional value you can use []:or:For @return tag use {{field1: Number, field2: String}}, see: http://wiki.servoy.com/display/public/DOCS/Annotating+JavaScript+using+JSDocThere\'s a new @config tag for these cases. They link to the preceding @param.
