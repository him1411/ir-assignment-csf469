I\'m trying to figure out how to execute some js code when an element is removed from the page:is there an event tailored for that, something like:thanks.Just checked, it is already built-in in current version of JQuery:jQuery - v1.9.1jQuery UI - v1.10.2Important: This is functionality of Jquery UI script (not JQuery), so you have to load both scripts (jquery and jquery-ui) to make it work. Here is example: http://jsfiddle.net/72RTz/You can use jQuery special events for this.In all simplicity,Setup:Usage:Addendum to answer Pierre and DesignerGuy\'s comments:To not have the callback fire when calling $(\'.thing\').off(\'destroyed\'), change the if condition to: if (o.handler && o.type !== \'destroyed\') { ... }You can bind to the DOMNodeRemoved event (part of DOM Level 3 WC3 spec).Works in IE9, latest releases of Firefox and Chrome. Example:You can also get notification when elements are inserting by binding to DOMNodeInsertedThere is no built-in event for removing elements, but you can create one by fake-extending jQuery\'s default remove method. Note that the callback must be called before actually removing it to keep reference.Note: some problems with this answer have been outlined by other posters.The most elegant solution to this problem seems to be: https://stackoverflow.com/a/10172676/216941 Hooking .remove() is not the best way to handle this as there are many ways to remove elements from the page (e.g. by using .html(), .replace(), etc).In order to prevent various memory leak hazards, internally jQuery will try to call the function jQuery.cleanData() for each removed element regardless of the method used to remove it.See this answer for more details: javascript memory leaksSo, for best results, you should hook the cleanData function, which is exactly what the jquery.event.destroyed plugin does:http://v3.javascriptmvc.com/jquery/dist/jquery.event.destroyed.jsFor those who use jQuery UI:jQuery UI has overridden some of the jQuery methods to implement a remove event that gets handled not only when you explicitly remove the given element, but also if the element gets removed from the DOM by any self-cleaning jQuery methods (e.g. replace, html, etc.). This basically allows you to put a hook into the same events that get fired when jQuery is "cleaning up" the events and data associated with a DOM element.John Resig has indicated that he\'s open to the idea of implementing this event in a future version of jQuery core, but I\'m not sure where it stands currently.I like mtkopone\'s answer using jQuery special events, but note that it doesn\'t work a) when elements are detached instead of removed or b) when some old non-jquery libraries use innerHTML to destroy your elementsI couldn\'t get this answer to work with unbinding (despite the update see here), but was able to figure out a way around it.  The answer was to create a \'destroy_proxy\' special event that triggered a \'destroyed\' event.  You put the event listener on both \'destroyed_proxy\' and \'destroyed\', then when you want to unbind, you just unbind the \'destroyed\' event:Here is a fiddleI\'m not sure there is an event handle for this, so you would have to keep a copy of the DOM and compare to the existing DOM in some kind of polling loop - which could be quite nasty. Firebug does this though - if you inspect the HTML and run some DOM-changes, it highlights the changes in yellow in the Firebug console for a short time.Alternatively, you could create a remove function...Another approach is to periodically check if element is still part of the DOM by checking if it has a parent node.\nIf you have no idea when the element might be removed, you can use an interval:http://codepen.io/oriadam/pen/QEQGjqPros: Cons:This is how to create a jQuery live remove listener:Or:(I have extracted this extension from the jQuery UI framework)Works with: empty() and html() and remove()With this solution you can also unbind the event handler.Try it! - ExampleAdditional Demo - jsBinreferencing to @David answer:When You want to do soo with another function, eg. html() like in my case, don\'t forget to add return in new function:This.
