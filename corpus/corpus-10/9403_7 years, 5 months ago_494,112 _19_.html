I\'ve been trying to figure out how I can make a query with MySQL that checks if the value (string $haystack ) in a certain column contains certain data (string $needle), like this:In PHP, the function is called substr($haystack, $needle), so maybe:Quite simple actually:The % is a wildcard for any character. Do note that this can get slow on very large datasets so if your database grows you\'ll need to use fulltext indices.Use:Reference:Mine is using LOCATE in mysql:LOCATE(substr,str), LOCATE(substr,str,pos)This function is multi-byte safe, and is case-sensitive only if at least one argument is a binary string.In your case:In addition to the answer from @WoLpH.When using the LIKE keyword you also have the ability to limit which direction the string matches. For example:If you were looking for a string that starts with your $needle:If you were looking for a string that ends with the $needle:be aware that this is dangerous: do first:so it will prevent possible attacks.You probably are looking for find_in_set function:This function acts like in_array function in PHP
