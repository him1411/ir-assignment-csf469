I am a complete JSP beginner.  I am trying to use a java.util.List in a JSP page.  What do I need to do to use classes other than ones in java.lang?Use the following import statement to import java.util.List:BTW, to import more than one class, use the following format:FYI - if you are importing a List into a JSP, chances are pretty good that you are violating MVC principles.  Take a few hours now to read up on the MVC approach to web app development (including use of taglibs) - do some more googling on the subject, it\'s fascinating and will definitely help you write better apps.If you are doing anything more complicated than a single JSP displaying some database results, please consider using a framework like Spring, Grails, etc...  It will absolutely take you a bit more effort to get going, but it will save you so much time and effort down the road that I really recommend it.  Besides, it\'s cool stuff :-)In the page tag:Use Page Directive to import a Class in JSP page.\nPage Directive Uses 11 Different types of Attributes , One of them is "import".\nPage Directive with import Attribute Allows you to Mention more than one package at the same place separated by Commas(,). Alternatively you can have multiple instances of page element each one with Different package .For Example:Note : the import attribute should be placed before the element that calls the importd class .This is the syntax to import classesIn case you use JSTL and you wish to import a class in a tag page instead of a jsp page, the syntax is a little bit different. Replace the word \'page\' with the word \'tag\'.Instead of Sandman\'s correct answeruse
