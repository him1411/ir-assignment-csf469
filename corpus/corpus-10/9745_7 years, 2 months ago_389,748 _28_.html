lets assume this URL...(Here id needs to be sent in a POST request)I want to send the id = 10 to the server\'s page.php, which accepts it in a POST method.How can i do this from within Java?I tried this :But I still can\'t figure out how to send it via POSTSince some of the classes, in the original answer, are deprecated in the newer version of Apache HTTP Components, I\'m posting this update.By the way, you can access the full documentation for more examples here.I recommend to use Apache HttpClient. its faster and easier to implement.for more information check this url: http://hc.apache.org/Sending a POST request is easy in vanilla Java. Starting with a URL, we need t convert it to a URLConnection using url.openConnection();. After that, we need to cast it to a HttpURLConnection, so we can access its setRequestMethod() method to set our method. We finally say that we are going to send data over the connection.We then need to state what we are going to send:A normal POST coming from a http form has a well defined format. We need to convert our input to this format:We can then attach our form contents to the http request with proper headers and send it.We can also send json using java, this is also easy:Remember that different servers accept different content-types for json, see this question.Sending files can be considered more challenging to handle as the format is more complex. We are also going to add support for sending the files as a string, since we don\'t want to buffer the file fully into the memory.For this, we define some helper methods:We can then use these methods to create a multipart post request as follows:The first answer was great, but I had to add try/catch to avoid Java compiler errors.\nAlso, I had troubles to figure how to read the HttpResponse with Java libraries.  Here is the more complete code :A simple way using Apache HTTP Components isTake a look at the Fluent APIPosting code that can send form data in post requests and works even on Java 7simplest way to send parameters with the post request:You have done. now you can use responsePOST.\nGet response content as string:Call HttpURLConnection.setRequestMethod("POST") and HttpURLConnection.setDoOutput(true); Actually only the latter is needed as POST then becomes the default method.I recomend use http-request built on apache http api.
