I am working on a local git repository. There are two branches, master and feature_x.I want to push feature_x to the remote repo, but I do not want to push the changes on the master branch.Will a git push origin feature_x from my feature_x branch (feature_x branch already exists on remote) work?I do not want to test this on my box, because I cannot push to master right now.yes, just do the followingBy default git push updates all the remote branches. But you can configure git to update only the current branch to it\'s upstream.It means git will update only the current (checked out) branch when you do git push.Other valid options are:Minor update on top of Karthik Bose\'s answer - you can configure git globally, to affect all of your workspaces to behave that way:So let\'s say you have a local branch foo, a remote called origin and a remote branch origin/master.To push the contents of foo to origin/master, you first need to set its upstream:Then you can push to this branch using:In the last command you can add --force to replace the entire history of origin/master with that of foo.
