I\'m having some trouble getting two different SSH keys/GitHub accounts to play well together.  I have the following setup:Repos accessible from one account using git@github.com:accountnameRepos accessible from another account using git@github.com:anotheraccountEach account has its own SSH key.  Both SSH keys have been added and I have created a config file.  I don\'t believe the config file is correct though.  I\'m not quite sure how to specify that repos accessed using git@github.com:accountname should use id_rsa and git@github.com:anotheraccount should use id_rsa_anotheraccount.  Andy Lester\'s response is accurate but I found an important extra step I needed to make to get this to work. In trying to get two profiles set up, one for personal and one for work, my ~/.ssh/config was roughly as follows:My work profile didn\'t take until I did a ssh-add ~/.ssh/work_rsa. After that connections to github used the correct profile. Previously they defaulted to the first public key.For Could not open a connection to your authentication agent when using ssh-add,check:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/17695338/1760313I recently had to do this and had to sift through all these answers and their comments to eventually piece the information together, so I\'ll put it all here, in one post, for your convenience:\nStep 1: ssh keys \nCreate any keypairs you\'ll need. In this example I\'ve named me default/original \'id_rsa\' (which is the default) and my new one \'id_rsa-work\':\nStep 2: ssh config \nSet up multiple ssh profiles by creating/modifying ~/.ssh/config. Note the slightly differing \'Host\' values:\nStep 3: ssh-add \nYou may or may not have to do this. To check, list identity fingerprints by running:If your entries aren\'t there then run:\nStep 4: test \nTo test you\'ve done this all correctly, I suggest the following quick check:Note that you\'ll have to change the hostname (github / work.github) depending on what key/identity you\'d like to use. But now you should be good to go! :)Let\'s say alice is a github.com user, with 2 or more private repositories repoN.\nFor this example we\'ll work with just two repositories named repo1 and repo2https://github.com/alice/repo1https://github.com/alice/repo2You need to be to pull from these repositories without entering a passwords probably on a server, or on multiple servers.\nYou want to perform git pull origin master for example, and you want this to happen without asking for a password.You don\'t like dealing with ssh-agent, you have discovered (or you\'re discovering now) about ~/.ssh/config a file that let\'s your ssh client know what private key to use depending on Hostname and username, with a simple configuration entry that looks like this:So you went ahead and created your (alice_github.id_rsa, alice_github.id_rsa.pub) keypair, you then also went to your repository\'s .git/config file and you modified the url of your remote origin to be something like this:And finally you went to the repository Settings > Deploy keys section and added the contents of alice_github.id_rsa.pubAt this point you could do your git pull origin master without entering a password without issue.So your instinct will be to grab that key and add it to repo2\'s Deploy keys, but github.com will error out and tell you that the key is already being used.Now you go and generate another key (using ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "alice@alice.com" without passwords of course), and so that this doesn\'t become a mess, you will now name your keys like this:You will now put the new public key on repo2\'s Deploy keys configuration at github.com, but now you have an ssh problem to deal with. Your .ssh/config file points to github.com and it doesn\'t know which key to use when it\'s time to do the pull.So I found a trick with github.com. You can tell your ssh client that each repository lives in a different github.com subdomain, in these cases, they will be repo1.github.com and repo2.github.comSo first thing is editing the .git/config files on your repo clones, so they look like this instead:For repo1For repo2And then, on your .ssh/config file, now you will be able to enter a configuration for each subdomain :)Now you are able to git pull origin master without entering any passwords from both repositories.If you have multiple machines, you could copy the keys to each of the machines and reuse them, but I\'d advise doing the leg work to generate 1 key per machine and repo. You will have a lot more keys to handle, but you will be less vulnerable if one gets compromised.Use the IdentityFile parameter in your ~/.ssh/config:I have 2 accounts on github, and here is what I did (on linux) to make it work.~/.ssh/configSet remote url for repo:Options in ~/.ssh/config:Host github-<identify_specific_user> \nHost could be any value that could identify a host plus an account,\nit don\'t need to be a real host,\ne.g\n    github-kc identify one of my account on github for my local \nlaptop,When set remote url for a git repo, this is the value to put after git@, that\'s how a repo maps to a Host, e.g git remote set-url origin git@github-kc:kuchaguangjie/pygtrans.gitIn my case none of the solutions above solved my issue, but ssh-agent does.  Basically, I did the following:Generate key pair using ssh-keygen shown below.  It will generate a key pair (in this example .\\keyfile and .\\keyfile.pub)ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "yourname@yourdomain" -f keyfileUpload keyfile.pub to the git providerI used,It wokred fine.Use the above setting in your .ssh/config file for different rsa keys for different usernames.As a complement of @stefano \'s answer,\nIt is better to use command with -f when generate a new SSH key for another account, Since id_rsa_work file doesn\'t exist in path ~/.ssh/, and I create this file manually, and it doesn\'t work :( I use shell scripts to switch me to whatever account I want to be "active". Essentially you start from a fresh start, get one account configured properly and working, then move the these files to a name with the proper prefix. From then on you can use the command "github", or "gitxyz" to switch:I\'ve had great luck with this. I also created a run script in Xcode (for you Mac users) so it would not build my project unless I had the proper setting (since its using git):Run Script placed after Dependencies:I spent a lot time to understand all the steps. So lets describe step by step:Add new section in .ssh/config:Host proj1.github.com\n   HostName github.com\n   PreferredAuthentications publickey\n   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_proj1Take into account the first section and note that proj1.github.com we will back to the section later.A good tutorial.Don\'t mess up with hosts
