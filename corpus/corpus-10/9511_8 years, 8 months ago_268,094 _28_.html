Given a #, how do I discover in what table and column it could be found within?I don\'t care if it\'s fast, it just needs to work.This might help you. - from Narayana Vyas. It searches all columns of all tables in a given database. I have used it before and it works.This is the Stored Proc from the above link - the only change I made was substituting the temp table for a table variable so you don\'t have to remember to drop it each time.Based on bnkdev\'s answer I modified Narayana\'s Code to search all columns even numeric ones.It\'ll run slower, but this version actually finds all matches not just those found in text columns.I can\'t thank this guy enough. Saved me days of searching by hand!If you need to run such search only once then you can probably go with any of the scripts already shown here. But otherwise, I\xe2\x80\x99d recommend using ApexSQL Search for this. It\xe2\x80\x99s a free SSMS addin and it really saved me a lot of time.Before running any of the scripts above you should customize it based on the data type you want to seerach. If you know you are searching for datetime column then there is no need to search through nvarchar columns. This will speed up all of the queries above.This is my independent take on this question that I use for my own work.  It works in SQL2000 and greater, allows wildcards, column filtering, and will search most of the normal data types.A pseudo-code description could be select * from * where any like \'foo\'I don\'t put it in proc form since I don\'t want to maintain it across hundreds of DBs and it\'s really for ad-hoc work anyway.  Please feel free to comment on bug-fixes.I optimized Allain Lalonde answer (https://stackoverflow.com/a/436676/412368).\nNumeric values are still supported. Should be roughly 4-5 times faster (1:03 vs 4:30), tested on a desktop with a 7GB database. http://developer.azurewebsites.net/2015/01/mssql-searchalltables/Thanks for the really useful script.You may need to add the following modification to the code if your tables have non-convertable fields:ChrisYou probably have to write a short script to query the metadata (in this case a list of tables/columns) from the database, and issue a series of select statements looking for the value.It\'s my way to resolve this question. Tested on SQLServer2008R2I have a solution from a while ago that I kept improving. Also searches within XML columns if told to do so, or searches integer values if providing a integer only string.Source:\nhttp://fullparam.wordpress.com/2012/09/07/fck-it-i-am-going-to-search-all-tables-all-collumns/Another way using JOIN and CURSOR:Here, very sweet and small solution:==========================I wrote once a tool for myself to do exactly that thing:a7 SqlToolsIt\'s free and open-source:github linkYou might need to build an inverted index for your database. It is assured to be pretty fast.
