How do I check if a number is positive or negative in C#?Of course no-one\'s actually given the correct answer,OVERKILL!The Math.Sign method is one way to go. It will return -1 for negative numbers, 1 for positive numbers, and 0 for values equal to zero (i.e. zero has no sign). Double and single precision variables will cause an exception (ArithmeticException) to be thrown if they equal NaN.This is the industry standard:You youngins and your fancy less-than signs.Back in my day we had to use Math.abs(num) != num //number is negative !Native programmer\'s version. Behaviour is correct for little-endian systems.Do not ever use this.or use "else ifs"For a 32-bit signed integer, such as System.Int32, aka int in C#:You just have to compare if the value & its absolute value are equal:This code takes advantage of SIMD instructions to improve performance.
