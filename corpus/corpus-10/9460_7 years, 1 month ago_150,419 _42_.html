What is the difference between these three events? Upon googling I found thatThe KeyDown event is triggered when\n  the user presses a Key.The KeyUp event is triggered when the\n  user releases a Key.The KeyPress event is triggered when\n  the user presses & releases a Key. \n  (onKeyDown followed by onKeyUp)I understand the first two, but isn\'t KeyPress the same as KeyUp? (or is it possible to release a key(KeyUp) without pressing(KeyDown) it?)This is a bit confusing, can someone clear this up for me?Check here the archived copy\n(as of 2017-09-05, the original link is no longer accessible, but leaving it here since it was part of the original answer):\nhttp://www.bloggingdeveloper.com/post/KeyPress-KeyDown-KeyUp-The-Difference-Between-Javascript-Key-Events.aspxFrom that link:In theory, the keydown and keyup\n  events represent keys being pressed or\n  released, while the keypress event\n  represents a character being typed.\n  The implementation of the theory is\n  not same in all browsers.KeyPress, KeyUp and KeyDown are analagous to, respectively, Click, MouseUp, and MouseDown.The *Down happens first, the *Press happens second (when text is entered), and the *Up happens last (when text input is complete).The exception is webkit, which has an extra event in there:onkeydown is fired when the key is down (like in shortcuts; for example, in Ctrl+A, Ctrl is held \'down\'.onkeyup is fired when the key is released (including modifier/etc keys)onkeypress is fired as a combination of onkeydown and onkeyup, or depending on keyboard repeat (when onkeyup isn\'t fired). (this repeat behaviour is something that I haven\'t tested. If you do test, add a comment!)textInput (webkit only) is fired when some text is entered (for example, Shift+A would enter uppercase \'A\', but Ctrl+A would select text and not enter any text input. In that case, all other events are fired)It seems that onkeypress and onkeydown make the same (whithin the small difference of shortcut keys already mentioned above).You can try this:And you will see that the events onkeypress and onkeydown are both triggered while the key is pressed and not when the key is pressed.The difference is that the event is triggered not once but many times (as long as you hold the key pressed).If you use some of these events be aware and handle how many times your code is run.And sorry for my English the lessons were poor.The onkeypress event works for all the keys except ALT, CTRL, SHIFT, ESC in all browsers where as onkeydown event works for all keys. Means onkeydown event captures all the keys.Most of the answers here are focused more on theory than practical matters and there\'s some big differences between keyup and keypress as it pertains to input field values, at least in Firefox (tested in 43).If the user types 1 into an empty input element:The value of the input element will be an empty string (old value) inside the keypress handlerThe value of the input element will be 1 (new value) inside the keyup handler.This is of critical importance if you are doing something that relies on knowing the new value after the input rather than the current value such as inline validation or auto tabbing.Scenario:When the keypress event fires after entering the letter A, the text box now contains only the letter A.But:So it seems that the browser (Firefox 43) erases the user\'s selection, then fires the keypress event, then updates the fields contents, then fires keyup.Basically, these events act differently on different browser type and version, I created a little jsBin test and you can check the console for find out how these events behavior for your targeted environment, hope this help. http://jsbin.com/zipivadu/10/editOn the one hand, there\'s obvious meaning: onKeyDown fires when a key is pushed down, onKeyUp fires when a pushed button is released, onKeyPress fires when a key is pushed and released.On the the other hand, some keys fire some of them and don\'t fire others. For instance, KeyPress ignores delete, arrows, home/end, ctrl, alt, shift etc while KeyDown and KeyUp don\'t.Finally, there\'s some pragmatics. For handling arrows, you\'ll probably need to use onKeyDown: if a user holds "down" KeyDown fires several times (and KeyPress fires only once!). Also, in some cases you can easily prevent propagation of KeyDown but can\'t (or can\'t that easily) prevent propagation of KeyUp (for instance, if you want to submit on enter without adding newline to the text field). If you\'d like to adjust height of a text area to the content, you probably won\'t use onKeyDown but rather onKeyPress. I\'ve used all 3 in my project but unfortunately may have forgotten some of pragmatics.This article by  Jan Wolter is the best piece I have came across, you can find the archived copy here.It explains all browser key events really well,The keydown event occurs when the key is pressed, followed immediately by the keypress event. Then the keyup event is generated when the key is released.To understand the difference between keydown and keypress, it is useful to distinguish between characters and keys. A key is a physical button on the computer\'s keyboard. A character is a symbol typed by pressing a button. On a US keyboard, hitting the 4 key while holding down the Shift key typically produces a "dollar sign" character. This is not necessarily the case on every keyboard in the world. In theory, the keydown and keyup events represent keys being pressed or released, while the keypress event represents a character being typed. In practice, this is not always the way it is implemented.For a while, some browers fired an additional event, called textInput, immediately after keypress. Early versions of the DOM 3 standard intended this as a replacement for the keypress event, but the whole notion was later revoked. Webkit supported this between versions 525 and 533, and I\'m told IE supported it, but I never detected that, possibly because Webkit required it to be called textInput while IE called it textinput.There is also an event called input, supported by all browsers, which is fired just after a change is made to to a textarea or input field. Typically keypress will fire, then the typed character will appear in the text area, then input will fire. The input event doesn\'t actually give any information about what key was typed - you\'d have to inspect the textbox to figure it out what changed - so we don\'t really consider it a key event and don\'t really document it here. Though it was originally defined only for textareas and input boxes, I believe there is some movement toward generalizing it to fire on other types of objects as well.
