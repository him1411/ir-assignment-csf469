How do I enable the MySQL function that logs each SQL query statement received from clients and the time that query statement has submitted?\nCan I do that in phpmyadmin or NaviCat?\nHow do I analyse the log?First, Remember that this logfile can grow very large on a busy server.For mysql < 5.1.29:To enable the query log, put this in /etc/my.cnf in the [mysqld] sectionAlso, to enable it from MySQL consoleSee http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/query-log.htmlFor mysql 5.1.29+With mysql 5.1.29+ , the log option is deprecated. To specify the logfile and enable logging, use this in my.cnf in the [mysqld] section:Alternately, to turn on logging from MySQL console (must also specify log file location somehow, or find the default location):Also note that there are additional options to log only slow queries, or those which do not use indexes.  Take a look on this answer to another related question. It shows how to enable, disable and to see the logs on live servers without restarting.Log all queries in mysqlHere is a summary:If you don\'t want or cannot restart the MySQL server you can proceed like this on your running server:Create your log tables (see answer)Enable Query logging on the database\n(Note that the string \'table\' should be put literally and not substituted by any table name. Thanks Nicholas Pickering)I use this method for logging when I want to quickly optimize different page loads. \nIt\'s a little tip...Logging to a TABLE You can then select from my mysql.general_log table to retrieve recent queries. I can then do something similar to tail -f on the mysql.log, but with more refinements...This makes it easy to see my queries that I can try and cut back. I use 8 seconds interval to only fetch queries executed within the last 8 seconds.You can disable or enable the general query log (which logs all queries) withThis was already in a comment, but deserves its own answer:\nIn mysql, as root, doDon\'t forget to turn it off afterwards.There is bug in MySQL 5.6 version.\nEven mysqld show as :Realy settings are reading in following order :Check file: "C:\\ProgramData\\MySQL\\MySQL Server 5.6\\my.ini"Hope it help somebody.On Windows you can simply go to Insert this line in my.iniThe my.ini file finally looks like thisI also wanted to enable the mysql log file to see the queries and i have resolved this with the below instructions1 - Go to /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d \n2 - open the mysqld.cnf \nand enable the below linesgeneral_log_file        = /var/log/mysql/mysql.log \ngeneral_log             = 13 - restart the mysql with this  command /etc/init.d/mysql restart \n4 - go to /var/log/mysql/ and check the logsfor mysql>=5.5 only for slow queries (1 second and more)\nmy.cfgTo enable the query log in MAC Machine:Open the following file:Set the query log url under \'mysqld\' section as follows:Few machine\xe2\x80\x99s are not logging query properly, So that case you can enable it from MySQL consoleNot exactly an answer to the question because the question already has great answers.  This is a side info.  Enabling general_log really put a dent on MySQL performance.  I left general_log =1 accidentally on a production server and spent hours finding out why performance was not comparable to a similar setup on other servers.  Then I found this which explains the impact of enabling general log. http://www.fromdual.com/general_query_log_vs_mysql_performance.Gist of the story, don\'t put general_log=1 in the .cnf file.  Instead use set global general_log =1 for a brief duration just to log enough to find out what you are trying to find out and then turn it off. In phpMyAdmin 4.0, you go to Status > Monitor. In there you can enable the slow query log and general log, see a live monitor, select a portion of the graph, see the related queries and analyse them.I had to drop and recreate the general log at one point. During the recreation, character sets got messed up and I ended up having this error in the logs:[ERROR] Incorrect definition of table mysql.general_log: expected the type of column \'user_host\' at position 1 to have character set \'utf8\' but found character set \'latin1\'So if the standard answer of "check to make sure logging is on" doesn\'t work for you, check to make sure your fields have the right character set.
