I have a html form which has a select list box from which you can select multiple values because its multiple property is set to multiple. Consider form method is \'GET\'. The html code for the form is as follows:I want to display the selected values in select list box on display.php page. So how are the selected values accessed on display.php page using $_GET[] array.If you want PHP to treat $_GET[\'select2\'] as an array of options just add square brackets to the name of the select element like this: <select name="select2[]" multiple \xe2\x80\xa6Then you can acces the array in your PHP script$_GET may be substituted by $_POST depending on the <form method="\xe2\x80\xa6" value.Change:To:Use the following program for select the multiple values from select box.multi.phpvalue.phpYou can use this code to retrieve values from multiple select combo boxHTML:PHP:    You can iterate it directly like thisor you can do it like thisThis will display the selected values:I fix my problem with javascript + HTML. First i check selected options and save its in a hidden field of my form:Next, i get by post that field and get all the string ;-)\nI hope it\'ll be work for somebody more. Thanks to all.You could do like this too. It worked out for me.Then take the multiple selection from following PHP code below. It print the selected multiple values accordingly.
