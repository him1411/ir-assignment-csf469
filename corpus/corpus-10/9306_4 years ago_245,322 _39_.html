How do I change the Navigation Bar color in iOS 7?Basically I want to achieve something like the Twitter Nav Bar (updated Twitter for iOS7 that is). I embedded-in a nav bar atop a view controller. All I want is to change the nav bar color to light blue along with the utility bar at the top. I can\'t seem to find an option in my storyboard.The behavior of tintColor for bars has changed in iOS 7.0. It no longer affects the bar\'s background.From the documentation:barTintColor Class Reference The tint color to apply to the navigation bar background.Discussion\nThis color is made translucent by default unless you set the translucent property to NO.Availability Available in iOS 7.0 and later.  Declared In\nUINavigationBar.hWe can also use this to check iOS Version as mention in  iOS 7 UI Transition GuideEDIT\nUsing xib  I know this question was asked, and answered, more than a year ago, but...Doing what the original question asked\xe2\x80\x94to get the old Twitter\'s Nav Bar look, blue background with white text\xe2\x80\x94is very easy to do just using the Interface Builder in Xcode.That should get you what you want. Here is a screenshot that would make it easier to see where to make the changes.Note that changing only the Bar Tint doesn\'t change the text colour in the Navigation Bar or the Status Bar. The Style also needs to be changed.In a Navigation based app you can put the code in AppDelegate. A more detailed code could be:In viewDidLoad, set: Change ( blueColor ) to whatever color you\'d like. If you want to use a hex code, here is the best way to do so. First, define this at the top of your class:Then inside the "application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions", put this:Put you hex code in place of the 00b0f0.If you need to support ios6 and ios7 then you get that particular light blue using this in your UIViewController:In iOS 7 you must use the -barTintColor property:It\'s actually easier than the answers I\'ve seen here:I hope this helps somebody. I didn\'t like the answers I saw. I like to keep my code as clean as possible. Not saying that it\'s wrong to do it programmatically, but there are people out there like me....this is for you guys.\nFor swift change navigation bar color:change title font,size, color:To make Rajneesh071\'s code complete, you may also want to set the navigation bar\'s title color (and font, if you want) since the default behavior changed from iOS 6 to 7:Add only This code in your ViewContorller or in your AppDelegateIn a navigation based application you can change colorThis question and these answers are helpful. With them I was able to set my desired dark blue navigationBar color with white title and button text.But I also needed to change the clock, carrier, signal strength, etc. to white. Black just didn\'t contrast enough with the dark blue. I may have overlooked that solution in one of the previous answers, but I was able to make that change by adding this line to my top level viewController\'s viewDidLoad:For Color :For Image
