Not obvious from the flask documention on how to get the query string. I am new, looked at the docs, could not find!   SoThe full URL is available as request.url, and the query string is available as request.query_string.Here\'s an example:To access an individual known param passed in the query string, you can use request.args.get(\'param\'). This is the "right" way to do it, as far as I know.ETA: Before you go further, you should ask yourself why you want the query string. I\'ve never had to pull in the raw string - Flask has mechanisms for accessing it in an abstracted way. You should use those unless you have a compelling reason not to.Werkzeug/Flask as already parsed everything for you. No need to do the same work again with urlparse:The full documentation for the request and response objects is in Werkzeug: http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/docs/wrappers/We can do this by using request.query_string.Example:Lets consider view.pyYou also make it more modular by using Flask Blueprints - http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/blueprints/Lets consider first name is being passed as a part of query string\n/web_url/?first_name=johnAs you see this is just a small example - you can fetch multiple values + formate those and use it or pass it onto the template file.
