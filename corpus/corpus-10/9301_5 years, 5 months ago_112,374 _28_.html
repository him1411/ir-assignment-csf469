I have an app that runs on the iPhone and iPod Touch, it can run on the Retina iPad and everything but there needs to be one adjustment. I need to detect if the current device is an iPad. What code can I use to detect if the user is using an iPad in my UIViewController and then change something accordingly?There are quite a few ways to check if a device is an iPad. This is my favorite way to check whether the device is in fact an iPad:For a Swift solution, see this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/27517536/2057171In Swift you can use the following equalities to determine the kind of device:Usage would then be something like:This is part of UIDevice as of iOS 3.2, e.g.:You can also use thisUI_USER_INTERFACE_IDIOM() only returns iPad if the app is for iPad or Universal. If its an iPhone app being ran on an iPad then it won\'t. So you should instead check the model.Be Careful: If your app is targeting iPhone device only, iPad running with iphone compatible mode will return false for below statement:The right way to detect physical iPad device is:I found that this didn\'t work for me in the Simulator within Xcode 4.5Also in the \'Other Examples\' in Xcode the device model comes back as \'iPad Simulator\' so the above tweak should sort that out.Many ways to do that in Swift:We check the model below (we can only do a case sensitive search here):We check the model below (we can do a case sensitive/insensitive search here):UIDevice.currentDevice().userInterfaceIdiom below only returns iPad if the app is for iPad or Universal. If it is an iPhone app being ran on an iPad then it won\'t. So you should instead check the model. :This snippet below does not compile if the class does not inherit of an UIViewController, otherwise it works just fine. Regardless UI_USER_INTERFACE_IDIOM() only returns iPad if the app is for iPad or Universal. If it is an iPhone app being ran on an iPad then it won\'t. So you should instead check the model. :*In swift 3.0*You can check the rangeOfString to see of the word iPad exists like this.Yet another Swifty way:Usage:For the latest versions of iOS, simply add UITraitCollection:and then within UIViewController just check:Why so complicated? This is how I do it...Swift 4:This way you can just say if iPad {}
