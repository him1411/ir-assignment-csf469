I\'m starting with input data like thisWhich when printed appears as this:Grouping is simple enough:and printing yields a GroupBy object:But what I want eventually is another DataFrame object that contains all the rows in the GroupBy object. In other words I want to get the following result:I can\'t quite see how to accomplish this in the pandas documentation. Any hints would be welcome.g1 here is a DataFrame. It has a hierarchical index, though:Perhaps you want something like this?Or something like:I want to little bit change answer by Wes, because version 0.16.2 need set as_index=False. If you don\'t set it, you get empty dataframe.Source:Aggregation functions will not return the groups that you are aggregating over if they are named columns, when as_index=True, the default. The grouped columns will be the indices of the returned object.Passing as_index=False will return the groups that you are aggregating over, if they are named columns.Aggregating functions are ones that reduce the dimension of the returned objects, for example: mean, sum, size, count, std, var, sem, describe, first, last, nth, min, max. This is what happens when you do for example DataFrame.sum() and get back a Series.  nth can act as a reducer or a filter, see here.EDIT:In version 0.17.1 and later you can use subset in count and reset_index with parameter name in size:Differences between count and size in SO Documentation.Simply, this should do the task:Here, grouped_df.size() pulls up the unique groupby count, and reset_index() method resets the name of the column you want it to be.\nFinally, the pandas Dataframe() function is called upon to create DataFrame object. I found this worked for me.Maybe I misunderstand the question but if you want to convert the groupby back to a dataframe you can use .to_frame(). I wanted to reset the index when I did this so I included that part as well. example code unrelated to question
