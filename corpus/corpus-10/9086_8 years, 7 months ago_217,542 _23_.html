I\'ve deleted some records from a table in a SQL Server database. Now the ID\'s go from 101 to 1200. I want to delete the records again, but I want the ID\'s to go back to 102. Is there a way to do this in SQL Server?Issue the following command to reseed mytable to start at 1:Read about it in the Books on Line (BOL, SQL help). Also be careful that you don\'t have records higher than the seed you are setting.if number=0 then in the next insert the auto increment field will contain value 1if number=101 then in the next insert the auto increment field will contain value 102Some additional info... May be useful to you\nBefore giving auto increment number in above query, you have to make sure your existing table\'s auto increment column contain values less that number.To get the maximum value of a column(column_name) from a table(table1), you can use following querysemi idiot-proof:http://sqlserverplanet.com/tsql/using-dbcc-checkident-to-reseed-a-table-after-deleteTry this:Delete and Reseed all the tables in a database.Based on the accepted answer, for those who encountered a similar issue, with full schema qualification:([MyDataBase].[MySchemaName].[MyTable])... results in an error, you need to be in the context of that DBThat is, the following will throw an error:Enclose the fully-qualified table name with single quotes instead:You do not want to do this in general. Reseed can create data integrity problems. It is really only for use on development systems where you are wiping out all test data and starting over. It should not be used on a production system in case all related records have not been deleted (not every table that should be in a foreign key relationship is!). You can create a mess doing this and especially if you mean to do it on a regular basis after every delete. It is a bad idea to worry about gaps in you identity field values.I figured it out. It\'s:Several answers recommend using a statement something like this:But the OP said "deleted some records", which may not be all of them, so a value of 0 is not always the right one. Another answer suggested automatically finding the maximum current value and reseeding to that one, but that runs into trouble if there are no records in the table, and thus max() will return NULL. A comment suggested using simplyto reset the value, but another comment correctly stated that this only increases the value to the maximum already in the table; this will not reduce the value if it is already higher than the maximum in the table, which is what the OP wanted to do.A better solution combines these ideas. The first CHECKIDENT resets the value to 0, and the second resets it to the highest value currently in the table, in case there are records in the table:As multiple comments have indicated, make sure there are no foreign keys in other tables pointing to the deleted records. Otherwise those foreign keys will point at records you create after reseeding the table, which is almost certainly not what you had in mind.
