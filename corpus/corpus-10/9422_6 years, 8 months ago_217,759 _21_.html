What is the most correct way to include another XHTML page in an XHTML page? I have been trying different ways, none of them are working.Most basic way is <ui:include>. The included content must be placed inside <ui:composition>. Kickoff example of the master page /page.xhtml:The include page /WEB-INF/include.xhtml (yes, this is the file in its entirety, any tags outside <ui:composition> are unnecessary as they are ignored by Facelets anyway):This needs to be opened by /page.xhtml. Do note that you don\'t need to repeat <html>, <h:head> and <h:body> inside the include file as that would otherwise result in invalid HTML.You can use a dynamic EL expression in <ui:include src>. See also How to ajax-refresh dynamic include content by navigation menu? (JSF SPA).A more advanced way of including is templating. This includes basically the other way round. The master template page should use <ui:insert> to declare places to insert defined template content. The template client page which is using the master template page should use <ui:define> to define the template content which is to be inserted.Master template page /WEB-INF/template.xhtml (as a design hint: the header, menu and footer can in turn even be <ui:include> files):Template client page /page.xhtml (note the template attribute; also here, this is the file in its entirety):This needs to be opened by /page.xhtml. If there is no <ui:define>, then the default content inside <ui:insert> will be displayed instead, if any. You can pass parameters to <ui:include> or <ui:composition template> by <ui:param>.Inside the include/template file, it\'ll be available as #{foo}. In case you need to pass "many" parameters to <ui:include>, then you\'d better consider registering the include file as a tagfile, so that you can ultimately use it like so <my:tagname foo="#{bean.foo}">. See also When to use <ui:include>, tag files, composite components and/or custom components?You can even pass whole beans, methods and parameters via <ui:param>. See also JSF 2: how to pass an action including an argument to be invoked to a Facelets sub view (using ui:include and ui:param)?The files which aren\'t supposed to be publicly accessible by just entering/guessing its URL, need to be placed in /WEB-INF folder, like as the include file and the template file in above example. See also Which XHTML files do I need to put in /WEB-INF and which not?There doesn\'t need to be any markup (HTML code) outside <ui:composition> and <ui:define>. You can put any, but they will be ignored by Facelets. Putting markup in there is only useful for web designers.

You should see XHTML as a language which allows you to produce HTML output using a XML based tool.
