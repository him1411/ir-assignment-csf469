I keep having trouble with debugging problems in KnockoutJS templates.Say I want to bind to a property called "items" but in the template I make a typo and bind to the (non existing) property "item".Using the Chrome debugger only tells me:"item" is not defined.Are there tools, techniques or coding styles that help me get more information about the binding problem?One thing that I do quite often when there is an issue with what data is available at a certain scope is to replace the template/section with something like:Or, if you want a slightly more readable version:This will spit out the data that is being bound at that scope and let you make sure that you are nesting things appropriately.  Update: as of KO 2.1, you can simplify it to:Now the arguments are passed on to JSON.stringify.If you are using Chrome for development, there is a really great extension (with which I\'m not affiliated) called Knockoutjs context debugger that shows you the binding context directly in the Developer Tools\' Elements panel.I found another one that can be helpfull. I was debugging some bindings and tried using Ryans example. I got an error that JSON found a circular loop.But, using this approach a replaced the data-bind value with the following:Now if i click on the PRE element while having the chrome debug window open, I get a nicely filled scope variables window.Found a little better way for it:Define a bindingHandler once, somewhere in your JavaScript library files.than simply use it likes this:AdvantagesThis trick is a combination of Chrome\'s $0-$4 feature and KnockoutJS\'s utility methods. In short, Chrome remembers which elements you have selected in the Chrome Developer Toolbar and exposes these elements under the alias $0, $1, $2, $3, $4. So when you right-click an element in your browser and select \'Inspect element\', this element automagically becomes available under the alias $0. You can use this trick with KnockoutJS, AngularJS, jQuery or any other JavaScript framework.The other side of the trick is KnockoutJS\'s utility methods ko.dataFor and ko.contextFor:Remember, Chrome\'s JavaScript Console is a fully functional JavaScript runtime environment. This means that you are not limited to just looking at variables. You can store the output of ko.contextFor and manipulate the viewmodel directly from the console. Try var root = ko.contextFor($0).$root; root.addContact(); and see what happens :-)Happy debugging!Check out a really simple thing I use:Or Then in html, say, you had:Just replace it withMore advanced:Enjoy :)UPDATEAnother annoying thing is when you are trying to bind to an undefined value. Imagine in the example above that the data object is just {} not { value: \'some text\' }. In this case you will be in trouble, but with the following tweak you will be fine:I created a github project called knockthrough.js to help visualize these errors.https://github.com/JonKragh/knockthroughIt highlights binding errors and gives a dump of the datacontext on that node.You can play with a sample here: http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/JonKragh/knockthrough/blob/master/default.htmCredit to RP Niemeyer for his excellent Knockout code samples on SO to get me to this point.The easiest way to see what data are passed to binding is to drop the data to console:Knockout will evaluate value for text binding (any binding can be used here in fact) and flushes $data to console browser panel.If you are developing in Visual studio and IE I like this more data-bind="somebinding:(function(){debugger; return bindvalue; })()" I like it more then echo function since it will go to the script with all the bindings rather the the eval file and you can just look at the $context $data(I use this in Chrome as well);All the other answers will work great, I\'m just adding what I like to do:In your view (assuming you\'ve already bound a ViewModel):Knockout code:This will pause the code in the debugger, and element and valueAccessor() will contain valuable information.
