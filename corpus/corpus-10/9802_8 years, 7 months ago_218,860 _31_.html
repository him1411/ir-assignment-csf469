I\'m looking to add a crontab entry to execute a script every 30 minutes, on the hour and 30 minutes past the hour or something close. I have the following, but it doesn\'t seem to run on 0.What string do I need to use?The cron is running on OSX.Do:Try this:According to the official Mac OS X crontab(5) manpage, the / syntax is supported.  Thus, to figure out why it wasn\'t working for you, you\'ll need to look at the logs for cron.  In those logs, you should find a clear failure message.Note:  Mac OS X appears to use Vixie Cron, the same as Linux and the BSDs.crontab does not understand "intervals", it only understands "schedule"valid hours: 0-23 -- valid minutes: 0-59example #130 * * * * your_commandthis means "run when the minute of each hour is 30" (would run at: 1:30, 2:30, 3:30, etc)example #2*/30 * * * * your_commandthis means "run when the minute of each hour is evenly divisible by 30" (would run at: 1:30, 2:00, 2:30, 3:00, etc)example #30,30 * * * * your_commandthis means "run when the minute of each hour is 0 or 30" (would run at: 1:30, 2:00, 2:30, 3:00, etc)it\'s another way to accomplish the same results as example #2example #419 * * * * your_commandthis means "run when the minute of each hour is 19" (would run at: 1:19, 2:19, 3:19, etc)example #5*/19 * * * * your_commandthis means "run when the minute of each hour is evenly divisible by 19" (would run at: 1:19, 1:38, 1:57, 2:19, 2:38, 2:57 etc)note: several refinements have been made to this post by various users including the authorIf your cron job is running on Mac OS X only, you may want to use launchd instead.From Scheduling Timed Jobs (official Apple docs):Note: Although it is still supported, cron is not a recommended solution. It has been deprecated in favor of launchd.You can find additional information (such as the launchd Wikipedia page) with a simple web search.You mention you are using OS X- I have used cronnix in the past. It\'s not as geeky as editing it yourself, but it helped me learn what the columns are in a jiffy. Just a thought.
