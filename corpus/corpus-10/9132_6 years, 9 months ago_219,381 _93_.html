I\'m working on an Android app, in which I want to integrate a Facebook\nposting feature. I downloaded the Facebook-Android SDK, and I got\nthe readme.md (text file) in there, in which it is mentioned to generate\nthe key hash for Android. How do I generate it?Here are the steps-Download openssl from Google code (If you have a 64 bit machine you must download openssl-0.9.8e X64 not the latest version)Extract it. create a folder- OpenSSL in C:/ and copy the extracted code here.detect debug.keystore file path. If u didn\'t find, then do a search in C:/ and use the Path in the command in next step.detect your keytool.exe path and go to that dir/ in command prompt and run this command in 1 line-$ keytool -exportcert -alias androiddebugkey -keystore "C:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator.android\\debug.keystore" | "C:\\OpenSSL\\bin\\openssl" sha1 -binary \n  |"C:\\OpenSSL\\bin\\openssl" base64For more info visit hereDude, you can copy this code to any activity. It will log in the catlog the hash key\nwhich is the debug key. This is easy, and it\'s a relief than using SSL and so ;)You can delete the code after knowing the key ;)I\'ve created a small tool for Windows and Mac OS X. Just throw in the key-store file, and get the hash key.If you want the default debug.keystore file, use the default alias and password. Else, use your own keystore file and values.Check it out, download the Windows version or download the Mac OS X version\n(Dev-Host might be down sometimes... so if the link is broken, PM me and I\'ll fix it).I hope that help you guys...Dec 31, 2014 - EDIT:\nChanged host to AFH.\nPlease let me know if the links are brokenNov 21, 2013 - EDIT:As users requested, I added a default keystore location and a DONATE button. Feel free to use it if I\'ve helped you. :)\nThe instructions currently in Facebook\'s Android Tutorial  do not work well under Windows. Their example shows how to pipe the keytool output to openssl but if you try this under Windows the output is not valid for some reason. I found that I had to use intermediary files to get it to work properly. Here are the steps that worked for me:Start by downloading openssl for Windows from Google.After running these commands the valid hash is stored in the file base64.txt. Copy and paste this to your app settings on Facebook.This is what is given at the official page of Facebook:Let me break this command into fragments.Look for "keytool.exe". You can search that on the C: drive. You can find it in "java jdk" or "java jre". If you have installed multiple versions, choose any.Open a CMD prompt and go to the above directory where you found "keytool.exe".Clip the "exe`" and paste the above command provided on the Facebook page.You will get an error on entering this that OpenSSL is not recognized as in input output command.\nSolution : Download "Openssl" from OpenSSL (if you have a 64-bit machine you must download openssl-0.9.8e X64). Extract and save it anywhere... I saved it on the C: drive in the OpenSSl folderReplace the openssl in the above command in which you was getting an error of OpenSSL with "C:\\OpenSSL\\bin\\openssl" at both the places after the pipe, "|".If prompted for a password, enter android.And you will get your hash key. For further steps, refer again to the Facebook page.Add this code to onCreate of your activity, it will print the hash under the KeyHash tag in your logCatYou can add multiple hashkeys for your account, so if you been running in debug don\'t forget to run this again in release mode.To get the Android key hash code, follow these steps:The simplest solution I have found is this:Look for the line in the log that looks like this:Copy "abcdefgHIJKLMN+OPqrstuvwzyz" and paste it into the Facebook Android Key Hash area.I have done by this way for Linux OS & Windows OS:Kindly change Alias Name and Keystore with it\'s path as your requirement.Terminal would ask for Password of Keystore. You have to provide password for the same Keystore.So finally you would get the Release Hashkey.Steps for Release Hashkey:Kindly change Alias Name and Keystore with it\'s path as your requirement.Terminal would ask for Password of Keystore. You have to provide password for the same Keystore.So finally you would get the Release Hashkey.DoneDownload openSSL -> Install it -> it would usually install in C:\\OpenSSLthen open cmd and typeto check jdk version go to C:/program files/java/jdk_versionIt will ask you for password which is android.download openSSL for windows in here you can find 64bit and 32bit hereextract the downloaded fileC:\\Users\\username\\.android\\debug.keystorekeytool -exportcert -alias androiddebugkey -keystore C:\\Users\\username.android\\debug.keystore | "C:\\openSSL\\bin\\openssl" sha1 -binary | "C:\\openSSL\\bin\\openssl" base641) Create a key to sign your application, and remember the alias.\n2) Install OpenSSL.\n3) Put the bin folder of OpenSSL in your path.\n4) Follow the steps mentioned under "Setup Single Sign-On" on the FB-Android-SDK page, and generate your Hash Key. Make sure you put the correct alias and keystore file name.\n5) Create an application on Facebok, and under Mobile Devices tab, enter this Hash Key.You need to create a keystore by the keytool for signed apps for android like the procedure described in Android Site and then you have to install cygwin and then you need to install openssl from google code then just execute the following command and you will get the hash key for android and then put that hash key into the facebook application you created. And then you can access the facebook application through the Android Application for posting wall ("publish_stream") could be an example.$ keytool -exportcert -alias alias_name -keystore sample_keystore.keystore | openssl sha1 -binary | openssl base64You need to execute the above command from cygwin.Official Documentation on facebook developer site: Simply Open you Main Activity File and create below mention function:1.1 Run you Application, this will generate a Hash key for your application.Now, Open log cat and search with "KeyHash" and copy the hash key.One you generate the Hash key you can remove this function. This worked for me ...Steps:For LinuxOpen Terminal : For Debug Buildyou wil find debug.keystore from ".android" folder copy it from and paste on desktop and run above commandFor release BuildNOTE : Make sure In Both case it must ask for password. If it does not asks for password that means something is wrong in command.To generate a hash of your release key, run the following command on Mac or Windows substituting your release key alias and the path to your keystore. On Windows, use:This command should generate a 28 characher string. Remember that COPY and PASTE this Release Key Hash into your Facebook App ID\'s Android settings.image: fbcdn-dragon-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/t39.2178-6/851568_627654437290708_1803108402_n.pngRefer from : https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/getting-started#release-key-hash and http://note.taable.comFor an Android applicationThis code is used to get the hash key in your Android application for Facebook integration. I have tested all devices and it\'s working. Only change the package name of this code:The simplest solution:The best approach is to use the following code:But I was so frustrating with the fact that there is no simple tool to generate the HashKey for the Facebook app. Each time I had to play with Openssl and Keytool or to use a code to get the hash from signature ...So I wrote a simple KeyGenTool that will do that work for you: -> KeyGenTool on Google Play <-Enjoy :)Firstly, to generate your key hash on your local computer, run Java\'s keytool utility (which should be on your console\'s path) against the Android debug keystore. This is, by default, in your home .android directory). on ubuntu, it\'s woking in my computerI did a small mistake that should be kept in mind. If you are using your keystore then give your alias name, not androiddebugkey...I solved my problem. Now if Facebook is there installed in my device, then still my app is getting data on the Facebook login integration. Just only care about your hash key.Please see below.Then press Enter - it will ask you for the password and then enter your keystore password, not Android.Cool.For people who dont know how to code, AivarsDa\'s key gen tool on google play i the easiest solution. just get the hash key from it and copy to the facebook app settings. The share on the keygen tool makes my app crash on my phone, so i just manually typed it in notepad and copied it to fb. Finally past this step after days of frustrationUse this command after keep open ssl in c drive and in openssl folder.As answered on a similar issue i found this to be working for me:
