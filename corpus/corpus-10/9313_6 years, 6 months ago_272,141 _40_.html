I\'ve got the following HTML5 form: http://jsfiddle.net/nfgfP/Currently when I hit enter when they\'re both blank, a popup box appears saying "Please fill out this field". How would I change that default message to "This field cannot be left blank"?EDIT: Also note that the type password field\'s error message is simply *****. To recreate this give the username a value and hit submit.EDIT: I\'m using Chrome 10 for testing. Please do the sameUse setCustomValidity:I changed to vanilla JavaScript from Mootools as suggested by @itpastorn in the comments, but you should be able to work out the Mootools equivalent if necessary.I\'ve updated the code here as setCustomValidity works slightly differently to what I understood when I originally answered.  If setCustomValidity is set to anything other than the empty string it will cause the field to be considered invalid; therefore you must clear it before testing validity, you can\'t just set it and forget.As pointed out in @thomasvdb\'s comment below, you need to clear the custom validity in some event outside of invalid otherwise there may be an extra pass through the oninvalid handler to clear it.Here is the code to handle Custom Error Message in HTML5This is the most important part:It\'s very simple to control custom messages with the help of HTML5 event oninvalidHere is code: Note: This no longer works in Chrome, not tested in other browsers.  See edits below.  This answer is being left here for historical reference.If you feel that the validation string really should not be set by code, you can set you input element\'s title attribute to read "This field cannot be left blank". (Works in Chrome 10)See http://jsfiddle.net/kaleb/nfgfP/8/And in Firefox, you can add this attribute:This seems to have changed since I originally wrote this answer.  Now adding a title does not change the validity message, it just adds an addendum to the message.  The fiddle above still applies.Chrome now does nothing with the title attribute as of Chrome 51. I am not sure in which version this changed.I have made a small library to ease changing and translating the error messages. You can even change the texts by error type which is currently not available using title in Chrome or x-moz-errormessage in Firefox. Go check it out on GitHub, and give feedback.It\'s used like:There\'s a demo available at jsFiddle.It\'s very simple to control custom messages with the help of the HTML5 oninvalid eventHere is the code:By setting and unsetting the setCustomValidity in the right time, the validation message will work flawlessly.I used onchange instead of oninput which is more general and occurs when the value is changed in any condition even through JavaScript.Try this one, its better and tested:HTML:JAVASCRIPT :Demo :http://jsfiddle.net/patelriki13/Sqq8e/The easiest and cleanest way I\'ve found is to use a data attribute to store your custom error. Test the node for validity and handle the error by using some custom html. le javascriptand some super HTML5I have a simpler vanilla js only solution:For checkboxes:For inputs:This is very simple controlling HTML input type required message. No need JS, or CSS only use HTML5.First you can use this only "oninvalid" AttributeOr you can use with "oninput" Attribute
