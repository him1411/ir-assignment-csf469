Google recommends that we use DialogFragment instead of a simple Dialog by using Fragments API, but it is absurd to use an isolated DialogFragment for a simple Yes-No confirmation message box. What is the best practice in this case?Yes, use DialogFragment and in onCreateDialog you can simply use an AlertDialog builder anyway to create a simple AlertDialog with Yes/No confirmation buttons. Not very much code at all.With regards handling events in your fragment there would be various ways of doing it but I simply define a message Handler in my Fragment, pass it into the DialogFragment via its constructor and then pass messages back to my fragment\'s handler as approprirate on the various click events. Again various ways of doing that but the following works for me.In the dialog hold a message and instantiate it in the constructor:Implement the onClickListener in your dialog and then call the handler as appropriate:EditAnd as Message is parcelable you can save it out in onSaveInstanceState and restore itThen in onCreateYou can create generic DialogFragment subclasses like YesNoDialog and OkDialog, and pass in title and message if you use dialogs a lot in your app.  Then call it using the following:And handle the result in onActivityResult.I would recommend using DialogFragment.Sure, creating a "Yes/No" dialog with it is pretty complex considering that it should be rather simple task, but creating a similar dialog box with Dialog is surprisingly complicated as well. (Activity lifecycle makes it complicated - you must let Activity manage the lifecycle of the dialog box - and there is no way to pass custom parameters e.g. the custom message to Activity.showDialog if using API levels under 8)The nice thing is that you can usually build your own abstraction on top of DialogFragment pretty easily.Since the introduction of API level 13: the showDialog method from Activity is deprecated.\nInvoking a dialog elsewhere in code is not advisable since you will have to manage the the dialog yourself (e.g. orientation change).Difference DialogFragment - AlertDialogAre they so much different? From Android reference regarding DialogFragment: A DialogFragment is a fragment that displays a dialog window, floating on top of its\n  activity\'s window. This fragment contains a Dialog object, which it\n  displays as appropriate based on the fragment\'s state. Control of the\n  dialog (deciding when to show, hide, dismiss it) should be done\n  through the API here, not with direct calls on the dialog.Other notesIn my project, I already used AlertDialog.Builder already a lot before I found out that it\'s problematic. However, I did not want to change that much code anywhere in my app. Additionally, I actually am a fan of passing OnClickListeners as anonymous classes where they are needed (that is, when using setPositiveButton(), setNegativeButton() etc.) instead of having to implement thousands of callback methods to communicate between a dialog fragment and the holder fragment, which can, in my opinion, lead to very confusing and complex code. Especially, if you have multiple different dialogs in one fragment and then need to distinguish in the callback implementations between which dialog currently being shown.Therefore, I combined different approaches to create a generic AlertDialogFragment helper class which can be used exactly like AlertDialog:SOLUTION(PLEASE NOTE that I am using Java 8 lambda expressions in my code, so you might have to change parts of the code if you are not using lambda expressions yet.)USAGEI am posting this here not only to share my solution, but also because I wanted to ask you people for your opinion: Is this approach legit or problematic to some extent?
