We also set an AnimatorListener so we can set the visibility of the View back to GONE once the animation is finished:You can start the correct Animation when the visibility of the LinearLayout changes by creating a new subclass of LinearLayout and overriding setVisibility() to start the Animations. Consider something like this:Easiest solution: set android:animateLayoutChanges="true" on the container holding your views.To put it into some context: If you have a layout like below, all visibility changes to the views in this container will be animated automatically.You can find more details about this on Animating Layout Changes - Android Developeryou can slide up and down any view or layout by using bellow code in android appHere is my solution. Just get a reference to your view and call this method:No need to do anything else =)Use this class:I had a corner case where my view\'s height was still zero so...
