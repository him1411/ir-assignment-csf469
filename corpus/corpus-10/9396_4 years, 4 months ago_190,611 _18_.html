I wrote a maven code on netbeans that has approximately more than 2000 lines. When I compile it on netbeans, everything is fine, but if I want to run it on command line, I will get these errors:I tried to use Java 1.3.1, compiler errors ,but I got more errors. I found from other posts that I should modify pom.xml, but I do not know how. Here is my pom.xmlIt would be great if you can help me. See the config page for the maven compiler plugin:http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-compiler-plugin/examples/set-compiler-source-and-target.htmlOh, and: don\'t use Java 1.3.x, current versions are Java 1.7.x or 1.8.xmaven-compiler-plugin it\'s already present in plugins hierarchy dependency in pom.xml. Check in Eclipse Effective POM.For short you can use properties like this:I\'m using maven 3.2.5You are most likely compiling with OpenJDK where the javac default for some reason is Java 1.3 (where Oracle Java defaults to 1.5). Unfortunately the maven-compiler-plugin documents that the default is 1.5 (without saying why) so people typically do not explicitly set the source and target versions in their pom.xml until they need to compile under other JVMs.Also note that if you want to be independent of the JDK you can tell the maven-compler-plugin to use the eclipse compiler instead.  This allows you to run Maven on a JRE.I faced same issue in eclipse neon simple maven java project But I add below details inside pom.xml fileAfter right click on project > maven > update project (checked force update)Its resolve me to display error on projectHope it\'s will helpfulThansk
