I must be googling in the wrong way or I\'m having a stupid moment in time.What\'s the difference between HAVING and WHERE in an SQL SELECT statement?EDIT: I\'ve marked Steven\'s answer as the correct one as it contained the key bit of information on the link:When GROUP BY is not used, HAVING behaves like a WHERE clauseThe situation I had seen the WHERE in did not have GROUP BY and is where my confusion started. Of course, until you know this you can\'t specify it in the question.Many thanks for all the answers which were very enlightening.HAVING specifies a search condition for a\n  group or an aggregate function used in SELECT statement.SourceHAVING is used to check conditions after the aggregation takes place.WHERE is used before the aggregation takes place.This code:Gives you a count of all the cities in MA.This code:Gives you the count of all the cities in MA that occur 6 or more times.Number one difference for me: if HAVING was removed from the SQL language then life would go on more or less as before. Certainly, a minority queries would need to be rewritten using a derived table, CTE, etc but they would arguably be easier to understand and maintain as a result. Maybe vendors\' optimizer code would need to be rewritten to account for this, again an opportunity for improvement within the industry.Now consider for a moment removing WHERE from the language. This time the majority of queries in existence would need to be rewritten without an obvious alternative construct. Coders would have to get creative e.g. inner join to a table known to contain exactly one row (e.g. DUAL in Oracle) using the ON clause to simulate the prior WHERE clause. Such constructions would be contrived; it would be obvious there was something was missing from the language and the situation would be worse as a result.TL;DR we could lose HAVING tomorrow and things would be no worse, possibly better, but the same cannot be said of WHERE.From the answers here, it seems that many folk don\'t realize that a HAVING clause may be used without a GROUP BY clause. In this case, the HAVING clause is applied to the entire table expression and requires that only constants appear in the SELECT clause. Typically the HAVING clause will involve aggregates.This is more useful than it sounds. For example, consider this query to test whether the name column is unique for all values in T:There are only two possible results: if the HAVING clause is true then the result with be a single row containing the value 1, otherwise the result will be the empty set.Difference between WHERE and HAVING clause:1. WHERE clause can be used with - Select, Insert, and Update statements, where as HAVING clause can only be used with the Select statement.2. WHERE filters rows before aggregation (GROUPING), where as, HAVING filters groups, after the aggregations are performed.3. Aggregate functions cannot be used in the WHERE clause, unless it is in a sub query contained in a HAVING clause, whereas, aggregate functions can be used in Having clause.Filtering Groups:WHERE clause is used to filter rows before aggregation, where as HAVING clause is used to filter groups after aggregationsIn SQL Server we have got lot of aggregate functions. \nExamplesThe HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword could not be used with aggregate functions.Check out this w3schools link for more informationSyntax:A query such as this:...may be rewritten using a derived table (and omitting the HAVING) like this:The difference between the two is in the relationship to the GROUP BY clause:WHERE comes before GROUP BY; SQL evaluates the WHERE clause before it groups records.HAVING comes after GROUP BY; SQL evaluates HAVING after it groups records.ReferencesSQLite SELECT Statement Syntax/Railroad DiagramInformix SELECT Statement Syntax/Railroad DiagramHAVING is used when you are using an aggregate such as GROUP BY.WHERE is applied as a limitation on the set returned by SQL; it uses SQL\'s built-in set oeprations and indexes and therefore is the fastest way to filter result sets.  Always use WHERE whenever possible.HAVING is necessary for some aggregate filters.  It filters the query AFTER sql has retrieved, assembled, and sorted the results.  Therefore, it is much slower than WHERE and should be avoided except in those situations that require it.SQL Server will let you get away with using HAVING even when WHERE would be much faster.  Don\'t do it.WHERE clause does not work for aggregate functions\nmeans : you should not use like this \nbonus : table nameHERE Instead of using WHERE clause you have to use HAVING..without using GROUP BY clause, HAVING clause just works as WHERE clauseWhen GROUP BY is not used, the WHERE and HAVING clauses are essentially equivalent.However, when GROUP BY is used:Resource from HereI had a problem and found out another difference between WHERE and HAVING. It does not act the same way on indexed columns.WHERE my_indexed_row = 123 will show rows and automatically perform a "ORDER ASC" on other indexed rows.HAVING my_indexed_row = 123 shows everything from the oldest "inserted" row to the newest one, no ordering.Difference b/w WHERE and HAVING clause:The main difference between WHERE and HAVING clause is, WHERE is used for row operations and HAVING is used for column operations.Why we need HAVING clause?As we know, aggregate functions can only be performed on columns, so we can not use aggregate functions in WHERE clause. Therefore, we use aggregate functions in HAVING clause.In an Aggregate query, (Any query Where an aggregate function is used) Predicates in a where clause are evaluated before the aggregated intermediate result set is generated,Predicates in a Having clause are applied to the aggregate result set AFTER it has been generated.  That\'s why predicate conditions on aggregate values must be placed in Having clause, not in the Where clause, and why you can use aliases defined in the Select clause in a Having Clause, but not in a Where Clause. WHERE clause is used for comparing values in the base table, whereas the HAVING clause can be used for filtering the results of aggregate functions in the result set of the query\nClick here!One way to think of it is that the having clause is an additional filter to the where clause.A WHERE clause is used filters records from a result. The filter occurs before any groupings are made. A HAVING clause is used to filter values from a groupI use HAVING for constraining a query based on the results of an aggregate function. E.G. select * in blahblahblah group by SOMETHING having count(SOMETHING)>0From here.the SQL standard requires that HAVING\n  must reference only columns in the\n  GROUP BY  clause or columns used in\n  aggregate functionsas opposed to the WHERE clause which is applied to database rowsWhile working on a project, this was also my question. As stated above, the HAVING checks the condition on the query result already found. But WHERE is for checking condition while query runs.Let me give an example to illustrate this. Suppose you have a database table like this.usertable{ int userid,  date datefield, int dailyincome }Suppose, the following rows are in table:1, 2011-05-20, 1001, 2011-05-21, 501, 2011-05-30, 102, 2011-05-30, 102, 2011-05-20, 20Now, we want to get the userids and sum(dailyincome) whose sum(dailyincome)>100If we write:SELECT userid, sum(dailyincome) FROM usertable WHERE\n  sum(dailyincome)>100 GROUP BY useridThis will be an error. The correct query would be:SELECT userid, sum(dailyincome) FROM usertable GROUP BY userid HAVING\n  sum(dailyincome)>100It may be just that the subject of "where" is a row, whereas the subject of "having" is a group. Am I right?
