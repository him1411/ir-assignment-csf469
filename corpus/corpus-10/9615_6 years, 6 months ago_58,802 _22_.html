What\'s the difference between event.stopPropagation() and event.stopImmediatePropagation()?stopPropagation will prevent any parent handlers from being executed stopImmediatePropagation will prevent any parent handlers and also any other handlers from executing Quick example from the jquery documentation: From the jQuery API:In addition to keeping any additional\n  handlers on an element from being\n  executed, this method also stops the\n  bubbling by implicitly calling\n  event.stopPropagation(). To simply\n  prevent the event from bubbling to\n  ancestor elements but allow other\n  event handlers to execute on the same\n  element, we can use\n  event.stopPropagation() instead.Use\n  event.isImmediatePropagationStopped()\n  to know whether this method was ever\n  called (on that event object).In short: event.stopPropagation() allows other handlers on the same element to be executed, while event.stopImmediatePropagation() prevents every event from running.Added a small example on jsfiddle to demonstrate how both these propagation stoppages work. There are three event handlers bound. If we don\xe2\x80\x99t stop any propagation, then there should be four alerts - three on the child div, and one on the parent div.If we stop the event from propagating, then there will be 3 alerts (all on the inner child div). Since the event won\xe2\x80\x99t propagate up the DOM hierarchy, the parent div won\xe2\x80\x99t see it, and its handler won\xe2\x80\x99t fire.If we stop propagation immediately, then there will only be 1 alert. Even though there are three event handlers attached to the inner child div, only 1 is executed and any further propagation is killed immediately, even within the same element.event.stopPropagation will prevent handlers on parent elements from running.\nCalling event.stopImmediatePropagation will also prevent other handlers on the same element from running.I am a late comer, but maybe I can say this with a specific example:Say, if you have a <table>, with <tr>, and then <td>.  Now, let\'s say you set 3 event handlers for the <td> element, then if you do event.stopPropagation() in the first event handler you set for <td>, then all event handlers for <td> will still run, but the event just won\'t propagate to <tr> or <table> (and won\'t go up and up to <body>, <html>, document, and window).Now, however, if you use event.stopImmediatePropagation() in your first event handler, then, the other two event handlers for <td> WILL NOT run, and won\'t propagate up to <tr>, <table> (and won\'t go up and up to <body>, <html>, document, and window).Note that it is not just for <td>.  For other elements, it will follow the same principle.event.stopPropagation() allows other handlers on the same element to be executed, while event.stopImmediatePropagation() prevents every event from running. For example, see below jQuery code block.If event.stopPropagation was used in previous example, then the next click event on p element which changes the css will fire, but in case event.stopImmediatePropagation(), the next p click event will not fire.1)event.stopPropagation():\n =>It is used to stop executions of its corresponding parent handler only.2) event.stopImmediatePropagation():\n  => It is used to stop the execution of its corresponding parent handler and also handler or function attached to itself except the current handler.\n  => It also stops all the handler attached to the current element of entire DOM.Here is the example: Jsfiddle!Thanks,\n-Sahil
