I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a good look and can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to find out how to select all elements matching certain classes in one jQuery selector statement such as this:Any ideas on how to achieve this? The only other option is to doBut I\xe2\x80\x99m doing this with quite a few classes, so it requires much code.This should work:$(\'.myClass, .myOtherClass\').removeClass(\'theclass\');You must add the multiple selectors all in the first argument to $(), otherwise you are giving jQuery a context in which to search, which is not what you want.It\'s the same as you would do in CSS.Have you tried this?I use $(\'.myClass.myOtherClass\').removeClass(\'theclass\');
