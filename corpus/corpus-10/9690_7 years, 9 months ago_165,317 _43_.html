Is there a difference between these two lines?The first one adds an item to your history in that you can (or should be able to) click "Back" and go back to the current page.The second replaces the current history item so you can\'t go back to it.See window.location:assign(url): Load the document at\n  the provided URL.replace(url):Replace the current\n  document with the one at the provided\n  URL. The difference from the\n  assign() method is that after using\n  replace() the current page will not\n  be saved in session history, meaning\n  the user won\'t be able to use the Back\n  button to navigate to it.Oh and generally speaking:is favoured over:TLDR;use location.href or better use window.location.href;However if you read this  you will gain undeniable proof.The truth is it\'s fine to use but why do things that are questionable. You should take the higher road and just do it the way that it probably should be done.This code is perfectly correct syntax-wise, logic wise, type-wise\nyou know the only thing wrong with it?it has location instead of location.hrefwhat about this what is the value of mystring? does anyone really know without doing some test. No one knows what exactly will happen here. Hell I just wrote this and I don\'t even know what it does. location is an object but I am assigning a string will it pass the string or pass the location object. Lets say there is some answer to how this should be implemented. Can you guarantee all browsers will do the same thing?This i can pretty much guess all browsers will handle the same.What about if you place this into typescript will it break because the type compiler will say this is suppose to be an object?This conversation is so much deeper than just the location object however. What this conversion is about what kind of programmer you want to be?If you take this short-cut, yea it might be okay today, ye it might be okay tomorrow, hell it might be okay forever, but you sir are now a bad programmer. It won\'t be okay for you and it will fail you.There will be more objects. There will be new syntax.You might define a getter that takes only a string but returns an object and the worst part is you will think you are doing something correct, you might think you are brilliant for this clever method because people here have shamefully led you astray.With getters and setters this code would actually work, but just because it can be done doesn\'t mean it\'s \'WISE\' to do so.Most people who are programming love to program and love to get better. Over the last few years I have gotten quite good and learn a lot. The most important thing I know now especially when you write Libraries is consistency and predictability.Do the things that you can consistently do.+"2" <-- this right here parses the string to a number. should you use it?\nor should you use parseInt("2")?what about var num =+"2"?From what you have learn, from the minds of stackoverflow i am not too hopefully.If you start following these 2 words consistent and predictable. You will know the right answer to a ton of questions on stackoverflow.Let me show you how this pays off.\nNormally I place ; on every line of javascript i write. I know it\'s more expressive. I know it\'s more clear. I have followed my rules. One day i decided not to. Why? Because so many people are telling me that it is not needed anymore and JavaScript can do without it. So what i decided to do this. Now because I have become sure of my self as a programmer (as you should enjoy the fruit of mastering a language) i wrote something very simple and i didn\'t check it. I erased one comma and I didn\'t think I needed to re-test for such a simple thing as removing one comma.I wrote something similar to this in es6 and babelThis code fail and took forever to figure out.\nFor some reason what it saw washidden deep within the source code it was telling me "hello world" is not a function.For more fun node doesn\'t show the source maps of transpiled code.Wasted so much stupid time. I was presenting to someone as well about how ES6 is brilliant and then I had to start debugging and demonstrate how headache free and better ES6 is. Not convincing is it.I hope this answered your question. This being an old question it\'s more for the future generation, people who are still learning.Question when people say it doesn\'t matter either way works. Chances are a wiser more experienced person will tell you other wise.what if someone overwrite the location object. They will do a shim for older browsers. It will get some new feature that needs to be shimmed and your 3 year old code will fail.My last note to ponder upon.Writing clean, clear purposeful code does something for your code that can\'t be answer with right or wrong. What it does is it make your code an enabler. You can use more things plugins, Libraries with out fear of interruption between the codes.for the record. usewindow.location.href
