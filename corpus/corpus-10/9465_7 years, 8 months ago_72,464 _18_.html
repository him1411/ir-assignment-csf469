Currently I am doing a very basic OrderBy in my statement.The problem with this is that NULL entries for \'position\' are treated as 0. Therefore all entries with position as NULL appear before those with 1,2,3,4. eg:Is there a way to achieve the following ordering:MySQL has an undocumented syntax to sort nulls last.  Place a minus sign (-) before the column name and switch the ASC to DESC:It is essentially the inverse of position DESC placing the NULL values last but otherwise the same as position ASC.A good reference is here http://troels.arvin.dk/db/rdbms#select-order_byI found this to be a good solution for the most part:Something like Replace 999999999 with what ever the max value for the field isTry using this query:You can coalesce your NULLs in the ORDER BY statement: If you want the NULLs to sort on the bottom, try coalesce(position, 100000). (Make the second number bigger than all of the other position\'s in the db.)You can swap out instances of NULL with a different value to sort them first (like 0 or -1) or last (a large number or a letter)...For a DATE column you can use:NULLS last:Blanks last:NULL LASTWhy don\'t you order by NULLS LAST?
