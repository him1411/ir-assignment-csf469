What is the difference between these headers?Which one is best and why?Please do not say they are identical - if they were identical there would not have been two of them. I know both work - but I would like to know the difference.text/javascript is obsolete, and application/x-javascript was experimental (hence the x- prefix) for a transitional period until application/javascript could be standardised. You should use application/javascript. This is documented in the RFC.As far a browsers are concerned, there is no difference (at least in HTTP headers). This was just a change so that the text/* and application/* MIME type groups had a consistent meaning where possible. (text/* MIME types are intended for human readable content, JavaScript is not designed to directly convey meaning to humans).Note that using application/javascript in the type attribute of a script element will cause the script to be ignored (as being in an unknown language) in some older browsers. Either continue to use text/javascript there or omit the attribute entirely (which is permitted in HTML 5).This isn\'t a problem in HTTP headers as browsers universally (as far as I\'m aware) either ignore the HTTP content-type of scripts entirely, or are modern enough to recognise application/javascript.mime-types starting with x- are not standardized. In case of javascript it\'s kind of outdated. \nAdditional the second code snippetrequires short_open_tags to be enabled. you should avoid it.However, the completely correct mime-type for javascript ishttp://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/index.htmlAccording to RFC 4329 the correct MIME type for JavaScript should be application/javascript. Howerver, older IE versions choke on this since they expect text/javascript.Use type="application/javascript"In case of HTML5, the type attribute is obsolete, you may remove it. Note: that it defaults to "text/javascript" according to w3.org, so I would suggest to add the "application/javascript" instead of removing it.http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/scripting-1.html#attr-script-type\n  The type\n  attribute gives the language of the script or format of the data. If\n  the attribute is present, its value must be a valid MIME type. The\n  charset parameter must not be specified. The default, which is used if\n  the attribute is absent, is "text/javascript".Use "application/javascript", because "text/javascript" is obsolete: RFC 4329: http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4329.txtDeployed Scripting Media Types and CompatibilityVarious unregistered media types have been used in an ad-hoc\n  fashion    to label and exchange programs written in ECMAScript and\n  JavaScript.    These include:+-----------------------------------------------------+\n    | text/javascript          | text/ecmascript          |\n    | text/javascript1.0       | text/javascript1.1       |\n    | text/javascript1.2       | text/javascript1.3       |\n    | text/javascript1.4       | text/javascript1.5       |\n    | text/jscript             | text/livescript          |\n    | text/x-javascript        | text/x-ecmascript        |\n    | application/x-javascript | application/x-ecmascript |\n    | application/javascript   | application/ecmascript   |\n    +-----------------------------------------------------+  Use of the "text" top-level type for this kind of content is known to    be\n  problematic.  This document thus defines text/javascript and text/\n  ecmascript but marks them as "obsolete".  Use of experimental and\n  unregistered media types, as listed in part above, is discouraged.\n  The media types,which are also defined in this document, are intended for common\n  use    and should be used instead.This document defines equivalent processing requirements for the\n  types text/javascript, text/ecmascript, and application/javascript.\n  Use of and support for the media type application/ecmascript is\n  considerably less widespread than for other media types defined in\n  this document.  Using that to its advantage, this document defines\n  stricter processing rules for this type to foster more interoperable\n  processing.x-javascript is experimental, don\'t use it.
