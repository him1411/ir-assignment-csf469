I am using XAMPP for development. Recently I upgraded my installation of xampp from an old version to 1.7.3. Now when I curl HTTPS enabled sites I get the following exceptionFatal error: Uncaught exception \'RequestCore_Exception\' with message\n  \'cURL resource: Resource\n      id #55; cURL error: SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is OK. Details:\n      error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed (60)\'Everyone suggest using some specific curl options from PHP code to fix this problem. I think this shouldn\'t be the way. Because I didn\'t have any problem with my old version of XAMPP and happened only after installing the new version. I need help to figure out what settings change in my PHP installation, Apache etc can fix this problem.curl used to include a list of accepted CAs, but no longer bundles ANY CA certs. So by default it\'ll reject all SSL certificates as unverifiable.You\'ll have to get your CA\'s cert and point curl at it. More details at cURLS\'s Details on Server SSL Certificates.It\'s a pretty common problem in Windows. You need just to set cacert.pem to curl.cainfo.Since PHP 5.3.7 you could do:Otherwise you will need to do the following for every cURL resource:Warning: this can introduce security issues that SSL is designed to protect against.But a really simple fix that worked for me was to call:before calling:in the php file.I believe that this disables all verification of SSL certificates.Source: http://ademar.name/blog/2006/04/curl-ssl-certificate-problem-v.htmlWhen opening a secure url with Curl you may get the following error:SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is OKI will explain why the error and what you should do about it.The easiest way of getting rid of the error would be adding the\n  following two lines to your script . This solution poses a security\n  risk tho.Let see what this two parameters do. Quoting the manual.CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST: 1 to check the existence of a common name in the SSL peer certificate. 2 to check the existence of a common name\n  and also verify that it matches the hostname provided.CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER: FALSE to stop CURL from verifying the peer\'s certificate. Alternate certificates to verify against can be\n  specified with the CURLOPT_CAINFO option or a certificate directory\n  can be specified with the CURLOPT_CAPATH option.\n  CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST may also need to be TRUE or FALSE if\n  CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER is disabled (it defaults to 2).  Setting\n  CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST to 2 (This is the default value) will garantee\n  that the certificate being presented to you have a \'common name\'\n  matching the URN you are using to access the remote resource. This is\n  a healthy check but it doesn\'t guarantee your program is not being\n  decieved.Your program could be misleaded into talking to another server\n  instead. This can be achieved through several mechanisms, like dns or\n  arp poisoning ( This is a story for another day). The intruder can\n  also self-sign a certificate with the same \'comon name\' your program\n  is expecting. The communication would still be encrypted but you would\n  be giving away your secrets to an impostor. This kind of attack is\n  called \'man in the middle\'Well, we need to to verify the certificate being presented to us is\n  good for real. We do this by comparing it against a certificate we\n  reasonable* trust.If the remote resource is protected by a certificate issued by one of\n  the main CA\'s like Verisign, GeoTrust et al, you can safely compare\n  against Mozilla\'s CA certificate bundle which you can get from\n  http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.htmlSave the file cacert.pem somewhere in your server and set the\n  following options in your script.for All above Info Credit Goes to : http://ademar.name/blog/2006/04/curl-ssl-certificate-problem-v.html The above solutions are great, but if you\'re using WampServer you might find setting the curl.cainfo variable in php.ini doesn\'t work.I eventually found WampServer has two php.ini files:The first is apparently used for when PHP files are invoked through a web browser, while the second is used when a command is invoked through the command line or shell_exec().TL;DRIf using WampServer, you must add the curl.cainfo line to both php.ini files.Sometimes if the application you try to contact has self signed certificates, the normal cacert.pem from http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem does not solve the problem.If you are sure about the service endpoint url, hit it through browser, save the certificate manually in "X 509 certificate with chain (PEM)" format. Point this certificate file with the When setting the curl options for CURLOPT_CAINFO please remember to use single quotes, using double quotes will only cause another error. So your option should look like:Additionally, in your php.ini file setting should be written as:(notice my double quotes)I put it directly below the line that says this: extension=php_curl.dll(For organizing purposes only, you could put it anywhere within your php.ini, i just put it close to another curl reference so when I search using keyword curl I caan find both curl references in one area.)For the love of all that is holy...In my case, I had to set the PEM file path to the openssl.cafile PHP config variable.I trust it is very true that there are many systems where setting curl.cainfo in PHP\'s config is exactly what is needed, but in the environment I\'m working with, which is the eboraas/laravel docker container, which uses Debian 8 (jessie) and PHP 5.6, setting that variable did not do the trick.I noticed that the output of php -i did not mention anything about that particular config setting, but I did have a few lines about openssl. There is both an available openssl.capath and openssl.cafile, but just setting the second one allowed curl via PHP to finally be okay with HTTPS URLs.I have the same error on amazon AMI linux.I Solved by setting curl.cainfo on /etc/php.d/curl.inihttps://gist.github.com/reinaldomendes/97fb2ce8a606ec813c4bI ended up here when trying to get GuzzleHttp (php+apache on Mac) to get a page from www.googleapis.com. Here was my final solution in case it helps anyone. Look at the certificate chain for whatever domain is giving you this error. For me it was googleapis.comYou\'ll get back something like this:Note: I captured this after I fixed the issue, to your chain output may look different.Then you need to look at the certificates allowed in php. Run phpinfo() in a page.Then look for the certificate file that\'s loaded from the page output:This is the file you\'ll need to fix by adding the correct certificate(s) to it.You basically need to append the correct certificate "signatures" to the end of this file.You can find some of them here: You may need to google/search for others in the chain if you need them.They look like this:(Note: This is an image so people will not simply copy/paste certificates from stackoverflow)Once the right certificates are in this file, restart apache and test.
