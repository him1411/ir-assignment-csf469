How can I round down a number in JavaScript?math.round() doesn\'t work because it rounds it to the nearest decimal. I\'m not sure if there is a better way of doing it other than breaking it apart at the decimal point at keeping the first bit. There must be...is the answer.Round towards negative infinity - Math.floor()Round towards zero - usually called Truncate(), but not supported by JavaScript - can be emulated by using Math.ceil() for negative numbers and Math.floor() for positive numbers.Math.floor() will work, but it\'s very slow compared to using a bitwise OR operation:EDIT Math.floor() is not slower than using the | operator. Thanks to Jason S for checking my work.Here\'s the code I used to test:You can try to use this function if you need to round down to a specific number of decimal placesexamplesTo round down towards negative infinity, use:To round down towards zero (if the number can round to a 32-bit integer between -2147483648 and 2147483647), use: To round down towards zero (for any number), use:Rounding a number towards 0 can be done by subtracting its signed fractional part number % 1:Like Math.floor (rounds towards -Infinity) this method is perfectly accurate.There are differences in the handling of -0, +Infinity and -Infinity though:Was fiddling round with someone elses code today and found the following which seems rounds down as well:For more info on the Sign-propagating right shift(>>)  see MDN Bitwise OperatorsIt took me a while to work out what this was doing :DBut as highlighted above, Math.floor() works and looks more readable in my opinion.
