I want to store a JSON payload into redis. There\'s really 2 ways I can do this:One using a simple string keys and values.\nkey:user, value:payload (the entire JSON blob which can be 100-200 KB)SET user:1 payloadUsing hashesHSET user:1 username "someone"\nHSET user:1 location "NY"\nHSET user:1 bio "STRING WITH OVER 100 lines"Keep in mind that if I use a hash, the value length isn\'t predictable. They\'re not all short such as the bio example above.Which is more memory efficient? Using string keys and values, or using a hash?It depends on how you access the data:Go for Option 1:Go for Option 2:P.S.: As a rule of the thumb, go for the option which requires fewer queries on most of your use cases.This article can provide a lot of insight here: http://redis.io/topics/memory-optimizationThere are many ways to store an array of Objects in Redis (spoiler: I like option 1 for most use cases):Store the entire object as JSON-encoded string in a single key and keep track of all Objects using a set (or list, if more appropriate). For example:Generally speaking, this is probably the best method in most cases. If there are a lot of fields in the Object, your Objects are not nested with other Objects, and you tend to only access a small subset of fields at a time, it might be better to go with option 2.Advantages: considered a "good practice." Each Object is a full-blown Redis key. JSON parsing is fast, especially when you need to access many fields for this Object at once.  Disadvantages: slower when you only need to access a single field.Store each Object\'s properties in a Redis hash.Advantages: considered a "good practice." Each Object is a full-blown Redis key. No need to parse JSON strings.  Disadvantages: possibly slower when you need to access all/most of the fields in an Object.  Also, nested Objects (Objects within Objects) cannot be easily stored.Store each Object as a JSON string in a Redis hash.This allows you to consolidate a bit and only use two keys instead of lots of keys.  The obvious disadvantage is that you can\'t set the TTL (and other stuff) on each user Object, since it is merely a field in the Redis hash and not a full-blown Redis key.Advantages: JSON parsing is fast, especially when you need to access many fields for this Object at once. Less "polluting" of the main key namespace.  Disadvantages: About same memory usage as #1 when you have a lot of Objects. Slower than #2 when you only need to access a single field. Probably not considered a "good practice."Store each property of each Object in a dedicated key.According to the article above, this option is almost never preferred (unless the property of the Object needs to have specific TTL or something).Advantages: Object properties are full-blown Redis keys, which might not be overkill for your app.  Disadvantages: slow, uses more memory, and not considered "best practice."  Lots of polluting of the main key namespace.Option 4 is generally not preferred.  Options 1 and 2 are very similar, and they are both pretty common.  I prefer option 1 (generally speaking) because it allows you to store more complicated Objects (with multiple layers of nesting, etc.)  Option 3 is used when you really care about not polluting the main key namespace (i.e. you don\'t want there to be a lot of keys in your database and you don\'t care about things like TTL, key sharding, or whatever).If I got something wrong here, please consider leaving a comment and allowing me to revise the answer before downvoting.  Thanks!  :)
