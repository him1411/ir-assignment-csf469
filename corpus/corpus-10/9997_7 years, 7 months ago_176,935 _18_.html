I have an HttpServletRequest object.How do I get the complete and exact URL that caused this call to arrive at my servlet?Or at least as accurately as possible, as there are perhaps things that can be regenerated (the order of the parameters, perhaps).The HttpServletRequest has the following methods:So, to get the full URL, just do:I use this method:HttpUtil being deprecated, this is the correct methodCombining the results of getRequestURL() and getQueryString() should get you the desired result.In a Spring project you can use You can use filter .donot forget to put  <dispatcher>FORWARD</dispatcher> in filter mapping in web.xmlUse the following methods on HttpServletRequest objectjava.lang.String getRequestURI()\n-Returns the part of this request\'s URL from the protocol name up to the query string in the first line of the HTTP request.java.lang.StringBuffer getRequestURL() \n-Reconstructs the URL the client used to make the request.java.lang.String getQueryString() \n-Returns the query string that is contained in the request URL after the path.Somewhat late to the party, but I included this in my MarkUtils-Web library in WebUtils - Checkstyle-approved and JUnit-tested:Probably the fastest and most robust answer here so far behind Mat Banik\'s - but even his doesn\'t account for potential non-standard port configurations with HTTP/HTTPS.See also:
