I need to install psycopg2 v2.4.1 specifically. I accidentally did:Instead of:That installs 2.4.4 instead of the earlier version. Now even after I pip uninstall psycopg2 and attempt to reinstall with the correct version, it appears that pip is re-using the cache it downloaded the first time.How can I force pip to clear out its download cache and use the specific version I\'m including in the command?If using pip 6.0 or newer, try adding the --no-cache-dir option.If using pip older than pip 6.0, upgrade it with pip install -U pip.  Clear the cache directory where appropriate for your systemLinux and UnixOS XWindowsFrom documentation at https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install.html#caching:Starting with v6.0, pip provides an on-by-default cache which\n  functions similarly to that of a web browser. While the cache is on by\n  default and is designed do the right thing by default you can disable\n  the cache and always access PyPI by utilizing the --no-cache-dir\n  option.pip can install py ignoring the cache, like thisOn Ubuntu, I had to delete /tmp/pip-build-root.I just had a similar problem and found that the only way to get pip to upgrade the package was to delete the $PWD/build (%CD%\\build on Windows) directory that might have been left over from a previously unfinished install or a previous version of pip (it now deletes the build directories after a successful install).On Windows 7, I had to delete %HOMEPATH%/pip.On archlinux pip cache is located at ~/.cache/pip, I could solve my issue by removing the http folder inside it.If using virtualenv, look for the build directory under your environments root.I had to delete %TEMP%\\pip-build On Windows 7On my mac I had to remove the cache directory ~/Library/Caches/pip/On Mac OS (Mavericks), I had to delete /tmp/pip-build/(...) it appears that pip is re-using the cache (...)I\'m pretty sure that\'s not what\'s happening. Pip used to (wrongly) reuse build directory not cache. This was fixed in version 1.4 of pip which was released on 2013-07-23.
