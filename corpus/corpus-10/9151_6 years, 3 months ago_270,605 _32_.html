Suppose I have a string:I want to get the last four characters of this string which is "d124". I can use SubString, but it needs a couple of lines of code.Is it possible to get this result in one expression with C#?If you\'re positive the length of your string is at least 4, then it\'s even shorter:You can use an extension method:And then call:Ok, so I see this is an old post, but why are we rewriting code that is already provided in the framework? I would suggest that you add a reference to the framework DLL "Microsoft.VisualBasic"Using Substring is actually quite short and readable:Here is another alternative that shouldn\'t perform too badly (because of deferred execution):new string(mystring.Reverse().Take(4).Reverse().ToArray());Although an extension method for the purpose mystring.Last(4) is clearly the cleanest solution, albeit a bit more work.A simple solution would be:You can simply use Substring method of C#. For ex.It will return result 0000.It is just this:Compared to some previous answers, the main difference is that this piece of code takes into consideration when the input string is:Here it is:This won\'t fail for any length string.This is probably overkill for the task at hand, but if there needs to be additional validation, it can possibly be added to the regular expression.Edit:  I think this regex would be more efficient:Use a generic Last<T>. That will work with ANY IEnumerable, including string.And a specific one for string:Definition:Usage:Result:ofI threw together some code modified from various sources that will get the results you want, and do a lot more besides. I\'ve allowed for negative int values, int values that exceed the length of the string, and for end index being less than the start index. In that last case, the method returns a reverse-order substring. There are plenty of comments, but let me know if anything is unclear or just crazy. I was playing around with this to see what all I might use it for. So if you have a string like "This is an extension method", here are some examples and results to expect.Hopefully this version is helpful to someone. It operates just like normal if you don\'t use any negative numbers, and provides defaults for out of range params.assuming you wanted the strings in between a string which is located 10 characters from the last character and you need only 3 characters; say StreamSelected = "rtsp://72.142.0.230:80/SMIL-CHAN-273/4CIF-273.stream"\nin the above, I need to extract the "273" that I will use in database query
