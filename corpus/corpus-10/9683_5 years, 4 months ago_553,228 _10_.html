I\'m trying: A.Date looks like: 2010-03-04 00:00:00.000However, this is not working. Can anyone provide a reference for why?In your query, 2010-4-01 is treated as a mathematical expression, so in essence it read (2010 minus 4 minus 1 is 2005\nConverting it to a proper datetime, and using single quotes will fix this issue.)Technically, the parser might allow you to get away withit will do the conversion for you, but in my opinion it is less readable than explicitly converting to a DateTime for the maintenance programmer that will come after you.Try enclosing your date into a character string.We can use like below as wellFirst convert TexBox into the Datetime then....use that variable into the Query
