I\'m checking if(response[0].title !== undefined), but I get the error:Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property \'title\' of undefined.response[0] is not defined, check if it is defined and then check for its property title.I had trouble with all of the other code examples above. In Chrome, this was the condition that worked for me:I will have to test that in other browsers and see how things go I suppose.Just check if response[0] is undefined:If you still need to explicitly check the title, do so after the initial check:Actually you must surround it with an Try/Catch block so your code won\'t stop from working.\nLike this:typeof:It\'ll be because response[0] itself is undefined.Check if you\'re response[0] actually exists, the error seems to suggest it doesn\'t.You must first check whether response[0] is undefined, and only if it\'s not, check for the rest. That means that in your case, response[0] is undefined.Check if condition == null; \nIt will resolve the problemI know i went here 7 months late, but I found this questions and it looks interesting. I tried this on my browser console.If variable x is undefined, error is catched and it will be false, if not, it will return true. So you can use eval function to set the value to a variable
