What\'s the difference when using GET or POST method? Which one is more secure? What are (dis)advantages of each of them?(similar question)It\'s not a matter of security. The HTTP protocol defines GET-type requests as being idempotent, while POSTs may have side effects. In plain English, that means that GET is used for viewing something, without changing it, while POST is used for changing something. For example, a search page should use GET, while a form that changes your password should use POST.Also, note that PHP confuses the concepts a bit. A POST request gets input from the query string and through the request body. A GET request just gets input from the query string. So a POST request is a superset of a GET request; you can use $_GET in a POST request, and it may even make sense to have parameters with the same name in $_POST and $_GET that mean different things.For example, let\'s say you have a form for editing an article. The article-id may be in the query string (and, so, available through $_GET[\'id\']), but let\'s say that you want to change the article-id. The new id may then be present in the request body ($_POST[\'id\']). OK, perhaps that\'s not the best example, but I hope it illustrates the difference between the two.When the user enters information in a form and clicks Submit , there are two ways the information can be sent from the browser to the server: in the URL, or within the body of the HTTP request.The GET method, which was used in the example earlier, appends name/value pairs to the URL. Unfortunately, the length of a URL is limited, so this method only works if there are only a few parameters. The URL could be truncated if the form uses a large number of parameters, or if the parameters contain large amounts of data. Also, parameters passed on the URL are visible in the address field of the browser not the best place for a password to be displayed.The alternative to the GET method is the POST method. This method packages the name/value pairs inside the body of the HTTP request, which makes for a cleaner URL and imposes no size limitations on the forms output. It is also more secure.The best answer was the first one.You are using: There are two common "security" implications to using GET.  Since data appears in the URL string its possible someone looking over your shoulder at Address Bar/URL may be able to view something they should not be privy to such as a session cookie that could potentially be used to hijack your session.  Keep in mind everyone has camera phones.The other security implication of GET has to do with GET variables being logged to most web servers access log as part of the requesting URL.  Depending on the situation, regulatory climate and general sensitivity of the data this can potentially raise concerns.Some clients/firewalls/IDS systems may frown upon GET requests containing an excessive amount of data and may therefore provide unrelable results.POST supports advanced functionality such as support for multi-part binary input used for file uploads to web servers.POST requires a content-length header which may increase the complexity of an application specific client implementation as the size of data submitted must be known in advance  preventing a client request from being formed in an exclusivly single-pass incremental mode.. Perhaps a minor issue for those choosing to abuse HTTP by using it as an RPC transport.Others have already done a good job in covering the semantic differences and the "when" part of this question.Here is the key point of GET requestand Here is the key point of POST requestI use GET when I\'m retrieving information from a URL and POST when I\'m sending information to a URL.You should use POST if there is a lot of data, or sort-of sensitive information (really sensitive stuff needs a secure connection as well). Use GET if you want people to be able to bookmark your page, because all the data is included with the bookmark. Just be careful of people hitting REFRESH with the GET method, because the data will be sent again every time without warning the user (POST sometimes warns the user about resending data).Get and Post methods have nothing to do with the server technology you are using, it works the same in php, asp.net or ruby. GET and POST are part of HTTP protocol.\nAs mark noted, POST is more secure. POST forms are also not cached by the browser.\nPOST is also used to transfer large quantities of data.The reason for using POST when making changes to data:Also, don\'t put sensitive information in the query string (only option with GET) because it shows up in the address bar, bookmarks and server logs.Hopefully this explains why people say POST is \'secure\'. If you are transmitting sensitive data you must use SSL.This W3C document explains the use of HTTP GET and POST.I think it is an authoritative source.The summary is (section 1.3 of the document):GET and POST are HTTP methods which can achieve similar goalsGET is basically for just getting (retrieving) data, A GET should not have a body, so aside from cookies, the only place to pass info is in the URL and URLs are limited in length , GET is less secure compared to POST because data sent is part of the URLNever use GET when sending passwords, credit card or other sensitive information!, Data is visible to everyone in the URL, Can be cached data .\n GET is harmless when we are reloading or calling back button, it will be book marked, parameters remain in browser history, only ASCII characters allowed. POST may involve anything, like storing or updating data, or ordering a product, or sending e-mail. POST method has a body.POST method is secured for passing sensitive and confidential information to server it will not visible in query parameters in URL and parameters are not saved in browser history. There are no restrictions on data length. When we are reloading the browser should alert the user that the data are about to be re-submitted. POST method cannot be bookmarkedUse GET method if you want to retrieve the resources from URL. You could always see the last page if you hit the back button of your browser, and it could be bookmarked, so it is not as secure as POST method.Use POST method if you want to \'submit\' something to the URL. For example you want to create a google account and you may need to fill in all the detailed information, then you hit \'submit\' button (POST method is called here), once you submit successfully, and try to hit back button of your browser, you will get error or a new blank form, instead of last page with filled form.The GET method:It is used only for sending 256 character dateWhen using this method, the information can be seen on the browserIt is the default method used by formsIt is not so secured.The POST method:It is used for sending unlimited data.With this method, the information cannot be seen on the browserYou can explicitly mention the POST methodIt is more secured than the GET methodIt provides more advanced features
