When I want to remove a Cookie I tryI see in my cookie browser from firefox that the cookie still exists. How can I really remove the cookie?You May Try thisSet the value to "" and the expiry date to yesterday (or any date in the past)Then the cookie will expire the next time the page loads.A clean way to delete a cookie is to clear both of $_COOKIE value and browser cookie file :That will unset the cookie in your code, but since the $_COOKIE variable is refreshed on each request, it\'ll just come back on the next page request.To actually get rid of the cookie, set the expiration date in the past:To reliably delete a cookie you must not set it to expire in the past, this is because client computers can and often do have times which different from that of your server. The best practice is to overwrite the current cookie with a blank cookie which expires one second in the future, as so;I had the same problem in my code and found that it was a cookie path issue.  Check out this stack overflow post: Can't delete php set cookie I had set the cookie using a path value of "/", but didn\'t have any path value when I tried to clear it, so it didn\'t clear.  So here is an example of what worked:Setting the cookie:Clearing the cookie:Hope that helps.If you set the cookie to expire in the past, the browser will remove it.  See setcookie() delete example at php.netSee the sample labelled "Example #2 setcookie() delete example" from the PHP docs. To clear a cookie from the browser, you need to tell the browser that the cookie has expired... the browser will then remove it. unset as you\'ve used it just removes the \'hello\' cookie from the COOKIE array.This is how PHP v7 setcookie() code works when you do:From the output of tcpdump while sniffing on the port 80, the server sends to the client (Browser) the following HTTP headers:Observing packets in the following requests the Browser no longer sends these cookies in the headersTo delete cookie you just need to set the value to NULL:"If you\'ve set a cookie with nondefault values for an expiration time, path, or domain, you must provide those same values again when you delete the cookie for the cookie to be deleted properly." \nQuote from "Learning PHP5" book.So this code should work(works for me):Setting the cookie:\nsetcookie(\'foo\', \'bar\', time() + 60 * 5);Deleting the cookie:\nsetcookie(\'foo\', \'\', time() + 60 * 5);But i noticed that everybody is setting the expiry date to past, is that necessary, and why? To remove all cookies you could write:Just set the expiration date to one hour ago, if you want to "remove" the cookie, like this:orSource: http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.setcookie.phpYou should use the filter_input() function for all globals which a visitor can enter/manipulate, like this:You can read more about it here: http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.filter-input.php and here: http://www.w3schools.com/php/func_filter_input.aspI know that there has been a long time since this topic has been created but I saw a little mistake within this solution (I can call it like that, because it\'s a detail).\nI agree that the better solution is probably this solution:But, in the present case, you delete the cookies in every case where the unset function works and immediately you create new expired cookies in case that the unset function doesn\'t work.That means that even if the unset function works, it will still have 2 cookies on the computer.\nThe asked goal, in a logical point of view, is to delete the cookies if it is possible and if it really isn\'t, make it expire; to get "the cleanest" result.So, I think we better should do:Thanks and have a nice day :)It\'s simple!You could set a session variable based on cookie valuesYou can simply use this customize function:If you want to remove $_COOKIE[\'user_account\'].\nJust use:You have to delete cookies with php in your server and also with js for your browser.. (They has made with php, but cookie files are in the browser client too):An example:Most of you are forgetting that this will only work on a local machine.\nOn a domain you will need a pattern like this example.
