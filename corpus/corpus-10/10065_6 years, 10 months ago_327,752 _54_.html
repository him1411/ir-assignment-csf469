I\'m trying to redirect all insecure HTTP requests on my site (e.g. http://www.example.com) to HTTPS (https://www.example.com). I\'m using PHP btw. Can I do this in .htaccess?Update: Although this answer has been accepted a few years ago, note that its approach is now recommended against by the Apache documentation. Use a Redirect instead. See this answer.SourceThe Apache docs recommend against using a rewrite:To redirect http URLs to https, do the following:This snippet should go into main server configuration file, not into .htaccess as asked in the question.This article might have come up only after the question was asked and answered, but seems to be the current way to go.I\'d recommend with 301 redirect:As I was saying in this question, I\'d suggest you avoid redirecting all HTTP requests to their HTTPS equivalent blindly, as it may cause you a false impression of security. Instead, you should probably redirect the "root" of your HTTP site to the root of your HTTPS site and link from there, only to HTTPS.The problem is that if some link or form on the HTTPS site makes the client send a request to the HTTP site, its content will be visible, before the redirection.For example, if one of your pages served over HTTPS has a form that says <form action="http://example.com/doSomething"> and sends some data that shouldn\'t be sent in clear, the browser will first send the full request (including entity, if it\'s a POST) to the HTTP site first. The redirection will be sent immediately to the browser and, since a large number of users disable or ignore the warnings, it\'s likely to be ignored.Of course, the mistake of providing the links that should be to the HTTPS site but that end up being for the HTTP site may cause problems as soon as you get something listening on the HTTP port on the same IP address as your HTTPS site. However, I think keeping the two sites as a "mirror" only increases the chances of making mistakes, as you may tend to make the assumption that it will auto-correct itself by redirecting the user to HTTPS, whereas it\'s often too late. (There were similar discussions in this question.)I found out that the best way for https and www on domain isI like this method of redirecting from http to https. Because I don\'t need to edit it for each site.This is the html redirect approach it works but not the best.PHP approach.htaccess approchcopied from:\nwww.letuslook.orgAdd the following code to the .htaccess file:Where [your domain name] is your website\'s domain name.You can also redirect specific folders off of your domain name by replacing the last line of the code above with:This is the proper method of redirecting HTTP to HTTPS using .htaccess according to GoDaddy.com. The first line of code is self-explanatory. The second line of code checks to see if HTTPS is off, and if so it redirects HTTP to HTTPS by running the third line of code, otherwise the third line of code is ignored.https://www.godaddy.com/help/redirect-http-to-https-automatically-8828Using the following code in your .htaccess file automatically redirects visitors to the HTTPS version of your site:If you have an existing .htaccess file:Do not duplicate RewriteEngine On.Make sure the lines beginning RewriteCond and RewriteRule immediately follow the already-existing RewriteEngine On.The best solution depends on your requirements. This is a summary of previously posted answers with some context added.If you work with the Apache web server and can change its configuration, follow the Apache documentation:But you also asked if you can do it in a .htaccess file. In that case you can use Apache\'s RewriteEngine:If everything is working fine and you want browsers to remember this redirect, you can declare it as permanent by changing the last line to:But be careful if you may change your mind on this redirect. Browsers remember it for a very long time and won\'t check if it changed.You may not need the first line RewriteEngine On depending on the webserver configuration.If you look for a PHP solution, look at the $_SERVER array and the header function:Do everything that is explained above for redirection. Just add "HTTP Strict Transport Security" to your header. This will avoid man in the middle attack.Edit your apache configuration file (/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/website.conf and /etc/apache2/httpd.conf for example) and add the following to your VirtualHost:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_SecurityThrough .htaccess This will help.Also, Refer this for More Detail. How To Redirect Http To Https?To redirect all http requests to https , you can use :If mod-rewrite isn\'t enabled and you are on apache 2.4, you can also use a Redirect inside if directive to redirect http requests to https .Apache 2.4.Unless you need mod_rewrite for other things, using Apache core IF directive is cleaner & faster:You can add more conditions to the IF directive, such as ensure a single canonical domain without the www prefix:There\'s a lot of familiarity inertia in using mod_rewrite for everything, but see if this works for you.More info: https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#ifTo see it in action (try without www. or https://, or with .net instead of .com): https://nohodental.com/ (a site I\'m working on).If you are using Apache, mod_rewrite is the easiest solution, and has a lot of documentation online how to do that. For example: http://www.askapache.com/htaccess/http-https-rewriterule-redirect.htmlA different edge to this problem is when a Load Balancer comes into play. The situation is as follows: \n- Traffic from browser to Load Balancer, and back, is (should be) HTTPS\n- Traffic between Load Balancer and actual WebServer is HTTP. So, all server request variables in PHP or Apache show that the connection is just HTTP. And the HTTP and HTTPS directories on the Server are the same.The RewriteCondition in the approved answer does not work. \nIt gives either a loop or it just doesn\'t work. Question is: How to get this working on a Load Balancer. (Or is the Load Balancer configured wrong. Which is what I\'m hoping for because then I can move the problem over to the WebHosting company :-) )
