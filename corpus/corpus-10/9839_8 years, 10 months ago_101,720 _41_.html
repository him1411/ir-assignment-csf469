Say I have the following in my models.py:I.e. there are multiple Companies, each having a range of Rates and Clients.  Each Client should have a base Rate that is chosen from it\'s parent Company\'s Rates, not another Company\'s Rates.When creating a form for adding a Client, I would like to remove the Company choices (as that has already been selected via an "Add Client" button on the Company page) and limit the Rate choices to that Company as well.How do I go about this in Django 1.0?  My current forms.py file is just boilerplate at the moment:And the views.py is also basic:In Django 0.96 I was able to hack this in by doing something like the following before rendering the template:ForeignKey.limit_choices_to seems promising but I don\'t know how to pass in the_company.id and I\'m not clear if that will work outside the Admin interface anyway.Thanks.  (This seems like a pretty basic request but if I should redesign something I\'m open to suggestions.)ForeignKey is represented by django.forms.ModelChoiceField, which is a ChoiceField whose choices are a model QuerySet.  See the reference for ModelChoiceField.So, provide a QuerySet to the field\'s queryset attribute.  Depends on how your form is built.  If you build an explicit form, you\'ll have fields named directly. If you take the default ModelForm object, form.fields["rate"].queryset = ...This is done explicitly in the view.  No hacking around.In addition to S.Lott\'s answer and as becomingGuru mentioned in comments, its possible to add the queryset filters by overriding the ModelForm.__init__ function. (This could easily apply to regular forms) it can help with reuse and keeps the view function tidy. This can be useful for reuse say if you have common filters needed on many models (normally I declare an abstract Form class). E.g.Other than that I\'m just restating Django blog material of which there are many good ones out there. This is simple, and works with Django 1.4:You don\'t need to specify this in a form class, but can do it directly in the ModelAdmin, as Django already includes this built-in method on the ModelAdmin (from the docs):An even niftier way to do this (for example in creating a front-end admin interface that users can access) is to subclass the ModelAdmin and then alter the methods below.  The net result is a user interface that ONLY shows them content that is related to them, while allowing you (a super-user) to see everything.I\'ve overridden four methods, the first two make it impossible for a user to delete anything, and it also removes the delete buttons from the admin site.  The third override filters any query that contains a reference to (in the example \'user\' or \'porcupine\' (just as an illustration).  The last override filters any foreignkey field in the model to filter the choices available the same as the basic queryset.  In this way, you can present an easy to manage front-facing admin site that allows users to mess with their own objects, and you don\'t have to remember to type in the specific ModelAdmin filters we talked about above.  remove \'delete\' buttons:prevents delete permissionfilters objects that can be viewed on the admin site:filters choices for all foreignkey fields on the admin site:To do this with a generic view, like CreateView...the most important part of that..., read my post hereIf you haven\'t created the form and want to change the queryset you can do:This is pretty useful when you are using generic views!So, I\'ve really tried to understand this, but it seems that Django still doesn\'t make this very straightforward.  I\'m not all that dumb, but I just can\'t see any (somewhat) simple solution.I find it generally pretty ugly to have to override the Admin views for this sort of thing, and every example I find never fully applies to the Admin views.This is such a common circumstance with the models I make that I find it appalling that there\'s no obvious solution to this...I\'ve got these classes:This creates a problem when setting up the Admin for Company, because it has inlines for both Contract and Location, and Contract\'s m2m options for Location are not properly filtered according to the Company that you\'re currently editing.In short, I would need some admin option to do something like this:Ultimately I wouldn\'t care if the filtering process was placed on the base CompanyAdmin, or if it was placed on the ContractInline.  (Placing it on the inline makes more sense, but it makes it hard to reference the base Contract as \'self\'.)Is there anyone out there who knows of something as straightforward as this badly needed shortcut?  Back when I made PHP admins for this sort of thing, this was considered basic functionality!  In fact, it was always automatic, and had to be disabled if you really didn\'t want it!A more public way is by calling get_form in Admin classes. It also works for non-database fields too. For example here i have a field called \'_terminal_list\' on the form that can be used in special cases for choosing several terminal items from get_list(request), then filtering based on request.user:
