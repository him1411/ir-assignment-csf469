I\'m working in order to integrate Spring Security SAML Extension with Spring Boot.I developed a complete sample application, all the source code is published on GitHub: By running the WebApp as Spring Boot application (through Spring Tool Set, by using an embedded Application Server), it works fine.\nUnfortunately, the auth process doesn\'t work on Undertow/WildFly (and I must use it as production AS).By logging, I can see that the IdP performs the AuthN process and the instructions of my custom UserDetails implementation are correctly executed. Despite that Spring doesn\'t set up the privileges for the current user.By debugging, I checked that the problem starts from the FilterChainProxy class.\nWhen I run the webapp on WildFly, I can see that the attribute FILTER_APPLIED of ServletRequest is null, thus Spring clears the SecurityContextHolder. On VMware vFabric tc Sever and Tomcat that doesn\'t happen.\nIs there a way to resolve this issue?Investigating the problem I have noticed that there is some mess with cookies and referers in the auth request.Currently wildfly authentication will work if you change webapplication context to the Root Context:After restarting wildfly and clearing cookies all should work as expected
