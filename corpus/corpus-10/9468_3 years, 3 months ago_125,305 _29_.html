How to use threading in swift?A lot has been modernized in Swift 3.0. Running something on the background thread looks like this:As of Swift 1.1 Apple didn\'t support the above syntax without some modifications. Passing QOS_CLASS_BACKGROUND didn\'t actually work, instead use Int(QOS_CLASS_BACKGROUND.value).For more information see Apples documentation The best practice is to define a reusable function that can be accessed multiple times.e.g. somewhere like AppDelegate.swift as a Global Function.Note: in Swift 2.0, replace QOS_CLASS_USER_INITIATED.value above with QOS_CLASS_USER_INITIATED.rawValue insteadA. To run a process in the background with a delay of 3 seconds:B. To run a process in the background then run a completion in the foreground:C. To delay by 3 seconds - note use of completion parameter without background parameter:From Jameson Quave\'s tutorialSwift 2Dan Beaulieu\'s answer in swift3.You have to separate out the changes that you want to run in the background from the updates you want to run on the UI:Swift 3 utilizes new DispatchQueue class to manage queues and threads. To run something on the background thread you would use:Or if you want something in two lines of code:You can also get some in-depth info about GDC in Swift 3 in this tutorial.Good answers though, anyway I want to share my Object Oriented solution Updated for swift 3.please check it out: AsyncTaskConceptually inspired by android\'s AsyncTask, I\'ve wrote my own class in Swift AsyncTask enables proper and easy use of the UI thread. This class allows to perform background operations and publish results on the UI thread.Here are few usage examplesExample 1 - Example 2 - It has 2 generic types:BGResult - the type of the result of the background computation.When you create an AsyncTask you can those types to whatever you need to pass in and out of the background task, but if you don\'t need those types, you can mark it as unused with just setting it to: Void or with shorter syntax: () When an asynchronous task is executed, it goes through 3 steps:I really like Dan Beaulieu\'s answer, but it doesn\'t work with Swift 2.2 and I think we can avoid those nasty forced unwraps!
