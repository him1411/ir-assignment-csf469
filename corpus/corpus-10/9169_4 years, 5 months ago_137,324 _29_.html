I have a project that uses Entity Framework. While calling SaveChanges on my DbContext, I get the following exception:System.Data.Entity.Validation.DbEntityValidationException: Validation\n  failed for one or more entities. See \'EntityValidationErrors\' property\n  for more details.This is all fine and dandy, but I don\'t want to attach a debugger every time this exception occurs. More over, in production environments I cannot easily attach a debugger so I have to go to great lengths to reproduce these errors. How can I see the details hidden within the DbEntityValidationException?The easiest solution is to override SaveChanges on your entities class. You can catch the DbEntityValidationException, unwrap the actual errors and create a new DbEntityValidationException with the improved message.Your exception message will now look like this:System.Data.Entity.Validation.DbEntityValidationException: Validation\n  failed for one or more entities. See \'EntityValidationErrors\' property\n  for more details. The validation errors are: The field PhoneNumber\n  must be a string or array type with a maximum length of \'12\'; The\n  LastName field is required.You can drop the overridden SaveChanges in any class that inherits from DbContext:The DbEntityValidationException also contains the entities that caused the validation errors. So if you require even more information, you can change the above code to output information about these entities.See also: http://devillers.nl/improving-dbentityvalidationexception/As Martin indicated, there is more information in the DbEntityValidationResult.  I found it useful to get both my POCO class name and property name in each message, and wanted to avoid having to write custom ErrorMessage attributes on all my [Required] tags just for this.The following tweak to Martin\'s code took care of these details for me:To view the EntityValidationErrors collection, add the following Watch expression to the Watch window.I\'m using visual studio 2013While you are in debug mode within the catch {...} block open up the "QuickWatch" window (ctrl+alt+q) and paste in there:This will allow you to drill down into the ValidationErrors tree. It\'s the easiest way I\'ve found to get instant insight into these errors.For Visual 2012+ users who care only about the first error and might not have a catch block, you can even do:To quickly find a meaningful error message by inspecting the error during debugging:Add a quick watch for:Drill down into EntityValidationErrors like this:(collection item e.g. [0]) > ValidationErrors > (collection item e.g. [0]) > ErrorMessageI think "The actual validation errors" may contain sensitive information, and this could be the reason why Microsoft chose to put them in another place (properties). The solution marked here is practical, but it should be taken with caution.I would prefer to create an extension method. More reasons to this: Actually, this is just the validation issue, EF will validate the entity properties first before making any changes to the database.\nSo, EF will check whether the property\'s value is out of range, like when you designed the table. Table_Column_UserName is varchar(20). But, in EF, you entered a value that longer than 20. \nOr, in other cases, if the column does not allow to be a Null.\nSo, in the validation process, you have to set a value to the not null column, no matter whether you are going to make the change on it.\nI personally, like the Leniel Macaferi answer. It can show you the detail of the validation issuesUse try block in your code like You can check the details here as wellhttp://mattrandle.me/viewing-entityvalidationerrors-in-visual-studio/Validation failed for one or more entities.
