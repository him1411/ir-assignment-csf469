How can I dynamically create keys in javascript associative arrays? All the documentation I\'ve found so far is to update keys that are already created:I have a string like this " name =  oscar "And I want to end up with something like this:That is I split the string and get the first element, and I want to put that in a dictionary.Use the first example.  If the key doesn\'t exist it will be added.Will pop up a message box containing \'oscar\'.Try:Somehow all examples, while work well, are overcomplicated:This question is tagged "beginner", so let\'s make it simple.The uber-simple way to use a dictionary in JavaScript or "Why JavaScript doesn\'t have a special dictionary object?":Now let\'s change values:Deleting values is easy too:Javascript does not have associative arrays, it has objects.The following lines of code all do exactly the same thing - set the \'name\' field on an object to \'orion\'.It looks like you have an associative array because an Array is also an Object - however you\'re not actually adding things into the array at all, you\'re setting fields on the object.Now that that is cleared up, here is a working solution to your exampleIn response to MK_Dev, one is able to iterate, but not consecutively. (For that obviously an array is needed)Quick google search brings up hash tables in javascriptExample code for looping over values in a hash (from aforementioned link):Original Code (I added the line numbers so can refer to them):Almost there...add a line after 3 and before 4:line 4: Now becomes:line 5: Change to:What I\'m trying to say is that the dict[keyValuePair[0]] does not work, you need to set a string to keyValuePair[0] and use that as the associative key.  That is the only way I got mine to work.  After you have set it up you can either refer to it with numeric index or key in quotes.Hope that helps.All modern browsers support a Map, which is a key/value data stricture. There are a couple of reasons that make using a Map better than Object:Example:If you want keys that are not referenced from other objects to be garbage collected, consider using a WeakMap instead of a Map.this is ok but iterates through every property of the array object.\nif you want to only iterate through the properties myArray.one, myArray.two... you try like thisnow you can access both by myArray["one"] and iterate only through these properties.I think it is better if you just created like thisfor more info , take a look at thisJavaScript Data Structures - Associative Array}
