Is there anything out of the box that bootstrap supports to render a "regular" defacto drop down list select box?  That is, where the drop down box is a list of values and if selected populate the contents of the list box?Something similar to this functionality?http://bootstrapformhelpers.com/select/Bootstrap 3 uses the .form-control class to style form components. http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms-controlsAnother option is to make the Bootstrap dropdown behave like a select using jQuery...http://www.bootply.com/b4NKREUPkNSkelly\'s nice and easy answer is now outdated with the changes to the dropdown syntax in Bootstap. Instead use this:Test: http://jsfiddle.net/brynner/hkwhaqsj/6/HTMLjQueryCSSAnother option could be using bootstrap select. On their own words:A custom select / multiselect for Bootstrap using button dropdown, designed to behave like regular Bootstrap selects.Another way without using the .form-control is this:Ben\'s code requires the parent div to have the form-group class (I was using btn-group), this is a slightly different version which just searches for the closest div and may even be a bit faster.The Bootstrap3 .form-control is cool but for those who love or need the drop-down with button and ul option, here is the updated code. I have edited the code by Steve to fix jumping to the hash link and closing the drop-down after selection. Thanks to Steve, Ben and Skelly! I\'m currently fighting with dropdowns and I\'d like to share my experiences:There are specific situations where <select> can\'t be used and must be \'emulated\' with dropdown.For example if you want to create  bootstrap input groups, like Buttons with dropdowns (see http://getbootstrap.com/components/#input-groups-buttons-dropdowns). Unfortunately <select> is not supported in input groups, it will not be rendered properly. Or does anybody solved this already?\nI would be very interested on the solution.And to make it even more complicated, you can\'t use so simply $(this).text() to catch what user selected in dropdown if you\'re using glypicons or font awesome icons as content for dropdown. For example: \n     <li id="someId"><a href="#0"><i class="fa fa-minus"></i></a></li>\nBecause in this case there is no text and if you will add some then it will be also displayed in dropdown element and this is unwanted.I found two possible solutions:1) \nUse $(this).html() to get content of the selected <li> element and then to examine it, but you will get something like <a href="#0"><i class="fa fa-minus"></i></a> so you need to play with this to extract what you need.2)\nUse $(this).text() and hide the text in element in hidden span:\n     <li id="someId"><a href="#0"><i class="fa fa-minus"><span class="hidden">text</span></i></a></li>.\nFor me this is simple and elegant solution, you can put any text you need, text will be hidden, and you don\'t need to do any transformations of  $(this).html() result like in option 1) to get what you need.I hope it\'s clear and can help somebody :-)
