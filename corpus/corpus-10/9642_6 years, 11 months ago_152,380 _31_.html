This will return all documents with a key called "IMAGE URL", but they may still have a null value.This will return all documents with both a key called "IMAGE URL" and a non-null value.Also, according to the docs, $exists currently can\'t use an index, but $ne can.Edit: Adding some examples due to interest in this answerGiven these inserts:This will return all three documents:This will return the first and second documents only:This will return the first document only:This will return the second and third documents only:In pymongo you can use:Because pymongo represents mongo "null" as python "None". An alternative that has not been mentioned, but that may be a more efficient option for some (won\'t work with NULL entries) is to use a sparse index (entries in the index only exist when there is something in the field).  Here is a sample data set:Now, create the sparse index on imageUrl field:Now, there is always a chance (and in particular with a small data set like my sample) that rather than using an index, MongoDB will use a table scan, even for a potential covered index query.  As it turns out that gives me an easy way to illustrate the difference here:OK, so the extra documents with no imageUrl are being returned, just empty, not what we wanted.  Just to confirm why, do an explain:So, yes, a BasicCursor equals a table scan, it did not use the index. Let\'s force the query to use our sparse index with a hint():And there is the result we were looking for - only documents with the field populated are returned.  This also only uses the index (i.e. it is a covered index query), so only the index needs to be in memory to return the results.This is a specialized use case and can\'t be used generally (see other answers for those options). In particular it should be noted that as things stand you cannot use count() in this way (for my example it will return 6 not 4), so please only use when appropriate.db.collection_name.find({"filed_name":{$exists:true}}); fetch documents that contain this filed_name even it is null.My proposition:You can check on the required attribute\'s type, it will return all the documents that its field_name queried contains a value because you are checking on the filed\'s type else if it is null the type condition doesn\'t match so nothing will be returned.N.b:if the field_name has an empty string which means "", it will be returned.It is the same behavior for \ndb.collection_name.find({"filed_name":{$ne:null}}); Extra validation:Okay, so we are not finished yet we need an extra condition.db.collection_name.\nfind({ "field_name":{$type:2},$where:"this.field_name.length >0"})ORdb.collection_name.\nfind({ "field_name":{$ne:null},$where:"this.field_name.length >0"})Reference for all the types: \nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/type/#op._S_typethe Query Will be it will return all documents having "IMAGE URL" as a key ...........
