Is there a cross-browser CSS/JavaScript technique to display a long HTML table such that the column headers stay fixed on-screen and do not scroll with the table body. Think of the "freeze panes" effect in Microsoft Excel.I want to be able to scroll through the contents of the table, but to always be able to see the column headers at the top.I was looking for a solution for this for a while and found most of the answers are not working or not suitable for my situation, so i wrote a simple solution with jquery.this is the solution outline. below is the code. here\'s the demo Fixed Header Demothis solution works in chrome & ie. since this is based on jquery this should work in other jquery supported browsers as well.If you only care about modern browsers, a fixed header can be achieved much easier by using CSS transforms. Sounds odd, but works great:Support for CSS Transforms is widely available except for IE8-. Some browsers still require vendor prefixes though. \nHere is the full example for reference:I\'ve just completed putting together a jQuery plugin that will take valid single table using valid HTML (have to have a thead and tbody) and will output a table that has fixed headers, optional fixed footer that can either be a cloned header or any content you chose (pagination, etc.).  If you want to take advantage of larger monitors it will also resize the table when the browser is resized.  Another added feature is being able to side scroll if the table columns can not all fit in view.http://fixedheadertable.com/on github: http://markmalek.github.com/Fixed-Header-Table/It\'s extremely easy to setup and you can create your own custom styles for it.  It also uses rounded corners in all browsers.  Keep in mind I just released it, so it\'s still technically beta and there are very few minor issues I\'m ironing out.It works in Internet Explorer 7, Internet Explorer 8, Safari, Firefox and Chrome.All of the attempts to solve this from outside the CSS spec are pale shadows of what we really want:  Delivery on the implied promise of THEAD.This frozen-headers-for-a-table issue has been an open wound in HTML/CSS for a long time.In a perfect world, there would be a pure-css solution for this problem.  Unfortunately there doesn\'t seem to be a good one in place. Relevant standards-discussions on this topic include:UPDATE:  Firefox shipped position:sticky  in version 32.  Everyone wins!I also created a plugin that addresses this issue. My project - jQuery.floatThead has been around for over a year now and is very mature. It requires no external styles and does not expect your table to be styled in any particular way. It supports IE8+ and FF/Chrome.Currently it has:231 commits and 393 stars on githubMany (not all) of the answers here are quick hacks that may have solved the problem one person was having but will work not for every table.  Some of the other plugins are old and probably work great  with IE but will break on FF and chrome.If you target modern browsers and don\'t have extravagant styling needs: http://jsfiddle.net/dPixie/byB9d/3/ ... Although the big four version is pretty sweet as well this version handles fluid width a lot better.With the advances of HTML5 and CSS3 this is now possible, at least for modern browsers. The slightly hackish implementation I came up with can be found here: http://jsfiddle.net/dPixie/byB9d/3/. I have tested it in FX 25, Chrome 31 and IE 10 ...Relevant HTML (insert a HTML5 doctype at the top of your document though):With this CSS:Simply put you have a table header, that you visually hide by making it 0px high, that also contains divs used as the fixed header. The table\'s container leaves enough room at the top to allow for the absolutely positioned header, and the table with scrollbars appear as you would expect.The code above uses the positioned class to position the table absolutely (I\'m using it in a popup style dialog) but you can use it in the flow of the document as well by removing the positioned class from the container.It\'s not perfect. Firefox refuses to make the header row 0px (at least I did not find any way) but stubbornly keeps it at minimum 4px ... It\'s not a huge problem, but depending on your styling it will mess with your borders etc.The table is also using a faux column approach where the background color of the container itself is used as the background for the header divs, that are transparent.All in all there might be styling issues depending on your requirements, especially borders or complicated backgrounds. There might also be problems with computability, I haven\'t checked it in a wide variety of browsers yet (please comment with your experiences if you try it out), but I didn\'t find anything like it so I thought it was worth posting anyway ...Here is a jQuery plugin for fixed table header. It allows the entire page to scroll, freezing the header when it reaches the top. It works well with twitter bootstrap tables.Github repo: https://github.com/oma/table-fixed-headerIt does not scroll only table content. Look to other tools for that, as one of these other answers. You decide what fits your case the best.Most of the solutions posted here require jQuery. If you are looking for a framework independent solution try Grid: http://www.matts411.com/post/grid/It\'s hosted on Github here: https://github.com/mmurph211/GridNot only does it support fixed headers, it also supports fixed left columns and footers, among other things.This is a variation on Mahes\' solution. You can call it like $(\'table#foo\').scrollableTable();The idea is:The CSS could be:That said, it works for my purposes and you\'re free to take and modify it.Here\'s the plugin:All of the pure CSS solutions I\'ve seen so far-- clever though they may be-- lack a certain level of polish, or just don\'t work right in some situations. So, I decided to create my own...Features:Here are a couple fiddles that show the fluid and auto width options:Fluid Width and Height (adapts to screen size): jsFiddle (Note that the scrollbar only shows up when needed in this configuration, so you may have to shrink the frame to see it)Auto Width, Fixed Height (easier to integrate with other content): jsFiddleThe Auto Width, Fixed Height configuration probably has more use cases, so I\'ll post the code below.HTMLCSSThe method I used to freeze the header row is similar to d-Pixie\'s, so refer to his post for an explanation. There were a slew of bugs and limitations with that technique that could only be fixed with heaps of additional CSS and an extra div container or two.I extended Nathan\'s function to also support a fixed footer and max height.\nAlso, the function will set the css itself, you only have to support a width.Usage:Fixed height:Max height (if the browser supports the css \'max-height\' option):Script::) Not-so-clean, but pure HTML/CSS solution.Updated for IE8+\nJSFiddle exampleTwo divs, one for header, one for data.  Make the data div scrollable, and use JavaScript to set the width of the columns in the header to be the same as the widths in the data.  I think the data columns widths need to be fixed rather than dynamic.I realize the question allows JavaScript but here is a pure CSS solution I worked up that also allows for the table to expand horizontally. Tested with IE10 and latest Chrome and Firefox browsers. A link to jsFiddle is at the bottom.The HTML:And the CSS:http://jsfiddle.net/HNHRv/3/Use the latest version of jQuery, and include the following javascript codeThis is not an exact solution to the fixed header row, but I have created a rather ingenious method of repeating the header row throughout the long table yet still keeping the ability to sort. This neat little option requires the jQuery tablesorter plugin. Here\'s how it works:htmlObvioiusly, my table has many more rows than this. 193 to be exact, nut you can see where the header row repeats. The repeating header row is setup by this function:jQueryI wish I had found @Mark\'s solution earlier, but I went and wrote my own before I saw this SO question...Mine is a very lightweight jQuery plugin that supports fixed header, footer, column spanning (colspan), resizing, horizontal scrolling, and an optional number of rows to display before scrolling starts.jQuery.scrollTableBody (GitHub)As long as you have a table with proper <thead>, <tbody>, and (optional) <tfoot>, all you need to do is this:I developed a simple light weight jQuery plug-in for converting a well HTML table to a scrollable table with fixed table header and columns.The plugin works well to match pixel-to-pixel positioning the fixed section with the scrollable section. Additionally, you could also freeze number of columns that will be always in view when scrolling horizontally. Demo & Documentation: http://meetselva.github.io/fixed-table-rows-cols/ Github Repo: https://github.com/meetselva/fixed-table-rows-colsBelow is the usage for a simple table with fixed header,A lot of people seem to be looking for this answer, I found it buried in an answer to another question here: Syncing column width of between tables in two different frames, etcOf the dozens of methods I have tried this is the only method I found that works reliably to allow you to have a scrolling bottom table with the header table having the same widths.Here is how I did it, first I improved upon the jsfiddle above to create this function, which works on both td and th (in case that trips up others who use th for styling of their header rows).Next, you need to create two tables, NOTE the header table should have an extra TD to leave room in the top table for the scrollbar, like this:then do something like:This is the only solution that I found on stackoverflow that works out of many similar questions that have been posted, that works in all my cases.For example I tried the jquery stickytables plugin which does not work with durandal, and the google code project here https://code.google.com/p/js-scroll-table-header/issues/detail?id=2Other solutions involving cloning the tables, have poor performance, or suck and don\'t work in all cases. THERE IS NO NEED FOR THESE OVERLY COMPLEX SOLUTIONS, JUST MAKE TWO TABLES LIKE THE EXAMPLES BELOW AND CALL setHeaderTableWidth function like described here and BOOM, YOU ARE DONE.If this does not work for you, you probably were playing with your css box-sizing property and you need to set it correctly. It is easy to screw up your css by accident there are many things that can go wrong so just be aware/careful of that. THIS APPROACH WORKS FOR ME. I\'m curious if it works for others, let me know. Good luck!Here\'s a solution that we ended up working with (in order to deal with some edge cases and older versions of IE we eventually also faded out the title bar on scroll then fade it back in when scrolling ends, but in Firefox and Webkit browsers this solution just works. It assumes border-collapse: collapse.The key to this solution is that once you apply border-collapse, CSS transforms work on the header, so it\'s just a matter of intercepting scroll events and setting the transform correctly. You don\'t need to duplicate anything. Short of this behavior being implemented properly in the browser, it\'s hard to imagine a more light-weight solution.JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/podperson/tH9VU/2/It\'s implemented as a simple jQuery plugin. You simply make your thead\'s sticky with a call like $(\'thead\').sticky() and they\'ll hang around. Works for multiple tables on a page and head sections halfway down big tables.I found this workaround - move header row in a table above table with data:By applying the StickyTableHeaders jQuery plugin to the table, the column headers will stick to the top of the viewport as you scroll down.
