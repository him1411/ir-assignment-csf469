What does it mean?Especially in case of "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded".rfc2616It doesn\'t matter what the content-type is.Extension at post below.It\'s the number of bytes of data in the body of the request or response.  The body is the part that comes after the blank line below the headers.One octet is 8 bits. Content-length is the number of octets that the message body represents.The Content-Length header is a number denoting an the exact byte length of the HTTP body. The HTTP body starts immediately after the first empty line that is found after the start-line and headers.Generally the Content-Length header is used for HTTP 1.1 so that the receiving party knows when the current response* has finished, so the connection can be reused for another request.* ...or request, in the case of request methods that have a body, such as POST, PUT or PATCHAlternatively, Content-Length header can be omitted and a chunked Transfer-Encoding header can be used. If both Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers are missing, then at the end of the response the connection must be closed.From here:The Content-Length entity-header field\n  indicates the size of the entity-body,\n  in decimal number of OCTETs, sent to\n  the recipient or, in the case of the\n  HEAD method, the size of the\n  entity-body that would have been sent\n  had the request been a GET. An example is Applications SHOULD use this field to\n  indicate the transfer-length of the\n  message-body, unless this is\n  prohibited by the rules in section\n  4.4. Any Content-Length greater than or\n  equal to zero is a valid value.\n  Section 4.4 describes how to determine\n  the length of a message-body if a\n  Content-Length is not given. Note that the meaning of this field is\n  significantly different from the\n  corresponding definition in MIME,\n  where it is an optional field used\n  within the "message/external-body"\n  content-type. In HTTP, it SHOULD be\n  sent whenever the message\'s length can\n  be determined prior to being\n  transferred, unless this is prohibited\n  by the rules in section 4.4.My interpretation is that this means the length "on the wire", i.e. the length of the *encoded" contentFrom this pageThe most common use of POST, by far,\n  is to submit HTML form data to CGI\n  scripts. In this case, the\n  Content-Type: header is usually\n  application/x-www-form-urlencoded, \n  and the Content-Length: header gives\n  the length of the URL-encoded form\n  data (here\'s a note on URL-encoding).\n  The CGI script receives the message\n  body through STDIN, and  decodes it.\n  Here\'s a typical form submission,\n  using POST:According to the spec:The Content-Length entity-header field indicates the size of the entity-body, in decimal number of OCTETs, sent to the recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method, the size of the entity-body that would have been sent had the request been a GET.An example isApplications SHOULD use this field to indicate the transfer-length of the message-body, unless this is prohibited by the rules in section 4.4.Any Content-Length greater than or equal to zero is a valid value.
