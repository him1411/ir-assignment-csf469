How do I pass the command line arguments to an alias? Here is a sample:But in this case the $xx is getting translated at the alias creating time and not at  runtime. I have, however, created a workaround using a shell function (after googling a little) like below:  Just wanted to know if there is a way to make aliases that accept CL parameters.\nBTW - I use \'bash\' as my default shell.You found the way: create a function instead of an alias.  The C shell has a mechanism for doing arguments to aliases, but bash and the Korn shell don\'t, because the function mechanism is more flexible and offers the same capability.Just to reiterate what has been posted for other shells, in Bash the following works:Running the following:Gives the output below:You cannot in ksh, but you can in csh.In ksh, function is the way to go. But if you really really wanted to use alias:To quote the bash man page:There is no mechanism for using arguments in the replacement text.   If\n  arguments  are  needed,  a shell function should be used (see FUNCTIONS\n  below).So it looks like you\'ve answered your own question -- use a function instead of an aliasYou may also find this command useful:mkdir dirname && cd $_where dirname is the name of the directory you want to createI found that functions cannot be written in ~/.cshrc file .. Here in alias which takes argumentsfor example, arguments passed to \'find\' commandwhere abc is the argument passed as !:1You actually can\'t do what you want with Bash aliases, since aliases are static. Instead, use the function you have created.Look here for more information: http://www.mactips.org/archives/2008/01/01/increase-productivity-with-bash-aliases-and-functions/. (Yes I know it\'s mactips.org, but it\'s about Bash, so don\'t worry.)This works in ksh:The "-x" option make the alias "exported" - alias is visible in subshells.And be aware of fact that aliases defined in a script are not visible in that script (because aliases are expanded when a script is loaded, not when a line is interpreted). This can be solved with executing another script file in same shell (using dot).The easiest way, is to use function not alias.  you can still call a function at any time from the cli.  In bash, you can just add function name() { command } it loads the same as an alias.Not sure about other shellsI think you are able to do it with shell functions if you are using bash:\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-pass-argument-to-alias-command/Here\'s a simple example function using python. You can stick in ~/.bashrc\n   You gotta have a space after the first left curly bracket\n   The python command needs to be in double quotes to get the variable substitution\n   Don\'t forget that semicolon at the endfunction count(){ python -c "for num in xrange($1):print num";}
