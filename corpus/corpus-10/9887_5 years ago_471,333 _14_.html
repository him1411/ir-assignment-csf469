This question already has an answer here:How do I drop all tables in Windows MySQL, using command prompt? The reason I want to do this is that our user has access to the database drops, but no access to re-creating the database itself, for this reason we must drop the tables manually. Is there a way to drop all the tables at once? Bear in mind that most of the tables are linked with foreign keys so they would have to be dropped in a specific order.You can generate statement like this: DROP TABLE t1, t2, t3, ... and then use prepared statements to execute it:The @Devart\'s version is correct, but here are some improvements to avoid having error.

Instead, see the script here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/12917793/1507877\nwhich does work on MySQL 5.5.  CAUTION: Around line 11, there is a "WHERE table_schema = SCHEMA();"   This should instead be "WHERE table_schema = \'INSERT NAME OF DB INTO WHICH IMPORT WILL OCCUR\';"
