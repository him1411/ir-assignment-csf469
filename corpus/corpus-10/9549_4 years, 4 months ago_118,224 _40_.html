We need to integrate Karma test runner into TeamCity and for that I\'d like to give sys-engineers small script (powershell or whatever) that would:pick up desired version number from some config file (I guess I can put it as a comment right in the karma.conf.js)check if the defined version of karma runner installed in npm\'s global repoif it\'s not, or the installed version is older than desired: pick up and install right versionrun it: karma start .\\Scripts-Tests\\karma.conf.js --reporters teamcity --single-runSo my real question is: "how can one check in a script, if desired version of package installed?". Should you do the check, or it\'s safe to just call npm -g install everytime?I don\'t want to always check and install the latest available version, because other config values may become incompatibleTo check if any module in a project is \'old\' you should do:npm outdated\'outdated\' will check every module defined in package.json and see if there is a newer version in the NPM registry.Here is an example, showing that xml2js (that is in node_modules/ in the current directory) is outdated, because a newer version exists (0.2.7):If you want to check for outdated modules and install newer version then you can do:\nnpm update (for all modules) or npm update xml2js (only checks/updates xml2js)Have a look at the NPM docs:npm outdated will identify packages that should be updated, and npm update <package name> can be used to update each package. But npm update <package name> will not update the versions in your package.json which is an issue.The best workflow is to:Check out npm-check-updates to help with this workflow.There is also a "fresh" module called npm-check:npm-checkCheck for outdated, incorrect, and unused dependencies.It also provides a convenient interactive way to update the dependencies.To update a single local package:First find out your outdated packages:npm outdatedThen update the package or packages that you want manually as:npm update --save package_nameThis way it is not necessary to update your local package.json\n   file.Note that this will update your package to the latest version.If you write some version in your package.json file and do:npm update package_nameIn this case you will get just the next stable version (wanted) regarding the version that you wrote in your package.json file.And with npm list (package_name) you can find out the current version of your local packages.One easy step:$ npm i -g npm-check-updates && ncu -a && npm iThat is all. All of the package versions in package.json will be the latest.When installing npm packages (both globally or locally) you can define a specific version by using the @version syntax to define a version to be installed.In other words, doing:\nnpm install -g karma@0.9.2 \nwill ensure that only 0.9.2 is installed and won\'t reinstall if it already exists.As a word of a advice, I would suggest avoiding global npm installs wherever you can. Many people don\'t realize that if a dependency defines a bin file, it gets installed to ./node_modules/.bin/. Often, its very easy to use that local version of an installed module that is defined in your package.json. In fact, npm scripts will add the ./node_modules/.bin onto your path.As an example, here is a package.json that, when I run npm install && npm test will install the version of karma defined in my package.json, and use that version of karma (installed at node_modules/.bin/karma) when running the test script:This gives you the benefit of your package.json defining the version of karma to use and not having to keep that config globally on your CI box.
