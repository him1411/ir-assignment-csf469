How can I insert a string at a specific index of another string? Suppose I want to insert "bar " after the "foo" how can I achieve that? I thought of substring, but there must be a simpler more straight forward way?You could prototype your own splice() into String.EDIT: Modified it to ensure that rem is an absolute value.Inserting at a specific index (rather than, say, at the first space character) has to use string slicing/substring:Try this.\nHere is a method I wrote that behaves like all other programming langauges.Example of use:Simples.Reference: \nhttp://coderamblings.wordpress.com/2012/07/09/insert-a-string-at-a-specific-index/Just make the following function:and then use it like that:Output: foo bar bazIt behaves exactly, like the C# (Sharp) String.Insert(int startIndex, string value).NOTE: This insert function inserts the string value (third parameter) before the specified integer index (second parameter) in the string str (first parameter), and then returns the new string without changing str!UPDATE 2016: Here is another just-for-fun (but more serious!) prototype function based on one-liner RegExp approach (with prepend support on undefined or negative index):Previous (back to 2012) just-for-fun solution:This is basically doing what @Bass33 is doing except I\'m also giving the option of using a negative index to count from the end.  Kind of like the substr method allows.Use case: \nLets say you have full size images using a naming convention but can\'t update the data to also provide thumbnail urls.If anyone is looking for a way to insert text at multiple indices in a string, try this out:For example, you can use this to insert <span> tags at certain offsets in a string:Given your current example you could achieve the result by eitherorbut given that you can make such assumptions, you might as well skip directly to Gullen\'s example.In a situation where you really can\'t make any assumptions other than character index-based, then I really would go for a substring solution.https://jsfiddle.net/gaby_de_wilde/wz69nw9k/You can use Regular Expressions with a dynamic pattern.outputs: This replaces text.length of whitespace characters at the beginning of the string output.\nThe RegExp means ^\\ - beginning of a line \\s any white space character, repeated {n} times, in this case text.length. Use \\\\ to \\ escape backslashes when building this kind of patterns out of strings.  another solution, cut the string in 2 and put a string in between.So, for you, it\'d be insertString("foo baz", "bar", 3);Obviously, this would be a paint to use because you have to supply your string to the function each time, but at the moment I don\'t know how to make it into something easier like a string.replace(insertion, place). The idea still stands, though.
