I have an unnormalized events-diary CSV from a client that I\'m trying to load into a MySQL table so that I can refactor into a sane format. I created a table called \'CSVImport\' that has one field for every column of the CSV file. The CSV contains 99 columns , so this was a hard enough task in itself:No constraints are on the table, and all the fields hold VARCHAR(256) values, except the columns which contain counts (represented by INT), yes/no (represented by BIT), prices (represented by DECIMAL), and text blurbs (represented by TEXT).I tried to load data into the file:The whole table is filled with NULL.I think the problem is that the text blurbs contain more than one line, and MySQL is parsing the file as if each new line would correspond to one databazse row. I can load the file into OpenOffice without a problem.The clientdata.csv file contains 2593 lines, and 570 records. The first line contains column names. I think it is comma delimited, and text is apparently delimited with doublequote.UPDATE:When in doubt, read the manual: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/load-data.htmlI added some information to the LOAD DATA statement that OpenOffice was smart enough to infer, and now it loads the correct number of records:But still there are lots of completely NULL records, and none of the data that got loaded seems to be in the right place.The core of your problem seems to be matching the columns in the CSV file to those in the table.Many graphical mySQL clients have very nice import dialogs for this kind of thing. My favourite for the job is Windows based HeidiSQL. It gives you a graphical interface to build the LOAD DATA command; you can re-use it programmatically later.Screenshot: "Import textfile" dialogTo open the Import textfile" dialog, go to Tools > Import CSV file:Use mysqlimport to load a table into the database:I found it at http://chriseiffel.com/everything-linux/how-to-import-a-large-csv-file-to-mysql/To make the delimiter a tab, use --fields-terminated-by=\'\\t\'Simplest way which I have imported 200+ rows is below command in phpmyadmin sql windowI have a simple table of country with two columns\nCountryId,CountryNamehere is .csv datahere is command:Keep one thing in mind, never appear , in second column, otherwise your import will stopNext time you need to do something like that, try using sqlizer.io. It\'s a simple online tool you can upload your CSV file to. It will generate the CREATE TABLE command with all the correct types and a series of INSERT statements that match the created table.  You just need to change the file type from Excel Spreadsheet to CSV file:phpMyAdmin can handle CSV import. Here are the steps:Prepare the CSV file to have the fields in the same order as the MySQL table fields.Remove the header row from the CSV (if any), so that only the data is in the file.Go to the phpMyAdmin interface.Select the table in the left menu.Click the import button at the top.Browse to the CSV file.Select the option "CSV using LOAD DATA".Enter "," in the "fields terminated by".Enter the column names in the same order as they are in the database table.Click the go button and you are done.This is a note that I prepared for my future use, and sharing here if someone else can benefit.The mysql command line is prone to too many problems on import. Here is how you do it:You can fix this by listing the columns in you LOAD DATA statement. From the manual:...so in your case you need to list the 99 columns in the order in which they appear in the csv file.I know that the question is old, But I would like to share thisI Used this method to import more than 100K records (~5MB) in 0.046sec Here\'s how you do it ,    Its very important to include the last line , if you have more than one fields i.e normally it skips the last field   (MySQL 5.6.17)Then , in any case if you have the first row as title for the fields , you might to include this line alsoYou could also try this online tool for generating SQL create/insert statements based on your CSV.\nhttp://www.convertcsvtomysql.com/What I like about this tool:DisadvantagesIf you are using a windows machine with Excel spreadsheet loaded, the new mySql plugin to Excel is phenomenal.  The folks at Oracle really did a nice job on that software.  You can make the database connection directly from Excel.  That plugin will analyse your data, and set up the tables for you in a format consistent with the data. I had some monster big csv files of data to convert.  This tool was a big time saver. http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/excel/You can make updates from within Excel that will populate to the database online.  This worked exceedingly well with mySql files created on ultra inexpensive GoDaddy shared hosting.  (Note when you create the table at GoDaddy, you have to select some off-standard settings to enable off site access of the database...)With this plugin you have pure interactivity between your XL spreadsheet and online mySql data storage.  PHP Query for import csv file to mysql database**Sample CSV file data **Here is sample excel file screen shot:Save as  and choose .csv.And you will have as shown below .csv data screen shot if you open using notepad++ or any other notepad.Make sure you remove header and have column alignment in .csv as in mysql Table.\nReplace folder_name by your folder nameLOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE\n\'D:/folder_name/myfilename.csv\'\nINTO TABLE mail \nFIELDS TERMINATED BY \',\' \n(fname,lname ,email, phone);If big data, you can take coffee and have it load!.Thats all you need. Change servername,username, password,dbname,path of your file, tablename and the field which is in your database you want to insertTry this, it worked for meIGNORE 1 ROWS here ignores the first row which contains the fieldnames. Note that for the filename you must type the absolute path of the file.
