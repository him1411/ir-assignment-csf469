I am trying to send email (Gmail) using python, but I am getting following error.The Python script is the following.You need to say EHLO before just running straight into STARTTLS:Also you should really create From:, To: and Subject: message headers, separated from the message body by a blank line and use CRLF as EOL markers.E.g.if you want to use Port 465 you have to create an SMTP_SSL object:I ran into a similar problem and stumbled on this question. I got an SMTP Authentication Error but my user name / pass was correct. Here is what fixed it. I read this: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255In a nutshell, google is not allowing you to log in via smtplib because it has flagged this sort of login as "less secure", so what you have to do is go to this link while you\'re logged in to your google account, and allow the access:https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureappsOnce that is set (see my screenshot below), it should work.Login now works:Response after change:Response prior:Still not working? If you still get the SMTPAuthenticationError but now the code is 534, its because the location is unknown. Follow this link:https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptchaClick continue and this should give you 10 minutes for registering your new app. So proceed to doing another login attempt now and it should work.UPDATE: This doesn\'t seem to work right away you may be stuck for a while getting this error in smptlib:The message says to use the browser to sign in:After enabling \'lesssecureapps\', go for a coffee, come back, and try the \'DisplayUnlockCaptcha\' link again. From user experience, it may take up to an hour for the change to kick in. Then try the sign-in process again. You can find it here: http://jayrambhia.com/blog/send-emails-using-pythonNot directly related but still worth pointing out is that my package tries to make sending gmail messages really quick and painless. It also tries to maintain a list of errors and tries to point to the solution immediately.It would literally only need this code to do exactly what you wrote:Or a one liner:For the package/installation please look at git or pip, available for both Python 2 and 3.Seems like problem of the old smtplib. In python2.7 everything works fine.Update: Yep, server.ehlo() also could help.There is a gmail API now, which lets you send email, read email and create drafts via REST.\nUnlike the SMTP calls, it is non-blocking which can be a good thing for thread-based webservers sending email in the request thread (like python webservers). The API is also quite powerful. It\'s easiest to setup if you have Google Apps administrator rights on the domain, because then you can give blanket permission to your client. Otherwise you have to fiddle with OAuth authentication and permission.Here is a gist demonstrating it:https://gist.github.com/timrichardson/1154e29174926e462b7agreat answer from @David, here is for Python 3 without the generic try-except:
