In jQuery I need to do an if statement to see if $this doesn\'t contain the class \'.selected\'.Basically when this function is run (on hover) I don\'t want to perform the fades if the class \'.selected\' has been appended to the div, this will mean that the image will be at full opacity to signify that it\'s selected. Searched on Google to no luck even though it\'s a simple question of how to use an IF statement...Use the "not" selector.For example, instead of:$(".thumbs").hover()try:$(".thumbs:not(.selected)").hover()jQuery has the hasClass() function that returns true if any element in the wrapped set contains the specified classTake a look at my example of useHere is the code for itEDIT:this is just a guess, but are you trying to achieve something like this? jQuery Code is here-I think the author was looking for:When you are checking if an element has or does not have a class, make sure you didn\'t accidentally put a dot in the class name:After a long time of staring at my code I realized I had done this. A little typo like this took me an hour to figure out what I had done wrong. Check your code!Putting an if inside of each part of the hover will allow you to change the select class dynamically and the hover will still work.As an example I\'ve also attached a click handler to switch the selected class to the clicked item. Then I fire the hover event on the previous item to make it fade out.You can also use the addClass and removeClass methods to toggle between items such as tabs.e.g.How about instead of using an if inside the event, you unbind the event when the select class is applied?\nI\'m guessing you add the class inside your code somewhere, so unbinding the event there would look like this:The only downside is that if you ever remove the selected class from the element, you have to subscribe it to the hover event again.
