I git push my work to a remote Git repository.Every push will prompt me to input username and password. I would like to avoid it for every push, but how to configure to avoid it?Open terminal to create ssh keys:(Only works if the commit program is capable of using certificates/private & public ssh keys)Here is a walkthrough on putty gen for the above stepsThis step varies, depending on how your remote is set up.If it is a GitHub repository and you have administrative privileges, go to settings and click \'add SSH key\'. Copy the contents of your ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub into the field labeled \'Key\'.If your repository is administered by somebody else, give the administrator your id_rsa.pub.If you have done the steps above and are still getting the password prompt, make sure your repo URL is in the formas opposed toTo see your repo URL, run:You can change the URL with:[1] This section incorporates the answer from Eric PIf you already have your SSH keys set up and are still getting the password prompt, make sure your repo URL is in the formas opposed toTo see your repo URL, run:You can change the URL with git remote set-url like so:Run following command to enable credential caching.Use should also specify caching expire,After enabling credential caching, it will be cached for 7200 seconds (2 hour).Just use --repo option for git push command. Like this:I was using the https link (https://github.com/org/repo.git)\ninstead of the ssh link;Switching solved the problem for me!You can use the git-credential-store via which stores your password on disk.Use the git-credential-cache which by default stores the password for 15 minutes.to set a different timeout, use --timeout (here 5 minutes)Wire your git client to your OS credential store. For example in Windows you bind the credential helper to wincred:Is there a way to skip password typing when using https:// on GitHub?I used the answer that Pavel suggested and it worked for me. My difference was to do it while I was adding the remote like so: git remote add (alias) https://(name:password)@github.com/(the remote address).gitAll this arises because git does not provide an option in clone/pull/push/fetch commands to send the credentials through a pipe. Though it gives credential.helper, it stores on the file system or creates a daemon etc. Often, the credentials of GIT are system level ones and onus to keep them safe is on the application invoking the git commands. Very unsafe indeed.Here is what I had to work around.\n1. Git version (git --version) should be greater than or equal to 1.8.3.GIT CLONEFor cloning, use "git clone URL" after changing the URL from the format, http://{myuser}@{my_repo_ip_address}/{myrepo_name.git} to http://{myuser}:{mypwd}@{my_repo_ip_address}/{myrepo_name.git}Then purge the repository of the password as in the next section.PURGING Now, this would have gone andIf your application is using Java to issue these commands, use ProcessBuilder instead of Runtime. If you must use Runtime, use getRunTime().exec which takes String array as arguments with /bin/bash and -c as arguments rather then the one which takes a single String as argument.GIT FETCH/PULL/PUSHMy Solution on Windows:You have to setup a SSH private key, you can review this page, how to do the setup on Mac, if you are on linux the guide should be almost the same, on Windows you would need tool like MSYS.Step 1 -Create SSH keys on your linux system using below commandIt will ask for passphrase and file name (default will be ~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)Step 2 -Once files created add public key id_rsa.pub to github account ssh section.Step 3 -On your machine add private key id_rsa to ssh-agent using below commandStep 4 -Now add remote url git@github.com:user_name/repo_name.git to your local git repo using below command.Thats it.Appears that, at least when using TortoiseGIT on Windows, it is possible to create the SSH keys and transfer these to the GIT server using simply:On Windows operating system use this instead, this works for me:e.g.
