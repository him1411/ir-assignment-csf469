I have created a new rails3 project but I am seeing following logs many times in my server logs. Why I am getting these request and how can I avoid these?Started GET "/apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png" for 192.168.6.2 at\n  2012-09-18 20:03:53 +0530ActionController::RoutingError (No route matches [GET]\n  "/apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png"):I haven\'t given this link anywhere and don\'t want to render this image anywhere. I am clueless why this resource is being tried to be loaded.Editorial Note: The information in this answer is not particularly wrong, however, more technical detail is available here:I guess apple devices make those requests if the device owner adds the site to it. This is the equivalent of the favicon. To resolve, add 2 100\xc3\x97100 png files, save it as apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png and apple-touch-icon.png and upload it to the root directory of the server. After that, the error should be gone.I noticed lots of requests for apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png and apple-touch-icon.png in the logs that tried to load the images from the root directory of the site. I first thought it was a misconfiguration of the mobile theme and plugin, but found out later that Apple devices make those requests if the device owner adds the site to it.Source: Why Webmasters Should Analyze Their 404 Error Log (Mar 2012; by Martin Brinkmann)If a user from Safari Web browser (Apple devices) visit your site. The browser tries to fetch the site icon if it is not defined in <head> in the following order:To resolve this issue either define an icon for safari web browsers or apple devices. Add something like this to head section of your site:If you want to keep <head> clean then upload the icon to root dir of your site with proper name. The default icon size is 57px.You can find more details on iOS developer library. Note that this can happen even when the user has NOT bookmarked the site to their iOS home screen - for example, any time you open a page using Chrome for iOS, it does a GET "/apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png".I\'ve handled this and other non-HTML 404 requests in my ApplicationController as follows:The format.all response takes care of images such as this PNG file (which does not exist for my site).If you ended here googling, this is a simple configuration to prevent this error full the web server logs:Apache virtualhostNginx server block:PS: Is possible you want to add apple-touch-icon.png and favicon.ico too.There\xe2\x80\x99s a gem like quiet_assets that will silence these errors in your logs if, like me, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to have to add these files to your Rails app:https://github.com/davidcelis/quiet_safariI finally solved!!

This way your log files aren\'t cluttered.then add a method \'apple_touch_not_found\' to your application_controller.rbSame thing is happening for me. And yes, as @Joao Leme said, it seems it is related to a user bookmarking a site to their device homescreen.However, I noticed that even though there is an error in the log, it\'s happening behind the scenes and the user never sees the error. I assume the device makes a request for the touch-icon specific to its resolution (which isn\'t there) until defaulting to the general apple-touch-icon or apple-touch-icon-precomposed, if present, or else generates a small screenshot of the current page.FWIW, put the icons in the /public directory.If you don\'t care about the icon looking pretty on all sort of Apple devices, just addget \'/:apple_touch_icon\' => redirect(\'/icon.png\'), constraints: { apple_touch_icon: /apple-touch-icon(-\\d+x\\d+)?(-precomposed)?\\.png/ }to your config/routes.rb file and some icon.png to your public directory. Redirecting to 404.html instead of icon.png works too.Simply create zero-sized files called the appropriate names.\nThe request will be satisfied with no additional datatransfer nor further logging lines.\n-DaveGThis whole problem is just a previewing issue, when using the local server through the instant preview feature of Adobe Edge Animate. It should and will be addressed by Adobe\'s Edge Animate developers, and there\'s no need to tweak any code or setting.Try to change link from to:
