IS there a way to trick the server so I don\'t get this error:Content was blocked because it was not signed by a valid security certificate.  I\'m pulling an iframe of an html website into another website but I keep getting the console (chrome) error in the title of this question and in internet explorer it says:Content was blocked because it was not signed by a valid security certificate.Your resource probably use a self-signed SSL certificate over HTTPS protocol.\nChromium, so Google Chrome block by default this kind of resource considered unsecure.You can bypass this this way :The problem as you can guess, is that each visitor of your website has to do this task to access your frame.You can notice that chrome will block your URL for each navigation session, while chrome can memorise for ever that you trust this domain.If your frame can be accessed by HTTP rather than HTTPS, I suggest you to use it, so this problem will be solved.Sometimes Google Chrome throws this error, even if it should not.\nI experienced it when Chrome had a new version, and it needed to be restarted.\nAfter restarting the same page worked without any errors.\nThe error in the console was:I still experienced the problem described above on an Asus T100 Windows 10 test device for both (up to date) Edge and Chrome browser.Solution was in the date/time settings of the device; somehow the date was not set correctly (date in the past). Restoring this by setting the correct date (and restarting the browsers) solved the issue for me. I hope I save someone a headache debugging this problem.If you\'re developing, and you\'re developing with a Windows machine, simply add localhost as a Trusted Site.And yes, per DarrylGriffiths\' comment, although it may look like you\'re adding an Internet Explorer setting...I believe those are Windows rather than IE settings. Although MS tend to assume that they\'re only IE (hence the alert next to "Enable Protected Mode"  that it requries restarted IE)...Offering another potential solution to this error.If you have a frontend application that makes API calls to the backend, make sure you reference the domain name that the certificate has been issued to.e.g.and notIn my case, I was making API calls to a secure server with a certificate, but using the IP instead of the domain name. This threw a Failed to load resource: net::ERR_INSECURE_RESPONSE.open up your console and hit the URL inside. it\'ll take you to the API page and then in the page accept the SSL certificate, go back to your app page and reload. \nremember that SSL certificates should have been issued for your Dev environment before. Try this code to watch for, and report, a possible net::ERR_INSECURE_RESPONSEI was having this issue as well, using a self-signed certificate, which I have chosen not to save into the Chrome Settings. After accessing the https domain and accepting the certificate, the ajax call works fine. But once that acceptance has timed-out or before it has first been accepted, the jQuery.ajax() call fails silently: the timeout parameter does not seem help and the error() function never gets called.As such, my code never receives a success() or error() call and therefore hangs. I believe this is a bug in jquery\'s handling of this error. My solution is to force the error() call after a specified timeout.This code does assume a jquery ajax call of the form jQuery.ajax({url: required, success: optional, error: optional, others_ajax_params: optional}).  Note: You will likely want to change the function within the setTimeout to integrate best with your UI: rather than calling alert().This problem is because of your https that means SSL certification. Try on Localhost.
