I installed the Visual Studio 11 Beta and suddenly all the async action methods I had created under the VS 11 Developer preview started hanging (apparently this issue: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/pfxteam/archive/2012/03/03/10277166.aspx).My app is using v4.0.30319 as the Framework Version, but there is no option to use 4.5. I repaired my .net 4.5 install to be sure, but nothing. Is there a way to configure this in IIS? Do I need to bin deploy the files (and if so which)? There is no 4.5 application pool. You can use any 4.5 application in 4.0 app pool. The .NET 4.5 is "just" an in-place-update not a major new version.Go to "Run" and execute this:NOTE: run as administrator.There is no v4.5 shown in the gui, and typically you don\'t need to manually specify v4.5 since it\'s an in-place update. However, you can set it explicitly with appcmd like this: Appcmd is located in %windir%\\System32\\inetsrv. This helped me to fix an issue with Web Deploy, where it was throwing an ERROR_APPPOOL_VERSION_MISMATCH error after upgrading from v4.0 to v4.5.MS article on setting .Net version for App Pool
