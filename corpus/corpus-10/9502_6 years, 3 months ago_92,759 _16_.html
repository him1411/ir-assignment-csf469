Visual Studio 2010 Pro: Where are the settings so that the editor can show the space, tab, paragpraph, CRLF, etc. characters? I can do it in NotePad++ though.http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/vstsstart/thread/968c0388-0f5d-4291-92db-fc67580ed347The keyboard shortcut is CTRL+R, CTRL+W.See if thats what you want - I don\'t know how to enable all the various marks you are expecting to see.For Visual Studio 2013 use CTRL+E, SEdit -> Advanced -> View White Space or Ctrl + E, SIf you want to add the button to a toolbar, it is called Toggle Visual Space in the command category "Edit".The actual command is Edit.ViewWhiteSpace.In Visual Studio 2015 and 2017 the default command still is CTRL+R, CTRL+W\nType one after the other.\nAll default shortcutsextention: There is a minimal extension adding the functionality as you would expect and buttons and short-cuts to set all line-endings in a document, or a selection.\nVisualStudio gallery: End of the LineNote: In the latest version of VisualStudio (2017) there is no option in the File-menu called Advanced Save Options.

You\'ll have to overwrite the current file.To see the CRLF you can try this extension: End of the LineIt works for VS2012+The shortcut didn\'t work for me in Visual Studio 2015, also it was not in the edit menu. Download and install the Productivity Power Tools for VS2015 and than you can find these options in the edit > advanced menu.The correct shortcut is CTRL-R-W like you don\'t have to release CTRL button while pressing W. This worked for me in VS 2015
