PostgreSQL just introduced JSONB and it\'s already trending on hacker news.  It would be great if someone could explain how it\'s different from Hstore and JSON previously present in PostgreSQL. What are it\'s advantages and limitations and when should someone consider using it?First, hstore is a contrib module, which only allows you to store key => value pairs, where keys and values can only be texts (however values can be sql NULLs too).Both json & jsonb allows you to store a valid JSON value (defined in its spec).F.ex. these are valid JSON representations: null, true, [1,false,"string",{"foo":"bar"}], {"foo":"bar","baz":[null]} - hstore is just a little subset compared to what JSON is capable (but if you only need this subset, it\'s fine).The only difference between json & jsonb is their storage:There are 3 major consequences of this:When jsonb will be available with a stable release, there will be two major use cases, when you can easily select between them:Peeyush:The short answer is:For a longer answer, you\'ll need to wait for me to do a full "HowTo" writeup closer to the 9.4 release.IMO, there is no significant reason for not using jsonb once it is available, if you are working with machine-readable data.A simple explanation of the difference between json and jsonb (original image by PostgresProfessional):More in speech video and slide show presentation by jsonb developers. Also they introduced JsQuery, pg.extension provides powerful jsonb query languageI was at the pgopen today benchmarks are way faster than mongodb, I believe it was around 500% faster for selects. Pretty much everything was faster at least by at 200% when contrasted with mongodb, than one exception right now is a update which requires completely rewriting the entire json column something mongodb handles better. The gin indexing on on jsonb sounds amazing.Also postgres will persist types of jsonb internally and basically match this with types such as numeric, text, boolean etc. Joins will also be possible using jsonbAdd PLv8 for stored procedures and this will basically be a dream come true for node.js developers. Being it\'s stored as binary jsonb will also strip all whitespace, change the ordering of properties and remove duplicate properties using the last occurance of the property. Besides the index when querying against a jsonb column contrasted to a json column postgres doesn\'t have to actually run the functionality to convert the text to json on every row which will likely save a vast amount of time alone. As far as I can tell,hstore as it currently exists (in Postgresql 9.3) does not allow for nesting other objects and arrays as the values of its key/value pairs. however a future hstore patch will allow for nesting. this patch will not be in the 9.4 release and may not be included any time soon.json as it currently exists does allow for nesting, but is text-based, and does not allow for indexing, thus it is "slow"jsonb that will be released with 9.4 will have the current nesting capabilities of json, as well as the GIN/GIST indexing of hstore, so it will be fastPeople working on postgresql 9.4 seem to be saying that the new, fast jsonb type will appeal to people who would have chosen to use a noSQL data store like MongoDB, but can now combine a relational database with query-able unstructured data under one roofhttp://www.databasesoup.com/2014/02/why-hstore2jsonb-is-most-important.htmlBenchmarks of postgresql 9.4 jsonb seem to be on par with or in some cases faster than MongoDBhttp://texture.io/alphabetum/postgresql-incl-hstore-vs-mongodb
