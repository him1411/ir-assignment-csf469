This example of knockout js works so when you edit a field and press TAB, the viewmodel data  and hence the text below the fields is updated.How can I change this code so that the viewmodel data is updated every keypress?From the documentationvalueUpdateIf your binding also includes a parameter called valueUpdate, this\n  defines which browser event KO should use to detect changes. The\n  following string values are the most commonly useful choices:"change"  (default) - updates your view model when the user\n  moves the focus to a different control,  or in the case of \n  elements, immediately after any change"keyup" - updates your view model when the user releases a key"keypress" - updates your view model when the user has typed a\n  key. Unlike keyup, this updates repeatedly while the user holds a key\n  downOf these options, "afterkeydown" is the best choice if you want to\n  keep your view model updated in real-time.In version 3.2 you can simply use textinput binding.:It does two important things:So no need for additional modules, custom controls and other things.If you want it to do updates on afterkeydown "by default," you could inject the valueUpdate binding in the value binding handler.  Just supply a new allBindingsAccessor for the handler to use that includes afterkeydown.If you\'re not comfortable "overriding" the value binding, you could give the overriding custom binding a different name and use that binding handler.demoA solution like this would be suitable for Knockout version 2.x.  The Knockout team has fleshed out a more complete binding for text-like inputs through the textInput binding in Knockout version 3 and up.  It was designed to handle all text input methods for text inputs and textarea.  It will even handle real time updating which effectively renders this approach obsolete.Jeff Mercado\'s answer is fantastic, but unfortunately broken with Knockout 3.But I found the answer suggested by the ko devs while working through Knockout 3 changes. See the bottom comments at https://github.com/knockout/knockout/pull/932. Their code:http://jsfiddle.net/mbest/GKJnt/Edit \nKo 3.2.0 now has a more complete solution with the new "textInput" binding.
