What does the \'standalone\' directive mean in an XML document?The standalone declaration is a way of telling the parser to ignore any markup declarations in the DTD. The DTD is thereafter used for validation only.As an example, consider the humble <img> tag. If you look at the XHTML 1.0 DTD, you see a markup declaration telling the parser that <img> tags must be EMPTY and possess src and alt attributes. When a browser is going through an XHTML 1.0 document and finds an <img> tag, it should notice that the DTD requires src and alt attributes and add them if they are not present. It will also self-close the <img> tag since it is supposed to be EMPTY. This is what the XML specification means by "markup declarations can affect the content of the document." You can then use the standalone declaration to tell the parser to ignore these rules.Whether or not your parser actually does this is another question, but a standards-compliant validating parser (like a browser) should.Note that if you do not specify a DTD, then the standalone declaration "has no meaning," so there\'s no reason to use it unless you also specify a DTD.Source: this awesome explanationstandalone describes if the current XML document depends on an external markup declaration.W3C describes its purpose in "Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition)":Markup declarations can affect the\n  content of the document, as passed\n  from an XML processor to an\n  application; examples are attribute\n  defaults and entity declarations. The\n  standalone document declaration, which\n  may appear as a component of the XML\n  declaration, signals whether or not\n  there are such declarations which\n  appear external to the document entity\n  or in parameter entities. [Definition:\n  An external markup declaration is\n  defined as a markup declaration\n  occurring in the external subset or in\n  a parameter entity (external or\n  internal, the latter being included\n  because non-validating processors are\n  not required to read them).]http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-rmdThe intent of the standalone=yes declaration is to guarantee that the information inside the document can be faithfully retrieved based only on the internal DTD, i.e. the document can "stand alone" with no external reference. Validating a standalone document ensures that validating and non-validating processors will provide exactly the same information.The standalone declaration serves no purpose if a document has no external DTD, and either no internal DTD or the internal DTD has no parameter entity references.The following are the actual effects of using standalone=yes.Forces documents with an external DTD or parameter entity references to throw an error if they contain references to entities not declared in the internal DTD (replacement text of parameter entities don\'t count); amp, lt, gt, apos, and quot are the only exceptionsForces non-validating processors to parse markup declarations in the internal DTD after an ignored parameter entity referenceForces validating processors to throw an error if any of the following are found in the document, and their respective declarations are in the external DTD or in parameter entity replacement text:The flip side to all this is that a non-validating processor might consider retrieving the external DTD and expanding all parameter entity references for documents that are not standalone, even though it is under no obligation to do so.The other answers here are either incomplete or incorrect, the main misconception is thatThe standalone declaration is a way of telling the parser to ignore any markup declarations in the DTD. The DTD is thereafter used for validation only.standalone="yes" means that the XML processor must use the DTD for validation only. Quite the opposite, declaring a document as standalone will actually force a non-validating processor to parse internal declarations it must normally ignore (i.e. those after a parameter entity reference). Non-validating processors must still use the info in the internal DTD to provide default attribute values and normalize tokenized attributes, as this is independent of validation.
