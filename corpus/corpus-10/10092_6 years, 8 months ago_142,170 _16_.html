I have an AppleScript script that runs a stress test. Part of the test is to open, save, and close certain files. Somehow, the files have picked up some "extended attributes" that prohibit the files from being saved. That causes the stress test to fail.How do I remove the extended attributes?Use the xattr command. You can inspect the extended attributes:and use the -d option to delete one extended attribute:you can also use the -c option to remove all extended attributes:xattr -h will show you the command line options, and xattr has a man page.See Bavarious\'s answer.Use xattr with the -c flag to "clear" the attributes:\nTo recursively remove extended attributes on all files in a directory, combine the -c "clear" flag with the -r recursive flag:Have a long path with spaces or special characters?Open Terminal.app and start typing xattr -rc, include a trailing space, and then then drag the file or folder to the Terminal.app window and it will automatically add the full path with proper escaping.Try using:This takes care of recursively removing the pesky attribute everywhere.Another recursive approach:
