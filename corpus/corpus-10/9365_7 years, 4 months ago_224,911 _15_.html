You can also Activate the so called Immediate Window by clicking View -> Immediate Window on the VBE toolbarDebug.Print outputs to the "Immediate" window.Also, you can simply type ? and then a statement directly into the immediate window (and then press Enter) and have the output appear right below, like this:This can be very handy to quickly output the property of an object...? myWidget.name...to set the property of an object...myWidget.name = "thingy"...or to even execute a function or line of code, while in debugging mode:Sheet1.MyFunction()
