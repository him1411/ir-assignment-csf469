I am new to Hibernate and am unclear of whether to use a SessionFactory or EntityManagerFactory to obtain the hibernate session.  What is the difference between the two?  Pros & Cons?Prefer EntityManagerFactory and EntityManager. They are defined by the JPA standard.SessionFactory and Session are hibernate-specific. The EntityManager invokes the hibernate session under the hood. And if you need some specific features that are not available in the EntityManager, you can obtain the session by calling:I want to add on this that you can also get Hibernate\'s session by calling getDelegate() method from EntityManager.ex:Using EntityManagerFactory approach  allows us to use callback method annotations like @PrePersist, @PostPersist,@PreUpdate with no extra configuration. Using similar callbacks while using SessionFactory will require extra efforts.Related Hibernate docs can be found here and here.Related SOF Question and Spring Forum discussionI prefer the JPA2 EntityManager API over SessionFactory, because it feels more modern. One simple example:JPA:SessionFactory:I think it\'s clear that the first one looks cleaner and is also easier to test because EntityManager can be easily mocked.By using EntityManager, code is no longer tightly coupled with hibernate. But for this, in usage we should use :instead of Similarly, for EntityManagerFactory, use javax interface. That way, the code is loosely coupled. If there is a better JPA 2 implementation than hibernate, switching would be easy. In extreme case, we could type cast to HibernateEntityManager.
