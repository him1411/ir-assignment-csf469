Is there a cleaner way to get the short version hash of HEAD from git?I want to see the same output as I get fromUPDATE: I originally used this to generate a version string, but this is even better:It will output strings like 0.1.12 (tagged commit) or 0.1.11-5-g0c85fbc (5 commits after the tag).The following works for me:The command git rev-parse can do a remarkable number of different things, so you\'d need to go through the documentation very carefully to spot that though :)You can do just about any format you want with --pretty=format:will also do it.will list the log entries with abbreviated SHA-1 checksum. A really simple way is to:Branch with short hash and last comment: A simple way to see the git commit short version and the git commit message is:Note that this is shorthand for git diff --full-index generated the diff with full hash
