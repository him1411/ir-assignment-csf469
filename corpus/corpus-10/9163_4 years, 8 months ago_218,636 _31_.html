I recently updated jQuery from 1.8 to 2.1. I suddenly discovered that the .live() stops working.\nI get the error TypeError: $(...).live is not a function.Is there any method I can use in place of .live()?That means if you are upgrading from version 1.8 and earlier, you will notice things breaking if you do not follow the migration guide below. You must not simply replace .live() with .on()!For quick/hot fixes on a live site, do not just replace the keyword live with on, as the parameters are different!should map to:The selector is very important! If you do not need to use this for any reason, set it to null.before:after, you move the child element (a) to the .on() selector:before:after, you move the element (.myButton) to the .on() selector, and find the nearest parent element (preferably with an ID):If you do not know what to put as the parent, body always works:You can avoid refactoring your code by including the following JavaScript code The jQuery API documentation lists live() as deprecated as of version 1.7 and removed as of version 1.9: link.version deprecated: 1.7, removed: 1.9Furthermore it states:As of jQuery 1.7, the .live() method is deprecated. Use .on() to attach event handlers. Users of older versions of jQuery should use .delegate() in preference to .live()Forward port of .live() for jQuery >= 1.9\n Avoids refactoring JS dependencies on .live()\n Uses optimized DOM selector context  .live was removed in 1.9, please see the upgrade guide: http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#live-removed.live() was deprecated and has now been removed from jQuery 1.9\nYou should use .on()A very simple fix that doesn\'t need to change your code, just add jquery migration script, download here\nhttps://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/It supplies jquery deprecated but needed functions like "live", "browser" etcI tend not to use the .on() syntax, if not necessary. For example you can migrate easier like this:old:new:Here is a list of valid event handlers: https://api.jquery.com/category/forms/From above onlyIf you do not know what to put as the parent, body always works:becomesIf you happen to be using the Ruby on Rails\' jQuery gem jquery-rails and for some reason you can\'t refactor your legacy code, the last version that still supports is 2.1.3 and you can lock it by using the following syntax on your Gemfile:then you can use the following command to update:I hope that help others facing a similar issue.
