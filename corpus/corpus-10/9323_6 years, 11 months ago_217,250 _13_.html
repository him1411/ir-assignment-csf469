I have lot of items on the screen and I need to use the scrollbar so the user can scroll down. However, the scroll is either not visible or it\'s not working. How is it possible to add a scrollbar to a LinearLayout?          Wrap the linear layout with a <ScrollView>See here for an example:Here is how I did it by trial and error.ScrollView - (the outer wrapper).Since Scrollview can have only one child, that child is a linear layout.  Then all the other layout types occur in the first linear layout.  I haven\'t tried to include a relative layout yet, but they drive me nuts so I will wait until my sanity returns.This can be done using the tag <ScrollView>. For ScrollView, one thing you have to remind that, ScrollView must have a single child.If you want your full layout to be scrollable then add <ScrollView> at the top. Check the example given below.But if you want some part of your layout to be scrollable then add <ScrollView> within that part. Check the example given below.You need to place ScrollView as the first child of Layout file and now put your linearlayout inside it. Now, android will decide on the basis of content and device size available whether to show a scrollable or not. Make sure linearlayout has no sibling because ScrollView can not have more than one child. While using Eclipse ADT:\nGraphical Layout -> Composite -> ScrollViewYou can add an atrribute in linearLayout : android:scrollbars="vertical"
