I was just reading this line:The first thing the format() method does is load a Velocity template from the classpath named output.vmAnd I couldn\'t figure out what was meant by classpath in this context.When programming in Java, you make other classes available to the class you are writing by putting something like this at the top of your source file:Or sometimes you \'bulk import\' stuff by saying:So later in your program when you say:The Java Virtual Machine will know where to find your compiled class.It would be impractical to have the VM look through every folder on your machine, so you have to provide the VM a list of places to look. This is done by putting folder and jar files on your classpath.Before we talk about how the classpath is set, let\'s talk about .class files, packages, and .jar files.First, let\'s suppose that MyClass is something you built as part of your project, and it is in a directory in your project called output. The .class file would be at output/org/javaguy/coolframework/MyClass.class (along with every other file in that package). In order to get to that file, your path would simply need to contain the folder \'output\', not the whole package structure, since your import statement provides all that information to the VM.Now let\'s suppose that you bundle CoolFramework up into a .jar file, and put that CoolFramework.jar into a lib directory in your project. You would now need to put lib/CoolFramework.jar into your classpath. The VM will look inside the jar file for the org/javaguy/coolframework part, and find your class.So, classpaths contain:How do you set your classpath?The first way everyone seems to learn is with environment variables. On a unix machine, you can say something like:On a Windows machine you have to go to your environment settings and either add or modify the value that is already there.The second way is to use the -cp parameter when starting Java, like this:A variant on this third way is often done with a .sh or .bat file that calculates the classpath and passes it to Java via the -cp parameter.So what\'s the best way to do it?Setting stuff globally via environment variables is bad, generally for the same kinds of reasons that global variables are bad. You change the CLASSPATH environment variable so one program works, and you end up breaking another program.The -cp is the way to go. I generally make sure my CLASSPATH environment variable is an empty string where I develop, whenever possible, so that I avoid global classpath issues (some tools aren\'t happy when the global classpath is empty though - I know of two common, mega-thousand dollar licensed J2EE and Java servers that have this kind of issue with their command-line tools).Think of it as Java\'s answer to the PATH environment variable - OSes search for EXEs on the PATH, Java searches for classes and packages on the classpath.Like the springsteen-esque question, too.The classpath is the path where the Java Virtual Machine look for user-defined classes, packages and resources in Java programs.In this context, the format() method load a template file from this path.The classpath in this context is exactly what it is in the general context: anywhere the VM knows it can find classes to be loaded, and resources as well (such as output.vm in your case).I\'d understand Velocity expects to find a file named output.vm anywhere in "no package". This can be a JAR, regular folder, ... The root of any of the locations in the application\'s classpath.Classpath is an environment variable of system. The setting of this variable is used to provide the root of any package hierarchy to java compiler.classpath and path are the evironment variables . usually , you have to put the jdk/bin to path so that u could use java compiler everywhere , classpath is the path of your .class files .  the classpath has a default path a period(.) which means the current directory. but when u used the packages . u would either specify the full path of the .class file or put the .class file path in the classpath which would save a lots of works ! CLASSPATH is an environment variable (i.e., global variables of the operating system available to all the processes) needed for the Java compiler and runtime to locate the Java packages used in a Java program. (Why not call PACKAGEPATH?) This is similar to another environment variable PATH, which is used by the CMD shell to find the executable programs.CLASSPATH can be set in one of the following ways:Setting the CLASSPATH System VariableTo display the current CLASSPATH variable, use these commands in Windows and UNIX (Bourne shell):\nIn Windows:   C:\\> set CLASSPATH\nIn UNIX:      % echo $CLASSPATHTo delete the current contents of the CLASSPATH variable, use these commands:\nIn Windows:   C:\\> set CLASSPATH=\nIn UNIX:      % unset CLASSPATH; export CLASSPATHTo set the CLASSPATH variable, use these commands (for example):\nIn Windows:   C:\\> set CLASSPATH=C:\\users\\george\\java\\classes\nIn UNIX:      % CLASSPATH=/home/george/java/classes; export CLASSPATH
