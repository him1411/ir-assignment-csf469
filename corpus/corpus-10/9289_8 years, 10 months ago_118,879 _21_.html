I\'m writing a Web application that needs to store JSON data in a small, fixed-size server-side cache via AJAX (think: Opensocial quotas). I do not have control over the server.I need to reduce the size of the stored data to stay within a server-side quota, and was hoping to be able to gzip the stringified JSON in the browser before sending it up to the server.However, I cannot find much in the way of JavaScript implementations of Gzip. Any suggestions for how I can compress the data on the client side before sending it up?Edit There appears to be a better LZW solution that handles Unicode strings correctly at http://pieroxy.net/blog/pages/lz-string/index.html (Thanks to pieroxy in the comments).I don\'t know of any gzip implementations, but the jsolait library (the site seems to have gone away) has functions for LZW compression/decompression. The code is covered under the LGPL.I had another problem, I did not want to encode data in gzip but to decode gzipped data. \nI am running javascript code outside of the browser so I need to decode it using pure javascript.It took me some time but i found that in the JSXGraph library there is a way to read gzipped data.Here is where I found the library: http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wp/2009/09/29/jsxcompressor-zlib-compressed-javascript-code/\nThere is even a standalone utility that can do that, JSXCompressor, and the code is LGPL licencied.Just include the jsxcompressor.js file in your project and then you will be able to read a base 64 encoded gzipped data:I understand it is not what you wanted but I still reply here because I suspect it will help some people.We just released pako https://github.com/nodeca/pako , port of zlib to javascript. I think that\'s now the fastest js implementation of deflate / inflate / gzip / ungzip. Also, it has democratic MIT licence. Pako supports all zlib options and it\'s results are binary equal.I ported an implementation of LZMA from a GWT module into standalone JavaScript.  It\'s called LZMA-JS.Here are some other compression algorithms implemented in Javascript:I did not test, but there\'s a javascript implementation of ZIP, called JSZip:http://jszip.stuartk.co.uk/https://stuk.github.io/jszip/I guess a generic client-side JavaScript compression implementation would be a very expensive operation in terms of processing time as opposed to transfer time of a few more HTTP packets with uncompressed payload.Have you done any testing that would give you an idea how much time there is to save? I mean, bandwidth savings can\'t be what you\'re after, or can it?You can use a 1 pixel per 1 pixel Java applet embedded in the page and use that for compression.It\'s not JavaScript and the clients will need a Java runtime but it will do what you need.Most browsers can decompress gzip on the fly. That might be a better option than a javascript implementation.
