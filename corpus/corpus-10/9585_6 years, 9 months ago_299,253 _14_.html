What is the best way to set the href attribute of the <a> tag at run time using jQuery?Also, how do you get the value of the href attribute of the <a> tag using jQuery?To get or set an attribute of an HTML element, you can use the element.attr() function in jQuery.To get the href attribute, use the following code:To set the href attribute, use the following code:In both cases, please use the appropriate selector. If you have set the class for the anchor element, use \'.class-name\' and if you have set the id for the anchor element, use \'#element-id\'.Set the href attribute withand read it usingWhere "selector" is any valid jQuery selector for your <a> element (".myClass" or "#myId" to name the most simple ones).Hope this helps !In jQuery 1.6+ it\'s better to use: $(selector).prop(\'href\',"http://www...") to set the value, and$(selector).prop(\'href\') to get the valueIn short, .prop gets and sets values on the DOM object, and .attr gets and sets values in the HTML. This makes .prop a little faster and possibly more reliable in some contexts.
