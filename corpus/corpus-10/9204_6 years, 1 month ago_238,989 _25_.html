Assuming that arraylist is defined as ArrayList<String> arraylist, is arraylist.removeAll(arraylist) equivalent to arraylist.clear()?If so, can I assume that the clear() method is more efficient for emptying the array list?Are there any caveats in using arraylist.removeAll(arraylist) instead of arraylist.clear()?The source code for clear():The source code for removeAll()(As defined in AbstractCollection):clear() is much faster since it doesn\'t have to deal with all those extra method calls.And as Atrey points out, c.contains(..) increases the time complexity of removeAll to O(n^2) as opposed to clear\'s O(n).The time complexity of ArrayList.clear() is O(n) and of removeAll is O(n^2).So yes, ArrayList.clear is much faster.Unless there is a specific optimization that checks if the argument passed to removeAll() is the collection itself (and I highly doubt that such an optimization is there) it will be significantly slower than a simple .clear().Apart from that (and at least equally important): arraylist.removeAll(arraylist) is just obtuse, confusing code. It is a very backwards way of saying "clear this collection". What advantage would it have over the very understandable arraylist.clear()?The clear() method removes all the elements of a single ArrayList. It\'s a fast operation, as it just sets some array elements to null.The removeAll(Collection) method, which is inherited from AbstractCollection, removes all the elements that are in the argument collection from the collection you call the method on. It\'s a relatively slow operation, as it has to search through one of the collections involved.They serve two different purposes. clear() just clears an instance of the class, removeAll() removes all the given objects and returns the state of the operation.clear() will go through the underlying Array and set each entry to null;removeAll(collection) will go through the ArrayList checking for collection and remove(Object) it if it exists. I would imagine that clear() is way faster then removeAll because it\'s not comparing, etc.clear() will be much more efficient. It will simply remove each and every item. Using removeAll(arraylist) will take a lot more work because it will check every item in arraylist to see if it exists in arraylist before removing it.Clear is faster because it does not loop over elements to delete. This method can assume that ALL elements can be deleted.Remove all does not necessarily mean delete all elements in the list, only those provided as parameters SHOULD be delete. Hence, more effort is required to keep those which should not be deleted.CLARIFICATIONBy \'loop\', I mean it does not have to check whether the element should be kept or not. It can set the reference to null without searching through the provided lists of elements to delete.Clear IS faster than deleteall.Array => once the space is allocated for an Array variable at the run time, the allocated space can not be extended or removed.ArrayList => This is not the case in arraylist. ArrayList can grow and shrink at the run time.\n             The allocated space can be minimized or maximized at the run time.
