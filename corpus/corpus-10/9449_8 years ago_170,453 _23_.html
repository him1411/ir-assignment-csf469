I accidentally installed the PowerPC version of MySQL on my Intel Mac in Snow Leopard, and it installed without a problem but of course doesn\'t run properly. I just didn\'t pay enough attention. Now when I try to install the correct x86 version it says that it can\'t install because a newer version is already installed. A Google query led me to perform these actions/delete these files to uninstall it:And finally removed the line MYSQLCOM=-YES- from /etc/hostconfigThey haven\'t seemed to help at all. I am still receiving the same message about there being a newer version. I tried installing an even newer version (the current Beta) and it also gave me the same message about a newer version already being installed. I can\'t uninstall it from the Prefs Pane because I never installed the PrefPane also.Try running alsoI also had entries in:that i had to delete.If you installed mysql through brew then we can use command to uninstall mysql.This worked for me.Aside from the long list of remove commands in your question, which seems quite comprehensive in my recent experience of exactly this issue, I found mysql.sock running in /private/var and removed that.  I used find / -name mysql -print 2> /dev/null...to find anything that looked like a mysql directory or file and removed most of what came up (aside from Perl/Python access modules).  You may also need to check that the daemon is not still running using Activity Monitor (or at the command line using ps -A).  I found that mysqld was still running even after deleting the files.I also had a config file at /etc/my.cnf that I needed to delete on my Mac OS X Snow Leopard install*stop and kill any MySQL processesedit /etc/hostconfig and remove the line MYSQLCOM=-YES-*restart your computer just to ensure any MySQL processes are killed\ntry to run mysql, it shouldn\'t workYou need to identify where MySQL was installed to before attempting to delete it. I always use the Hivelogic guide to installing under Mac OS X which builds MySQL from source. When setting up the build you can specify a directory under which to install MySQL with the --prefix parameter. You should make sure the directory does not exist and attempt to install from source.It might be overkill but your MySQL command history can also be wiped from:You should also check /var/db/receipts and remove all entries that contain com.mysql.*Using sudo rm -rf /var/db/receipts/com.mysql.* didn\'t work for me. I had to go into var/db/receipts and delete each one seperately.For me, I had installed MariaDB years ago using homebrew. Correct uninstall procedure was:\nbrew uninstall mariadb.sudo find / | grep -i mysqlThis worked like a charm for me. Just went through the list and ensured that anything MySQL related was deleted.
