I built a docker image from a dockerfile. I see the image was built successfully, but what do I do with it? Shouldn\'t it be able to run as a container?New to docker so probably a misunderstanding on my end, any help would be great. The specific way to run it depends on whether you gave the image a tag/name or not.With a name (let\'s use ubuntu):Without a name, just using the ID:Please see https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/ for more information.Do following steps :$ docker imagesyou will get list of all local docker images with tags specified.$ docker run image_name:tag_nameIf you didn\'t specify tag_name it will automatically run image with \'latest\'       tag.Instead of image_name you can also specify Image Id (no tag_name).Here is an example to run a webdev service in docker.\nThe image\'s name is morrisjobke/webdav. You can pull it from dockerhub.After you run this images,you can then access the WebDAV instance at http://localhost:8888/webdav. Internally the folder /var/webdav is used as WebDAV root.You can run this container in following way:\n\n$ docker run -d -e USERNAME=test -e PASSWORD=test -p 8888:80 morrisjobke/webdav\n
