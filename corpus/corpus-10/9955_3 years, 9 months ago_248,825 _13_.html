I need to write a script that starts my program with different arguments, but I\'m new to Bash. I start my program like this:./MyProgram.exe Data/data1.txt [Logs/data1_Log.txt].Here is the pseudocode for what i want to do:So I\'m really puzzled how to create second argument from the first one, so it looks like dataABCD_Log1.txt and start my program. Help is very much appreciated.P.S. I know there are simililar questions out there, but I found nothing on creating my logfile name.A couple of notes first: when you use Data/data1.txt as an argument, should it really be /Data/data1.txt (with a leading slash)? Also, should the outer loop scan only for .txt files, or all files in /Data? Here\'s an answer, assuming /Data/data1.txt and .txt files only:Notes:If you needed to run MyProgram with Data/file.txt instead of /Data/file.txt, use "${filename#/}" to remove the leading slash. On the other hand, if it\'s really Data not /Data you want to scan, just use for filename in Data/*.txt.The name=${file##*/} substitution (shell parameter expansion) removes the leading pathname up to the last /.The base=${name%.txt} substitution removes the trailing .txt.  It\'s a bit trickier if the extensions can vary.Sorry for necromancing the thread, but whenever you iterate over files by globbing, it\'s good practice to avoid the corner case where the glob does not match (which makes the loop variable expand to the (un-matching) glob pattern string itself).For example: Reference: Bash Pitfalls
