I have a start_date and end_date. I want to get the list of dates in between these two dates. Can anyone help me pointing the mistake in my query.Here Date is a datetime variable.you should put those two dates between single quotes like..or can useSince a datetime without a specified time segment will have a value of date 00:00:00.000, if you want to be sure you get all the dates in your range, you must either supply the time for your ending date or increase your ending date and use <.OROR DO NOT use the following, as it could return some records from 2011/02/28 if their times are 00:00:00.000.Try this:The date values need to be typed as strings.To ensure future-proofing your query for SQL Server 2008 and higher, Date should be escaped because it\'s a reserved word in later versions.Bear in mind that the dates without times take midnight as their defaults, so you may not have the correct value there.Here, first add a day to the current endDate, it will be 2011-02-28 00:00:00, then you subtract one second to make the end date 2011-02-27 23:59:59. By doing this, you can get all the dates between the given intervals.This query stands good for fetching the values between current date and its next 3 datesThis will eventually add extra 3 days of buffer to the current date.-- if data type is differentThis is very old, but given a lot of experiences I have had with dates, you might want to consider this: People use different regional settings, as such, some people (and some databases/computers, depending on regional settings) may read this date 11/12/2016 as 11th Dec 2016 or Nov 12, 2016. Even more, 16/11/12 supplied to MySQL database will be internally converted to 12 Nov 2016, while Access database running on a UK regional setting computer will interpret and store it as 16th Nov 2012.Therefore, I made it my policy to be explicit whenever I am going to interact with dates and databases. So I always supply my queries and programming codes as follows:Note also that Access will accept the #, thus:but MS SQL server will not, so I always use " \' " as above, which both databases accept.And when getting that date from a variable in code, I always convert the result to string as follows:I am writing this because I know sometimes some programmers may not be keen enough to detect the inherent conversion. There will be no error for dates < 13, just different results!As for the question asked, add one day to the last date and make the comparison as follows:Try putting the dates between # #\nfor example:It worked for me.best query for the select date between current date and back three days:best query for the select date between current date and next three days:if its date in 24 hours and start in morning and end in the night should add something like : Check below Examples: Both working and Non-Working.ORORAND below is not working:I like to use the syntax \'1 MonthName 2015\' for dates ex:for datesI would go forThe logic being that >= includes the whole start date and < excludes the end date, so we add one unit to the end date. This can adapted for months, for instance:You ca try this SQLit\'s better write this way:
