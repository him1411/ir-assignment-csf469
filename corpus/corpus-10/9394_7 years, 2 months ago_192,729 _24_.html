I\'m trying to dynamically create TableRow objects and add them to a TableLayout.\nThe TableRow objects has 2 items, a TextView and a CheckBox. The TextView items need to have their layout weight set to 1 to push the CheckBox items to the far right.I can\'t find documentation on how to programmatically set the layout weight of a TextView item.You have to use TableLayout.LayoutParams with something like this:The last parameter is the weight.The answer is that you have to use TableRow.LayoutParams, not LinearLayout.LayoutParams or any other LayoutParams.The different LayoutParams are not interchangeable and if you use the wrong one then nothing seems to happen.  The text view\'s parent is a table row, hence:http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TableRow.LayoutParams.htmlIn the earlier answers weight is passed to the constructor of a new SomeLayoutType.LayoutParams object.\nStill in many cases it\'s more convenient to use existing objects - it helps to avoid dealing with parameters we are not interested in.An example:just set layout params in that layout like create param variable1f is weight variableset your widget or layout like (OR)1f is refered as weight=1; according to your need you can give 2f or 3f, views will move accoding to the space. For making specified distance between views in Linear layout use weightsum for "LinearLayout".1f is denotes as weight=1; you can give 2f or 3f, views will move accoding to the spaceYou can also give weight separately like this  ,This work for me, and I hope it will work for you also Set the LayoutParams for the parent view first:then set for the TextView (child):This  should works to youThere is another way to do this. In case you need to set only one parameter, for example \'height\':I had a fair amount of difficulty with a solution something very similar to this: trying to have two buttons in a TableRow, with each being half the screen width.  For whatever reason, the left button would always be about 70% of the width, and the right button 30%.  Calling table_layout.setStretchAllColumns(true) had no effect, nor did setting the button\'s width to half the screen, nor setting their layout weight.  The solution I ended up with was nesting a LinearLayout in the TableRows, which did take into account the value of the buttons\' width.
