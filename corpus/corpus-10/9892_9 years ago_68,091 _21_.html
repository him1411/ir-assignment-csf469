I search for "nurple" in a file.  I found it, great.  But now, every occurrence of "nurple" is rendered in sick black on yellow.  Forever.Forever, that is, until I search for something I know won\'t be found, such as "asdhfalsdflajdflakjdf" simply so it clears the previous search highlighting.Can\'t I just hit a magic key to kill the highlights when I\'m done searching?Just put this in your .vimrc:noh (short for nohighlight) will do the trick./lkjasdf has always been faster than :noh for me.Then I prefer this:And why? Because it toggles the switch: if highlight is on, then pressing F12 turns it off. And vica versa. HTH.Append the following line to the end of your .vimrc to prevent highlighting altogether:I found it just under :help #, which I keep hitting all the time, and which highlights all the words on the current page like the current one.I search so often that I\'ve found it useful to map the underscore key to remove the search highlight:I think the best answer is to have a leader shortcut:Now whenever you have your document all junked up with highlighted terms, you just hit ,c (I have my leader mapped to comma). Works perfectly.I have this in my .vimrc:This way, ; will toggle search highlighting.  Normally, the ; key repeats the latest t/T/f/F command, but I never really used that functionality.  I find this setting much more useful, because I can change search highlighting on and off very quickly, and easily get a sense of where my search results are, at a glance.I think this answer in "Vim clear last search highlighting" is better:There is hlsearch and nohlsearch.  :help hlsearch will provide more information.If you want to bind F12 to toggle it on/off you can use this:I add the following mapping to my ~/.vimrcAnd in ESC mode, I press e/Also, if you want to have a toogle and be sure that the highlight will be reactivate for the next time you search something, you can use this
