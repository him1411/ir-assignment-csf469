What\'s the difference between:andThe difference is that const char * is a pointer to a const char, while char * const is a constant pointer to a char. The first, the value being pointed to can\'t be changed but the pointer can be. The second, the value being pointed at can change but the pointer can\'t (similar to a reference).There is also awhich is a constant pointer to a constant char (so nothing about it can be changed).Note:The following two forms are equivalent:andThe exact reason for this is described in the C++ standard, but it\'s important to note and avoid the confusion. I know several coding standards that prefer:over(with or without pointer) so that the placement of the const element is the same as with a pointer const.To avoid confusion, always append the const qualifier.const always modifies the thing that comes before it (to the left of it), EXCEPT when it\'s the first thing in a type declaration, where it modifies the thing that comes after it (to the right of it).So these two are the same:they define pointers to a const int.  You can change where i1 and i2 points, but you can\'t change the value they point at.This:defines a const pointer to an integer and initializes it to point at memory location 12345678.  You can change the int value at address 12345678, but you can\'t change the address that i3 points to.const * char is invalid C code and is meaningless.  Perhaps you meant to ask the difference between a const char * and a char const *, or possibly the difference between a const char * and a char * const?  const char* is a pointer to a constant character\nchar* const is a constant pointer to a character\nconst char* const is a constant pointer to a constant character1) const char* x Here X is basically a character pointer which is pointing to a constant value2) char* const x is refer to character pointer which is constant, but the location it is pointing can be change.3) const char* const x is combination to 1 and 2, means it is a constant character pointer which is pointing to constant value.4) const *char x will cause a compiler error. it can not be declared.5)  char const * x is equal to point 1. the rule of thumb is if const is with  var name then the pointer will be constant but the pointing location can be changed , else pointer will point to a constant location and pointer can point to another location but the pointing location content can not be change.  First one is a syntax error. Maybe you meant the difference betweenandIn that case, the first one is a pointer to data that can\'t change, and the second one is a pointer that will always point to the same address.Another thumb rule is to check where const is: Rule of thumb: read the definition from right to left!Means "foo points (*) to an int that cannot change (const)".\nTo the programmer this means "I will not change the value of what foo points to".Means "foo cannot change (const) and points (*) to an int".\nTo the programmer this means "I will not change the memory address that foo refers to".Means "foo cannot change (const) and points (*) to an int that cannot change (const)".\nTo the programmer this means "I will not change the value of what foo points to, nor will I change the address that foo refers to".I presume you mean const char * and char * const .The first, const char *, is a pointer to a constant character.  The pointer itself is mutable.The second, char * const is a constant pointer to a character.  The pointer cannot change, the character it points to can.And then there is const char * const where the pointer and character cannot change.Here is a detailed explanation with codeSyntax:char *const comes under this case.Syntax: const datatype *varor datatype const *varconst char* comes under this case.char * const and const char *?const char * p;             // value cannot be changedchar * const p;             // address cannot be changedconst char * const p;       // both cannot be changed.The const modifier is applied to the term immediately to its left. The only exception to this is when there is nothing to its left, then it applies to what is immediately on its right.These are all equivalent ways of saying "constant pointer to a constant char":Two rulese.g.Lots of answer provide specific techniques, rule of thumbs etc to understand this particular instance of variable declaration. But there is a generic technique of understand any declaration:Clockwise/Spiral RuleA)As per the clockwise/spiral rule a is pointer to character that is constant. Which means character is constant but the pointer can change. i.e. a = "other string"; is fine but a[2] = \'c\'; will fail to compileB)As per the rule, a is const pointer to a character. i.e. You can do a[2] = \'c\'; but you cannot do a = "other string";
