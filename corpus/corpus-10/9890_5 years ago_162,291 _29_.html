On the settings page, I want to include three links to I\'ve searched this site and the web and my documentation and I\'ve found nothing that is obvious.NOTE: I don\'t want to open web pages within my app, I just want to send the link to Safari and that link be open there.

Because some times (majority in simulator) i found it causes crashes.Objective-CSwift 2.0Take a look at the -openURL: method on UIApplication. It should allow you to pass an NSURL instance to the system, which will determine what app to open it in and launch that application. (Keep in mind you\'ll probably want to check -canOpenURL: first, just in case the URL can\'t be handled by apps currently installed on the system - though this is likely not a problem for plain http:// links.)And, in case you\'re not sure if the supplied URL text has a scheme:The non deprecated Objective-C version would be:Swift 3.0This supports devices running older versions of iOS as wellIn SWIFT 3.0openURL(:) was deprecated in iOS 10.0, instead you should use the following instance method on UIApplication: open(:options:completionHandler:)Example using Swift\nThis will open "https://apple.com" in Safari.https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiapplication/1648685-openTry this:In Swift 1.2\xef\xbc\x8c try this:Swift 3\nSolution with a Done buttonDon\'t forget to import SafariServices
