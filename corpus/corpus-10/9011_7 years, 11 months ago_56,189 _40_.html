Help, I can\'t function without Resharper. All of a sudden my Alt+Enter \xe2\x86\xb5 shortcut (to bring up the action list) has stopped working. Anybody experienced this or know how to fix?Symptom A: the menu pops up for a split second, then goes away.  Fix using the following steps in numerical order.Symptom B: pressing Alt+Enter \xe2\x86\xb5 does nothing.  Fix using Step #2 first then try Step #1 if the issue persists.Perform a Visual Studio reset:Re-apply Visual Studio keyboard scheme:You can try going ReSharper -> Options > IntelliSense > General and switching the radio buttons and clicking OK. Then switching back to the previously selected radiobutton.EditHere is how to change/assign keyshort cuts in Visual Studio/Resharper from JetBrains Knowledge BaseThe command you are looking for is called "ReSharper_QuickFix". In version 8, this is called "Resharper_AltEnter".I had to do this:To get your Alt+Enter \xe2\x86\xb5 combination working you should set "ReSharper_AltEnter" action (formerly "ReSharper_QuickFix(Text Editor)") for Alt+Enter \xe2\x86\xb5 in Tools->Options->Environment->Keyboard. Press Alt+Enter \xe2\x86\xb5 in "Press shortcuts here:" field and expand "Shortcuts currently used by:" drop list. It is not necessary for action to be selected, it just should be there. If it is not - go to Resharper->Options->Environment->Keyboard & Menus and apply "ReSharper 2.x or Intellij IDEA" scheme.   After that, ReSharper acions will work for Alt+Enter \xe2\x86\xb5 even when you\'ll apply "Visual Studio" or "None" keyboard scheme. To be exact, for "Visual Studio" schema selecting window will be shown and for "None" ReSharper action will be executed by default. Hereby, "ReSharper_AltEnter" for Alt+Enter \xe2\x86\xb5 is the key moment to get your ReSharper actions working!Thanks Josh ... your suggestion worked for me. The steps I took on VS 2010 were:ReSharper -> Options -> Environment -> Visual Studio Integration ->\n  Keyboard Shortcuts (Visual Studio) -> Apply Scheme (button)I had to do this:Go to Visual Studio -> Tools -> Options -> Environment -> Keyboard Press ResetGo to ReSharper -> Options... -> Environment -> Keyboard & Menus Select the ReSharper keyboard scheme Finally, select Visual Studio, click on Apply Scheme and then Save.. and it worked!I have encounter the same problem. you might be able to fix it by going into the ReSharper > Options > Environment > Keyboard & Menus > check ReSharper\n  2.x or IntelliJ IDEA -> ApplyThis will reset the shortcut keys for ReSharper.I\'ve also found that Kwex solution works but sometimes it doesn\'t put all of the shortcuts back.I found this strange solutionhttp://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RSRP-287309i found an ad-hoc solution which seems to do the trick for now (not\n  sure if this is universal, but it worked here. Twice):Kind of a hack perhaps, but the keyboard shortcuts seem to work.solution helped fix the rest (especially Control + B - go to\n  definition)The only thing to be done is to set the keyboard shortcut under Options > Environment > Keyboard. You add ReSharper_QuickFix to your search and enter the shortcut keys under Press shortcut keys: textbox and click Assign and OK. Done, You don\'t have to reset anything.I had the same when I upgraded Vista -> Win 7. I my case, I had set my keyboard to \'United States-international\'. Pressing the  +  will actually give you  +  + . Solution: set keyboard to \'US\'.if any of the other solution does not works try Deleting the %APPDATA%\\JetBrains\\ReSharper folder. This will restores ReSharper to working condition in VS2012 as well as VS2013. In my case the Right-Alt "compose" key was preventing windows from seeing that it was being pressed, so it just saw "enter". Removing the compose key fixed it for me..As an additional reason for why Alt+Enter \xe2\x86\xb5 would not work if analysis is turned off on the file. If you look in the upper right of the of the code editing window just to the right of the scroll bar and there is a pause icon instead of the warning, or OK symbols R# will not give you any menu on Alt+Enter \xe2\x86\xb5.If this is disabled you can enable it from the R# options menu under Code Inspection >  Settings and make sure that Enable code analysis is checked.This happened to me after upgrading ReSharper to version 8.0.14.856 from some v8 EAP.  I use the IntelliJ shortcuts.  My Alt+Enter \xe2\x86\xb5 stopped working.  To get it back I used the I picked the Visual Studio radio button, then Apply Scheme button, then selected the Resharper 2x or IntelliJ IDEA radio button, then another Apply Scheme.  My Alt+Enter \xe2\x86\xb5 started working again.I write this because the issue came in the newest version of the tool, and the comments by Bart and Josh, while still substantively still correct, refer to menu items that moved a little since they wrote.
