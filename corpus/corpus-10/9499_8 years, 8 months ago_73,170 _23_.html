What\'s an easy way to read random line from a file in Unix command line?You can use shuf:There is also a utility called rl. In Debian it\'s in the randomize-lines package that does exactly what you want, though not available in all distros.  On its home page it actually recommends the use of shuf instead (which didn\'t exist when it was created, I believe).  shuf is part of the GNU coreutils, rl is not.Another alternative:(I like the shuf approach above even better though - I didn\'t even know that existed and I would have never found that tool on my own)perlfaq5: How do I select a random line from a file? Here\'s a reservoir-sampling algorithm from the Camel Book:This has a significant advantage in space over reading the whole file in. You can find a proof of this method in The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 2, Section 3.4.2, by Donald E. Knuth.using a bash script:This is simple. Granted this is just a tad slower than the "shuf -n 1 file.txt" on it\'s own.Single bash line:Slight problem: duplicate filename.Here\'s a simple Python script that will do the job:Usage:Another way using \'awk\'A solution that also works on MacOSX, and should also works on Linux(?):Where:N is the number of random lines you wantNR==FNR {lineN[$1]; next}(FNR in lineN) file1 file2\n--> save line numbers written in file1 and then print corresponding line in file2Using only vanilla sed and awk, and without using $RANDOM, a simple, space-efficient and reasonably fast "one-liner" for selecting a single line pseudo-randomly from a file named FILENAME is as follows:(This works even if FILENAME is empty, in which case no line is emitted.)Here is what I discovery since my Mac OS doesn\'t use all the easy answers. I used the jot command to generate a number since the $RANDOM variable solutions seems not to be very random in my test.  When testing my solution I had a wide variance in the solutions provided in the output.The echo of the variable is to get a visual of the generated random number.
