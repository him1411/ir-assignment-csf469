I\'d like to modify the path to my application, but doing so breaks it because the service still points to the old location. By going to Administrative Tools > Services you can open a properties dialog and view the Path to executable, but there is no way to change it. Is there any way a user can modify the service path without having to reinstall the application ?It involves editing the registry, but service information can be found in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services.  Find the service you want to redirect, locate the ImagePath subkey and change that value.There is also this approach seen on SuperUser which uses the sc command line instead of modifying the registry:Note: the space after binPath= is important. You can also query the current configuration using:This displays output similar to:[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESSSERVICE_NAME: ServiceNameYou could also do it with PowerShell:Or:You can delete the service:Then recreate the service.
