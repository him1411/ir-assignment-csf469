I know that PHP is compiled to byte code before it is run on the server, and then that byte code can be cached so that the whole script doesn\'t have to be re-interpreted with every web access.But can you "compile" php and upload a binary-ish file, which will just be run by the byte code interpreter?After this question was asked, Facebook launched HipHop for PHP which is probably the best-tested PHP compiler to date (seeing as it ran one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s 10 biggest websites). However, Facebook discontinued it in favour of HHVM, which is a virtual machine, not a compiler.Beyond that, googling PHP compiler turns up a number of 3rd party solutions.PhalangerphcRoadsend PHP CompilerbcompilerProject ZeroBambalamBinaryPHPThe short answer is "no".The current implementation of PHP is that of an interpreted language.  You can argue the theoretical aspects of the fact that any language can technically be interpreted or compiled, but as it stands, the current implementations are such that PHP code requires an interpreter to run, and the interpreter manages the executing environment.To answer your question about uploading pre-compiled PHP bytecode, it\'s probably possible, but you\'d have to implement a way for the PHP interpreter to read in such a file and work with it.  With existing opcode caches out there already, it doesn\'t seem like a task that would reap much reward.Since the question was first asked, there has been a change to that answer from a flat out "no" to a "kind of"http://github.com/facebook/hiphop-php/wikiHip Hop for PHP was a compiler that took PHP code and turned it into highly optimized C++\nApparently, some functions are not supported (for example \'explode\')I found this question while looking for more information on how to implement HipHop and thought I\'d speak up :)Since 2013 Facebook no longer use it, however, and it has been discontinued in favour of HHVM, which is not a compiler: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HipHop_for_PHPThere is alsowhich aimsThe extension is available from PECL.phc allows you to compile PHP programs into shared libraries, which can be uploaded to the server. The PHP program is compiled into binaries. It\'s done in such a way as to support evals, includes, and the entire PHP standard library.If you are simply looking for producing a binary executable from a PHP script, then please avoid trying to make your question extremely precise because it will make it appear that you know exactly what you need. Besides, most PHP developer have absolutely zero clue about what a bytecode is.With that said, the answers is YES. I have just finished compiling a PHP script into a binary. And not just any binary. I have used the CDE application (link to Wayback Machine, the original link is now broken) to turn it into an portable binary that can be distributed with all the dependencies and executed without any issue\xe2\x80\xa6 and it works beautifully.All you need is to use phc.Um, anybody heard of Zend Guard, which does exactly what this person is asking.  It encodes/obfuscates PHP code into "machine code".There are several "compilers" of PHP code. Most of them do not support all of PHP features, since these simply must be interpreted during run time.We are using Phalanger - http://www.php-compiler.net/ - that is supporting even those dirty PHP dynamic features, and still is able to compile them as .NET assembly, that can be distributed as a standalone DLL.see 5.5.x with the integrated OPcache module, volatile in a shared memory, much more performance and the dynamism principle of php remain untouched.http://www.php.net/manual/en/opcache.installation.phpPHP doesn\'t really get compiled as with many programs.  You can use Zend\'s encoder to make it unreadable though.In php 7 there is the php ini option opcache.file_cache that saves the bytecode in a specific folder. In could be useful to in php cli script that are "compiled" and saved in a specific folder for a optimized reuse.Opcache it is not compiling but is something similar.
