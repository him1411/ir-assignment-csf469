Is there a way to configure TortoiseHg to store my password?I have a project hosted on Google Code that I access using TortoiseHg. Whenever I want to push changes to Google Code TortoiseHg prompts me for a username and password. Google Code requires me to use an auto-generated password, and it gets quite repetitive to look it up every time.Security warningAlthough this answer is accepted as of 2017-09-15, it is not a recommended solution. You should never store your passwords in plain text. Use the mercurial_keyring extension instead. See another answer here.You can change your push URL to https://username:password@hostname.com/repo.This is explained in Google Code\'s and Mercurial\'s FAQs.EDIT: Mercurial FAQ explains another way to do it:As far as I understand, both answers suggest storing your username and password unencrypted in plain-text, which is a bit of a no-no.You should use the Keyring extension instead, as it has been specifically designed for securely saving authentication passwords. It already comes bundled with TortoiseHg, so all you have to do is activate it by writing the following in your mercurial.ini file:You will also have to associate your username with the push url by editing your repository-specific .hg\\hgrc file like in the example below:For more details on associating your username with the url, see the Repository Configuration (SMTP) section of the Keyring extension page.Three steps, watch screenshot.\nNote: This stores your password in plaintext.If you want to configure it via TortoiseHg, Repository Setting dialog is available.\nAfter opening the dialog, please switch to \'Sync\' tab.\nYou can add a path with HTTPS auth information.http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.io/manual/2.9/settings.html#module-web.settingsSimply modify the hgrc file in the .hg directory of your local repository so it looks like this:where name is your Google Code login without the gmail/googlemail bit e.g. \'fredb\' (not fredb@gmail.com), password is the Google-generated password, and yourproj is the name of your GC project. So something like:This works for me using SSH. I know the password it\'s in text plain, but this is not a problem in this project.\nYou have to change myUser and MyOPas for your credentials and the path to: TortoisePlink.exe.\nEdit the mercurial.ini
