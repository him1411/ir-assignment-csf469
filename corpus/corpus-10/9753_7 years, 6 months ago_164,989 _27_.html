I know how to create a histogram (just use "with boxes") in gnuplot if my .dat file already has properly binned data. Is there a way to take a list of numbers and have gnuplot provide a histogram based on ranges and bin sizes the user provides?yes, and its quick and simple though very hidden:check out help smooth freq to see why the above makes a histogramto deal with ranges just set the xrange variable.I have a couple corrections/additions to Born2Smile\'s very useful answer:Be very careful: all of the answers on this page are implicitly taking the decision of where the binning starts - the left-hand edge of the left-most bin, if you like - out of the user\'s hands. If the user is combining any of these functions for binning data with his/her own decision about where binning starts (as is done on the blog which is linked to above) the functions above are all incorrect. With an arbitrary starting point for binning \'Min\', the correct function is:You can see why this is correct sequentially (it helps to draw a few bins and a point somewhere in one of them). Subtract Min from your data point to see how far into the binning range it is. Then divide by binwidth so that you\'re effectively working in units of \'bins\'. Then \'floor\' the result to go to the left-hand edge of that bin, add 0.5 to go to the middle of the bin, multiply by the width so that you\'re no longer working in units of bins but in an absolute scale again, then finally add back on the Min offset you subtracted at the start.Consider this function in action:e.g. the value 1.1 truly falls in the left bin:Born2Smile\'s answer is only correct if the bin boundaries occur at (n+0.5)*binwidth (where n runs over integers). mas90\'s answer is only correct if the bin boundaries occur at n*binwidth.Do you want to plot a graph like this one?\n\nyes? Then you can have a look at my blog article: http://gnuplot-surprising.blogspot.com/2011/09/statistic-analysis-and-histogram.htmlKey lines from the code:I have found this discussion extremely useful, but I have experienced some "rounding off" problems.More precisely, using a binwidth of 0.05, I have noticed that, with the techniques presented here above, data points which read 0.1 and 0.15 fall in the same bin. This (obviously unwanted behaviour) is most likely due to the "floor" function.Hereafter is my small contribution to try to circumvent this.This recursive method is for x >=0; one could generalise this with more conditional statements to obtain something even more general.As usual, Gnuplot is a fantastic tool for plotting sweet looking graphs and it can be made to perform all sorts of calculations.  However, it is intended to plot data rather than to serve as a calculator and it is often easier to use an external programme (e.g. Octave) to do the more "complicated" calculations, save this data in a file, then use Gnuplot to produce the graph.  For the above problem, check out the "hist" function is Octave using [freq,bins]=hist(data), then plot this in Gnuplot using We do not need to use recursive method, it may be slow. My solution is using a user-defined function rint instesd of instrinsic function int or floor. This function will give rint(0.0003/0.0001)=3, while int(0.0003/0.0001)=floor(0.0003/0.0001)=2.Why? Please look at Perl int function and padding zerosI have a little modification to Born2Smile\'s solution. I know that doesn\'t make much sense, but you may want it just in case. If your data is integer and you need a float bin size (maybe for comparison with another set of data, or plot density in finer grid), you will need to add a random number between 0 and 1 inside floor. Otherwise, there will be spikes due to round up error. floor(x/width+0.5) will not do because it will create pattern that\'s not true to original data.With respect to binning functions, I didn\'t expect the result of the functions offered so far. Namely, if my binwidth is 0.001, these functions were centering the bins on 0.0005 points, whereas I feel it\'s more intuitive to have the bins centered on 0.001 boundaries.In other words, I\'d like to haveThe binning function I came up with isHere\'s a script to compare some of the offered bin functions to this one:and here\'s the output
