I want to URL encode this:Do I have to download a module for this? I already have the request module.You can use JavaScript\'s encodeURIComponent:The built-in module querystring is what you\'re looking for:Use the escape function of querystring. It generates a URL safe string.Note that URI encoding is good for the query part, it\'s not good for the domain. The domain gets encoded using punycode. You need a library like URI.js to convert between a URI and IRI (Internationalized Resource Identifier).This is correct if you plan on using the string later as a query string:If you don\'t want ASCII characters like /, : and ? to be escaped, use encodeURI instead:However, for other use-cases, you might need uri-js instead:The solutions above work, but do not encode queries containing characters " or \' .
