I know I can issue an alter table individually to change the table storage from MyISAM to InooDB.I am wondering if there is a way to quickly change all of them to InnoDB?Run this SQL statement (in the MySQL client, phpMyAdmin, or wherever) to retrieve all the MyISAM tables in your database.Replace value of the name_of_your_db variable with your database name.Then, copy the output and run as a new SQL query.Works like a charm.This will give you list of all tables with the alter queries that you can run in a batchIn the scripts below, replace <username>, <password> and <schema> with your specific data.To show the statements that you can copy-paste into a mysql client session type the following:To simply execute the change, use this:CREDIT: This is a variation of what was outlined in this article.Use this as a sql query in your phpMyAdminOne line:You can execute this statement in the mysql command line tool:You may need to specify username and password using: mysql -u username -p\nThe result is an sql script that you can pipe back into mysql:Replace "name-of-database" in the above statement and command line.Here is a way to do it for Django users:Add that to your app under the folders management/commands/ Then you can convert all your tables with a manage.py command:It\'s Very simple there are only TWO step just copy and paste :step 1.(copy and paste all result in in sql tab)step 2:\n(copy all result in in sql tab)\nand paste below in the lineSTART TRANSACTION;COMMIT;eg.\nSTART TRANSACTION;ALTER TABLE admin_files ENGINE=InnoDB;COMMIT;It hasn\'t been mentioned yet, so I\'ll write it for posterity:If you\'re migrating between DB servers (or have another reason you\'d dump and reload your dta), you can just modify the output from mysqldump:Then load it again:(Also, in my limited experience, this can be a much faster process than altering the tables \xe2\x80\x98live\xe2\x80\x99. It probably depends on the type of data and indexes.)From inside mysql, you could use search/replace using a text editor:Note: You should probably ignore information_schema and mysql because "The mysql and information_schema databases, that implement some of the MySQL internals, still use MyISAM. In particular, you cannot switch the grant tables to use InnoDB." ( http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-default-se.html )In any case, note the tables to ignore and run:Now just copy/paste that list into your text editor and search/replace "|" with "ALTER TABLE" etc.You\'ll then have a list like this you can simply paste into your mysql terminal:If your text editor can\'t do this easily, here\'s another solution for getting a similar list (that you can paste into mysql) for just one prefix of your database, from linux terminal:You could write a script to do it in your favourite scripting language. The script would do the following:Try this shell scriptThis is a simple php script.I\'m a newbie and had to find my own solution because mysql commands on the web are usually riddled with misspellings create a real life nightmare for people just starting out.  Here is my solution....Instead of in 1 command per table, I prepared dozens of commands (ready to copy and paste) at once using excel.How?\nexpand your putty window and enter mysql and then run the command "SHOW TABLE STATUS;" and the copy/paste the output to microsoft excel.  Go to the Data tab and use the "text to columns" feature an delimit the columns by a space key.  Then Sort the columns by whichever column shows your table types and delete all rows which the tables are already in InnoDb format (because we don\'t need to run commands against them, they are already done).  Then add 2 columns to the left of the tables column, and 2 columns to the right.  Then paste in the first part of the command in column-1 (see below).  Column 2 should contain only a space.  Column 3 is your tables column.  Column 4 should contain only a space.  Column 5 is the last part of your command.  It should look like this:Then copy and paste about 5 rows at a time into mysql.  This will convert about 5 at once.  I noticed if I did more than that at once then the commands would fail.Some fixes to this util scriptA plain MySQL Version.You can simply start mysql executable, use database and copy-paste the query.This will convert all MyISAM tables in the current Database into INNODB tables.use this line to alter the database engine for single table.In my case, I was migrating from a MySQL instance with a default of MyISAM, to a MariaDB instance with a DEFAULT of InnoDB.Per MariaDB Migration Doc\'s.On old Server Run :The --skip-create-options ensures that the database server uses the default storage engine when loading the data, instead of MyISAM.This threw an error regarding creating mysql.db, but everything works great now :)cd /var/lib/mysql/DBNAMEls | grep ".frm" | cut -d"." -f1 | xargs -I{} -n1 mysql -D DBNAME -e "alter table {} ENGINE=INNODB;" -uroot -pXXXXX
