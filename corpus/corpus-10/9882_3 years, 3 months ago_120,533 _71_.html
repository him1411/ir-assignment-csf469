I am trying to use hex color values in Swift, instead of the few standard ones that UIColor allows you to use, but I have no idea how to do it. Example: how would I use #ffffff as a color?#ffffff are actually 3 color components in hexadecimal notation - red ff, green ff and blue ff. You can write hexadecimal notation in Swift using 0x prefix, e.g 0xFFTo simplify the conversion, let\'s create an initializer that takes integer (0 - 255) values:Usage:How to get alpha?Depending on your use case, you can simply use the native UIColor.withAlphaComponent method, e.g.Or you can add an additional (optional) parameter to the above methods:(we cannot name the parameter alpha because of a name collision with the existing initializer).Called as:To get the alpha as an integer 0-255, we canCalled asOr a combination of the previous methods. There is absolutely no need to use strings.This is a function that takes a hex string and returns a UIColor.\n(You can enter hex strings with either format: #ffffff or ffffff)Swift 3:Swift 2:Usage:Source: arshad/gist:de147c42d7b3063ef7bcEdit: Updated the code.  Thanks, Hlung and jaytrixz!Swift 3 UIColor extension:Usage:Swift 2.x version:UIColor:CGColor:UsageWith Swift 2.0 and Xcode 7.0.1 you can create this function:and then use it in this way:Gist codeExample strings:Playground output:\nThis answer shows how to do it in Obj-C. The bridge is to use Swift 3 version of Ethan Strider answer:Another methodSwift 3.0Write a extension for UIColoryou can directly create UIColor with hex like thisHere\'s a Swift extension on UIColor that takes a hex string:Latest swift3 VersionUse in your class or where ever you converted into hexcolor to uicolor like in this wayHow to useYou can use this extension on UIColor which converts Your String (Hexadecimal , RGBA) to UIColor and vice versa.}Swift 2.0The code below is tested on xcode 7.2Swift 2.0:In viewDidLoad()I\'ve made another UIColor extension in Swift 2.2, it can use hex value to UIColor straight, wish can help someone:And use it like this:Just some addiotion to the first answer(haven\'t cehcked the alpha, may need to add an if netHext > 0xffffff):There are 7 hex color formats: ""#FF0000","0xFF0000", "FF0000", "F00", "red", 0x00FF00 , 16711935CAUTION: This isn\'t a "one-file-solution", there are some dependencies, but hunting them down may be faster than researching this from scratch. https://github.com/eonist/swift-utils/blob/2882002682c4d2a3dc7cb3045c45f66ed59d566d/geom/color/NSColorParser.swiftPermalink:\nhttps://github.com/eonist/Element/wiki/Progress#supporting-7-hex-color-typesSwift 2.0:Make an extension of UIColor.Usage:Swift 2.3:\nUIColor Extension.
