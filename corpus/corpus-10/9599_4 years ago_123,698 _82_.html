I submitted an app update, but I have received an email telling me this error has occurred:Missing recommended icon file - The bundle does not contain an app icon for iPhone / iPod Touch of exactly \'120x120\' pixels, in .png formatHow can I fix this problem?Here are the current icon requirements from Apple.I could not see 120x120 appearing anywhere? Is this iOS 7 specific? Should I include an icon named Icon-120.png or something?Update: I added three icons to the resource folder (Icon-120.png : 120x120, Icon-76.png: 76x76 & Icon-152.png: 152x152), but it did not add them to the info.plist. The same warning email was received. I decided to not change anything and wait to see what would happen next.To my utter amazement, the app went into the review stage 20 hours later and was released on the market the very next day! Kind of makes me wonder how many Apple/Windows app review people lurk around here.For iPhoneX new apple guide line please take a look following:https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/icons-and-images/image-size-and-resolution/Here are one of the helpful website that create an icon for iOS, Mac App and android app:https://makeappicon.com/You just need to drag and drop your 1024 x 1024 icon that will be create all the icon and send it to your email. then follow the following method to set icons for iOS app.After Apple launched iOS 8, iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the app icon sizes and launch image sizes changed; please visit my post for new sizes:Image resolution for new iPhone 6 and 6+, @3x support added?Yes, you need to add a 120x120 high resolution icon. Now, if you want to target only iOS 7, you just need 76 x 76, 120 x 120 and 152 x 152 icon sizes. If you also want to target iOS 6, you\xe2\x80\x99ll need 57 x 57, 72 x 72, 76 x 76, 114 x 114, 120 x 120, 144 x 144 and 152 x 152 icon sizes. Without counting Spotlight and Settings icon if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want the OS to interpolate them!As per the blog post New Metrics for iOS 7 App Icons. UPDATE:As per Apple Guideline App-icon OR Icon and Image Sizes:Icon dimensions (iOS 7 and later)Icon dimensions (iOS 6.1 and earlier)Create different sizes of the app icon for different devices. If you\xe2\x80\x99re creating a universal app, you need to supply app icons in all four sizes.For iPhone and iPod touch, both of these sizes are required:120 x 120 pixels60 x 60 pixels (standard resolution)For iPad, both of these sizes are required:152 x 15276 x 76 pixels (standard resolution)Now set this into Project:Create a new icon with 120 pixels with high-resolution and 60 pixels as regular as above that the Apple documentation mentions and set the name. For example, icon-120.png and icon-152.png.Put this icons into your project Resource folder and add this icon into the project:Now archive and distribute your project as we did for submission of the app binary into the AppÂ Store. I hope now you can submit your app without any icon issue.NOTE:Be careful to provide all the icons you need. Otherwise your app will not pass Apple validation. If you\xe2\x80\x99ve received this kind of email:Apple is now accepting applications that work on iOS 7 as well, so whatever the Deployment target 6.1 or earlier, but you also need to provide the iOS 7 icon sizes as I mention above (that the store is expecting).Xcode 5 app icon ManageIf you are using xCode5 The first thing to update is the icons. Xcode 5 introduces Asset Catalogs to simply managing multiple copies of an image (such as for multiple resolutions). We\xe2\x80\x99ll create one to manage both the Game\xe2\x80\x99s icons, along with the Launch Images.Now, click the Use Asset Catalog button. When confirming the migration, you\xe2\x80\x99re also asked if you wish to migrate the Launch Images (which is iOS talk for the splash screen that appears when starting your app) - you\xe2\x80\x99ll want to ensure this is checked as well.Please take a Look for more Info Apple doc of Asset CatalogsThe accepted answer is great, but here\'s the short answer:New icons below hereFound this here by searching for "The bundle does not contain an app icon for iPhone / iPod Touch of exactly \'120x120\' pixels, in .png format." in Google.You don\'t have to do it this complicated way. If you are using XCode 5 (which I am sure most of us are) then create your icons call them whatever you like i.e. And drag and drop them on to the correct boxes under AppIcon. See screenshots. You don\'t have to manually edit plist file. \n\nI want to add another pitfall. Even if you did everything right, you may get trapped by this error if you support more than one target in your build process.The image asset catalog is part of a target and even if you selected it in Xcode5 to be used for your target, it does not mean it is automatically added. As a result, the build works like a charm, but the asset catalog is not added to the IPA and the AppStore validation fails with the Error, that the icons are missing.To fix or check that the assets are part of the target, select the assets-entry in the Xcode project and make sure your target is checked in the inspector.I faced the same issue while submitting the app using Xcode 4.6. It does not recognise the icons with dimension 120x120, 58x58, 29x29, etc. So when I tried to add these icons into the info.plist and submit the app for review, Xcode 4.6 did not allow me to do so. On submitting the app without the above icons, I got a mail saying - "Your delivery was successful, but you may wish to correct the following issues in your next delivery:\nMissing recommended icon file - The bundle does not contain an app icon for iPhone / iPod Touch of exactly \'120x120\' pixels, in .png format."Since, it was recommended and not necessary, I submitted the app anyhow. I added the above recommended icons to the bundle but did not specify them in the Info.plist. I got the same mail again. This time I ignored it and to my surprise the app was accepted. I wanted my app to run on iOS 5 and above and therefore, I had to use Xcode 4.6 and not the latest Xcode 5 which properly allows only apps for iOS7 and above only.UPDATE: NOTE: "Starting February 1st 2014 new apps and app updates submitted to the App Store must be built with Xcode 5 and iOS 7 SDK". \nhttps://developer.apple.com/news/?id=12172013a#topThus, this scenario will be invalid in future.This should be called a warning, not an error. At least the email says that the icon file is "recommended" and not "required". You can safely ignore this warning if you target iOS 6. Of course, for iOS 7 you would need the new dimensions and also look out for the new rounding of the icon\'s corners In my case, my App icon files were not in the camel case notation. For example:My Filename: Appicon57x57Should be: AppIcon57x57 (note the capital \'i\' here)So, in my case the solution was this:This should fix the problem.None of the answers help me. Turns out that User-Defined COMBINE_HIDPI_IMAGES setting with value YES is the reason of this error. So my anwser:Set COMBINE_HIDPI_IMAGES to NOAdding another "Same symptoms, but different solution" response, just in case somebody is having the same problem, but none of the common solutions are working.In my case, I had an app that started development prior to the instruction of asset catalogs and the flexibility in icon naming conventions, but was first submitted to the store after the transition.  To resolve the issue I had to:In my case i simply removed CFBundleIcons~ipad key from the info.plist file which was blocking the use of AppIcon set for iPad.The target of my project was iPhone and IOS 8. XCode version was 6.3. Setting CFBundleIcons~ipad probably come from an early version of XCode. I created my AppIcon catalog manually and had all the correct icons in it, but my project was not using it as the icon catalog. On the project\'s General tab (where you can set the project name and version number), there was an entry for App Icons Source, but no way to select the catalog I created. I had to click the button to create a new catalog, then delete that new catalog, and then the button changed to a menu where I could select the existing catalog.For any Xamarin.iOS or Xamarin.Forms developers, additionally you will want to check the .csproj file (for the iOS project) and ensure that it contains references to the PNG\'s and not just the Asset Catalog i.e.Just had same problem. Using Xcode 8.3.3 and wanted to use AppIcon in Assests catalogue. Tried all sorts of Stack Overflow answers without success.Finally learned about a deep clean step from Ken/Apple Forum:added a new asset catalogue and called it "Assets" right clicked in Assets folder and added new app icon set - changed that one in inspector to be for iOS >=7 triplechecked all my icon files OUTSIDE of Xcode (all were already png\nfiles of right resolution, but some had still colour profile attached\nfrom photoshop elements or did have indexed colour instead of RGB\nprofile. so I made sure I only save a png file without colour profile\nand from a background layer) - not sure that was necessary
