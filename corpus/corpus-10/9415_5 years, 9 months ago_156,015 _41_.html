Is it possible to exchange jobs between 2 different Jenkins\'? I\'m searching for a way to export/import jobs.Jenkins has a rather good wiki, albeit hard to read when you\'re new to CI software...They offer a simple solution for moving jobs between serversThe trick probably was the need to reload config from the Jenkins Configuration Page.Probably use jenkins command line is another option, see https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+CLISo you can do It works fine for me and I am used to store in inside my version control systemA one-liner:$ curl -s http://OLD_JENKINS/job/JOBNAME/config.xml | curl -X POST \'http://NEW_JENKINS/createItem?name=JOBNAME\' --header "Content-Type: application/xml" -d @-Authentication$ curl -s http:///<USER>:<API_TOKEN>@OLD_JENKINS/job/JOBNAME/config.xml | curl -X POST \'http:///<USER>:<API_TOKEN>@NEW_JENKINS/createItem?name=JOBNAME\' --header "Content-Type: application/xml" -d @-With Crumb, if CSRF is active (see details here)get crumb with: $ CRUMB_OLD=$(curl -s \'http://<USER>:<API_TOKEN>@OLD_JENKINS/crumbIssuer/api/xml?xpath=concat(//crumbRequestField,":",//crumb)\')$ CRUMB_NEW=$(curl -s \'http://<USER>:<API_TOKEN>@NEW_JENKINS/crumbIssuer/api/xml?xpath=concat(//crumbRequestField,":",//crumb)\')apply crumb with -H CRUMB:$ curl -s -H $CRUMB_OLD http:///<USER>:<API_TOKEN>@OLD_JENKINS/job/JOBNAME/config.xml | curl -X POST -H $CRUMB_NEW \'http:///<USER>:<API_TOKEN>@NEW_JENKINS/createItem?name=JOBNAME\' --header "Content-Type: application/xml" -d @-There\'s a plugin called Job Import Plugin that may be what you are looking for.  I have used it.  It does have issues with importing projects from a server that doesn\'t allow anonymous access.For Completeness:\nIf you have command line access to both, you can do the procedure already mentioned by Khez for Moving, Copying and Renaming Jenkins Jobs.Go to your Jenkins server\'s front page, click on REST API at the bottom of the page:Create JobTo create a new job, post config.xml to this URL with query parameter name=JOBNAME. You need to send a Content-Type: application/xml header. You\'ll get 200 status code if the creation is successful, or 4xx/5xx code if it fails. config.xml is the format Jenkins uses to store the project in the file system, so you can see examples of them in the Jenkins home directory, or by retrieving the XML configuration of existing jobs from /job/JOBNAME/config.xml.In my Jenkins instance (version 1.548) the configuration file is at:/var/lib/jenkins/jobs/-the-project-name-/config.xmlOwned by jenkins user and jenkins group with 644 permissions. Copying the file to and from here should work. I haven\'t tried changing it directly but have backed-up the config from this spot in case the project needs to be setup again.Thanks to Larry Cai\'s answer I managed to create a script to backup all my Jenkins jobs. I created a job that runs this every week. In case someone finds it useful, here it is:Job Import plugin is the easy way here to import jobs from another Jenkins instance. Just need to provide the URL of the source Jenkins instance. The Remote Jenkins URL can take any of the following types of URLs:http://$JENKINS - get all jobs on remote instancehttp://$JENKINS/job/$JOBNAME - get a single jobhttp://$JENKINS/view/$VIEWNAME - get all jobs in a particular viewJenkins export jobs to a directoryImport jobsSimple php script worked for me.Export:\n    \n\nImport:This does not work for existing jobs, however there is Jenkins job builder.This allows one to keep job definitions in yaml files and in a git repo which is very portable.For those of us in the Windows world who may or may not have Bash available, here\'s my PowerShell port of Katu and Larry Cai\'s approach. Hope it helps someone.It is very easy just download plugin name Job Import PluginEnter the URL of your Remote Jenkins server and it will import the jobs automatically
