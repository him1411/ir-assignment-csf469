If you have an NSMutableArray, how do you shuffle the elements randomly?(I have my own answer for this, which is posted below, but I\'m new to Cocoa and I\'m interested to know if there is a better way.)Update: As noted by @Mukesh, as of iOS 10+ and macOS 10.12+, there is an -[NSMutableArray shuffledArray] method that can be used to shuffle. See https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsarray/1640855-shuffledarray?language=objc for details. (But note that this creates a new array, rather than shuffling the elements in place.)You don\'t need the swapObjectAtIndex method. exchangeObjectAtIndex:withObjectAtIndex: already exists.I solved this by adding a category to NSMutableArray.Edit: Removed unnecessary method thanks to answer by Ladd.Edit: Changed (arc4random() % nElements) to arc4random_uniform(nElements) thanks to answer by Gregory Goltsov and comments by miho and blahdiblahEdit: Loop improvement, thanks to comment by RonEdit: Added check that array is not empty, thanks to comment by Mahesh AgrawalSince I can\'t yet comment, I thought I\'d contribute a full response. I modified Kristopher Johnson\'s implementation for my project in a number of ways (really trying to make it as concise as possible), one of them being arc4random_uniform() because it avoids modulo bias.This is the simplest and fastest way to shuffle NSArrays or NSMutableArrays \n(object puzzles is a NSMutableArray, it contains puzzle objects. I\'ve added to\npuzzle object variable index which indicates initial position in array)log output:you may as well compare obj1 with obj2 and decide what you want to return\npossible values are: From iOS 10 you can use the new shuffled API:https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/nsarray/1640855-shuffledAfter editing the top answers, I thought about sharing a slightly improved and concise solution.The algorithm is the same and is described in literature as "Fisher-Yates shuffle".In ObjectiveC:In Swift 3.2 and 4.x:In Swift 3.0 and 3.1:Note: A more concise solution in Swift is possible from iOS10 using GameplayKit.Note: An algorithm for unstable shuffling (with all positions forced to change if count > 1) is also availableThere is a nice popular library, that has this method as it\'s part, called SSToolKit in GitHub. \nFile NSMutableArray+SSToolkitAdditions.h contains shuffle method. You can use it also. Among this, there seem to be tons of useful things. The main page of this library is here.If you use this, your code will be like this: This library also has a Pod (see CocoaPods)If elements have repeats. e.g. array: A A A B B or B B A A Aonly solution is: A B A B AsequenceSelected is an NSMutableArray which stores elements of class obj, which are pointers to some sequence.From iOS 10, you can use NSArray shuffled() from GameplayKit. Here is an helper for Array in Swift 3:Kristopher Johnson\'s answer is pretty nice, but it\'s not totally random.Given an array of 2 elements, this function returns always the inversed array, because you are generating the range of your random over the rest of the indexes. A more accurate shuffle() function would be likeEdit: This is not correct. For reference purposes, I did not delete this post. See comments on the reason why this approach is not correct.Simple code here:
