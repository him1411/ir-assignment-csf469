I am trying to parse two values from a datagrid.\nThe fields are numeric, and when they have a comma (ex. 554,20), I can\'t get the numbers after the comma.\nI\'ve tried parseInt and parseFloat. How can I do this?If they\'re meant to be separate values, try this:If they\'re meant to be a single value (like in French, where one-half is written 0,5)Have you ever tried to do this? :p+(string) will cast string into float.Handy!So in order to solve your problem, you can do something like this:Replace the comma with a dot. This will only return 554:This will return 554.20:So in the end, you can simply use:Don\'t forget that parseInt() should only be used to parse integers (no floating points). In your case it will only return 554. Additionally, calling parseInt() on a float will not round the number: it will take its floor (closest lower integer).If you extend String object like this.... you can run it like thisworks with dot as wellYou can use this function. It will replace the commas with \' \' and then it will parseFlaot the value and after that it will again adjust the commas in value.   @GusDeCool or anyone else trying to replace more than one thousands separators, one way to do it is a regex global replace: /foo/g.  Just remember that . is a metacharacter, so you have to escape it or put it in brackets (\\. or [.]).  Here\'s one option:I had the same problem except I did not know in advance what were the thousands separators and the decimal separator. I ended up writing a library to do this.
