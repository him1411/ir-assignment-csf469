In my Android app I\'am going to implement my strings with internationalization. So currently I got a problem with the grammar and the way sentences build in different languages.For example: "5 minutes ago" - English"vor 5 Minuten" - GermanCan I do something like the following in strings.xml?And then some magic likeThis behaviour would solve the other problem with different word orders as well.Yes, just format your strings in the standard String.format() way.See the method Context.getString(int, Object...) and the Android or Java Formatter documentation.In your case, the string definition would be:If you need two variables in the XML you can use:%1$d text... %2$d or %1$s text... %2$s for string variables.Example:PS: Read Flaxie\'s comment bellow If you need to format your strings using String.format(String, Object...), then you can do so by putting your format arguments in the string resource. For example, with the following resource:In this example, the format string has two arguments: %1$s is a string and %2$d is a decimal number. You can format the string with arguments from your application like this:If you wish more look at: http://developer.android.com/intl/pt-br/guide/topics/resources/string-resource.html#FormattingAndStylingNote that for this particular application there\'s a standard library function, android.text.format.DateUtils.getRelativeTimeSpanString().There is many ways to use it and i recomend you to see this documentation about String Format.http://developer.android.com/intl/pt-br/reference/java/util/Formatter.htmlBut, if you need only one variable, you\'ll need to use %[type] where [type] could be any Flag (see Flag types inside site above). (i.e. "My name is %s" or to set my name UPPERCASE, use this "My name is %S")
