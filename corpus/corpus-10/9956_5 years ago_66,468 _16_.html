I am fairly new to Github and have come across an amateur-ish problem.I have been asked to do a code review and have been provided with a commit hash, however I have tried looking in Git if I can search using commit hashes but couldn\'t find anything.Is there a way I can find the changed code just by using the commit hash?A URL of the form https://github.com/<owner>/<project>/commit/<hash> will show you the changes introduced in that commit.  For example here\'s a recent bugfix I made to one of my projects on GitHub:https://github.com/jerith666/git-graph/commit/35e32b6a00dec02ae7d7c45c6b7106779a124685You can also shorten the hash to any unique prefix, like so:https://github.com/jerith666/git-graph/commit/35e32bI know you just asked about GitHub, but for completeness: If you have the repository checked out, from the command line, you can achieve basically the same thing with either of these commands (unique prefixes work here too):View single commit:\nhttps://github.com/<user>/<project>/commit/<hash>View log:\nhttps://github.com/<user>/<project>/commits/<hash>View full repo:\nhttps://github.com/<user>/<project>/tree/<hash><hash> can be any length as long as it is unique.The ability to search commits has recently been added to GitHub.To search for a hash, just enter at least the first 7 characters in the search box. Then on the results page, click the "Commits" tab to see matching commits (but only on the default branch, usually master), or the "Issues" tab to see pull requests containing the commit.To be more explicit you can add the hash: prefix to the search, but it\'s not really necessary.There is also a REST API (at the time of writing it is still in preview).
