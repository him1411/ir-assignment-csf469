The jQuery Core Style Guidelines suggest two different ways to check whether a variable is defined.Why does jQuery use one approach for global variables and another for locals and properties?For undeclared variables, typeof foo will return the string literal "undefined", whereas the identity check foo === undefined would trigger the error "foo is not defined".For local variables (which you know are declared somewhere), no such error would occur, hence the identity check.I\'d stick to using typeof foo === "undefined" everywhere. That can never go wrong.I imagine the reason why jQuery recommends the two different methods is that they define their own undefined variable within the function that jQuery code lives in, so within that function undefined is safe from tampering from outside. I would also imagine that someone somewhere has benchmarked the two different approaches and discovered that foo === undefined is faster and therefore decided it\'s the way to go. [UPDATE: as noted in the comments, the comparison with undefined is also slightly shorter, which could be a consideration.]  However, the gain in practical situations will be utterly insignificant: this check will never, ever be any kind of bottleneck, and what you lose is significant: evaluating a property of a host object for comparison can throw an error whereas a typeof check never will.For example, the following is used in IE for parsing XML:To check whether it has a loadXML method safely:On the other hand:UPDATEAnother advantage of the typeof check that I forgot to mention was that it also works with undeclared variables, which the foo === undefined check does not, and in fact throws a ReferenceError. Thanks to @LinusKleen for reminding me. For example:Bottom line: always use the typeof check.Yet another reason for using the typeof-variant: undefined can be redefined.The result of typeof variable  cannot.Update: note that this is not the case in ES5.Because undefined is not always declared, but jQuery declare undefined in its main function. So they use the safe undefined value internally, but outside, they use the typeof style to be safe.Who is interested in the performance gain of variable === undefined, may take a look here, but it seems to be a chrome optimization only.typeof a === \'undefined\' is faster then a === \'undefined\' by about 2 times on node v6.9.1.
