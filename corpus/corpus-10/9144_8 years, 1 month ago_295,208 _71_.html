Someone told me that he has seen software systems that would accept MD5 encrypted passwords (through various integrations with other systems), decrypt them, and store them in the systems own database using its own algorithm.Is that possible?  I thought that it wasn\'t possible (feasible) to decrypt MD5 hashes.I know there are MD5 dictionaries, but is there an actual decryption algorithm?No. MD5 is not encryption (though it may be used as part of some encryption algorithms), it is a one way hash function. Much of the original data is actually "lost" as part of the transformation. Think about this: An MD5 is always 128 bits long. That means that there are 2128 possible MD5 hashes. That is a reasonably large number, and yet it is most definitely finite. And yet, there are an infinite number of possible inputs to a given hash function (and most of them contain more than 128 bits, or a measly 16 bytes). So there are actually an infinite number of possibilities for data that would hash to the same value. The thing that makes hashes interesting is that it is incredibly difficult to find two pieces of data that hash to the same value, and the chances of it happening by accident are almost 0.A simple example for a (very insecure) hash function (and this illustrates the general idea of it being one-way) would be to take all of the bits of a piece of data, and treat it as a large number. Next, perform integer division using some large (probably prime) number n and take the remainder (see: Modulus). You will be left with some number between 0 and n. If you were to perform the same calculation again (any time, on any computer, anywhere), using the exact same string, it will come up with the same value. And yet, there is no way to find out what the original value was, since there are an infinite number of numbers that have that exact remainder, when divided by n.That said, MD5 has been found to have some weaknesses, such that with some complex mathematics, it may be possible to find a collision without trying out 2128 possible input strings. And the fact that most passwords are short, and people often use common values (like "password" or "secret") means that in some cases, you can make a reasonably good guess at someone\'s password by Googling for the hash or using a Rainbow table. That is one reason why you should always "salt" hashed passwords, so that two identical values, when hashed, will not hash to the same value.Once a piece of data has been run through a hash function, there is no going back.You can\'t. The whole point of a hash is that it\'s one way only. This means that if someone manages to get the list of MD5 hashes, they still can\'t get your password. (Not that MD5 is as secure as it might be, but never mind.) Additionally it means that even if someone uses the same password on multiple sites (yes, we all know we shouldn\'t, but...) administrators of site A won\'t be able to use the user\'s password on site B.Even if you could, you shouldn\'t email them their password - that\'s sensitive information which might remain sensitive.Instead, create a tool for resetting the password based on a timestamped hash value that can only be used once. Email a url to them which includes that timestamped hash value and at that URL let them change their password. Additionally, if you can, make that timestamped hash expire after a short period (e.g. 24 hours) so that even if they don\'t change the password (because they don\'t log in), there\'s a reduced vulnerability window.Many systems generate a new, random password and email that to them, forcing them to change it on first login. This is not desirable because someone could change every password in your system by brute-forcing the password reset form.Technically, it\'s \'possible\', but under very strict conditions (rainbow tables, brute forcing based on the very small possibility that a user\'s password is in that hash database). But that doesn\'t mean it\'s You don\'t want to \'reverse\' an MD5 hash. Using the methods outlined below, you\'ll never need to. \'Reversing\' MD5 is actually considered malicious - a few websites offer the ability to \'crack\' and bruteforce MD5 hashes - but all they are are massive databases containing dictionary words, previously submitted passwords and other words. There is a very small chance that it will have the MD5 hash you need reversed. And if you\'ve salted the MD5 hash - this won\'t work either! :)The way logins with MD5 hashing should work is:\nDuring Registration:\nUser creates password -> Password is hashed using MD5 -> Hash stored in databaseDuring Login:\nUser enters username and password -> (Username checked) Password is hashed using MD5 -> Hash is compared with stored hash in databaseWhen \'Lost Password\' is needed:\n2 options:orNot directly. Because of the pigeonhole principle, there is (likely) more than one value that hashes to any given MD5 output. As such, you can\'t reverse it with certainty. Moreover, MD5 is made to make it difficult to find any such reversed hash (however there have been attacks that produce collisions - that is, produce two values that hash to the same result, but you can\'t control what the resulting MD5 value will be).However, if you restrict the search space to, for example, common passwords with length under N, you might no longer have the irreversibility property (because the number of MD5 outputs is much greater than the number of strings in the domain of interest). Then you can use a rainbow table or similar to reverse hashes.Not possible, at least not in a reasonable amount of time.The way this is often handled is a password "reset".  That is, you give them a new (random) password and send them that in an email.You can\'t revert a md5 password.(in any language)But you can:give to the user a new one.check in some rainbow table to maybe retrieve the old one.One of appropriate method for reseting a passwordA sample example with databaseHere, take email_id and checks its present in database Users,\nIf yes, then make a random number/alphanumber or unixtimestamp and convert that string into hash \nand update the field reset_token with the converted/hashed string.Now take pick ( user_id or email_id ) and reset_token and make a link like belowreset_password.html?user=1&token=roiurwerolsAnd send this link to users.Now when a user clicks the links get parameters values from link using GET method.\nCheck whether user_id with 1 and reset_token in database, \nif these values exist then condition is true, that a user can update/reset password.\nAfter the password is updated/reset, then make reset_token to empty of that user_id [Make sure, Write SQL Queries correct]And thats it.. \nAnd if you want to add reset password expiry, then add a field in Users table with pwd_expiry\nand then make a condition in reset_password is lesser than your desired hours to todays dateNo, he must have been confused about the MD5 dictionaries.Cryptographic hashes (MD5, etc...) are one way and you can\'t get back to the original message with only the digest unless you have some other information about the original message, etc. that you shouldn\'t.Decryption (directly getting the the plain text from the hashed value, in an algorithmic way), no.There are, however, methods that use what is known as a rainbow table. It is pretty feasible if your passwords are hashed without a salt.MD5 is a hashing algorithm, you can not revert the hash value.You should add "change password feature", where the user gives another password, calculates the hash and store it as a new password. There\'s no easy way to do it.  This is kind of the point of hashing the password in the first place. :)One thing you should be able to do is set a temporary password for them manually and send them that.I hesitate to mention this because it\'s a bad idea (and it\'s not guaranteed to work anyway), but you could try looking up the hash in a rainbow table like milw0rm to see if you can recover the old password that way.See all other answers here about how and why it\'s not reversible and why you wouldn\'t want to anyway.For completeness though, there are rainbow tables which you can look up possible matches on. There is no guarantee that the answer in the rainbow table will be the original password chosen by your user so that would confuse them greatly.Also, this will not work for salted hashes. Salting is recommended by many security experts.No, it cannot be done. Either you can use a dictionary, or you can try hashing different values until you get the hash that you are seeking. But it cannot be "decrypted".There is no way of "reverting" a hash function in terms of finding the inverse function for it. As mentioned before, this is the whole point of having a hash function. It should not be reversible and it should allow for fast hash value calculation. So the only way to find an input string which yields a given hash value is to try out all possible combinations. This is called brute force attack for that reason.Trying all possible combinations takes a lot of time and this is also the reason why hash values are used to store passwords in a relatively safe way. If an attacker is able to access your database with all the user passwords inside, you loose in any case. If you have hash values and (idealistically speaking) strong passwords, it will be a lot harder to get the passwords out of the hash values for the attacker.Storing the hash values is also no performance problem because computing the hash value is relatively fast. So what most systems do is computing the hash value of the password the user keyed in (which is fast) and then compare it to the stored hash value in their user database.You can find online tools that use a dictionary to retrieve the original message.\nIn some cases, the dictionary method might just be useless:\n- if the message is hashed using a SALT message\n- if the message is hash more than once\nFor example, here is one md5 decrypter online tool!\nDavidMD5 is considered broken, not because you can get back the original content from the hash, but because with work, you can craft two messages that hash to the same hash.You cannot un-hash an MD5 hash.MD5 has its weaknesses (see Wikipedia), so there are some projects, which try to precompute Hashes. Wikipedia does also hint at some of these projects. One I know of (and respect) is ophrack. You can not tell the user their own password, but you might be able to tell them a password that works. But i think: Just mail thrm a new password in case they forgot.The only thing that can be work is (if we mention that the passwords are just hashed, without adding any kind of salt to prevent the replay attacks, if it is so you must know the salt)by the way, get an dictionary attack tool, the files of many words, numbers etc. then create  two rows, one row is word,number (in dictionary) the other one is hash of the word, and compare the hashes if matches you get it...that\'s the only way, without going into cryptanalysis.The MD5 Hash algorithm is not reversible, so MD5 decode in not possible, but some website have bulk set of password match, so you can try online for decode MD5 hash.Try online : MD5 Decryptmd5onlinemd5decrypterYes, exactly what you\'re asking for is possible.\nIt is not possible to \'decrypt\' an MD5 password without help, but it is possible to re-encrypt an MD5 password into another algorithm, just not all in one go.What you do is arrange for your users to be able to logon to your new system using the old MD5 password. At the point that they login they have given your login program an unhashed version of the password that you prove matches the MD5 hash that you have. You can then convert this unhashed password to your new hashing algorithm.Obviously, this is an extended process because you have to wait for your users to tell you what the passwords are, but it does work.(NB: seven years later, oh well hopefully someone will find it useful)It is not yet possible to put in a hash of a password into an algorithm and get the password back in plain text because hashing is a one way thing. But what people have done is to generate hashes and store it in a big table so that when you enter a particular hash, it checks the table for the password that matches the hash and returns that password to you. An example of a site that does that is  http://www.md5online.org/ . Modern password storage system counters this by using a salting algorithm such that when you enter the same password into a password box during registration different hashes are generated.In theories you can\'t decrypt but you have some dirty techniques for getting the original plain text back.You can do it in one way , try online MD5 Decrypter tool.http://www.md5decrypt.net/en/Api/  register email address here and get api code and set codemore...
