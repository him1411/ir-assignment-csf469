What is the meaning of this? I am guessing it is a browser hack, but I have not been able to find what exactly it does.What is the significance of \\9?\\9 is a "CSS hack" specific to Internet Explorer 7, 8, & 9.This simply means that the one specific line of CSS ending with a \\9; in place of the ; is only valid in IE 7, 8, & 9.In your example,width: 500px\\9; means that a width of 500 pixels (same result as width: 500px;) will only be applied while using IE 7, 8, & 9.All other browsers will ignore width: 500px\\9; entirely, and therefore not apply width: 500px; to the element at all.If your CSS looked like this...The result would be #myElement 500 pixels wide in IE 7, 8, & 9, while in all other browsers, #myElement would be 300 pixels wide.http://webdesignandsuch.com/ie9-specific-css-hack/EDIT:This answer was written in 2011.
