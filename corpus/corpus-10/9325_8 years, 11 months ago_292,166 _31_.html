Can someone enlighten me as to the difference between private and protected members in classes? I understand from best practice conventions that variables and functions which are not called outside the class should be made private - but looking at my MFC project, MFC seems to favour protected.Whats the difference and which should I use?Private members are only accessible within the class defining them.Protected members are accessible in the class that defines them and in classes that inherit from that class.Edit: Both are also accessible by friends of their class, and in the case of protected members, by friends of their derived classes.Edit 2: Use whatever makes sense in the context of your problem. You should try to make members private whenever you can to reduce coupling and protect the implementation of the base class, but if that\'s not possible then use protected members. Check C++ FAQ for a better understanding of the issue. This question about protected variables might also help.Public members of a class A are accessible for all and everyone.Protected members of a class A are not accessible outside of A\'s code, but is accessible from the code of any class derived from A.Private members of a class A are not accessible outside of A\'s code, or from the code of any class derived from A.So, in the end, choosing between protected or private is answering the following questions: How much trust are you willing to put into the programmer of the derived class?By default, assume the derived class is not to be trusted, and make your members private. If you have a very good reason to give free access of the mother class\' internals to its derived classes, then you can make them protected.Protected members can be accessed from derived classes. Private ones can\'t.In terms of "best practice", it depends. If there\'s even a faint possibility that someone might want to derive a new class from your existing one and need access to internal members, make them Protected, not Private. If they\'re private, your class may become difficult to inherit from easily.The reason that MFC favors protected, is because it is a framework. You probably want to subclass the MFC classes and in that case a protected interface is needed to access methods that are not visible to general use of the class.It all depends on what you want to do, and what you want the derived classes to be able to see.Attributes and methods marked as protected are -- unlike private ones -- still visible in subclasses.Unless you don\'t want to use or provide the possibility to override the method in possible subclasses, I\'d make them private.Protected members can only be accessed by descendants of the class, and by code in the same module. Private members can only be accessed by the class they\'re declared in, and by code in the same module.Of course friend functions throw this out the window, but oh well.private members are only accessible from within the class, protected members are accessible in the class and derived classes. It\'s a feature of inheritance in OO languages.You can have private, protected and public inheritance in C++, which will determine what derived classes can access in the inheritance hierarchy. C# for example only has public inheritance.Sure take a look at the Protected Member Variables question.  It is recommended to use private as a default (just like C++ classses do) to reduce coupling.  Protected member variables are most always a bad idea, protected member functions can be used for e.g. the Template Method pattern. since no public member function is needed to fetch and update protected members in derived class, this increases the effiecieny of code and reduces the amount of code we need to write. However programmer of derived class is supposed to be aware of what he is doing.Private member can be accessed only in same class where it has declared where as protected member can be accessed in class where it is declared along with the classes which are inherited by it .private = accessible by the mothership (base class) only\n(ie only my parent can go into my parent\'s bedroom)protected = accessible by mothership (base class), and her daughters\n(ie only my parent can go into my parent\'s bedroom, but gave son/daughter permission to walk into parent\'s bedroom)public = accessible by mothership (base class), daughter, and everyone else\n(ie only my parent can go into my parent\'s bedroom, but it\'s a house party - mi casa su casa)Private : It is an access specifier. By default the instance (member) variables or the methods of a class in c++/java are private. During inheritance , the code and the data is always inherited but is not accessible outside the class. We can declare our data members as private so that no one can make direct changes to our member variables and we can provide public getters and setters in order to change our private members. And this concept is always applied in business rule. Protected : It is also an access specifier. In c++ , the protected members are accessible within the class and to the inherited class but not outside the class. In java , the protected members are accessible within the class  , to the inherited class as well as to all the classes within the same package.private and protected access modifiers are one and same only that protected members of the base class can be accessed outside the scope of the base class in the child(derived)class.\nIt also applies the same to inheritance .\nBut with the private modifier the members of the base class can only be accessed in the scope or code of the base class and its friend functions only\'\'\'\'A protected nonstatic base class member can be accessed by members and friends of any classes derived from that base class by using one of the following:
