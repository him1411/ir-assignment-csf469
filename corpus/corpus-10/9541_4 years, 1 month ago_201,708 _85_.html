I have an android layout which has a scrollView with a number of elements with in it. At the bottom of the scrollView I have a listView which is then populated by an adapter.The problem that I am experiencing, is that android is excluding the listView from the scrollView as the scrollView already has a scroll-able function.  I want the listView to be as long as the content is and for the master scroll view to be scroll-able.How can I achieve this behavior?Here is my main layout:I then programmatically add my components to the linearlayour with the id: foodItemActvity_linearLayout_fragments.  Below is one of the views that is loaded into that linearlayout. This is the one giving me trouble with the scrolls.My adapter then fills up this list view.Here is an image from the android hierarchy viewer when I click on the master scrollView:As you can see, it is excluding the reviews listView.I should be able to scroll the page down and see 8 reviews, but instead it only shows me those 3, and I can scroll on the tiny part where the reviews are. I want a global page scrollThe shortest & easiest solution for the ListView inside a ScrollView problem.You do not have to do anything special in layout.xml file nor handle anything on the parent ScrollView. You only have to handle the child ListView. You can also use this code to use any type of child view inside a ScrollView & perform Touch operations.Just add these lines of code in your java class :If you put ListView inside a ScrollView then all the ListView does not stretch to its full height. Below is a method to fix this issue.To use this method just pass the ListView inside this method :For using with ExpandableListView  - credit BennyFor ListView with variable items height use the below link :ListView inside ScrollView is not scrolling on AndroidFor Library to directly implementing in your code - credit Paolo Rotolohttps://github.com/PaoloRotolo/ExpandableHeightListViewThe answer is simple and I am surprised it has yet to be answered here.Use a Header View or/and Footer View on the list itself.\nDon\'t mix a ScrollView with a ListView or anything that can scroll. It\'s meant to be used with headers and footers :)Essentially, take all the content above your ListView, put it in another .xml file as a layout and then in code inflate it and add it to the list as a header view.i.e.I know it\'s been so long but I got this problem too, tried this solution and it\'s working. So I guess it may help the others too.I add android:fillViewport="true" on the layout xml for the scrollView.\nSo overall my ScrollView will be like this.And it works like magic to me. \nthe ListView that located inside my ScrollView expand to its size again.Here is the full example code for the ScrollView and the ListView.You Create Custom ListView Which is non ScrollableIn Your Layout Resources FileIn Java File\nCreate a object of your customListview instead of ListView like : \nNonScrollListView non_scroll_list = (NonScrollListView) findViewById(R.id.lv_nonscroll_list);you can use this code for listview in scrollviewYou may solve it by adding android:fillViewport="true" to your ScrollView.before use that property, there was only one child of my list view is visible. after using that all the rows or child of list are visible.I\'ll leave it here in case anyone will face the same issue. I had to put a ListView inside a ScrollView. ListView with header was not an option by a number of reasons. Neither was an option to use LinearLayout instead of ListView. So I followed the accepted solution, but it didn\'t work because items in the list had complex layout with multiple rows and each listview item was of variable height. Height was measured not properly. The solution was to measure each item inside ListView Adapter\'s getView() method.This code will solve your problem if you have implemented just  a ListView in a code.If you are using RelativeLayout as ListView child than this code return a NullPointerException here listItem.measure(0, 0);, because of RelativeLayout.And the solution is put your Relativelayout inside a LinearLayout and it will work fine.You can easy put ListView in ScrollView!\nJust need to change height of ListView programmatically, like this:This works perfectly!As others had already mentioned, don\'t use ListView inside a ScrollView.To workaround, you can use a LinearLayout, but to still keep things neat - populate your LinearLayout with an Adapter, same as you do with a ListViewYou can use this class as a LinearLayout replacement that supports AdaptersYou can put all into linear layout. That is,  create linear layout and it will have 2 childs, scrollview and another linear layout. Give them layout weights and here you go :Don\'t do anything in Parent ScrollView. Only do this to child ListView. Everything will work perfectly.  You should never use a ScrollView with a ListView, because ListView takes care of its own vertical scrolling. Most importantly, doing this defeats all of the important optimizations in ListView for dealing with large lists, since it effectively forces the ListView to display its entire list of items to fill up the infinite container supplied by ScrollView.http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ScrollView.htmlUpdateto The point here is you are trying to set height to 0dp (fixed)Done after lots of R&D:fragment_one.xml should looks like:Your Java class of FragmentOne.java looks like:onCreateViewMy requirement is to include a ListView of equally-sized items within a ScrollView. I tried a few of the other solutions listed here, none seemed to size the ListView correctly (either too little space or too much).  Here\'s what worked for me:Hope this helps someone.found a solution for scrollview -> viewpager -> FragmentPagerAdapter -> fragment -> dynamic listview, but im not the author. there is some bugs, but at least it worksfragments layout can be anythingthen somewhere justDo NEVER put a ListView inside of a ScrollView! You can find more information about that topic on Google. In your case, use a LinearLayout instead of the ListView and add the elements programmatically.Ok, here \'s my answer. The method that fixes the ListView height is closed enough, but not perfect. In case that most of the items are the same height, that work well. But in case that\'s not, then there\'s a big problem. I\'ve tried many time, and when I put out the value of listItem.getMeasureHeight and listItem.getMeasuerWidth into the log, I saw the width values vary a lot, which is not expected here, since all the item in the same ListView should have the same width. And there go the bug : Some used measure(0 ,0), which actually made the view unbound, in both direction, and width run wild. Some tried to getWidth of listView, but then it return 0, meaningless. When I read further into how android render the View, I realize that all of this attempt can\'t reach the answer that I searched for, unless these function run after the view is render. This time I use the getViewTreeObserver on the ListView that I want to fix height, then addOnGlobalLayoutListener. Inside this method, I declare a new OnGlobalLayoutListener, in which, this time, getWidth return the actual width of the ListView. The value pad, is the padding that I set in ListView layout. If for some reason you don\'t want to use addHeaderView and addFooterView, e.g. when you have several lists, a good idea would be to reuse ListAdapter to populate a simple LinearLayout so there\'s no scrolling functionality.If you already have a whole fragment derived from ListFragment and want to convert it to a similar fragment with simple LinearLayout without scrolling instead (e.g. to put it in ScrollView), you can implement an adapter fragment like this:You may also want to forward onCreate, onPause, onResume, etc. to the original fragment depending on your needs or try inheritance instead of composition (but override certain methods so original fragment is not actually attached to layout hierarchy); but I wanted to isolate original fragment as much as possible, because we only need to extract its ListAdapter. If you call original fragment\'s setListAdapter in onAttach, that\'s probably enough.Here\'s how to use ListAsArrayFragment to include OriginalListFragment without scrolling. In parent activity\'s onCreate:found a solution for scrollview -> viewpager -> FragmentPagerAdapter -> fragment -> dynamic listview, but im not the author. fragments layout can be anythingthen somewhere justusing this ListView Worked for meand in xmland in MainActivity Refer This article  for more info and also to know how to keep gridview  inside scroll viewIn xml:In Java:I had a similar problem to the issue posed by the Original Poster - how to make the listview scroll inside the scrollview - and this answer solved my problem.\nDisable scrolling of a ListView contained within a ScrollViewI didn\'t call new fragments into existing layouts or anything like that, like the OP was doing, so my code would look something like this :Basically what I am doing is checking the length of the listview before I call it and when I call it I make it into that length. In your java class use this function:And call the function like this:The result is a listview with no scrollbar, the whole length of the listview being displayed, that scrolls with the scroll bar of the scrollview.
