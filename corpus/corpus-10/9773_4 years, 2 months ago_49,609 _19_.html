This may be a very basic question but I simply don\'t get it. What is the difference between creating an app using Express.js and starting the app listening on port 1234 for example:and adding an http server:What\'s the difference? If I navigate to http://localhost:1234 - I get the same output...The second form (creating an HTTP server yourself, instead of having Express create one for you) is useful if you want to reuse the HTTP server, for example to run socket.io within the same HTTP server instance:However, app.listen() also returns the HTTP server instance, so with a bit of rewriting you can achieve something similar without creating an HTTP server yourself:There is one more difference of using the app and listening to http server is when you want to setup for https serverTo setup for https, you need the code below:The app from express will return http server only, you cannot set it in express, so you will need to use the https server commandExpress is basically a wrapper of http module that is created for the ease of the developers in such a way that..I came with same question but after google, I found there is no big difference :)From GithubIf you wish to create both an HTTP and HTTPS server you may do so with the "http" and "https" modules as shown here.Also if you want to work with socket.io see their exampleSee thisI prefer app.listen() :) Just for punctuality purpose and extend a bit Tim answer.\nFrom official documentation:The app returned by express() is in fact a JavaScript Function, \n  DESIGNED TO BE PASSED to Node\xe2\x80\x99s HTTP servers as a callback  to handle\n  requests.This makes it easy to provide both HTTP and HTTPS  versions of your\n  app with the same code base, as the app does not  inherit from these\n  (it is simply a callback):The app.listen() method returns an http.Server object and (for HTTP)\n  is a convenience method for the following:
