In Python you can do a:How would you do this in Java, as I have two imports that are clashing.There is no import aliasing mechanism in Java. You cannot import two classes with the same name and use both of them unqualified.Import one class and use the fully qualified name for the other one, i.e.It\'s probably worth noting that Groovy has this feature:As the other answers already stated, Java does not provide this feature.Implementation of this feature has been requested multiple times, e.g. as JDK-4194542: class name aliasing or JDK-4214789: Extend import to allow renaming of imported type.From the comments:This is not an unreasonable request, though hardly essential. The occasional\n  use of fully qualified names is not an undue burden (unless the library\n  really reuses the same simple names right and left, which is bad style).In any event, it doesn\'t pass the bar of price/performance for a language\n  change.So I guess we will not see this feature in Java anytime soon :-PJava doesn\'t allow you to do that. You\'ll need to refer to one of the classes by its fully qualified name and only import the other one.Actually it is possible to create a shortcut so you can use shorter names in your code by doing something like this:In that way you only need to specify the long name once, and you can have as many specially named classes you want.Another thing I like about this pattern is that you can name the implementing class the same as the abstract base class, and just place it in a different namespace. That is unrelated to the import/renaming pattern though.
