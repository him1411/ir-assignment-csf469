Activity class code:The getView function in the Adapter class:Is there a problem with using two xmls while inflating?I just found solution from here.. but by deep clicking...If any row item of list contains focusable or clickable view then OnItemClickListener won\'t work.The row item must have a param like android:descendantFocusability="blocksDescendants".here you can see example, how your list item should look like.\nYour list item xml should be...\nrow_item.xml (your_xml_file.xml)The problem is that your layouts contain either focusable or clickable items.\nIf a view contains either focusable or clickable item the OnItemCLickListener won\'t be called.Click here for more information.Please post one of your layout xmls if that isn\'t the case.For my lists, my rows have other things that can be clicked, like buttons, so doing a blanket blocksDescendants doesn\'t work. Instead I add a line in the button\'s xml:That keeps the buttons from blocking the clicks on the rows, but still lets the buttons take the clicks, too.you need to do 2 steps in your listview_item.xmlHere is an example: listview_item.xmluse the below code inside button tag in custom row layout of listviewI had the same problem and I just saw I had accidentally set:on my CustomListViewAdapter class.By changing this to:I\'ve managed to fix the problem.\nJust in case if someone has done the same mistake...if you have textviews, buttons or stg clickable or selectable in your row view onlyis not enough. You have to set to your textviews and to your buttons and other focusable items.Even I was having the same problem, I am having checkbox, did the following to masker itemClickListener work,Added the following properties to the checkbox,and ItemClickListner started working.For detailed example you can go through the link,http://knowledge-cess.com/android-itemclicklistner-with-checkbox-or-radiobutton/Hope it helps Cheers!!Use android:descendantFocusabilityAdd above in root layoutI solved it with the help of this answer 1.Add the following in Linear Layout of list_items.xml\n  android:descendantFocusability="blocksDescendants" 2.Child Views of LinearLayout in list_items.xmlI had the same problem and tried all of the mentioned solutions to no avail. through testing i found that making the text selectable was preventing the listener to be called. So by switching it to false, or removing it my listener was called again. hope this helps someone who was stuck like me.Two awesome solutions were this, if your extending ListFragment from a fragment, know that mListView.setOnItemClickListener wont be called before your activity is created, this ensured it is set when activity has been createdWhile looking at the source code for ListFragment, I came across thisAn onItemClickListener object is attached and it calls onListItemClick()\nAs such the other similar solution, which works in the exact same way is to override onListItemClick()I\'ve tried all the above and NOTHING worked.I solved the problem as follows:First I define a custom Button called ListButtonThe XML looks like:Then I define my own ButtonClicked Listener interface:Then I use my own listener just as if it was the normal OnClickListener:If you want to use both the simple click and long click on list view items better way to implement that would be to use context menu for long click. Avoid using setItemLongClickListener especially if you have multiple row layouts for your listview. Faced same problem, tried for hours. If you have tried all of the above than try changing layout_width of Listview and list item to match_parent from wrap_content.All of the above failed for me.  However, I was able to resolve the problem (after many hours of banging my head - Google, if you\'re listening, please consider fixing what I encountered below in the form of compiler errors, if possible)You really have to be careful of what android attributes you add to your  xml layout here (in this original question, it is called list_items.xml).  For me, what was causing the problem was that I had switched from an EditText view to a TextView and had leftover attribute cruft from the change (in my case, inputType).  The compiler didn\'t catch it and the clickability just failed when I went to run the app.  Double check all of the attributes you have in your layout xml nodes.
