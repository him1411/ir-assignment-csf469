I am making an app that processes sensitive credit card data.If my code is running in debug mode I want to log this data to the console and make some file dumps.   However on the final appstore version (ie when it is running in release mode) it is essential all of this is disabled (security hazard)!I will try to answer my question as best I can;  so the question becomes \'Is this solution path the right or best way to do it?\'Check your project\'s build settings under \'Apple LVM - Preprocessing\', \'Preprocessor Macros\' for debug to ensure that \'DEBUG\' is being set - do this by selecting the project and clicking on the build settings tab. Search for \'DEBUG\' and look to see if indeed DEBUG is being set.Pay attention though.  You may see DEBUG changed to another variable name such as DEBUG_MODE.then conditionally code for DEBUG in your source filesApple already includes a DEBUG flag in debug builds, so you don\'t need to define your own.You might also want to consider just redefining NSLog to a null operation when not in DEBUG mode, that way your code will be more portable and you can just use regular NSLog statements:For a solution in Swift please refer to this thread on SO.Basically the solution in Swift would look like this:Additionally you will need to set the DEBUG symbol in Swift Compiler - Custom Flags section for the Other Swift Flags key via a -D DEBUG entry. See the following screenshot for an example:zitao xiong\'s answer is pretty close to what I use; I also include the file name (by stripping off the path of FILE).In xcode 7, there is a field under Apple LLVM 7.0 - preprocessing, which called "Preprocessors Macros Not Used In Precompiled..."\x10\nI put DEBUG in front of Debug and it works for me by using below code:Most answers said that  how to set #ifdef DEBUG  and none of them saying how to determinate debug/release build.My opinion:Edit scheme -> run ->  build configuration :choose debug / release . It can control the simulator and your test iPhone\'s code status.Edit scheme -> archive ->  build configuration :choose debug / release . It can control the test package app and App Store app \'s code status.\nNot sure if I answered you question, maybe you could try these code:Just one more idea to detect:DebugMode.hDebugMode.madd into header bridge file:#include "DebugMode.h"usage:DebugMode.isDebug()It is not needed to write something inside project properties swift flags.
