How would I do an "or" in a django filter.Basically, I want to be able to list the items that either a user has added (they are listed as the creator) or the item has been approvedso I basically need to selectHow would I do this in django (preferably with a filter/queryset)There is Q objects that allow to complex lookups. Example:You can use the | operator to combine querysets directly without needing Q objects:(edit - I was initially unsure if this caused an extra query but @spookylukey pointed out that lazy queryset evaluation takes care of that)You want to make filter dynamic then you have to use Lambda like   reduce(lambda x, y: x | y, [Q(brand=item) for item in brands]) is equivalent toSimilar to older answera, but a bit simpler, without the lambda:To filter these two conditions using OR:To get the same result programmatically:(broken in two lines here, for clarity)operator is in standard library: import operator\nFrom docstring: or_(a, b) -- Same as a | b.For Python3, reduce is not in standard library: from functools import reduceP.S.Don\'t forget to make sure list_of_Q is not empty - reduce() will choke on empty list, it needs at least one element.It is worth to note that it\'s possible to add Q expressions.For example:This ends up with a query like :This way there is no need to deal with or operators, reduce\'s etc.This might be useful https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/queries/#spanning-multi-valued-relationshipsBasically it sounds like they act as OR
