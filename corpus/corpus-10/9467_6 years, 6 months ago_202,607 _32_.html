I\'d like to use a color from an hexa string such as "#FFFF0000" to (say) change the background color of a Layout.\nColor.HSVToColor looks like a winner but it takes a float[] as a parameter.Am I any close to the solution at all?Try Color class method:From Android documentation:Supported formats are: #RRGGBB #AARRGGBB \'red\', \'blue\', \'green\', \'black\', \'white\', \'gray\', \'cyan\', \'magenta\', \'yellow\', \'lightgray\', \'darkgray\' Try:Convert that string to an int color which can be used in setBackgroundColor and setTextColorThe 16 means it is hexadecimal and not your regular 0-9. The result should be the same as It\'sI use this and it works great for me for setting any color I want.Set the colors using 0-255 for each red, green and blue then anywhere you want that color used just put MY_COLOR instead of Color.BLUE or Color.RED or any of the other static colors the Color class offers.Just do a Google search for color chart and it you can find a chart with the correct RGB codes using 0-255.Try this:This question comes up for a number of searches related to hex color so I will add a summary here.Hex colors take the form RRGGBB or AARRGGBB (alpha, red, green, blue). In my experience, when using an int directly, you need to use the full AARRGGBB form. If you only have the RRGGBB form then just prefix it with FF to make the alpha (transparency) fully opaque. Here is how you would set it in code. Using 0x at the beginning means it is hexadecimal and not base 10.As others have noted, you can use Color.parseString like soNote that the String must start with a #. Both RRGGBB and AARRGGBB formats are supported.You should actually be getting your colors from XML whenever possible. This is the recommended option because it makes it much easier to make color changes to your app. If you set a lot of hex colors throughout your code then it is a big pain to try to change them later.Android material design has color palates with the hex values already configured. These theme colors are used throughout your app and look like this:colors.xmlIf you need additional colors, a good practice to follow is to define your color in two steps in xml. First name the the hex value color and then name a component of your app that should get a certain color. This makes it easy to adjust the colors later. Again, this is in colors.xml.Then when you want to set the color in code, do the following:The Color class comes with a number of predefined color constants. You can use it like this.Other colors are XML file saved at res/values/colors.xml:This application code retrieves the color resource:This layout XML applies the color to an attribute:Try using 0xFFF000 instead and pass that into the Color.HSVToColor method.If you define a color in your XML and want to use it to change background color or something this API is the one your are looking for:In my sample I used it for TestViewIn Xamarin \nUse this
