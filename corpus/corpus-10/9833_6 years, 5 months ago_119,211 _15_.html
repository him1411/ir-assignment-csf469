I have a multi-module maven project. We intend to version all these modules together. But as of now I am ending up hard-coding version in each of the module pom.xml as belowand the main parent module has the below configurationUse versions:set from the versions-maven plugin:It will adjust all pom versions, parent versions and dependency versions in a multi-module project.If you made a mistake, doafterwards, orif you\'re happy with the results.You may want to look into Maven release plugin\'s release:update-versions goal. It will update the parent\'s version as well as all the modules under it.Update: Please note that the above is the release plugin. If you are not releasing, you may want to use versions:setI encourage you to read the Maven Book about multi-module (reactor) builds. I meant in particular the following:should be changed into. Here take care about the not defined version only in parent part it is defined.This is a better link. versions:update-child-modules sounds like what you\'re looking for.  You could do versions:set as mentioned, but this is a light-weight way to update the parent version numbers.  For the child modules, it\'s my opinion that you should remove the <version> definitions, since they will inherit the parent module\'s version number.The best way is, since you intend to bundle your modules together, you can specify <dependencyMangement> tag in outer most pom.xml (parent module). It controls the version and group name. In your individual module, you just need to specify the <artifactId> tag in your pom.xml. It will take the version from parent file.
