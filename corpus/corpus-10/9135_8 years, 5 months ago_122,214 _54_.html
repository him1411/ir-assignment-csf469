What\'s the (fastest/cleanest/straightforward) way to convert all keys in a hash from strings to symbols in Ruby?This would be handy when parsing YAML.I\'d like to be able to use:Rather than:If you want a one-liner,will copy the hash into a new one with the keys symbolized.Here\'s a better method, if you\'re using Rails:params.symbolize_keysThe end.If you\'re not, just rip off their code (it\'s also in the link):For the specific case of YAML in Ruby, if the keys begin with \':\', they will be automatically interned as symbols.Output:Even more terse:if you\'re using Rails, it is much simpler - you can use a HashWithIndifferentAccess and access the keys both as String and as Symbols:see also:http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/HashWithIndifferentAccess.htmlOr you can use the awesome "Facets of Ruby" Gem, which contains a lot of extensions to Ruby Core and Standard Library classes.see also:\nhttp://rubyworks.github.io/rubyfaux/?doc=http://rubyworks.github.io/facets/docs/facets-2.9.3/core.json#api-class-HashHere\'s a way to deep symbolize an objecthttp://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Hash.html#method-i-symbolize_keysI really like the Mash gem.you can do mash[\'key\'], or mash[:key], or mash.keyA modification to @igorsales answerparams.symbolize_keys will also work. This method turns hash keys into symbols and returns a new hash.This is my one liner for nested hashesSo many answers here, but the one method rails function is hash.symbolize_keysYou could be lazy, and wrap it in a lambda:But this would only work for reading from the hash - not writing.To do that, you could use Hash#mergeThe init block will convert the keys one time on demand, though if you update the value for the string version of the key after accessing the symbol version, the symbol version won\'t be updated.You could also have the init block not update the hash, which would protect you from that kind of error, but you\'d still be vulnerable to the opposite - updating the symbol version wouldn\'t update the string version:So the thing to be careful of with these is switching between the two key forms.  Stick with one.a shorter one-liner fwiw: Would something like the following work?It\'ll copy the hash, but you won\'t care about that most of the time.  There\'s probably a way to do it without copying all the data.How about this:strings = ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript", "Python", "Ruby"]symbols = [ ]strings.each {|x| symbols.push(x.intern)}So this is probably the most straightforward way to convert strings to symbols in your array(s) in Ruby. Make an array of strings then make a new variable and set the variable to an empty array. Then select each element in the first array you created with the ".each" method. Then use a block code to ".push" all of the elements in your new array and use ".intern or .to_sym" to convert all the elements to symbols. Symbols are faster because they save more memory within your code and you can only use them once. Symbols are most commonly used for keys in hash which is great. I\'m the not the best ruby programmer but this form of code helped me a lot.If anyone knows a better way please share and you can use this method for hash too! If you would like vanilla ruby solution and as me do not have access to ActiveSupport here is deep symbolize solution (very similar to previous ones)This is for people who uses mruby and do not have any symbolize_keys method defined:The method:This is not exactly a one-liner, but it turns all string keys into symbols, also the nested ones:I like this one-liner, when I\'m not using Rails, because then I don\'t have to make a second hash and hold two sets of data while I\'m processing it:Hash#delete returns the value of the deleted keyFacets\' Hash#deep_rekey is also a good option, especially:Sample:In case the reason you need to do this is because your data originally came from JSON, you could skip any of this parsing by just passing in the :symbolize_names option upon ingesting JSON.No Rails required and works with Ruby >1.9In ruby I find this to be the most simple and easy to understand way to turn string keys in hashes to symbols : For each key in the hash we call delete on it which removes it from the hash (also delete returns the value associated with the key that was deleted) and we immediately set this equal to the symbolized key.symbolize_keys recursively for any hash:
