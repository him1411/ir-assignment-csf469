This question already has an answer here:How do I initialise a list with 10 times a default value in Python?I\'m searching for a good-looking way to initialize a empty list with a specific range. \nSo make a list that contains 10 zeros or something to be sure that my list has a specific length.If the "default value" you want is immutable, @eduffy\'s suggestion, e.g. [0]*10, is good enough.But if you want, say, a list of ten dicts, do not use [{}]*10 -- that would give you a list with the same initially-empty dict ten times, not ten distinct ones. Rather, use [{} for i in range(10)] or similar constructs, to construct ten separate dicts to make up your list.list multiplication works.In a talk about core containers internals in Python at PyCon 2012, Raymond Hettinger is suggesting to use [None] * n to pre-allocate the length you want.Slides available as PPT or via GoogleThe whole slide deck is quite interesting.\nThe presentation is available on YouTube, but it doesn\'t add much to the slides.
