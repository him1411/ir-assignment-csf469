So I have 3 ports that should be exposed to the machine\'s interface. Is it possible to do this with a Docker container?To expose just one port, this is what you need to do:To expose multiple ports, simply provide multiple -p arguments:In your Dockerfile, you can use the verb EXPOSE to expose multiple ports.\ne.g.You then would like to build an new image based on above Dockerfile.\ne.g.Then you can use the -p to map host port with the container port, as defined in above EXPOSE of Dockerfile.\ne.g.In case you would like to expose a range of continuous ports, you can run docker like this:if you use docker-compose.ymlfile:You can also specify the host/network port
