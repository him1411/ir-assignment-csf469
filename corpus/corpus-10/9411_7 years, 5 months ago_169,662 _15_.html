Same code is placed at the end of the query and procedure to remove index since it is not needed but quarterly.

As mentioned in the comments, the index must already exist for this clause to work without throwing an error.Wrote the below function that allows me to quickly check to see if an index exists; works just like OBJECT_ID.EDIT: This just returns the OBJECT_ID of the table, but it will be NULL if the index doesn\'t exist.
