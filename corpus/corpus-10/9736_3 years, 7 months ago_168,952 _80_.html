A total node noob here. I\'ve been trying to set up a sample node app but the following error keeps popping up every time I try to run:node appI guess you did not have the make tools available when you installed your mongodb library. I suggest you do xcode-select --install (on a mac)\nor sudo apt-get install gcc make build-essential (on ubuntu)and run OR just npm update based on @tobias comment (after installing build-essential)I just resolved that.When you install the mongoose module by npm, it does not have a built bson module in it\'s folder. In the file node_modules/mongoose/node_modules/mongodb/node_modules/bson/ext/index.js, change the linetoand then install the bson module using npm. I have sorted the issue of getting the "Failed to load c++ bson extension" on raspbian(debian for raspberry) by: and then I was unable to solve thisuntil now. First of all you have to have system packages mentioned by Pradeep Mahdevu. Those are:or Then I\'ve installed node-gyplike datadracer said but npm update also suggested by him is risky. It update all modules, which can be dangerous (sometimes API changes between versions). I suggest going into node_modules/mongodb/node_modules/bson directory and from there use That solved the problem for me. A common problem is that node-gyp requires Python 2.x and if your system\'s python points to 3.x, it will fail to compile bson, without warning. You can fix this by setting a python global key in your npm config that points to the 2.x executable on your system. For example, on Arch Linux:On WIN 8.1It seems I used a wrong version of mongoose in my package.json file.I removed the line "mongoose" : "^3.8.15" from package.jsonCLI:\nnpm install mongoose --saveNow it says "mongoose": "^4.0.6" in package.json and the error I had is gone.I\'m running Ubuntu 14.04 and to fix it for me I had to create a symlink for node to point to nodejs as described here:nodejs vs node on ubuntu 12.04Once I did that I re-ran these commands:just wanted to say I also had the error But with none of the other errors. I tried everything and turns out the mongodb drivers that I was specifying in the package.json file was incompatible with my version of MongoDB. I changed it to my latest version which was (1.4.34) and it worked!!!So in my case, I first tried to check under this directory /node_modules/mongoose/node_modules/, just to confirm that I have the bson module.\nI figured out that I did not have it in the first place, then I just run and then All got sorted.Tried and tested in Ubuntu.sudo npm rebuild was what fixed it for me.I finally corrected this error by updating  my mongodb dependency version to"~2.0.36" in package.json.Unfortunately, All the above answers are only half right..\nTook a long time to figure this out..Mongoose bson install via npm throws warning and causes the error...This works like magic!!The bson extension message is just a warning, I get it all the time in my nodejs application. Things to check:For me it only take to run these commands in my api directory:I just ran:andand all become ok.I also got this problem and it caused my sessions not to work. But not to break either...I used a mongoose connection.I had this:Very straightforward. But req.session stayed always empty.Did the trick. Watch out you dont have a \'mongodb\' in your package.json! Just Mongoose and connect-mongo.I fixed this problem on CentOS byI had the same problem on my EC2 instance.  I think the initial cause was because I had a Node instance running when I installed Mongo.  I stopped the Node service and then raninside of the top level folder of my node project.  This fixed the problem and everything was just like newHere\'s how I fixed the problem on Ubuntu:Inspired by @mbochynski answer, but I had to create a symbolic link first, otherwise the rebuild failed.I fixed it changing line 10 of /node_modules/mongoose/node_modules/mongodb/node_modules/bson/ext/index.js from:to:i was having same trouble tried so many options but in the last npm intall in my mean app folder worked.I had this problem because I was including the node_modules folder in my Git repository. When I rebuilt the node_modules on the other system it worked. One of them was running Linux, the other OS X. Maybe they had different processor architectures as well.If the bson extension wasn\'t the reason, I guessed the other reason for "failed to connect" would be the user id\'s. So I created a new database and added a user for the database, with a password for that user (note: not mongolab account password).\nI updated those on my code and voila! It worked. Duh right? :DI also encountered the same problem and I\'m a Mac OSX user. Basically, you need to make sure you have installed the Xcode and also the "Command Line Tools" within the Xcode. Xcode is free and can be downloaded over here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/After you have installed the Xcode, open it and click "Preference" in the pull down menu, and click the "Downloads" icon. Make sure you have the "Command Line Tools" installed.Then run the following commands like all the other users mentioned above:I was trying to run node on virtual machine (vagrant) shared folder. That was a problem. My host machine is Windows, installed node on Windows and worked like a charm. So if you are using virtual machine, just try to run node server on host machine.I just had the same problem and literally nothing worked for me. The error was showing kerberos is causing the problem and it was one of the mongoose dependencies. Since I\'m on Ubuntu, I thought there might be permission issues somewhere between the globally installed packages -- in /usr/lib/node_modules via sudo, and those which are on the user space.I installed mongoose globally -- with sudo of course, and everything began working as expected.P.S. The kerberos package now also is installed globally next to mongoose, however I can\'t remember if I did it deliberately -- while I was trying to solve the problem, or if it was there from the beginning.I\'m working on Docker with centOS 7, and encountered the same problem.after looking around, and make several tries, I fixed this problem by installing mongodb, and mongodb-serverI don\'t think this is the best way to produce the minimal container. but I can limit the scope into the following packagesFor Windows 7.1, these directions helped me to fix my build environment:https://github.com/mongodb/js-bson/issues/58#issuecomment-68217275http://christiankvalheim.com/post/diagnose_installation_problems/I was able to resolve by uninstalling and reinstalling monk package. \nInitial install seemingly had a corrupt mongodb/bson dependency.on ubuntu 14.04 I needed to create a link in /usr/bin because /usr/bin/env was looking for /usr/bin/nodeln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/nodeThe error messages can be found in the builderror.log in each directory so for the message:bson@0.2.21 install /usr/local/lib/node_modules/mongodb/node_modules/mongodb-core/node_modules/bson\n  (node-gyp rebuild 2> builderror.log) || (exit 0)look at this file for more information about the exact problem/usr/local/lib/node_modules/mongodb/node_modules/mongodb-core/node_modules/bson/builderror.log
