I\'ve got some code that resizes an image so I can get a scaled chunk of the center of the image - I use this to take a UIImage and return a small, square representation of an image, similar to what\'s seen in the album view of the Photos app. (I know I could use a UIImageView and adjust the crop mode to achieve the same results, but these images are sometimes displayed in UIWebViews).I\'ve started to notice some crashes in this code and I\'m a bit stumped. I\'ve got two different theories and I\'m wondering if either is on-base.Theory 1) I achieve the cropping by drawing into an offscreen image context of my target size. Since I want the center portion of the image, I set the CGRect argument passed to drawInRect to something that\'s larger than the bounds of my image context. I was hoping this was Kosher, but am I instead attempting to draw over other memory that I shouldn\'t be touching?Theory 2) I\'m doing all of this in a background thread. I know there are portions of UIKit that are restricted to the main thread. I was assuming / hoping that drawing to an offscreen view wasn\'t one of these. Am I wrong?(Oh, how I miss NSImage\'s drawInRect:fromRect:operation:fraction: method.)Update 2014-05-28: I wrote this when iOS 3 or so was the hot new thing, I\'m certain there are better ways to do this by now, possibly built-in. As many people have mentioned, this method doesn\'t take rotation into account; read some additional answers and spread some upvote love around to keep the responses to this question helpful for everyone.Original response:I\'m going to copy/paste my response to the same question elsewhere:There isn\'t a simple class method to do this, but there is a function that you can use to get the desired results: CGImageCreateWithImageInRect(CGImageRef, CGRect) will help you out.Here\'s a short example using it:To crop retina images while keeping the same scale and orientation, use the following method in a UIImage category (iOS 4.0 and above):You can make a UIImage category and use it wherever you need. Based on HitScans response and comments bellow it. You can use it this way:Here is my UIImage crop implementation which obeys the imageOrientation property. All orientations were thoroughly tested.with help of this bridge function CGRectMake -> CGRect (credits to this answer answered by @rob mayoff):The usage is:Output:Heads up: all these answers assume a CGImage-backed image object.image.CGImage can return nil, if the UIImage is backed by a CIImage, which would be the case if you created this image using a CIFilter. In that case, you might have to draw the image in a new context, and return that image (slow).None of the answers here handle all of the scale and rotation issues 100% correctly. Here\'s a synthesis of everything said so far, up-to-date as of iOS7/8. It\'s meant to be included as a method in a category on UIImage.Most of the responses I\'ve seen only deals with a position of (0, 0) for (x, y). Ok that\'s one case but I\'d like my cropping operation to be centered. What took me a while to figure out is the line following the WTF comment.Let\'s take the case of an image captured with a portrait orientation:Hope it makes sense! If it does not, try different values you\'ll see that the logic is inverted when it comes to choosing the right x, y, width, and height for your cropRect.Swift ExtensionBest solution for cropping an UIImage in Swift, in term of precision, pixels scaling ...:Instructions used to call this function:Note: the initial source code inspiration written in Objective-C has been found on "Cocoanetics" blog.Looks a little bit strange but works great and takes into consideration image orientation:On iOS9.2SDK ,I use below method to convert frame from UIView to  UIImage Swift 2.0 Update (CIImage compatibility)Expanding off of Maxim\'s Answer but works if your image is CIImage based, as well.Here\'s an updated Swift 3 version based on Noodles answerI wasn\'t satisfied with other solutions because they either draw several time (using more power than necessary) or have problems with orientation. Here is what I used for a scaled square croppedImage from a UIImage * image.I use the method below.}Look at https://github.com/vvbogdan/BVCropPhotoFollow Answer of @Arne.\nI Just fixing to Category function. put it in Category of UIImage.
