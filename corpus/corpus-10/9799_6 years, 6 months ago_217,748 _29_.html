Example: I have a number and I want to print it in binary. I dont want to do it by writing an algorithm, rather I want to use a built-in function.Assuming you mean "built-in":See Integer documentation.(Long has a similar method, BigInteger has an instance method where you can specify the radix.)Here no need to depend only on binary or any other format... one flexible built in function is available That prints whichever format you want in your program.. Integer.toString(int,representation);I needed something to print things out nicely and separate the bits every n-bit. In other words display the leading zeros and show something like this:So here\'s what I wrote:Invoke it like this:Old school:check out this logic can convert a number to any baseORThis is the simplest way of printing the internal binary representation of an integer.\nFor Example: If we take n as 17 then the output will be: 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001 0001The question is tricky in java (and probably also in other language).A Integer is a 32-bit signed data type, but Integer.toBinaryString() returns a string representation of the integer argument as an unsigned integer in base 2.So, Integer.parseInt(Integer.toBinaryString(X),2) can generate an exception (signed vs. unsigned).The safe way is to use Integer.toString(X,2); this will generate something less elegant:-11110100110But it works!!!I think it\'s the simplest algorithm so far (for those who don\'t want to use built-in functions):Example: convertNumber(1) --> "0b1"convertNumber(5) --> "0b101"convertNumber(117) --> "0b1110101"How it works: while-loop moves a-number to the right (replacing the last bit with second-to-last, etc), gets the last bit\'s value and puts it in StringBuilder, repeats until there are no bits left  (that\'s when a=0).Try this way:}10010100There are already good answers posted here for this question. But, this is the way I\'ve tried myself (and might be the easiest logic based \xe2\x86\x92 modulo/divide/add):It works with signed and unsigned values used powerful bit manipulation and generates the first zeroes on the left.
