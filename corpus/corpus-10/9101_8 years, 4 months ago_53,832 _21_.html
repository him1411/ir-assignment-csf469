This is a silly question, but you can use this code to check if something is a particular type...Is there a more elegant way to check for the "NOT" instance?Yes, yes... silly question....Because there is some question on what the code looks like, it\'s just a simple return at the start of a method.is the only operator to go (there\'s no IsNot operator).You can build an extension method that does it:and then use it to:And you could follow on your theme:Since you\'re actually casting the value afterward, you could just use as instead:You can do it this way:Why not just use the else ?Its neat it familiar and simple ?The way you have it is fine but you could create a set of extension methods to make "a more elegant way to check for the \'NOT\' instance."Then you could write:Enjoy,\nRobert C. CartainoUgly? I disagree. The only other way (I personally think this is "uglier"):The is operator evaluates to a boolean result, so you can do anything you would otherwise be able to do on a bool. To negate it use the ! operator. Why would you want to have a  different operator just for this?While the IS operator is normally the best way, there is an alternative that you can use in some cirumstances.  You can use the as operator and test for null.The extension method IsNot<T> is a nice way to extend the syntax. Keep in mindperforms better than doing something likeIn your case, it doesn\'t matter as you are returning from the method. In other words, be careful to not do both the check for type and then the type conversion immediately after.
