It is possible to install NumPy with pip using pip install numpy. Is there a similar possibility with SciPy? (Doing pip install scipy does not work.)UpdateThe package SciPy is now available to be installed with pip!An attempt to easy_install indicates a problem with their listing in the Python Package Index, which pip searches.All is not lost, however; pip can install from Subversion (SVN), Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar repositories. SciPy uses SVN:Update (12-2012):Since NumPy is a dependency, it should be installed as well.Prerequisite:Actual packages:Optional packages:srcIn Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid), I could successfully pip install scipy (within a virtualenv) after installing some of its dependencies, in particular:To install scipy  on windows  follow these instructions:-Step-1 : Press this link http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scipy to download a scipy .whl file (e.g. scipy-0.17.0-cp34-none-win_amd64.whl).Step-2: Go to the directory where that download file is there from the command prompt (cd folder-name ).Step-3: Run this command:I tried all the above and nothing worked for me. This solved all my problems:Note that the -U option to pip install requests that the package be upgraded. Without it, if the package is already installed pip will inform you of this and exit without doing anything.If I first install BLAS, LAPACK and GCC Fortran as system packages (I\'m using Arch Linux), I can get SciPy installed with:On Fedora, this works:If you get any public key errors while downloading, add --nogpgcheck as parameter to yum, for example:\nyum --nogpgcheck install blas-develOn Fedora 23 onwards, use dnf instead of yum.For the Arch Linux users:pip install --user scipy prerequisites the following Arch packages to be installed:Addon for Ubuntu (UbuntuÂ 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx)):The repository moved, but afailed for me... With the following steps, it finally worked out (as root in a virtual environment, where python3 is a link to Python 3.2.2):\ninstall the Ubuntu dependencies (see elaichi), clone NumPy and SciPy:Build NumPy (within the numpy folder):Install SciPy (within the scipy folder):In my case, it wasn\'t working until I also installed the following package : libatlas-base-dev, gfortranThen run pip install scipyBesides all of these answers,\nIf you install python of 32bit on your 64bit machine, you have to download scipy of 32-bit irrespective of your machine.\nhttp://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/\nIn the above URL you can download the packages and command is: pip install The answer is yes, there is.First you can easily install numpy use commands:Then you should install mkl, which is required by Scipy, and you can download it hereAfter download the file_name.whl you install it Then at the same website you can download scipy-0.18.1-cp35-cp35m-win32.whlNote:You should download the file_name.whl according to you python version, if you python version is 32bit python3.5 you should download this one, and the "win32" is about your python version, not your operating system version.Then install file_name.whl like this:Then there is only one more thing to do: comment out a specfic line or there will be error messages when you imput command "import scipy".So comment out this linein this file: your_own_path\\lib\\site-packages\\scipy__init__.pyThen you can use SciPy :)Here tells you more about the last step.Here is a similar anwser to a similar question.For gentoo, it\'s in the main repository:\nemerge --ask scipy
