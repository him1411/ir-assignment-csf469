Can anyone tell me the difference between break and continue statements?break leaves a loop, continue jumps to the next iteration.See Branching Statements for more details and code samples: The break statement has two forms: labeled and unlabeled. You saw the\n  unlabeled form in the previous discussion of the switch statement. You\n  can also use an unlabeled break to terminate a for, while, or do-while\n  loop [...]An unlabeled break statement terminates the innermost switch, for,\n  while, or do-while statement, but a labeled break terminates an outer\n  statement.The continue statement skips the current iteration of a for, while ,\n  or do-while loop. The unlabeled form skips to the end of the innermost\n  loop\'s body and evaluates the boolean expression that controls the\n  loop. [...]A labeled continue statement skips the current iteration of an outer loop marked with the given label.This will lead to following output:You can label a block, not only a for-loop, and then break/continue from a nested block to an outer one. In few cases this might be useful, but in general you\'ll try to avoid such code, except the logic of the program is much better to understand than in the following example:Because it\'s possible, it doesn\'t mean you should use it. If you want to obfuscate your code in a funny way, you don\'t choose a meanigful name, but http: and follow it with a comment, which looks alien, like a webadress in the source-code:I guess this is from a Joshua Bloch quizzle. :) Break leaves the loop completely and executes the statements after the loop. \nWhereas Continue leaves the current iteration and executes with the next value in the loop. This Code Explains Everything :Output:break completely exits the loop. continue skips the statements after the continue statement and keeps looping.Excellent answer simple and accurate.I would add a code sample.A break statement results in the termination of the statement to which it applies (switch, for, do, or while).A continue statement is used to end the current loop iteration and return control to the loop statement.continue skips the current executing loop and MOVES TO the next loop whereas break MOVES OUT of the loop and executes the next statement after the loop.\nI learned the difference using the following code. Check out the different outputs.Hope this helps.Consider the following:break causes the loop to terminate and the value of n is 0.continue causes the program counter to return to the first line of the loop (the condition is checked and the value of n is increment) and the final value of n is 10.It should also be noted that break only terminates the execution of the loop it is within:Will output something to the effect ofThe break statement breaks out of the loop (the next statement to be executed is the first one after the closing brace), while continue starts the loop over at the next iteration.The break statement exists the current looping control structure and jumps behind it while the continue exits too but jumping back to the looping condition.here\'s the semantic of break:here\'s the semantic of continue:First,i think you should know that there are two types of break and continue in Java which are labeled break,unlabeled break,labeled continue and unlabeled continue.Now, i will talk about the difference between them.An unlabeled break statement terminates the innermost switch ,for ,while ,do-while statement.A labeled break terminates an outer statement.if you javac and java this demo,you will get:An unlabeled continue statement skips the current iteration of a for,while,do-while statement.A labeled continue statement skips the current iteration of an outer loop marked with the given lable,if you javac and java the demo,you will get:if you have any question , you can see the Java tutorial of this:enter link description hereSimple Example:break leaves the loop.continue will go back to start loop.Simply put: break will terminate the current loop, and continue execution at the first line after the loop ends.  continue jumps back to the loop condition and keeps running the loop.try this code in netbeans you\'ll understand the different between break and continueSimple program to understand difference between continue and breakWhen continue is usedWhen break is usedso you are inside a for or while loop. Using break; will put you outside of the loop. As in, it will end. Continue; will tell it to run the next iteration. No point in using continue in if statement, but break; is useful. \nIn switch...case, always use break; to end a case, so it does not executes another case.
