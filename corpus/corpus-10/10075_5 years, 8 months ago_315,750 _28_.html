What is the simplest way to create an <a> tag that links to the previous web page? Basically a simulated back button, but an actual hyperlink. Client-side technologies only, please.Edit\nLooking for solutions that have the benefit of showing the URL of the page you\'re about to click on when hovering, like a normal, static hyperlink. I\'d rather not have the user looking at history.go(-1) when hovering on a hyperlink. Best I\'ve found so far is:Is document.referrer reliable? Cross-browser safe? I\'ll be happy to accept a better answer.And another way:This solution has the benefit of showing the URL of the linked-to page on hover, as most browsers do by default, instead of history.go(-1) or similar:The easiest way is to use history.go(-1);Try this:you can try javascriptrefer JavaScript\nBack ButtonEDITto display url of  refer http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/crossmenu2.shtmland send the element a itself in onmouseover as followcheck jsfiddleA back link is a link that moves the browser backwards one page, as if the user had clicked the Back button available in most browsers. Back links use JavaScript. It moves the browser back one page if your browser supports JavaScript (which it does) and if it supports the window.history object, which is necessary for back links.Simple ways areOR:Generally speaking a back link isn\'t necessary\xe2\x80\xa6 the Back button usually suffices quite nicely, and usually you can also simply link to the previous page in your site. However, sometimes you might want to provide a link back to one of several "previous" pages, and that\'s where a back link comes in handy. So I refer you below tutorial if you want to do in more advanced way:http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/linking/linking_famsupp_108.htmltry thisThis solution gives you the best of both worldsMore details in the code comments below.You can also use history.back() alongside document.write() to show link only when there is actually somewhere to go back to:
