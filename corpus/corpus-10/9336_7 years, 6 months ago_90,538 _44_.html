I\'ve always used single quotes when writing my HTML by hand. I work with a lot of rendered HTML which always uses double quotes. This allows me to determine if the HTML was written by hand or generated. Is this a good idea?What is the difference between the two? I know they both work and are supported by all modern browsers but is there a real difference where one is actually better than the other in different situations?The w3 org said:By default, SGML requires that all attribute values be delimited using either double quotation marks (ASCII decimal 34) or single quotation marks (ASCII decimal 39). Single quote marks can be included within the attribute value when the value is delimited by double quote marks, and vice versa. Authors may also use numeric character references to represent double quotes (&#34;) and single quotes (&#39;). For double quotes authors can also use the character entity reference &quot;.So... seems to be no difference. Only depends on your style.I use " as a top-tier and \' as a second tier, as I imagine most people do. For exampleIn that example, you must use both, it is unavoidable.In HTML the use of single quotes (\') and double quotes (") are interchangeable, there is no difference.But consistency is recommended, therefore we must pick a syntax convention and use it regularly.Web Development often consists of many programming languages. HTML, JS, CSS, PHP, ASP, RoR, Python, ect. Because of this we have many syntax conventions for different programing languages. Often habbits from one language will follow us to other languages, even if it is not considered "proper" i.e. commenting conventions. Quoting conventions also falls into this category for me.But I tend to use HTML tightly in conjunction with PHP. And in PHP there is a major difference between single quotes and double quotes. In PHP with double quotes "you can insert variables directly within the text of the string". (scriptingok.com) And when using single quotes "the text appears as it is". (scriptingok.com)PHP takes longer to process double quoted strings. Since the PHP parser has to read the whole string in advance to detect any variable inside\xe2\x80\x94and concatenate it\xe2\x80\x94it takes longer to process than a single quoted string. (scriptingok.com)Â Single quotes are easier on the server. Since PHP does not need to read the whole string in advance, the server can work faster and happier. (scriptingok.com)Other things to considerWith this understanding of PHP I have set the convention (for myself and the rest of my company) that strings are to be represented as single quotes by default for server optimization. Double quotes are used within the string if a quotes are required such as JavaScript within an attribute, for example:<button onClick=\'func("param");\'>Press Me</button>Of course if we are in PHP and want the parser to handle PHP variables within the string we should intentionally use double quotes. $a=\'Awesome\'; $b = "Not $a";Single quotes vs Double quotes in PHP. (n.d.). Retrieved November 26, 2014, from http://www.scriptingok.com/tutorial/Single-quotes-vs-double-quotes-in-PHPIf it\'s all the same, perhaps using single-quotes is better since it doesn\'t require holding down the shift key. Fewer keystrokes == less chance of RSI.In HTML I don\'t believe it matters whether you use " or \', but it should be used consistently throughout the document.My own usage prefers that attributes/html use ", whereas all javascript uses \' instead.This makes it slightly easier, for me, to read and check. If your use makes more sense for you than mine would, there\'s no need for change. But, to me, your code would feel messy. It\'s personal is all.Actually, the best way is the way Google recommends. Double quotes:\nhttps://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.xml?showone=HTML_Quotation_Marks#HTML_Quotation_MarksSee https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.xml?showone=HTML_Validity#HTML_Validity\nQuoted Advice from Google: "Using valid HTML is a measurable baseline quality attribute that contributes to learning about technical requirements and constraints, and that ensures proper HTML usage."I know LOTS of people wouldn\'t agree, but this is what I do and I really enjoy such a coding style: I actually don\'t use any quote in HTML unless it is absolutely necessary.Example:Double quotes are used only when there are spaces in the attribute values or whatever:I have had an issue using Bootstrap where using double quotes did matter vs using single quote (which didn\'t work). class=\'row-fluid\' gave me issues causing the last span to fall below the other spans rather than sitting nicely beside on the far right, whereas class="row-fluid" worked.Using double quotes for HTMLi.e.Using single quotes for JavaScripti.e.if you are writing asp.net then occasionally you have to use double quotes in Eval statements and single quotes for delimiting the values - this is mainly so that the C# inline code knows its using a string in the eval container rather than a character.  Personally I\'d only use one or the other as a standard and not mix them, it looks messy thats all.Using " instead of \' when:Using \' instead of " when:In PHP using double quotes causes a slight decrease in performance because variable names are evaluated, so in practice, I always use single quotes when writing code:So you can write this instead;I believe Javascript functions similarly, so a very tiny improvement in performance, if that matters to you.Additionally, if you look all the way down to HTML spec 2.0, all the tags listed here;W3 HTML DTD Reference(Use doublequotes.) Consistency is important no matter which you tend to use more often.Double quotes are used for strings (i.e., "this is a string") and single quotes are used for a character (i.e., \'a\', \'b\' or \'c\').  Depending on the programming language and context, you can get away with using double quotes for a character but not single quotes for a string.HTML doesn\'t care about which one you use.  However, if you\'re writing HTML inside a PHP script, you should stick with double quotes as you will need to escape them (i.e., \\"whatever\\") to avoid confusing yourself and PHP.
