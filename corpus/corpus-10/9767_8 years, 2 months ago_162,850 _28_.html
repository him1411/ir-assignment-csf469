Is there anyway I can achieve this?\nNote, that in VB.NET there is no problem use the first snippet it works just great, VB is flexible, im unable to get used to C#\'s strictness!!!With EF v4 you can use SqlFunctions.StringConvert.  There is no overload for int so you need to cast to a double or a decimal.  Your code ends up looking like this:I solved a similar problem by placing the conversion of the integer to string out of the query. This can be achieved by putting the query into an object. Use LinqToObject :  contacts.AsEnumerable()SqlFunctions.StringConvert will work, but I find it cumbersome, and most of the time, I don\'t have a real need to perform the string conversion on the SQL side.What I do if I want to do string manipulations is perform the query in linq-to-entities first, then manipulate the stings in linq-to-objects. In this example, I want to obtain a set of data containing a Contact\'s fullname, and ContactLocationKey, which is the string concatination of two Integer columns (ContactID and LocationID).Now, I grant that it does get cumbersome to have to write two anonymous selects, but I would argue that is outweighed by the convenience of which you can perform string (and other) functions not supported in L2E. Also keep in mind that there is probably a performance penalty using this method.Firstly, convert to object, then toString() will be correct.I ran into this same problem when I was converting my MVC 2 app to MVC 3 and just to give another (clean) solution to this problem I want to post what I did...GetProducers() simply returns an entity collection of Producers. \nP.S. The SqlFunctions.StringConvert didn\'t work for me.If your "contact" is acting as generic list, I hope the following code works well.Thanks.Brian Cauthon\'s answer is excellent! Just a little update, for EF 6, the class got moved to another namespace. So, before EF 6, you should include: If you update to EF 6, or simply are using this version, include:By including the incorrect namespace with EF6, the code will compile just fine but will throw a runtime error.  I hope this note helps to avoid some confusion. Using MySql, the SqlFunctions.StringConvert didn\'t work for me.  Since I use SelectListItem in 20+ places in my project, I wanted a solution that work without contorting the 20+ LINQ statements.  My solution was to sub-class SelectedListItem in order to provide an integer setter, which moves type conversion away from LINQ.  Obviously, this solution is difficult to generalize, but was quite helpful for my specific project.To use, create the following type and use in your LINQ query in place of SelectedListItem and use IntValue in place of Value.One more solution:Just add empty string and it will be converted to string.The simplest way:if you use entity framework and you want to make the only int acceptable then you can use this in linq query you can try this this worked for me in my project i think it would be helpful for youMy understanding is that you have to create a partial class  to "extend" your model and add a property that is readonly that can utilize the rest of the class\'s properties.ThenI found that SqlFunctions.StringConvert((double)c.Age) did not work for me either the field is of type Nullable<Int32>Took me a lot of searching over the last few days of trial and error to find this.I hope this helps a few coders out there.Can you try:
