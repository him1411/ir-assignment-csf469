Possible Duplicate:\n  Is there any way to hover over one element and effect a different element? When I hover over a div or class with an id of "a", can I get the background color of a div or class with the id of "b" to change?  Yes, you can do that, but only if #b is after #a in the HTML.If #b comes immediately after #a: http://jsfiddle.net/u7tYE/That\'s using the adjacent sibling combinator (+).If there are other elements between #a and #b, you can use this: http://jsfiddle.net/u7tYE/1/That\'s using the general sibling combinator (~).Both + and ~ work in all modern browsers and IE7+If #b is a descendant of #a, you can simply use #a:hover #b.ALTERNATIVE: You can use pure CSS to do this by positioning the second element before the first. The first div is first in markup, but positioned to the right or below the second. It will work as if it were a previous sibling. This can not be done purely with css. This is a behaviour, which affects the styling of the page.With jquery you can quickly implement the behavior from your question:The following example is based on jQuery but it can be achieved using any JS tool kit or even plain old JSA pure solution without jQuery:JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/YShs2/
