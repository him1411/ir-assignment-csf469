I\'m using git-svn to work against my company\'s central svn repository. We\'ve recently created a new feature branch in the central repo. How do I tell git about it? When I run git branch -r I can only see the branches that existed when I ran fetch against the svn repo to initialize my git repo?You can manually add the remote branch,If you want to track ALL the remote svn branches, then the solution is as simple as:This will fetch ALL the remote branches that have not been fetched yet. Extra tip: if you checked out only the trunk at first, and later you want to track ALL branches, then edit .git/config to look like this and re-run git svn fetch:The key points are url should point to the repository root, and the paths defined in fetch and branches should be relative to url. If you want to fetch only specific branches instead of ALL, there is a nice example in git svn --help:With older versions of git-svn, once you specified branches like this, you might not be able to get new branches with git svn fetch. One workaround is adding more fetch lines, like this:Another workaround by @AndyEstes: edit .git/svn/.metadata and change the value of branches-maxRev or tags-maxRev to a revision before any newly-specified branches or tags were created. Once you\'ve done this, run git svn fetch to track the new svn remote branch.It appears I just needed to git svn fetch; somehow I had convinced myself that would fetch the entire repo instead of just the changes.Maybe I messed it up somehow but I followed the instructions in vjangus\' answer and it almost worked. The only problem was that newbranch didn\'t appear to be branched from the trunk. In gitk, it was kind of "floating" all on its own; it had no common ancestor with the trunk.The solution to this was:I recommend keeping gitk --all open the whole time and refreshing it often to keep track of what you\'re doing. I\'m still sort of new to git and git svn so please suggest improvements to this method.I have not found any documentation about this feature, but looks like git svn configuration supports multiple fetch entries. This way you can also add branches separately without need to add another remote svn repository entry to your config nor using wildcards to get all branches of certain directory.Assume that your SVN tree is really nasty having lots of branches without any logic how they are located, e.g. having branches and sub-directories containing more branched.i.e. and you just want to hand pick some of the branches to be included to your git repository.You may first init your repository with only trunk without any additional branches:After that you should see following configuration:when ever you want to fetch new branch from MyRepo you can just add new fetch entries to configuration by:Or you may edit the same configuration in .git/configTo fetch the new branches after adding them to config just run:[Edit] Sometimes it seems to be necessary to run fetch with --all parameter to fetch newly added branches:Instead of dealing with the git-svn quirks you may try SubGit.One has to install SubGit into Subversion repository. After that one can use standard git workflow instead of using special git-svn commands:Pushing new commits:git-svn:SubGit:Fetching incoming changesgit-svn:SubGit:Creating a new branch:git-svn:SubGit:See SubGit documentation for more details.A simplification of vjangus\' answer:If you\'re using the standard layout in SVN and have done the usual svn init, git-svn will do the config stuff for you. Just:An example. SVN url is svn+ssh://gil@svn.myplace.com/repo. SVN branch I\'m looking for is newbranch. Local git branch (tracking remote newbranch) will be git-newbranch.Step 1: find the branch-copy revisionSo the branch point in SVN is revision 7802.Step 2: Fetch the revisiongit-svn did all the work and now knows about the remote:Step 3: Create your new local branch tracking the remote one:To add to vjangus\' answer, which helped me, I also found it useful to add use git grafts to tie the branches to the trunk at the appropriate point - allowing git to see the history and perform merges correctly.This is simply a case of adding a line to .git/info/grafts with the hashes:eg.Credit to http://evan-tech.livejournal.com/255341.html(I\'d add this as a comment, but I\'ve not enough reputation.)If you don\'t check out with a valid layout, you won\'t be able to checkout a remote branch. This is what I do:After that, you can switch to a remote branch:Then you will automatically be switched to your branch.
