I found myself amending my commits quite often. I don\'t stash so much because I tend to forget I did so, especially when I want to save what I did before I leave or before a weekend, so I do a "draft" commit. Only thing is, when I amend the commit, it is still set to the original author date. Is there a (simple) way to update it when amending?You can change the author date with the --date parameter to git commit.  So, if you want to amend the last commit, and update its author date to the current date and time, you can do:(The -R parameter to date tells it to output the date in RFC 2822 format.  This is one of the date formats understood by git commit.)Another way to do this isThis does change the commit author as well as the date - but if it was originally your unpushed commit then that\'s a no-op.You can also add --no-edit if you want to update the date on multiple commits but you want the commit messages to stay untouched. This way you will not be prompted to edit the message for each commit.git commit --amend --date=now(git version 2.7.0)I like Mark\'s answer and used it myself several times, but now I\'m on OS X and date -R is not supported. But everything is much easier than original answer made us think, just use empty string!
