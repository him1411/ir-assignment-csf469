How can I check if any of the strings in an array exists in another string?Like:That code doesn\'t work, it\'s just to show what I want to achieve.You can use any:Similarly to check if all the strings from the list are found, use all instead of any.You should be careful if the strings in a or str gets longer. The straightforward solutions take O(S*(A^2)), where S is the length of str and A is the sum of the lenghts of all strings in a. For a faster solution, look at Aho-Corasick algorithm for string matching, which runs in linear time O(S+A).any() is by far the best approach if all you want is True or False, but if you want to know specifically which string/strings match, you can use a couple things.If you want the first match (with False as a default):If you want to get all matches (including duplicates):If you want to get all non-duplicate matches (disregarding order):If you want to get all non-duplicate matches in the right order:You need to iterate on the elements of a.Just to add some diversity with regex:or if your list is too long - any(re.findall(r\'|\'.join(a), str, re.IGNORECASE))It depends on the  context \nsuppose if you want to check single literal like(any single word a,e,w,..etc) in is enoughif you want to check any of the character among the original_word:\nmake use of if you want all the input you want in that  original_word,make use of all\nsimplejbernadas already mentioned the Aho-Corasick-Algorithm in order to reduce complexity.Here is one way to use it in Python:Download aho_corasick.py from herePut it in the same directory as your main Python file and name it aho_corasick.pyTry the alrorithm with the following code:Note that the search is case-sensitive
