I\'m aware of questions like this, where people tend to discuss the general Symfony 2 concept of bundle.The thing is, in a specific application, like, for instance, a twitter-like application, should everything really be inside a generic bundle, like the official docs say? The reason I\'m asking this is because when we develop applications, in general, we don\'t want to highly couple our code to some full-stack glue framework.If I develop a Symfony 2 based application and, at some point, I decide Symfony 2 is not really the best choice to keep the development going, will that be a problem for me?So the general question is: why is everything being a bundle a good thing? EDIT#1Almost a year now since I asked this question I wrote an article to share my knowledge on this topic.I\'ve written a more thorough and updated blog post on this topic: http://elnur.pro/symfony-without-bundles/No, not everything has to be in a bundle. You could have a structure like this:This way, you would put in the AppBundle only that stuff that is really Symfony2 specific. If you decide to switch to another framework later, you would get rid of the Bundle namespace and replace it with the chosen framework stuff.Please note that what I\'m suggesting here is for app specific code. For reusable bundles, I still suggest using the best practices.To keep entities in src/Vendor/Model outside of any bundle, I\'ve changed the doctrine section in config.yml fromtoEntities\'s names \xe2\x80\x94 to access from Doctrine repositories \xe2\x80\x94 begin with Model in this case, for example, Model:User.You can use subnamespaces to group related entities together, for example, src/Vendor/User/Group.php. In this case, the entity\'s name is Model:User\\Group.First, you need to tell JMSDiExtraBundle to scan the src folder for services by adding this to config.yml:Then you define controllers as services and put them under the Controller namespace:Note that I\'m using my ElnurAbstractControllerBundle to simplify defining controllers as services.The last thing left is to tell Symfony to look for templates without bundles. I do this by overriding the template guesser service, but since the approach is different between Symfony 2.0 and 2.1, I\'m providing versions for both of them.I\'ve created a bundle that does that for you.First, define the class:And then tell Symfony to use it by adding this to config.yml:Now, you can use templates out of bundles. Keep them under the app/Resources/views folder. For example, templates for those two actions from the example controller above are located in:When referring to a template, just omit the bundle part:Of course you can decouple your application. Just develop it as a library and integrate it into symfony vendor/-folder (either by using the deps or composer.json, depending wether you use Symfony2.0 or Symfony2.1). However, you need at least one bundle, that acts as the "frontend" of your library, where Symfony2 finds the controller (and such).A usual symfony distribution can work without any extra (application) bundle, depending on how much functionalities you want to use from the full stack framework.For example, your controllers can be any callable that can be put anywhere in your project structure, as soon as they are autoloaded.In a routing definition file, you can use:It can be any plain old php object, only tied to the framework by the fact it has to return a Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\Response object.Your twig templates (or others) can be put like app/Resources/views/template.html.twig and can be rendered using the ::template.html.twig logical name.All DI services can be defined in app/config/config.yml (or imported from app/config/services.yml for example, and all service classes can be any plain old php objects too. not tied to the framework at all.All of this is provided by default by the symfony full stack framework.Where you will have problems is when you will want to use translation files (like xliff), because they are discovered through bundles only.The symfony-light distribution aims to solve these kind of problems by discovering everything that would be usually discovered only through bundles.You could use KnpRadBundle, which tries to simplify the project structure.Another approach is to use src/Company/Bundle/FrontendBundle for example for the bundles and src/Company/Stuff/Class.php for the classes that are symfony independent and that could be reused outside of the frameworkSince it\'s 5 years already passed, here are few more articles about Symfony Bundles.TLDR:Do you need multiple bundles in your application directly? Most likely\n  not. You\'re better off writing an AppBundle to prevent a spaghetti of\n  dependencies. You can simply follow the best practices and it will\n  work fine.TLDR:Create only one bundle called AppBundle for your application logic.\n  One AppBundle - but please do not put your application logic in there!Symfony framework is very good for quickly launch a proof of concept and all the code can enter within the default bundle application in src/In this bundle you can structure your code as you want.After if you want to use other technology for develop your POC you can easily translate that because you don\'t structure all your code in bundle conception.For all of concept you don\'t extremismed this. Bundle is good but bundle everything and everyday is not good.Perhaps you can use a Silex (Symfony micro framework) for develop your Proof of Concept for reduce impact of bundle third-party.
