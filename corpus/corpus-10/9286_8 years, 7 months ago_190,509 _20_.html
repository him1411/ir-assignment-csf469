I am running Django, FastCGI, and Nginx.  I am creating an api of sorts that where someone can send some data via XML which I will process and then return some status codes for each node that was sent over.The problem is that Nginx will throw a 504 Gateway Time-out if I take too long to process the XML -- I think longer than 60 seconds.So I would like to set up Nginx so that if any requests matching the location /api will not time out for 120 seconds.  What setting will accomplish that.What I have so far is:Edit: What I have is not working :)Proxy timeouts are well, for proxies, not for FastCGI...The directives that affect FastCGI timeouts are client_header_timeout, client_body_timeout and send_timeout.Edit: Considering what\'s found on nginx wiki, the send_timeout directive is responsible for setting general timeout of response (which was bit misleading). For FastCGI there\'s fastcgi_read_timeout which is affecting the fastcgi process response timeout.HTH.For those using nginx with unicorn and rails, most likely the timeout is in your unicorn.rb fileput a large timeout in unicorn.rbif you\'re still facing issues, try having fail_timeout=0 in your upstream in nginx and see if this fixes your issue. This is for debugging purposes and might be dangerous in a production environment.If you use unicorn.Look at top on your server. Unicorn likely is using 100% of CPU right now.\nThere are several reasons of this problem.You should check your HTTP requests, some of their can be very hard.Check unicorn\'s version. May be you\'ve updated it recently, and something was broken.In http nginx section (/etc/nginx/nginx.conf) add or modify:In server nginx section (/etc/nginx/sites-available/your-config-file.com) add these lines:In php file in the case 127.0.0.1:9000 (/etc/php/7.X/fpm/pool.d/www.conf) modify:I hope help you.
