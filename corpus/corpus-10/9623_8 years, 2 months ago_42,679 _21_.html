A simple test app:outputs:So it looks like it works. What does the standard say about this? Is it always legal to "allocate" empty block of memory?From 5.3.4/7When the value of the expression in a direct-new-declarator is zero, the allocation function is called to allocate an array with no elements.From 3.7.3.1/2The effect of dereferencing a pointer returned as a request for zero size is undefined.AlsoEven if the size of the space requested [by new] is zero, the request can fail.That means you can do it, but you can not legally (in a well defined manner across all platforms) dereference the memory that you get - you can only pass it to array delete - and you should delete it.Here is an interesting foot-note (i.e not a normative part of the standard, but included for expository purposes) attached to the sentence from 3.7.3.1/2[32. The intent is to have operator new() implementable by calling malloc() or calloc(), so the rules are substantially the same. C++ differs from C in requiring a zero request to return a non-null pointer.]Yes, it is legal to allocate a zero-sized array like this. But you must also delete it.What does the standard say about this? Is it always legal to "allocate" empty block of memory?Every object has a unique identity, i.e. a unique address, which implies a non-zero length (the actual amount of memory will be silently increased, if you ask for zero bytes).If you allocated more than one of these objects then you\'d find they have different addresses.Yes it is completely legal to allocate a 0 sized block with new. You simply can\'t do anything useful with it since there is no valid data for you to access. int[0] = 5; is illegal.However, I believe that the standard allows for things like malloc(0) to return NULL.You will still need to delete [] whatever pointer you get back from the allocation as well.Curiously, C++ requires that operator new return a legitimate pointer\n  even when zero bytes are requested. (Requiring this odd-sounding\n  behavior simplifies things elsewhere in the language.)I found Effective C++ Third Edition said like this in "Item 51: Adhere to convention when writing new and delete".
