I have a shell script that is used both on Windows/Cygwin and Mac and Linux. It needs slightly  different variables for each versions.How can a shell/bash script detect whether it is running in Cygwin, on a Mac or in Linux?Usually, uname with its various options will tell you what environment you\'re running in:And, according to the very helpful schot (in the comments), uname -s gives Darwin for OSX and Linux for Linux, while my Cygwin gives CYGWIN_NT-5.1. But you may have to experiment with all sorts of different versions.So the bash code to do such a check would be along the lines of:Use uname -s because uname -o is not supported on some Operating Systems as Mac OS, Solaris... The below snippet does not require bash (i.e. does not require #!/bin/bash)The below Makefile is inspired from Git project (config.mak.uname).See also this nice and complete answer about uname -s and Makefile.The correspondence table in the bottom of this answer is from Wikipedia article about uname. Please contribute to keep it up-to-date (edit the answer or post a comment). You may also update the Wikipedia article and post a comment to notice me about your contribution ;-)See also more sophisticated OS detection as done by the installation scripts of Git LSF.Operating System            uname -s                    \nMac OS X                    Darwin                      \nCygwin 32-bit (Win-XP)      CYGWIN_NT-5.1               \nCygwin 32-bit (Win-7 32-bit)CYGWIN_NT-6.1               \nCygwin 32-bit (Win-7 64-bit)CYGWIN_NT-6.1-WOW64         \nCygwin 64-bit (Win-7 64-bit)CYGWIN_NT-6.1               \nMinGW (Windows 7 32-bit)    MINGW32_NT-6.1              \nMinGW (Windows 10 64-bit)   MINGW64_NT-10.0             \nInterix (Services for UNIX) Interix                      MSYS                        MSYS_NT-6.1                 \nAndroid                     Linux                       \ncoreutils                   Linux                       \nCentOS                      Linux                       \nFedora                      Linux                       \nGentoo                      Linux                       \nRed Hat Linux               Linux                       \nLinux Mint                  Linux                       \nopenSUSE                    Linux                       \nUbuntu                      Linux                       \nUnity Linux                 Linux                       \nManjaro Linux               Linux                       \nOpenWRT r40420              Linux                       \nDebian (Linux)              Linux                       \nDebian (GNU Hurd)           GNU                         \nDebian (kFreeBSD)           GNU/kFreeBSD                \nFreeBSD                     FreeBSD                     \nNetBSD                      NetBSD                      \nDragonFlyBSD                DragonFly                   \nHaiku                       Haiku                       \nNonStop                     NONSTOP_KERNEL              \nQNX                         QNX                         \nReliantUNIX                 ReliantUNIX-Y               \nSINIX                       SINIX-Y                     \nTru64                       OSF1                        \nUltrix                      ULTRIX                      \nIRIX 32 bits                IRIX                        \nIRIX 64 bits                IRIX64                      \nMINIX                       Minix                       \nSolaris                     SunOS                       \nUWIN (64-bit Windows 7)     UWIN-W7                     \nSYS$UNIX:SH on OpenVMS      IS/WB                       \nz/OS USS                    OS/390                      \nCray                        sn5176                      \n(SCO) OpenServer            SCO_SV                      \n(SCO) System V              SCO_SV                      \n(SCO) UnixWare              UnixWare                    \nIBM AIX                     AIX                         \nIBM i with QSH              OS400                       \nHP-UX                       HP-UX                       Bash sets the shell variable OSTYPE. From man bash:Automatically set to a string that describes the operating system on\n  which bash is executing.This has a tiny advantage over uname in that it doesn\'t require launching a new process, so will be quicker to execute.However, I\'m unable to find an authoritative list of expected values. For me on Ubuntu 14.04 it is set to \'linux-gnu\'. I\'ve scraped the web for some other values. Hence:The asterisks are important in some instances - for example OSX appends an OS version number after the \'darwin\'. The \'win\' value is actually \'win32\', I\'m told - maybe there is a \'win64\'?Perhaps we could work together to populate a table of verified values here:(Please append your value if it differs from existing entries)If the 6 first chars of uname -s command is "CYGWIN", a cygwin system is assumedTo build upon Albert\'s answer, I like to use $COMSPEC for detecting Windows:This avoids parsing variants of Windows names for $OS, and parsing variants of uname like MINGW, Cygwin, etc.Background: %COMSPEC% is a Windows environmental variable specifying the full path to the command processor (aka the Windows shell).  The value of this variable is typically %SystemRoot%\\system32\\cmd.exe, which typically evaluates to C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe .http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnameAll the info you\'ll ever need. Google is your friend.Use uname -s to query the system name.Ok, here is my way.e.g.I use this in my dotfilesUse only this from command line works very fine,\nthanks to Justin:sourceI guess the uname answer is unbeatable, mainly in terms of cleanliness.Although it takes a ridiculous time to execute, I found that testing for specific files presence also gives me good and quicker results, since I\'m not invoking an executable:So,[ -f /usr/bin/cygwin1.dll ] && echo Yep, Cygwin runningjust uses a quick Bash file presence check. As I\'m on Windows right now, I can\'t tell you any specific files for Linuxes and Mac OS X from my head, but I\'m pretty sure they do exist. :-)
