I am using Mocha for testing my NodeJS application. I am not able to figure out how to use its code coverage feature. I tried googling it but did not find any proper tutorial. Please help.You need an additional library for code coverage, and you are going to be blown away by how powerful and easy istanbul is. Try the following, after you get your mocha tests to pass (and have installed mocha globally):Note the need to use _mocha instead of mocha, as explained here: https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul/issues/44Blanket.js works perfect too.npm install --save-dev blanketin front of your test/tests.jsrun mocha -R html-cov > coverage.htmlNow (2017) the preferred way to use istanbul, is via its "state of the art command line interface" nyc.First, install it in your project withThen, if you have a npm based project, just change the test script inside the scripts object of your package.json file to execute code coverage of your mocha tests:Now run your testsand you will see a table like this in your console, just after your tests output:Just useinstead of text. Now it will produce a report inside ./coverage/index.html.Istanbul supports a wide range of report formats. Just look at its reports library to find the most useful for you.\nJust add a --reporter=REPORTER_NAME option for each format you want.\nFor example, withyou will have both the console and the html report.Just add another script in your package.json and leave the test script with only your test runner (e.g. mocha):Now run this custom scriptto run tests with code coverage.Fail if the total code coverage is below 90%:Fail if the code coverage of at least one file is below 90%:
