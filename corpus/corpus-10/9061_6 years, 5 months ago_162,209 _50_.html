So I currently use something like:But this gets called many times while resizing process goes on. Is it possible to catch an event when it ends?I had luck with the following recommendation: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/the-resizeend-eventHere\'s the code so you don\'t have to dig through his post\'s link & source:Thanks sime.vidas for the code!You can use setTimeout() and clearTimeout()Code example on jsfiddle.This is the code that I write according to @Mark Coleman answer:Thanks Mark!Internet Explorer provides a resizeEnd event. Other browsers will trigger the resize event many times while you\'re resizing.There are other great answers here that show how to use setTimeout and the .throttle, .debounce methods from lodash and underscore, so I will mention Ben Alman\'s throttle-debounce jQuery plugin which accomplishes what you\'re after.Suppose you have this function that you want to trigger after a resize:Throttle Example\nIn the following example, onResize() will only be called once every 250 milliseconds during a window resize.Debounce Example\nIn the following example, onResize() will only be called once at the end of a window resizing action. This achieves the same result that @Mark presents in his answer.There is an elegant solution using the Underscore.js So, if you are using it in your project you can do the following -This should be enough :) But, If you are interested to read more on that, you can check my blog post - http://rifatnabi.com/post/detect-end-of-jquery-resize-event-using-underscore-debounceYou can store a reference id to any setInterval or setTimeout. Like this:To do this without a "global" variable you can add a local variable to the function itself. Ex:You can use setTimeout() and clearTimeout() in conjunction with jQuery.data:UpdateI wrote an extension to enhance jQuery\'s default on (& bind)-event-handler. It attaches an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements if the event was not triggered for a given interval. This is useful if you want to fire a callback only after a delay, like the resize event, or else.\nhttps://github.com/yckart/jquery.unevent.jsUse it like any other on or bind-event handler, except that you can pass an extra parameter as a last:http://jsfiddle.net/ARTsinn/EqqHx/This is a modification to Dolan\'s code above, I\'ve added a feature which checks the window size at the start of the resize and compares it to the size at the end of the resize, if size is either bigger or smaller than the margin (eg. 1000) then it reloads.One solution is extend jQuery with a function, e.g.: resizedSample usage:\n$(window).resized(myHandler, 300);\ni wrote a litte wrapper function on my own...Here is the usage:Well, as far as the window manager is concerned, each resize event is its own message, with a distinct beginning and end, so technically, every time the window is resized, it is the end.Having said that, maybe you want to set a delay to your continuation? Here\'s an example.Here is VERY simple script to trigger both a \'resizestart\' and \'resizeend\' event on the window object.There is no need to muck around with dates and times.The d variable represents the number of milliseconds between resize events before triggering the resize end event, you can play with this to change how sensitive the end event is.To listen to these events all you need to do is:resizestart: $(window).on(\'resizestart\', function(event){console.log(\'Resize Start!\');});resizeend:\n$(window).on(\'resizeend\', function(event){console.log(\'Resize End!\');});since the selected answer didn\'t actually work .. and if you\'re not using jquery here is a simple throttle function with an example of how to use it with window resizingthis worked for me as I did not want to use any plugins.On window re-size invoke "setFn" which gets width of window and save as "originalWindowSize". Then invoke "checkFn" which after 500ms (or your preference) gets the current window size, and compares the original to the current, if they are not the same, then the window is still being re-sized. Don\'t forget to remove console messages in production, and (optional) can make "setFn" self executing.      This worked for what I was trying to do in chrome. This won\'t fire the callback until 200ms after last resize event.Better alternative also created by me is here:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/23692008/2829600\n(supports "delete functions")I wrote this simple function for handling delay in execution, useful inside jQuery .scroll() and .resize() So callback_f will run only once for specific id string.http://jsfiddle.net/04fLy8t4/I implemented function which trig two events on user DOM element:Code:Mark Coleman\'s answer is certainly far better than the selected answer, but if you want to avoid the global variable for the timeout ID (the doit variable in Mark\'s answer), you could do one of the following:(1) Use a an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) to create a closure.(2) Use a property of the event handler function.I don\'t know is my code work for other but it\'s really do a great job for me. I got this idea by analyzing Dolan Antenucci code because his version is not work for me and I really hope it\'ll be helpful to someone.
