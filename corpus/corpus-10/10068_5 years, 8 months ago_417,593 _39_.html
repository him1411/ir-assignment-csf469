CSS Push Div to bottom of pagePlease look at that link, I want the opposite: When the content overflows to the scrollbars, I want my footer to be always at the complete bottom of the page, like Stack Overflow.I have a div with id="footer" and this CSS:But all it does is go to the bottom of the viewport, and stays there even if you scroll down, so it is no longer at the bottom.Image: Sorry if not clarified, I don\'t want it to be fixed, only for it to be at the actual bottom of all the content.This is precisely what position: fixed was designed for:Here\'s the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/uw8f9/Unfortunately you can\'t do this with out adding a little extra HTML and having one piece of CSS rely on another.HTMLFirst you need to wrap your header,footer and #body into a #holder div:CSSThen set height: 100% to html and body (actual body, not your #body div) to ensure you can set minimum height as a percentage on child elements.Now set min-height: 100% on the #holder div so it fills the content of the screen and use position: absolute to sit the footer at the bottom of the #holder div.Unfortunately, you have to apply padding-bottom to the #body div that is the same height as the footer to ensure that the footer does not sit above any content:Working example, short body: http://jsfiddle.net/ELUGc/Working example, long body: http://jsfiddle.net/ELUGc/1/Just worked out for another solution as above example have bug( somewhere error ) for me. Variation from the selected answer.for html layoutWell this way don\'t support old browser however its acceptable for old browser to scrolldown 30px to view the footer.I realise it says not to use this for \'responding to other answers\' but unfortunately I don\'t have enough rep to add a comment onto the appropriate answer (!) but ...If you are having problems in asp.net with the answer from \'My Head Hurts\' - you need to add \'height : 100%\' to the main generated FORM tag as well as HTML and BODY tags in order for this to work.I would comment if i could , but i have no permissions yet, so i will post a hint as an answer, for unexpected behavior on some android devices:Position: Fixed only works in Android 2.1 thru 2.3 by using the following meta tag: see http://caniuse.com/#search=positionThis is an intuitive solution using the viewport command that just sets the minimum height to the viewport height minus the footer height.if you have a fixed height footer (for example 712px) you can do this with js like so:I\'ve solved a similar issue by putting all of my main content within an extra div tag (id="outer").  I\'ve then moved the div tag with id="footer" outside of this last "outer" div tag.\nI\'ve used CSS to specify the height of "outer" and specified the width and height of "footer".  I\'ve also used CSS to specify the margin-left and margin-right of "footer" as auto.  The result is that the footer sits firmly at the bottom of my page and scrolls with the page too (although, it\'s still appears inside the "outer" div, but happily outside of the main "content" div. which seems strange, but it\'s where I want it).You didn\'t close your ; after position: absolute.\nOtherwise your above code would have worked perfectly!I just want to add - most of the other answers worked fine for me; however, it took a long time to get them working!This is because setting height: 100% only picks up parent div\'s height!So if your entire html (inside of the body) looks like the following:Then the following will be fine:...as "holder" will pick up it\'s height directly from "body".Kudos to My Head Hurts, whose answer was the one I ended up getting to work!However. If your html is more nested (because it\'s only an element of the full page, or it\'s within a certain column, etc) then you need to make sure every containing element also has height: 100% set on the div. Otherwise, the information on height will be lost between "body" and "holder".E.g. the following, where I\'ve added the "full height" class to every div to make sure the height gets all the way down to our header/body/footer elements:And remember to set height on full-height class in the css:That fixed my issues!
