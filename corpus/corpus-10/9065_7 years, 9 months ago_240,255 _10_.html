In Android, I am trying to get the selected Spinner value with a listener.What is the best way to get the spinner\'s value?The Spinner should fire an "OnItemSelected" event when something is selected:Say this is your xml with spinner entries (ie. titles) and values:and this is your spinner:Then in your code to get the entries:and to get the values:Yes, you can register a listener via setOnItemSelectedListener(), as is demonstrated here.If you already know the item is a String, I prefer:Calling toString() on an Object that you know is a String seems like a more roundabout path than just casting the Object to String.
