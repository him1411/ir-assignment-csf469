For the life of me, I can\'t remember how to set, delete, toggle or test a bit in a bitfield. Either I\'m unsure or I mix them up because I rarely need these. So a "bit-cheat-sheet" would be nice to have.For example: orCan you give examples of all the other common operations, preferably in C# syntax using a [Flags] enum?I did some more work on these extensions - You can find the code hereI wrote some extension methods that extend System.Enum that I use often... I\'m not claiming that they are bulletproof, but they have helped... Comments removed...Then they are used like the followingIn .NET 4 you can now write:The idiom is to use the bitwise or-equal operator to set bits:To clear a bit, the idiom is to use bitwise and with negation:Sometimes you have an offset that identifies your bit, and then the idiom is to use these combined with left-shift:@DrewNote that except in the simplest of cases, the Enum.HasFlag carries a heavy performance penalty in comparison to writing out the code manually. Consider the following code:Over 10 million iterations, the HasFlags extension method takes a whopping 4793 ms, compared to the 27 ms for the standard bitwise implementation.C++ syntax, assuming bit 0 is LSB, assuming flags is unsigned long:Check if Set:Check if not set:Set:Clear:Toggle:To test a bit you would do the following:\n(assuming flags is a 32 bit number)Test Bit: \n This was inspired by using Sets as indexers in Delphi, way back when:.NET\'s built-in flag enum operations are unfortunately quite limited. Most of the time users are left with figuring out the bitwise operation logic.In .NET 4, the method HasFlag was added to Enum which helps simplify user\'s code but unfortunately there are many problems with it.Due in part to .NET\'s limited support for flag enums I wrote the OSS library Enums.NET which addresses each of these issues and makes dealing with flag enums much easier.Below are some of the operations it provides along with their equivalent implementations using just the .NET framework.flags | otherFlagsflags.CombineFlags(otherFlags)flags & ~otherFlagsflags.RemoveFlags(otherFlags)flags & otherFlagsflags.CommonFlags(otherFlags)flags ^ otherFlagsflags.ToggleFlags(otherFlags)(flags & otherFlags) == otherFlags or flags.HasFlag(otherFlags)flags.HasAllFlags(otherFlags)(flags & otherFlags) != 0flags.HasAnyFlags(otherFlags)flags.GetFlags()I\'m trying to get these improvements incorporated into .NET Core and maybe eventually the full .NET Framework. You can check out my proposal here.C++ operations are: & | ^ ~ (for and, or, xor and not bitwise operations). Also of interest are >> and <<, which are bitshift operations.So, to test for a bit being set in a flag, you would use:\n    if (flags & 8) //tests bit 4 has been set
