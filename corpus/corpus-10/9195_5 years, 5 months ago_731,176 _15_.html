I\'m trying to join 3 tables in a view; here is the situation:I have a table that contains information of students who are applying to live on this College Campus. I have another table that lists the Hall Preferences (3 of them) for each Student. But each of these preferences are merely an ID Number, and the ID Number has a corresponding Hall Name in a third table (did not design this database...).Pretty much, I have INNER JOIN on the table with their preferences, and their information, the result is something like...Where 005 would be the HallID. So Now I want to match that HallID to a third table, where this table contains a HallID and HallName.So pretty much, I want my result to be like...EDIT here is what I currently HaveYou can do the following (I guessed on table fields,etc)EDIT:Based on your request for multiple halls you could do it this way. You just join on your Hall table multiple times for each room pref id:if you have 3 tables with the same ID to be joined, i think it would be like this:SELECT * FROM table1 a JOIN table2 b ON a.ID = b.ID JOIN table3 c ON a.ID = c.IDjust replace * with what you want to get from the tableYou just need a second inner join that links the ID Number that you have now to the ID Number of the third table. Afterwards, replace the ID Number by the Hall Name and voil\xc3\xa1 :)This is correct query for join 3 table with same id**employee first table.\nreport second table.\nbirth third table
