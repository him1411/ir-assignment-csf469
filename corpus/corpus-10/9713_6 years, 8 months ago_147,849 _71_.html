I would like to place an icon left of the two lines of text such that there\'s about 2-3 pixels of space between the image and the start of text. The control itself is Center aligned horizontally (set through Interface Builder)The button would resemble something like this:I\'m trying to configure this with contentEdgeInset, imageEdgeInsets and titleEdgeInsets to no avail. I understand that a negative value expands the edge while a positive value shrinks it to move it closer to the center.I tried:but this doesn\'t display it correctly. I\'ve been tweaking the values but going from say -5 to -10 on the left inset value doesn\'t appear to move it in expected manner. -10 will scoot the text all the way to the left so I expected -5 to scoot it half way from the left side but it doesn\'t. What\'s the logic behind insets? I\'m not familiar with image placements and related terminology.I used this SO question as a reference but something about my values isn\'t right.\nUIButton: how to center an image and a text using imageEdgeInsets and titleEdgeInsets?I agree the documentation on imageEdgeInsets and titleEdgeInsets should be better, but I figured out how to get the correct positioning without resorting to trial and error.The general idea is here at this question, but that was if you wanted both text and image centered.  We don\'t want the image and text to be centered individually, we want the image and the text to be centered together as a single entity.  This is in fact what UIButton already does so we simply need to adjust the spacing.I also turned this into a category for UIButton so it will be easy to use:UIButton+Position.hUIButton+Position.mSo now all I have to do is:And I get what I need every time.  No more messing with the edge insets manually.EDIT: Swapping Image and TextIn response to @Javal in commentsUsing this same mechanism, we can swap the image and the text. To accomplish the swap, simply use a negative spacing but also include the width of the text and the image. This will require frames to be known and layout performed already.Of course you will probably want to make a nice method for this, potentially adding a second category method, this is left as an exercise to the reader.I\'m a little late to this party, but I think I have something useful to add. Kekoa\'s answer is great but, as RonLugge mentions, it can make the button no longer respect sizeToFit or, more importantly, can cause the button to clip its content when it is intrinsically sized. Yikes!First, though, A brief explanation of how I believe imageEdgeInsets and titleEdgeInsets work:The docs for imageEdgeInsets have the following to say, in part:Use this property to resize and reposition the effective drawing rectangle for the button image. You can specify a different value for each of the four insets (top, left, bottom, right). A positive value shrinks, or insets, that edge\xe2\x80\x94moving it closer to the center of the button. A negative value expands, or outsets, that edge.I believe that this documentation was written imagining that the button has no title, just an image. It makes a lot more sense thought of this way, and behaves how UIEdgeInsets usually do. Basically, the frame of the image (or the title, with titleEdgeInsets) is moved inwards for positive insets and outwards for negative insets. OK, so what?I\'m getting there! Here\'s what you have by default, setting an image and a title (the button border is green just to show where it is): When you want spacing between an image and a title, without causing either to be crushed, you need to set four different insets, two on each of the image and title. That\'s because you don\'t want to change the sizes of those elements\' frames, but just their positions. When you start thinking this way, the needed change to Kekoa\'s excellent category becomes clear:But wait, you say, when I do that, I get this:Oh yeah! I forgot, the docs warned me about this. They say, in part:This property is used only for positioning the image during layout. The button does not use this property to determine intrinsicContentSize and sizeThatFits:.But there is a property that can help, and that\'s contentEdgeInsets. The docs for that say, in part:The button uses this property to determine intrinsicContentSize and sizeThatFits:.That sounds good. So let\'s tweak the category once more:And what do you get?Looks like a winner to me. Working in Swift and don\'t want to do any thinking at all? Here\'s the final version of the extension in Swift:In interface Builder. Select the UIButton -> Attributes Inspector -> Edge=Title and modify the edge insetsAlso if you want to make something similar to You need1.Set horizontal and vertical alignment for button toFind all required values and set UIImageEdgeInsetsThis will arrange your title and image on button.Also please note update this on each relayoutSwiftYou can avoid much trouble by using this --This will align all your content automatically to left (or wherever you want it)Swift 3:I\'m a little late to this party too, but I think I have something useful to add :o).I created a UIButton subclass whose purpose is to be able to choose where the button\'s image is layout, either vertically or horizontally.It means that you can make this kind of buttons :\nHere the details about how to create these buttons with my class :To do that, I added 2 attributes : imageVerticalAlignment and imageHorizontalAlignment. Off course, If your button only have an image or a title ... don\'t use this class at all !I also added an attribute named imageToTitleSpacing which allow you to adjust space between title and image.This class try his best to be compatible if you want to use imageEdgeInsets, titleEdgeInsets and contentEdgeInsets directly or in combinaison with the new layout attributes.As @ravron explains us, I try my best to make the button content edge correct (as you can see with the red borders).You can also use it in Interface Builder : Here the code (gist) :A small addition to Riley Avron answer to account locale changes:In Xcode 8.0 you can simply do it by changing insets in size inspector.Select the UIButton ->  Attributes Inspector -> go to size inspector and modify the content, image and title insets.And if you want to change image on right side you can simply change the semantic property to Force Right-to-left in Attribute inspector .Here is a simple example of how to use imageEdgeInsets\nThis will make a 30x30 button with a hittable area 10 pixels bigger all the way around (50x50)        An elegant way in Swift 3 and better to understand:
