This question already has an answer here:In the following snippet:Is there a keyword to refer to the outer class from the inner class?  Basically what I want to do is outer.otherMethod(), or something of the like, but can\'t seem to find anything.In general you use OuterClassName.this to refer to the enclosing instance of the outer class.In your example that would be a.this.otherMethod()
