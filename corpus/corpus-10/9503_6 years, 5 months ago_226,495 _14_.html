This question already has an answer here:I have an array of objects:How do I get the array to be sorted in ascending order of the atribute name (array[i][1])?I\'ve tried to do this: array[i][1].sort(), but that doesn\'t work.Please help me!Edit: the array can contain more than two objects! It can contain hundreds.Edit:\nWhy is this question marked as a duplicate, when it was asked 2 years before the "duplicated" question?The sort function takes an additional argument, a function that takes two arguments. This function should return -1, 0 or 1 depending on which of the two arguments should come first in the sorting. More info.I also fixed a syntax error in your multidimensional array.the sort method contains an optional argument to pass a custom compare function.Assuming you wanted an array of arrays:Otherwise if you wanted an array of objects, you could do:Well, it appears that instead of creating a true multidimensional array, you\'ve created an array of (almost) JavaScript Objects. Try defining your arrays like this ->Hopefully that helps!
