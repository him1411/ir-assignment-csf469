java -Xmx1024m filenamewhat does -Xmx mean?see here: Java Tool Doc, it says,-Xmxn\n      Specify the maximum size, in bytes, of the memory allocation pool. This value must a multiple of 1024 greater than 2MB. Append the letter k or K to indicate kilobytes, or m or M to indicate megabytes. The default value is 64MB. The upper limit for this value will be approximately 4000m on Solaris 7 and Solaris 8 SPARC platforms and 2000m on Solaris 2.6 and x86 platforms, minus overhead amounts. Examples:So, in simple words, you are saying Java to use Maximum of 1024 MB from available memory.Notice there is NO SPACE between -Xmx and 1024mIt does not matter if you use uppercase or lowercase. For example: "-Xmx10G" and "-Xmx10g" do the exact same thing.The -Xmx option changes the maximum Heap Space for the VM. java -Xmx1024m means that the VM can allocate a maximum of 1024 MB. In layman terms this means that the application can use a maximum of 1024MB of memory.Max heap Usage for the application is is 1024 MB-Xmx sets the Maximum Heap size
