I am working on a moderately complex schema in MySQL Workbench, and the single page of the EER diagram is now full up. Does anyone know how to enlarge it to two or more pages?On the Model pull-down there is an option Diagram Properties and Size, which allows the size of the diagram to be changed.ER Diagram -> Model -> Diagram Properties and Size...by the way, if you want a large number of schemas to display correctly, you need to increase the size of the canvas AND zoom out BEFORE running "Auto Layout". if you increase the canvas size enough and zoom out enough all the tables will be spaced apart nicely.If you are under Linux, and it is hanging when you try to elarge the canvas size, try zoomming out to the smallest view possible before changing the canvas properties.Worked for me.Regards,\nLeo.  If option "Diagram Properties and Size" is disabled (grayed out) \nYou can try to run MysqlWorkbench with sudo I am not good at linux, there should be some miss-configuration leading to this. So I\'am only saying that this resolved the problem for me.(system info \nMySQL Workbench Community (GPL) for Linux/Unix version 6.2.3  revision 12312 build 2280 (64 bit)\nConfiguration Directory: /home/arsen/.mysql/workbench\nData Directory: /usr/share/mysql-workbench\nCairo Version: 1.13.1\nOS: Linux 3.13.0-76-generic\nCPU: 4x Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad CPU           @ 2.40GHz (1596.000MHz) - 5,83GiB RAM\nDistribution: Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS\n)In addition to the already told "diagram propertys" settings - where everything is measured in pages and where you can\'t enter float values to make slightly smaller or bigger. But you can change the page size itself: File->Page SetupIf the "Diagram Properties and Size..." option is grayed out, do the following:
