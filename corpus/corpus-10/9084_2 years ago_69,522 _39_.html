I\'m trying to get the exact JSON that is being sent in the request. Here is my code:But I only see this in the logs:How am I supposed to do proper logging, given the removal of setLog() and setLogLevel() which we used to use with Retrofit 1?In Retrofit 2 you should use HttpLoggingInterceptor.Add dependency to build.gradle:Create Retrofit object like the following:Above solution gives you logcat logs very similar to the old ones set by\nUpdate for Retrofit 2.1.0:Use interceptor v3.3.1 otherwise you will get following error-\njava.lang.NoSuchMethodError: No virtual method log(Ljava/lang/String;)V in class Lokhttp3/internal/Platform; or its super classesConfiguration for 2.1.0 looks like this:I met the thing as you and I tried to ask the author of the book Retrofit: Love working with APIs on Android (here is the link)\n(nope! I am not making some ads for them....but they are really nice guys :)\nAnd the author replied to me very soon, with both Log method on Retrofit 1.9 and Retrofit 2.0-beta.And here is the code of Retrofit 2.0-beta:This is how to add logging method with the help of HttpLoggingInterceptor. Also if you are the reader of that book I mentioned above, you may find that it says there is not log method with Retrofit 2.0 anymore -- which, I had asked the author, is not correct and they will update the book next year talking about it.// In case you are not that familiar with the Log method in Retrofit, I would like to share something more.Also should be noticed that there are some Logging Levels you could pick. I use the Level.BODY most of the time, which will give some thing like this:You can find almost all the http staff inside the picture: the header, the content and response, etc.And sometimes you really don\'t need all the guests to attend your party: I just want to know whether it\'s successfully connected, that internet call is successfully made within my Activiy & Fragmetn. Then you are free to use Level.BASIC, which will return something like this:Can you find the status code 200 OK inside? That is it :)Also there is another one, Level.HEADERS, which will only return the header of the network. Ya of course another picture here:That\'s all of the Logging trick ;)And I would like to share you with the tutorial I learned a lot there. They have a bunch of great post talking about almost everything related to Retrofit, and they are continuing updating the post, at the same time Retrofit 2.0 is coming. Please take a look at those work, which I think will save you lots of time.Here is an Interceptor that logs both the request and response bodies (using Timber, based on an example from the OkHttp docs and some other SO answers):Try this:After this, in the body there is the JSON you are interested in.I don\'t know if setLogLevel() will return in the final 2.0 version of Retrofit but for now you can use an interceptor for logging.A good example can found in OkHttp wiki: https://github.com/square/okhttp/wiki/InterceptorsFor those who need high level logging in Retrofit, use the interceptor like thisCourtesy: https://github.com/square/retrofit/issues/1072#If you are using Retrofit2 and okhttp3 then you need to know that Interceptor works by queue. So add loggingInterceptor at the end, after your other Interceptors:The main problem which I faced was dynamical adding headers and logging them into debug logcat. I\'ve tried to add two interceptors. One for logging and one for adding headers on-the-go (token authorization). The problem was that we may .addInterceptor or .addNetworkInterceptor. As Jake Wharton said to me: "Network interceptors always come after application interceptors. See https://github.com/square/okhttp/wiki/Interceptors". So here is working example with headers and logs:You can also add Facebook\'s Stetho and look at the network traces in Chrome:\nhttp://facebook.github.io/stetho/Then open "chrome://inspect" in Chrome...A best way to do this right in Retrofit 2 is to add the logger interceptor as a networkInterceptor this will print out the  network headers and your custom headers too. The important thing is to remember that interceptor work as a stack and be sure u add the logger at the end of all.I found way for Print Log in RetrofitWorks for me.hey guys\xef\xbc\x8ci already find solution:
