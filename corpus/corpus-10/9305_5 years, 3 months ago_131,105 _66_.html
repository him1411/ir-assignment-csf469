I have a web project in my solution file that is "unavailable" when I open the solution. When I right-click on the web project and reload the project, I get the following error:\nThe Web Application Project mycompany.myapp.mywebproject is configured to use IIS. The Web Server \'http://localhost/MyWebApp could not be found.\nI have not manually set up virtual directories for this web application. Per colleagues, Visual Studio should prompt me to create virtual directories but I am not getting prompted. I installed VS2010 before installing IIS on my dev machine. Here is my development machine setup:When this happens the easiest solution is to make the virtual directory manually.First of all, you need to make sure you have the right version of ASP.Net installed and that you have installed the IIS extensions.To do this, go to the relevant .net version\'s folder in c:\\(windows)\\microsoft.net\\(dotnetver)\\\n (substituting the bracketed folders for the right folders on your PC) and run this commandNext once that\'s run and finished, sometimes runningfrom the command line helps, sometimes you don\'t need to.Next, go to your IIS Manager and find you localhost website and choose add a folder.\nBrowse to the folder in your project that contains the actual ASP.Net project and add that.Finally, right click on the folder you added and you should have an option that says \'convert to application\' or \'create virtual directory\' or something similar.!!Make sure the Virtual directory has the name \'MyWebApp\'!!Reload your solution and it should work.Please be wary; this isn\'t a programming question (and shouldn\'t really be posted here) but I\'ve posted this guidance as it\'s a common problem, but the advice I\'ve posted is generic; the commands I\'ve listed are correct but the steps you need to do in IIS may vary, it depends on your version and your account privileges.Good luck!Since the accepted answer requires IIS Manager, and IIS Express doesn\'t have IIS Manager or any UI, here\'s the solution for you IIS Express users (and should work for everyone else too):When you open Visual Studio and get the error message, right-click the project Solution Explorer and choose "Edit {ProjectName}.csproj"In the project file, change the following line:\n<UseIIS>True</UseIIS>\nto\n<UseIIS>False</UseIIS>\nSave the file.Now reload your project.\nDone.You\'ll then be able to open your project. If at this point, you want to use IIS, simply go to your project properties, click the "Web" tab, and select the option to use IIS. There\'s the button there to "Create Virtual Directory". It may tell you that you need to run Visual Studio as an administrator to create that directory, so do that if needed.Open the project folder and delete {Project}.csproj.user, then reload the project on Visual Studio.Edit the .csproj or vbproj file. Find and replace these entries This solution work for me.Right click the Project and select edit and find the following code as shown below in picture.change the <UseIIS>True</UseIIS> to <UseIIS>False</UseIIS>ORchange the <IISUrl>http://example.com/</IISUrl> to <IISUrl>http://localhost/</IISUrl>In my case, this problem was caused by broken IIS bindings. Specifically, my \'http\' binding had been deleted. Recreating it fixed the problem.for me, i had to delete these two lines from .csproj fileI tried deleting only the first one, but it wasn\'t enough.Try opening Visual Studio with Administrator privileges. In my case, it gave access to the IIS site and made this error go away. I was then able to switch the project to use IIS Express which doesn\'t seem to need administrator privileges.In my case I wanted to switch from http to https, so I had deleted http from IIS. In my .csproj.user file found that I still had:So I changed it to:In my case I was able to open the solution in offline mode just running the command:This worked for me:-\nMake all your IIS websites point to localhost(All Unassigned) only You will not believe that,  start visual studio as Administrator as obvious from the message The Web Server \'http://localhost/MyWebApp\' could not be found.could not be found because may it has no privileges to see it so Just restart visual studio as Administrator I had this error, too. I thought everything was setup correctly, but I found out that one thing was missing: The host name I used for my project was not (yet) resolvable.Since my app determines the current client\'s name from the host name I used a host name like clientname.mysuperapp.local for development. When I added the development host name to my hosts file, the project was loadable again. Obviously, I had to this anyway, but I haven\'t thought that VS checks the host name before loading the project.For you Win8 users out there, if you follow the steps in the accepted answer, console spits out a message at you saying "thou shalt not use the command-line to execute this command" (paraphrasing). Instead, access the Programs & Features via Control Panel (or Windows + R > appwiz.cpl), click \'Turn Windows features on or off\', and make sure you have the following installed: This will check a bunch of other options as well. As soon as I installed these features, and ran VS2012 with elevated permissions, I was able to launch my app successfully. in my case, make sure you have a "Default" websiteThis happens with me when I tried to open a project from the .csproj file, but I get over it by opening the project from VS: File> Open> Web Siteand select the directory which include my project.You can load the project without setting the value of attribute UseIIS to true. \nSimply follow the below steps:In the mywebproject.csproj file--Delete the tag < IISUrl>http://localhost/MyWebApp/< /IISUrl> and save the file. \nThe application will automatically assign the default port to it. In my case, the "Default Web Site" in IIS didn\'t have a binding for localhost on port 80.\nYou should have a binding for whatever your  value in the .csproj file is.If you are connected via TFS, open your project.csproj.user file and check forand change it to true.Check if IIS Express is installed. If IIS Express is missing, Visual Studio might discard the setting <UseIISExpress>false</UseIISExpress> and still look for the express.In my case, the url referenced in the csproj file was incorrect. It needed to be prefixed with www.I made the changes, saved the file and the project loaded fine.      I ran into this issue when the <ProjectTypeGuids> element in the .csproj file contained the unit test project GUID: {3AC096D0-A1C2-E12C-1390-A8335801FDAB}.Removing it made the project load without problems.For DNN users my issue was I needed a binding for dnndev.me at port 80. I have multiple installs that run on different ports and VS requires that that particular Url to exist on port 80 (not 86 like mine was).I fixed this simply by reinstalling IIS Express after downloading from below link: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=48264
