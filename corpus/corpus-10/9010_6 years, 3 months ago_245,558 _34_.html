I would like to write a single SQL command to drop multiple columns from a single table in one ALTER TABLE statement.From MSDN\'s ALTER TABLE documentation...Specifies that constraint_name or column_name is removed from the table. DROP COLUMN is not allowed if the compatibility level is 65 or earlier. Multiple columns and constraints can be listed.It says that mutliple columns can be listed in the the statement but the syntax doesn\'t show an optional comma or anything that would even hint at the syntax.How should I write my SQL to drop multiple columns in one statement (if possible)?The syntax isFor MySQLSo summarizingOracle:MS SQL:MySql:Postgre SQLBe aware that DROP COLUMN does not physically remove the data, and for fixed length types (int, numeric, float, datetime, uniqueidentifier etc) the space is consumed even for records added after the columns were dropped. To get rid of the wasted space do ALTER TABLE ... REBUILD.This may be late, but sharing it for the new users visiting this question.\nTo drop multiple columns actual syntax is So for every column you need to specify "drop column" in Mysql 5.0.45.The Syntax as specified by Microsoft for the dropping a column part of an ALTER statement is thisNotice that the [,...n] appears after both the column name and at the end of the whole drop clause. What this means is that there are two ways to delete multiple columns. You can either do this:or thisThis second syntax is useful if you want to combine the drop of a column with dropping a constraint:When dropping columns SQL Sever does not reclaim the space taken up by the columns dropped. For data types that are stored inline in the rows (int for example) it may even take up space on the new rows added after the alter statement. To get around this you need to create a clustered index on the table or rebuild the clustered index if it already has one. Rebuilding the index can be done with a REBUILD command after modifying the table. But be warned this can be slow on very big tables. For example:If it is just single column to delete the below syntax worksALTER TABLE tablename DROP COLUMN column1;For deleting multiple columns, using the DROP COLUMN doesnot work, the below syntax worksALTER TABLE tablename DROP (column1, column2, column3......);For MySQL (ver 5.6), you cannot do multiple column drop with one single drop-statement but rather multiple drop-statements:BTW, drop <col_name> is shorthanded for drop column <col_name> as you can see from drop c3 above.Generic:E.g: this query will alter the multiple column test it.for MySQL DB.Or you can add some column while altering in the same line:Try following queries:oror
