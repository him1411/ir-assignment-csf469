How I can quickly remove all rows in table using Entity Framework?I am currently using:However, it takes a long time to execute.Are there any alternatives?For those that are googling this and ended up here like me, this is how you currently do it in EF5 and EF6:Assuming context is a System.Data.Entity.DbContextWarning: The following is only suitable for small tables (think < 1000 rows)Here is a solution that uses entity framework (not SQL) to delete the rows, so it is not SQL Engine(R/DBM) specific. This assumes that you\'re doing this for testing or some similar situation.\nEither Simply call:Assuming this context:For tidier code you can declare:Then the above becomes:I recently used this approach to clean up my test database for each testcase run (it\xc2\xb4s obviously faster than recreating the DB from scratch each time, though I didn\xc2\xb4t check the form of the delete commands that were generated).Why can it be slow?So if you\'re working with serious amount of data you\'ll kill the SQL server process (it will consume all the memory) and same thing for the IIS process since EF will cache all the data same way as SQL server. Don\'t use this one if your table contains serious amount of data.Cheers! ;)Using SQL\'s TRUNCATE TABLE command will be the fastest as it operates on the table and not on individual rows.Assuming dataDb is a DbContext (not an ObjectContext), you can wrap it and use the method like this:or This avoids using any sqlLike Rudi Visser wrote:Using SQL\'s TRUNCATE TABLE command will be the fastest as it operates on the table and not on individual rows.dataDb.ExecuteStoreCommand("TRUNCATE TABLE [Table]");Assuming dataDb is a DbContext (not an ObjectContext), you can wrap it and use the method like this:var objCtx =\n  ((System.Data.Entity.Infrastructure.IObjectContextAdapter)dataDb).ObjectContext;\n  objCtx.ExecuteStoreCommand("TRUNCATE TABLE [Table]");But You have to be shure to use afterwards anywhere a freshly created datacontext - otherwise you\'ll get entity framework conflicts. Inside the datacontext these entities are still alive when using Truncate table.if  causes Cannot truncate table \'MyTable\' because it is being referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.I use this :I came across this question when I had to deal with a particular case: fully updating of content in a "leaf" table (no FKs pointing to it). This involved removing all rows and putting new rows information and it should be done transactionally (I do not want to end up with an empty table, if inserts fails for whatever reason).I have tried the public static void Clear<T>(this DbSet<T> dbSet) approach, but new rows are not inserted. Another disadvante is that the whole process is slow, as rows are deleted one by one. So, I have switched to TRUNCATE approach, since it is much faster and it is also ROLLBACKable. It also resets the identity.Example using repository pattern:Of course, as already mentioned, this solution cannot be used by tables referenced by foreign keys (TRUNCATE fails).If you wish to clear your entire database.Because of the foreign-key constraints it matters which sequence the tables are truncated. This is a way to bruteforce this sequence.    usage: remember to reinstantiate your DbContext after this.This works Properly in EF 5:In EF6 you can do like this:
