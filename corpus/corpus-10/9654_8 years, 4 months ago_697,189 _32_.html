How do I retrieve a date from SQL Server in YYYY-MM-DD format? I need this to work with SQL Server 2000 and up. Is there a simple way to perform this in SQL Server or would it be easier to convert it programatically after I retrieve the result set?I\'ve read the CAST and CONVERT on Microsoft Technet, but the format I want isn\'t listed and changing the date format isn\'t an option. Limiting the size of the varchar chops of the hour portion that you don\'t want.Starting with SQL Server 2012 (original question is for 2000):SELECT FORMAT(GetDate(), \'yyyy-MM-dd\')The form you are after is listed in the books online documentation.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa226054(SQL.80).aspxFor example, try the following:The convert function with the format specifier 120 will give you the format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss", so you just have to limit the length to 10 to get only the date part:However, formatting dates is generally better to do in the presentation layer rather than in the database or business layer. If you return the date formatted from the database, then the client code has to parse it to a date again if it needs to do any calculations on it.Example in C#:For YYYYMMDD tryI have only tested on SQLServer2008.One other way...Will also do trick without "chopping anything off".In case someone wants to do it the other way around and finds this.This converts a string in the German date format to a datetime object.Why 104? See here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms187928.aspxFor those who would want the time part as well (I did), the following snippet may helpIn your cast and convert link, use style 126 thus:CONVERT (varchar(10), DTvalue, 126)This truncates the time. Your requirement to have it in yyyy-mm-dd means it must be a string datatype and datetime.Frankly though, I\'d do it on the client unless you have good reasons not to.If you want to use it as a date instead of a varchar again afterwards, don\'t forget to convert it back:SELECT CONVERT(NVARCHAR(20), GETDATE(), 23)I would use:The BOL description for 126 is a bit confusion (never found an explanation for "T").Using a CASE statement for each of the convert / cast functions always works for me:Please replace tableXXXXY with your table name, and issueDate_dat with the name of your datetime field in that table:Hope this was helpful. chagbert.This solution works for me, simple and effective (with 126 too)If your source date format is all messed up, try something along the lines of:
