I\'m trying to move some JavaScript code from MicrosoftAjax to JQuery. I use the JavaScript equivalents in MicrosoftAjax of the popular .net methods, e.g. String.format(), String.startsWith(), etc. Are there equivalents to them in jQuery?The source code for ASP.NET AJAX is available for your reference, so you can pick through it and include the parts you want to continue using into a separate JS file.  Or, you can port them to jQuery.Here is the format function...And here are the endsWith and startsWith prototype functions...This is a faster/simpler (and prototypical) variation of the function that Josh posted:Usage:I use this so much that I aliased it to just f, but you can also use the more verbose format. e.g. \'Hello {0}!\'.format(name)Many of the above functions (except Julian Jelfs\'s) contain the following error:Or, for the variants that count backwards from the end of the argument list:Here\'s a correct function. It\'s a prototypal variant of Julian Jelfs\'s code, which I made a bit tighter:And here is a slightly more advanced version of the same, which allows you to escape braces by doubling them:This works correctly:Here is another good implementation by Blair Mitchelmore, with a bunch of nice extra features: https://web.archive.org/web/20120315214858/http://blairmitchelmore.com/javascript/string.formatMade a format function that takes either a collection or an array as argumentsUsage: Code:There is an (somewhat) official option: jQuery.validator.format.Comes with jQuery Validation Plugin 1.6 (at least).\nQuite similar to the String.Format found in .NET.Edit Fixed broken link.If you\'re using the validation plugin you can use:jQuery.validator.format("{0} {1}", "cool", "formatting") = \'cool formatting\'http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/jQuery.validator.format#templateargumentargumentN...Though not exactly what the Q was asking for, I\'ve built one that is similar but uses named placeholders instead of numbered. I personally prefer having named arguments and just send in an object as an argument to it (more verbose, but easier to maintain).Here\'s an example usage...None of the answers presented so far has no obvious optimization of using enclosure to initialize once and store regular expressions, for subsequent usages.Also, none of the examples respects format() implementation if one already exists.Here\'s mine:Not bullet proof but works if you use it sensibly. Using a modern browser, which supports EcmaScript 2015 (ES6), you can enjoy Template Strings. Instead of formatting, you can directly inject the variable value into it:Note the template string has to be written using back-ticks (`).Here\'s my version that is able to escape \'{\', and clean up those unassigned place holders.The following answer is probably the most efficient but has the caveat of only being suitable for 1 to 1 mappings of arguments. This uses the fastest way of concatenating strings (similar to a stringbuilder: array of strings, joined). This is my own code. Probably needs a better separator though.Use it like:Now you can use Template Literals:    This violates DRY principle, but it\'s a concise solution:I couldn\'t get Josh Stodola\'s answer to work, but the following worked for me. Note the specification of prototype. (Tested on IE, FF, Chrome, and Safari.):s really should be a clone of this so as not to be a destructive method, but it\'s not really necessary.Expanding on adamJLev\'s great answer above, here is the TypeScript version:I have a plunker that adds it to the string prototype:\nstring.format\nIt is not just as short as some of the other examples, but a lot more flexible.Usage is similar to c# version:Also, added support for using names & object propertiesYou can also closure array with replacements like this. or you can try bind
