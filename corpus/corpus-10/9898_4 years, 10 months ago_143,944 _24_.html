I\'m running Firefox on a Xvfb in a VPS. What I want to do is to take a full page screenshot of the page.I can redirect Firefox to particular page usingand take a screenshot (inside X) using ImageMagickThe problem is, most of the page need scrolling and I can\'t know the height beforehand.The other way is to pick a very big height (like 4000px) and then process the image and remove the useless part. But that\'s unnecessary processing.I found many Firefox add-ons, but I\'m looking for a solution that can be programmed using the Shell Command line.Edit: I ended up writing my own FireFox extension for doing this.Since Firefox 16 you can press shift-F2 or go to Tools > Web Developer > Developer Toolbar to open a command line. Write:and press Intro in order to take a screeshot.To fully answer the question, you can even save the whole page, not only the visible part of it:And to copy the screenshot to clipboard, use --clipboard option:Firefox 18 changes the way arguments are passed to commands, you have to add "--" before them.You can find some documentation and the full list of commands here.PS. The screenshots are saved into the downloads directory by default.Since Firefox 32 there is also a full page screenshot button in the developer tools (F12). If it is not enabled go to the developer tools settings (gear button) and choose "Take a fullpage screenshot" at the "Available Toolbox Buttons" section.\nsource: developer.mozilla.orgBy default the screenshots are saved in the download directory. This works similar to screenshot --fullpage in the toolbar.Update 2017-06-15As of Firefox 55 there is Firefox Screenshots as a more flexible alternative.I think what you are looking for is a utility which enables you to save a complete page opened in your browser into a png file. Most probably you are looking for a utility like commandlineprint2.After installing the extension, you just need to type the command:I ended up coding a custom solution (Firefox extension) that does this. I think by the time I developed it, the commandline mentioned in enreas wasn\'t there.The Firefox extension is CmdShots. It\'s a good option if you need finer degree of control over the process of taking the screenshot (or you want to do some HTML/JS modifications and image processing).You can use it and abuse it. I decided to keep it unlicensed, so you are free to play with it as you want.
