I want to iterate through the methods in a class, or handle class or instance objects differently based on the methods present. How do I get a list of class methods?Also see:An example (listing the methods of the optparse.OptionParser class):Notice that getmembers returns a list of 2-tuples. The first item is the name of the member, the second item is the value.You can also pass an instance to getmembers:There is the dir(theobject) method to list all the fields and methods of your object (as a tuple) and the inspect module (as codeape write) to list the fields and methods with their doc (in """).Because everything (even fields) might be called in Python, I\'m not sure there is a built-in function to list only methods. You might want to try if the object you get through dir is callable or not.Try the property __dict__.Python 3.x answer without external librariesdunder-excluded result:Note that you need to consider whether you want methods from base classes which are inherited (but not overridden) included in the result. The dir() and inspect.getmembers() operations do include base class methods, but use of the __dict__ attribute does not.you can also import the FunctionType from types and test it with the class.__dict__:SoThink Python page 210I know this is an old post, but just wrote this function and will leave it here is case someone stumbles looking for an answer:
