I\'ve heard people referring to this table and was not sure what it was about.It\'s a sort of dummy table with a single record used for selecting when you\'re not actually interested in the data, but instead want the results of some system function in a select statement:e.g. select sysdate from dual;See http://www.adp-gmbh.ch/ora/misc/dual.htmlFrom WikipediaHistoryThe DUAL table was created by Chuck Weiss of Oracle corporation to provide a table for joining in internal views:I created the DUAL table as an underlying object in the Oracle Data Dictionary. It was never meant to be seen itself, but instead used\n  inside a view that was expected to be queried. The idea was that you\n  could do a JOIN to the DUAL table and create two rows in the result\n  for every one row in your table. Then, by using GROUP BY, the\n  resulting join could be summarized to show the amount of storage for\n  the DATA extent and for the INDEX extent(s). The name, DUAL, seemed\n  apt for the process of creating a pair of rows from just one. 1It may not be obvious from the above, but the original DUAL table had two rows in it (hence its name). Nowadays it only has one row.OptimizationDUAL was originally a table and the database engine would perform disk IO on the table when selecting from DUAL. This disk IO was usually logical IO (not involving physical disk access) as the disk blocks were usually already cached in memory. This resulted in a large amount of logical IO against the DUAL table.Later versions of the Oracle database have been optimized and the database no longer performs physical or logical IO on the DUAL table even though the DUAL table still actually exists.It is a dummy table with one element in it. It is useful because Oracle doesn\'t allow statements likeYou can work around this restriction by writinginstead.I think this wikipedia article may help clarify.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DUAL_tableThe DUAL table is a special one-row\n  table present by default in all Oracle\n  database installations. It is suitable\n  for use in selecting a pseudocolumn\n  such as SYSDATE or USER The table has\n  a single VARCHAR2(1) column called\n  DUMMY that has a value of "X"It\'s the special table in Oracle. I often use it for calculations or checking system variables. For example:A utility table in Oracle with only 1 row and 1 column. It is used to perform a number of arithmetic operations and can be used generally where one needs to generate a known output.SELECT * FROM dual;will give a single row, with a single column named "DUMMY" and a value of "X" as shown here: Kind of a pseudo table you can run commands against and get back results, such as sysdate. Also helps you to check if Oracle is up and check sql syntax, etc.More Facts about the DUAL....http://asktom.oracle.com/pls/asktom/f?p=100:11:0::::P11_QUESTION_ID:1562813956388Thrilling experiments done here, and more thrilling explanations by TomThe DUAL table is a special one-row table present by default in all Oracle database installations.

For example:\nselect 1 from dual;\nreturns 1select 21+44 from dual;\nreturns 65select [sequence].nextval from dual;\nreturns the next value from the sequence.DUAL we mainly used for getting the next number from the sequences.Syntax : SELECT \'sequence_name\'.NEXTVAL FROM DUAL  This will return the one row one column value(NEXTVAL column name).
