I\'m trying to set the src attribute of an iframe from a variable and I can\'t get it to work...The markup:controllers/app.js:With this code, nothing gets inserted into the iframe\'s src attribute. It\'s just blank.Update 1:\nI injected the $sce dependancy into the AppCtrl and $sce.trustUrl() now works without throwing errors. However it returns TrustedValueHolderType which I\'m not sure how to use to insert an actual URL. The same type is returned whether I use $sce.trustUrl() inside the interpolation braces in the attribute src="{{trustUrl(currentProjectUrl))}}" or if I do it inside the controller when setting the value of currentProjectUrl. I even tried it with both.Update 2:\nI figured out how to return the url from the trustedUrlHolder using .toString() but when I do that, it throws the security warning when I try to pass it into the src attribute.Update 3:\nIt works if I use trustAsResourceUrl() in the controller and pass that to a variable used inside the ng-src attribute:My problem seems to be solved by this, although I\'m not quite sure why.I suspect looking at the excerpt that the function trustSrc from trustSrc(currentProject.url) is not defined in the controller. You need to inject the $sce service in the controller and trustAsResourceUrl the url there.In the controller:In the Template:It is the $sce service that blocks Urls with external domains, it is a service that provides Strict Contextual Escaping services to AngularJS, to prevent security vulnerabilities such as XSS, clickjacking, etc. it\'s enabled by default in Angular 1.2.you can disable it completely, but it\'s not recommendedfor more info\nhttps://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$scePlease remove call to trustSrc function and try again like this . {{trustSrc(currentProject.url)}} to {{currentProject.url}}.\nCheck this link http://plnkr.co/edit/caqS1jE9fpmMn5NofUve?p=preview\nBefore:JavascriptHtmlBut for security reason they are recommending following methodJavascriptHtmlselect template;\niframe controller, ng model updateindex.htmliframe.htmlCheck this link: http://plnkr.co/edit/TGRj2o?p=preview
