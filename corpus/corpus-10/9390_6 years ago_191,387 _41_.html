I am working on a new Android project (Java), and created an Object with a large number of variables. Since I am planning to add getters and setters for all of them, I was wondering: is there a shortcut in Eclipse for automatically generating the getters and setters in a given class?Bring up the context menu (i.e. right click) in the source code window of the desired class. Then select the Source submenu; from that menu selecting Generate Getters and Setters... will cause a wizard window will appear.Source -> Generate Getters and Setters...Select the variables you wish to create getters and setters for and click OK.Right click -> Source -> Generate setters and gettersBut to make it even more convenient, I always map this to ALT + SHIFT + G from Windows -> Preferences  -> General -> KeysIn Eclipse Juno, by default, ALT+SHIFT+S,R opens the getter/setter dialog box. Note you have to press all 4 keys.Ways to Generate Getters & Setters - 1) Press Alt+Shift+S, then R\n2) Right click -> Source -> Generate Getters & Setters \n3) Go to Source menu -> Generate Getters & Setters \n4) Go to Windows menu -> Preferences  -> General -> Keys (Write Generate Getters & Setters on text field) \n5) Click on error bulb of the field -> create getters & setters ...\n6) Press Ctrl+3 and write getters & setters on text field then select option Generate Getters & Settersif Mac OS press Alt+cmd+S then select Getters & SettersAll the other answers are just focus on the IDE level, these are not the most effective and elegant way to generate getters and setters. \nIf you have tens of attributes, the relevant getters and setters methods will make your class code very verbose.The best way I ever used to generate getters and setters automatically is using project lombok annotations in your java project, lombok.jar will generate getter and setter method when you compile java code. You just focus on class attributes/variables naming and definition, lombok will do the rest. This is easy to maintain your code. For example, if you want to add getter and setter method for age variable, you just add two lombok annotations:\nThis is equal to code like that:You can find more details about lombok here: Project LombokRight click-> generate getters and setters does the job well but if you want to create a keyboard shortcut in eclipse in windows, you can follow the following steps:Hope this helps!Sure.Use Generate Getters and Setters from the Source menu or the context menu on a selected field or type, or a text selection in a type to open the dialog. The Generate Getters and Setters dialog shows getters and setters for all fields of the selected type. The methods are grouped by the type\'s fields.Take a look at the help documentation for more information.Yes. Right-click on code and you see a menu pop up; there "Source", "Generate Getters and Setters" and next to it you can see the shortcut, which is Alt+Shift+S and R on my system.Similarly you can navigate to other submenus in that main menu, by typing the appropriate shortcut you go straight the submenu instead of main context menu, and can then either pick from menu or type another letter to pick from the list.On Mac OS it\'s Alt+Cmd+S then select "...Getters and Setters"I prefer to create the private field firstEclipse will auto highlight the variable, by positioning cursor over your new variable, press Ctrl + 1. It will then give you the menu to Create getter and setter.I press Ctrl + 1 because it is a bit more intelligent about what I think you want next.Press Alt+Shift+S+R... and then only select which all fields you have to generate Getters or Setters or bothEclipse > Source > Generate Getters and SettersRight click on the property you want to generate the getter and setters for and choose 1) Go to Windows->Preferences->General->Keys2) Select the command "Generate Getters and Setters"3) In the Binding, press the shortcut to like to use (like Alt+Shift+G) 4) Click apply and you are good to go**In Eclipse Idefor generating both setters and getters -> alt+shift+s+r then Alt A then click on ok;for generating only getters ->alt+shift+s+r then press g then click on ok button;for generating only setters ->alt+shift+s+r then press l then click on ok button;**There is an open source jar available know as Lombok ,  you just add jar and then annotate your POJO with @Getter & @Setter it will create getters and setters automatically.Apart from this we can use other features like @ToString ,@EqualsAndHashCode and pretty other cool stuff which removes vanilla code from your applicationIt opens a popup to select the fields for which getter/setter methods to be generated. Select the fields and click on "Generate" button.\n
