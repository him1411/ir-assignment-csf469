I would like to make several statements that give standard output without seeing newlines in between statements.Specifically, suppose I have:The result is:How get this to instead look like:Even better, is it possible to print the single number over the last number, so only one number is on the screen at a time?Change print item to:If you want to print the data dynamically use following syntax:By the way...... How to refresh it every time so it print mi in one place just change the number.In general, the way to do that is with terminal control codes.  This is a particularly simple case, for which you only need one special character: U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN, which is written \'\\r\' in Python (and many other languages).  Here\'s a complete example based on your code:Some things about this that may be surprising:If you find that this doesn\'t work, the first thing you should suspect is that your terminal emulator is buggy.  The vttest program can help you test it.You could replace the stdout.write with a print statement but I prefer not to mix print with direct use of file objects.Use print item, to make the print statement omit the newline.In Python 3, it\'s print(item, end=" ").If you want every number to display in the same place, use for example (Python 2.7):In Python 3, it\'s a bit more complicated; here you need to flush sys.stdout or it won\'t print anything until after the loop has finished:Like the other examples,\nI use a similar approach but instead of spending time calculating out the last output length, etc,  I simply use ANSI code escapes to move back to the beginning of the line and then clear that entire line before printing my current status output.To use in your iteration loop you would just call something like:See more hereYou can add a trailing comma to your print statement to print a space instead of a newline in each iteration:Alternatively, if you\'re using Python 2.6 or later, you can use the new print function, which would allow you to specify that not even a space should come at the end of each item being printed (or allow you to specify whatever end you want):Finally, you can write directly to standard output by importing it from the sys module, which returns a file-like object:changetoI think a simple join should work:To make the numbers overwrite each other, you can do something like this:That should work as long as the number is printed in the first column.EDIT:\nHere\'s a version that will work even if it isn\'t printed in the first column.I should note that this code was tested and works just fine in Python 2.5 on Windows, in the WIndows console. According to some others, flushing of stdout may be required to see the results. YMMV."By the way...... How to refresh it every time so it print mi in one place just change the number."It\'s really tricky topic. What zack suggested ( outputting console control codes ) is one way to achieve that.You can use (n)curses, but that works mainly on *nixes.On Windows (and here goes interesting part) which is rarely mentioned (I can\'t understand why) you can use Python bindings to WinAPI (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/ also with ActivePython by default) - it\'s not that hard and works well. Here\'s a small example:Or, if you want to use print (statement or function, no difference):win32console module enables you to do many more interesting things with windows console... I\'m not a big fan of WinAPI, but recently I realized that at least half of my antipathy towards it was caused by writing WinAPI code in C - pythonic bindings are much easier to use.All other answers are great and pythonic, of course, but... What if I wanted to print on previous line? Or write multiline text, than clear it and write the same lines again? My solution makes that possible.Another answer that I\'m using on 2.7 where I\'m just printing out a "." every time a loop runs (to indicate to the user that things are still running) is this:It prints the "." characters without spaces between each. It looks a little better and works pretty well. The \\b is a backspace character for those wondering.If you just want to print the numbers, you can avoid the loop.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100\ntook 21.1986929975ms1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 \ntook 491.466823551msThe best way to accomplish this is to use the \\r characterJust try the below code:for Python 2.7for Python 3For Python(2.7)Python 3
