I have followed these instructions below to upload a project. Global setup:But I get this error:Permission denied (publickey). fatal:\n  The remote end hung up unexpectedlyFor me the problem was the execution of clone via sudo.If you clone to a directory where you have user permission ( /home/user/git) it will work fine.(Explanation: Running a command as superuser will not work with the same public key as running a command as user. Therefore Github refused the connection.) This solution requires a SSH key already to be set up: https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keysI had to add my public key to github. https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keysYes, It\'s a public key Problem.\nI\'m a windows user,and the page below help me resolve this problem.http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git/more precisely this link should be helpful https://help.github.com/articles/error-permission-denied-publickeyafter you created the RSA key pair, you must to add it to SSH using:or wherever you created your rsa key pair.Type the following command using your username and repository name:in Ubuntu this works perfectly.I got a solution after a long time in tutorials.I followed the github tutorial on this link -> https://help.github.com/articles/error-permission-denied-publickey and I was able to connect in every step.\nBut when I was trying to git push -u origin master I got this error:Permission denied (publickey). fatal: Could not read from remote\n  repository.Please make sure you have the correct access rightsThats how I`ve fixed it!!\nGo to the project directory using the Terminal and check it outYou will get something like this:If you are using anything different then git@github.com, open the config file on git directory by typing the command:And configure the lineIn my case, I had to setup the public key for another user, as I already had one for my main user. once I switched users and performed the commands in the link above I was able to perform the setup for my test server without a problem.I had this problem, but none of the solutions above worked. I could clone and fetch but couldn\'t push. Eventually, I figured out the problem was in the url in my .git/config, it should be:(not ssh://github.com/<username>/<project>.git or https://github.com/<username>/<project>.git).Given that none of the answers here worked for me, I finally tracked down my issue connecting to Bitbucket (or Github, doesn\'t matter in this case) with ssh -vT git@bitbucket.org.In my case, the failure was due to using a DSA key instead of RSA, and apparently my SSH client no longer allows that.debug1: Skipping ssh-dss key /c/Users/USER/.ssh/id_dsa for not in PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypesThe solution was to add this to .ssh/config:This elegantly appends the ssh-dss key type to all existing accepted public key types and after this was done, git can now ssh into Bitbucket no problem.My issue was that I was trying to give my ssh key a SPECIFIC NAME every time I entered ssh-keygen on my mac terminal. I solved the issue by just leaving the name that "ssh-keygen" generates = id_rsa. You\'ll end up with 2 keys in your .ssh folder on a mac, id_rsa, which is your private key, and the id_rsa.pub, which is your public key. Then I copied and saved the code from id_rsa.pub into my GitHub account settings, and that was it. Problem solved.A good one if you have installed git on your computer:http://help.github.com/mac-set-up-git/Adding public key is the solution.For generating ssh keys: https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys  has step by step instructions.However, the problem can persist if key is not generated in the correct way.\nI found this to be a useful link too: https://help.github.com/articles/error-permission-denied-publickeyIn my case the problem was that I was generating the ssh-key without using sudo but when using git commands I needed to use sudo.\nThis comment in the above link "If you generate SSH keys without sudo, then when you try to use a command like sudo git push, you won\'t be using the SSH key you generated." helped me.So, the solution was that I had to use sudo with both key generating commands and git commands.\nOr for others, when they don\'t need sudo anywhere, do not use it in any of the two steps. (key generating and git commands).I faced a similar issue when running SSH or Git Clone in Windows. Following findings helps to solve my problem:Also, I think there  a way to \xe2\x80\x9ctell\xe2\x80\x9d git to use the default .ssh folder in home folder but still need to figure out how. For me, it worked like this: In GitHub I changed the ssh link to https, and then gave the following commands:You need to set up SSH keys.This GitHub page explains how to generate keys.If you have an existing key, you copy $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and paste it into the GitHub SSH settings page.A quick way to fix this if you\'re using a Mac is to sign out of the OSX app and log back in.My problem was that it didn\'t work with a passphrase on my private key.Hope that helps someone.I also have this problem today.\nThe solution is setting your "ssh key".\nClick the url below, follow the steps, then you will sovle it.http://github.com/guides/providing-your-ssh-keyI tried the solutions mentioned but still failed.\nI found the solution that finally worked for me here - removing then re-adding the remote linkI had the same issue on windows. I switched from SSH to HTTPS and ran a Git PUSH.Successful! hope this helps.
