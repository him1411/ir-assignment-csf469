I have below error when i execute the following script;Could you specify what it is and how it can be resolved?You\'re inserting values for OperationId that is an identity column.You can turn on identity insert on the table like this so that you can specify your own identity values.Be very wary of setting IDENTITY_INSERT to ON. This is a poor practice unless the database is in maintenance mode and set to single user. This affects not only your insert, but those of anyone else trying to access the table. Why are you trying to put a value into an identity field? don\'t put value to OperationID because it will be automatically generated. try this:Simply If you getting this error on SQL server then run this query- e.g  If table name is student then query look like this   SET IDENTITY_INSERT student ON If you getting this error on your web application or you using entity framework then first run this query on SQL server and Update your entity model (.edmx file)  and build your project and this error will be resolvedIn your entity for that table, add this line above the column for which identity insert is set:\nExample:\n[DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]\npublic int TaskId { get; set; }If you are using liquibase to update your SQL Server, you are likely trying to insert a record  key into an autoIncrement field. By removing the column from the insert, your script should run. There is pre-mentioned OperationId in your query which should not be there as it is auto increamentedso your query will be Well I solved mine pretty easy, Check that your Primary Key are the same name with your classes where the only difference is that your primary key have \'ID\' appended to it or specify [Key] on primary keys that are not related to how the class is named.And if you are using Oracle SQL Developer to connect, remember to add /sqldev:stmt//sqldev:stmt/ set identity_insert TABLE on;I\'m not sure what the use for the "Insert Table" is, but if you\'re just trying to insert some values try:I had the same error message come up, but I think this should work. The ID should auto-increment automatically as long as it\'s a primary key.The problem raised from using non-typed DBContext or DBSet if you using Interface and implement method of savechanges in a generic wayIf this is your case I propose to strongly typed DBContex for examplethen .Savechanges will work
