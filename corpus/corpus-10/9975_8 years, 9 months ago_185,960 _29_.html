What is the best way to get the current system time milliseconds?It returns the number of seconds since epoch as a double. I\'m almost sure you can access the milliseconds from the fractional part.If you\'re looking at using this for relative timing (for example for games or animation) I\'d rather useWhich is the recommended way; NSDate draws from the networked synch-clock and will occasionally hiccup when re-synching it against the network.If you want only the decimal part (often used when syncing animations),I benchmarked all the other answers on an iPhone 4S and iPad 3 (release builds). CACurrentMediaTime has the least overhead by a small margin. timeIntervalSince1970 is far slower than the others, probably due to NSDate instantiation overhead, though it may not matter for many use cases.I\'d recommend CACurrentMediaTime if you want the least overhead and don\'t mind adding the Quartz Framework dependency. Or gettimeofday if portability is a priority for you.iPhone 4SiPad 3In Swift we can make a function and do as followsThough its working fine in Swift 3.0 but we can modify and use the Date class instead of NSDate in 3.0 Swift 3.0So far I found gettimeofday a good solution on iOS (iPad), when you want to perform some interval evaluation (say, framerate, timing of a rendering frame...) :It may be useful to know about CodeTimestamps, which provide a wrapper around mach-based timing functions.  This gives you nanosecond-resolution timing data - 1000000x more precise than milliseconds.  Yes, a million times more precise.  (The prefixes are milli, micro, nano, each 1000x more precise than the last.)  Even if you don\'t need CodeTimestamps, check out the code (it\'s open source) to see how they use mach to get the timing data.  This would be useful when you need more precision and want a faster method call than the NSDate approach.http://eng.pulse.me/line-by-line-speed-analysis-for-ios-apps/Swift 2Swift 3I needed a NSNumber object containing the exact result of [[NSDate date] timeIntervalSince1970]. Since this function was called many times and I didn\'t really need to create an NSDate object, performance was not great.So to get the format that the original function was giving me, try this:Which should give you the exact same result as [[NSDate date] timeIntervalSince1970]Absolute time is measured in seconds relative to the absolute reference date of Jan 1 2001 00:00:00 GMT. A positive value represents a date after the reference date, a negative value represents a date before it. For example, the absolute time -32940326 is equivalent to December 16th, 1999 at 17:54:34. Repeated calls to this function do not guarantee monotonically increasing results. The system time may decrease due to synchronization with external time references or due to an explicit user change of the clock.Try this :In this example, dateWithTimeIntervalSince1970 is used in combination of the formatter @"YYYY-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS" that will return the date with year, month, day and the time with hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. See the example : "2015-12-02 04:43:15.008". I used the NSString to be sure that the format will be has written before.This is what I used for Swiftused this site to verify accuracy http://currentmillis.com/This is basically the same answer as posted by @TristanLorach, just recoded for Swift 3:[NSDate timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate] is another option, if you don\'t want to include the Quartz framework. It returns a double, representing seconds.Using this method:It like System.currentTimeMillis() in Java;
