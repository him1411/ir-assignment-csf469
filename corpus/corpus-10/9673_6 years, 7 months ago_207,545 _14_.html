I\'m looking for a way to generate a "Create and insert all rows" script with SQL Management Studio 2008 R2.I know that I can create a "create table" script.I can also create an "insert in" script, but that will only generate a single row with placeholders.Is there a way to generate an insert script that contains all currently stored rows?Yes, but you\'ll need to run it at the database level.Right-click the database in SSMS, select "Tasks", "Generate Scripts...".  As you work through, you\'ll get to a "Scripting Options" section.  Click on "Advanced", and in the list that pops up, where it says "Types of data to script", you\'ve got the option to select Data and/or Schema.This script generates insert statements of your existing data. This is a stored procedure which you need to run once and then it is tailor made for you.I tried to find this kind of stuff for a while but wasn\'t satisfied with the results, so I wrote this stored procedure.Example:(1) Here dbo is schema and test is tablename and 1=1 is condition. (2) Here dbo is schema and test is tablename and name=\'neeraj\' is condition.Here is the stored procedureYes, use the commercial but inexpensive SSMS Tools Pack addin which has a nifty "Generate Insert statements from resultsets, tables or database" feature
