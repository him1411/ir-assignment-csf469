With JSR 311 and it\'s implementations we have a powerful standard for exposing Java objects via Rest. However on the client side there seems to be something missing that is comparable to Apache Axis for SOAP - something that hides the web service and marshals the data transparently back to Java objects.How do you create Java RESTful clients? Using HTTPConnection and manual parsing of the result? Or specialized clients for e.g. Jersey or Apache CXR?This is an old question (2008) so there are many more options now than there were then:UPDATE circa 2014:The new kid on the block which provides NIO support (although truthfully I don\'t think this really improves performance for clients like it does servers).UPDATE 2016:A caveat on picking HTTP/REST clients. Make sure to check what your framework stack is using for an HTTP client, how it does threading, and ideally use the same client if it offers one. That is if your using something like Vert.x or Play you may want to try to use its backing client to participate in whatever bus or reactor loop the framework provides... otherwise be prepared for possibly interesting threading issues.As I mentioned in this thread I tend to use Jersey which implements JAX-RS and comes with a nice REST client. The nice thing is if you implement your RESTful resources using JAX-RS then the Jersey client can reuse the entity providers such as for JAXB/XML/JSON/Atom and so forth - so you can reuse the same objects on the server side as you use on the client side unit test.For example here is a unit test case from the Apache Camel project which looks up XML payloads from a RESTful resource (using the JAXB object Endpoints). The resource(uri) method is defined in this base class which just uses the Jersey client API.e.g. BTW I hope that future version of JAX-RS add a nice client side API along the lines of the one in JerseyYou can use the standard Java SE APIs:Or you can use the REST client APIs provided by JAX-RS implementations such as Jersey. These APIs are easier to use, but require additional jars on your class path.For more information see:You can also check Restlet which has full client-side capabilities, more REST oriented that lower-level libraries such as HttpURLConnection or Apache HTTP Client (which we can leverage as connectors).Best regards,\nJerome LouvelIf you only wish to invoke a REST service and parse the response you can try out Rest AssuredYou could try Rapa. Let us know your feedback about the same.\nAnd feel free to log issues or expected features.I\'d like to point out 2 more options:I\'ve recently tried Retrofit Library from square, Its great and you can call your rest API very easily. \nAnnotation based configuration allows us to get rid of lot of boiler plate coding.I use Apache HTTPClient to handle all the HTTP side of things.I write XML SAX parsers for the XML content that parses the XML into your object model. I believe that Axis2 also exposes XML -> Model methods (Axis 1 hid this part, annoyingly). XML generators are trivially simple.It doesn\'t take long to code, and is quite efficient, in my opinion.OkHttp is lightweight and powerful when combined with Retrofit as well.  This works well for general Java use as well as on Android.OkHttp: http://square.github.io/okhttp/Retrofit: http://square.github.io/retrofit/Try JdkRequest from jcabi-http (I\'m a developer). This is how it works:Check this blog post for more details: http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/11/jcabi-http-intro.htmlFor a while now, I\'ve been using Resty:JSONResource jsonResource = new Resty().json(uri);One can find some examples here.I wrote a library that maps a java interface to a remote JSON REST service:https://github.com/ggeorgovassilis/spring-rest-invokerTry looking at http-rest-clienthttps://github.com/g00dnatur3/http-rest-clientHere is a simple example:The library takes care of json serialization and binding for you.Here is another example, And one last example,Cheers!Though its simple to create a HTTP client and make a reuest. But if you want to make use of some auto generated clients,  You can make use of WADL to describe and generate code. You can use RestDescribe to generate and compile WSDL, you can generate clients in php, ruby, python, java and C# using this. It generates clean code and there is a good change that you have to tweak it a bit after code generation, you can find good documentation and underlying thoughts behind the tool here.There are few interesting and useful WADL tools mentioned on wintermute.You can use java.net.URLFrom a URL, you can create an HttpURLConnection that allows you to invoke specificExamples of jersey Rest client :\nAdding dependency : ForGetMethod and passing two parameter : GetMethod  passing one parameter and Getting a Respone of List :     In Above It Returns a List which we are accepting as a List and then converting it to Json Array and then Json Array to List .
