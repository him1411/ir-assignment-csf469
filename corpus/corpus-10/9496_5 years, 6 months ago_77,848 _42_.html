What is the difference between onInterceptTouchEvent and dispatchTouchEvent in Android?According to the android developer guide, both methods can be used to intercept a touch event (MotionEvent), but what is the difference?How do onInterceptTouchEvent, dispatchTouchEvent and onTouchEvent interact together within a hierarchy of Views (ViewGroup)?The best place to demystify this is the source code. The docs are woefully inadequate about explaining this.dispatchTouchEvent is actually defined on Activity, View and ViewGroup. Think of it as a controller which decides how to route the touch events. For example, the simplest case is that of View.dispatchTouchEvent which will route the touch event to either OnTouchListener.onTouch if it\'s defined or to the extension method onTouchEvent.For ViewGroup.dispatchTouchEvent things are way more complicated. It needs to figure out which one of its child views should get the event (by calling child.dispatchTouchEvent). This is basically a hit testing algorithm where you figure out which child view\'s bounding rectangle contains the touch point coordinates.But before it can dispatch the event to the appropriate child view, the parent can spy and/or intercept the event all together. This is what onInterceptTouchEvent is there for. So it calls this method first before doing the hit testing and if the event was hijacked (by returning true from onInterceptTouchEvent) it sends a ACTION_CANCEL to the child views so they can abandon their touch event processing (from previous touch events) and from then onwards all touch events at the parent level are dispatched to onTouchListener.onTouch (if defined) or onTouchEvent(). Also in that case, onInterceptTouchEvent is never called again.Would you even want to override [Activity|ViewGroup|View].dispatchTouchEvent? Unless you are doing some custom routing you probably should not. The main extension methods are ViewGroup.onInterceptTouchEvent if you want to spy and/or intercept touch event at the parent level and View.onTouchListener/View.onTouchEvent for main event handling.All in all its overly complicated design imo but android apis lean more towards flexibility than simplicity.Because this is the first result on Google. I want to share with you a great Talk by Dave Smith on Youtube: Mastering the Android Touch System and the slides are available here. It gave me a good deep understanding about the Android Touch System:How the Activity handles touch:How the View handles touch:How a ViewGroup handles touch:He also provides example code of custom touch on github.com/devunwired/.Answer:\nBasically the dispatchTouchEvent() is called on every View layer to determine if a View is interested in an ongoing gesture. In a ViewGroup the ViewGroup has the ability to steal the touch events in his dispatchTouchEvent()-method, before it would call dispatchTouchEvent() on the children. The ViewGroup would only stop the dispatching if the ViewGroup onInterceptTouchEvent()-method returns true. The difference is that dispatchTouchEvent()is dispatching MotionEvents and onInterceptTouchEvent tells if it should intercept (not dispatching the MotionEvent to children) or not (dispatching to children).You could imagine the code of a ViewGroup doing more-or-less this (very simplified):There is a lot of confusion about these methods, but it is actually not that complicated. Most of the confusion is because:Processing order is like this:If you want to preview TouchEvents/MotionEvents without disabling the events on your children, you must do two things:If you want to detect some gesture like a swipe event, without disabling other events on your children as long as you did not detect the gesture, you can do it like this:Example of overrides in a FrameLayout (my example in is C# as I\xe2\x80\x99m programming with Xamarin Android, but the logic is the same in Java):I came accross very intuitive explanation at this webpage http://doandroids.com/blogs/tag/codeexample/. Taken from there:dispatchTouchEvent handles before onInterceptTouchEvent.Using this simple example:You can see that the log willl be like:So in case you are working with these 2 handlers use dispatchTouchEvent to handle on first instance the event, which will go to onInterceptTouchEvent.Another difference is that if dispatchTouchEvent return \'false\' the event dont get propagated to the child, in this case the EditText, whereas if you return false in onInterceptTouchEvent the event still get dispatch to the EditTextYou can find the answer in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYoN-OvdZ3M&list=PLonJJ3BVjZW6CtAMbJz1XD8ELUs1KXaTD&index=19 and the next 3 videos. All the touch events are explained very well, it\'s very clear and full of examples.The following code within a ViewGroup subclass would prevent it\'s parent containers from receiving touch events:I used this with a custom overlay to prevent background views from responding to touch events.The main difference : \xe2\x80\xa2Activity.dispatchTouchEvent(MotionEvent) - This allows your Activity\n  to intercept all touch events before they are dispatched to the\n  window. \n  \xe2\x80\xa2ViewGroup.onInterceptTouchEvent(MotionEvent) - This allows a\n  ViewGroup to watch events as they are dispatched to child Views.ViewGroup\'s onInterceptTouchEvent() is always the entry point for ACTION_DOWN event which is first event to occur. If you want ViewGroup to process this gesture, return true from onInterceptTouchEvent().\nOn returning true, ViewGroup\'s onTouchEvent() will receive all subsequent events till next ACTION_UP or ACTION_CANCEL, and in most cases, the touch events between ACTION_DOWN and ACTION_UP or ACTION_CANCEL are ACTION_MOVE, which will normally be recognized as scrolling/fling gestures.If you return false from onInterceptTouchEvent(), the target view\'s onTouchEvent() will be called. It will be repeated for subsequent messages till you return true from onInterceptTouchEvent().Source:\nhttp://neevek.net/posts/2013/10/13/implementing-onInterceptTouchEvent-and-onTouchEvent-for-ViewGroup.htmlBoth Activity and View have method dispatchTouchEvent() and onTouchEvent.The ViewGroup have this methods too, but have another method called onInterceptTouchEvent. The return type of those methods are boolean, you can control the dispatch route through the return value.The event dispatch in Android starts from Activity->ViewGroup->View.Small answer:onInterceptTouchEvent comes before setOnTouchListener.
