The man page for git-diff is rather long, and explains many cases which don\'t seem to be necessary for a beginner. For example:Lets take a look at example advanced diff from git history (in commit 1088261f in git.git repository):Lets analyze this patch line by line.The first line Next are one or more extended header lines.  The first threeNext is two-line unified diff headerNext come one or more hunks of differences; each hunk shows one area where the files differ.  Unified format hunks starts with line likeThe optional header shows the C function where each change occurs, if it is a C file (like -p option in GNU diff), or the equivalent, if any, for other types of files.Next comes the description of where files differ.  The lines common to both files begin with a space character. The lines that actually differ between the two files have one of the following indicator characters in the left print column:So, for example, first chunkmeans that cmd_http_fetch was replaced by main, and that const char *prefix; line was added.In other words, before the change, the appropriate fragment of then \'builtin-http-fetch.c\' file looked like this:After the change this fragment of now \'http-fetch.c\' file looks like this instead:There might be As Donal Fellows said it is best to practice reading diffs on real-life examples, where you know what you have changed.References:@@ -1,2 +3,4 @@ part of the diffThis part took me a while to understand, so I\'ve created a minimal example.The format is basically the same the diff -u unified diff.For instance:Here we removed lines 2, 3, 14 and 15. Output:@@ -1,6 +1,4 @@ means:-1,6: this piece corresponds to line 1 to 6 of the first file:- means "old", as we usually invoke it as diff -u old new.+1,4 says that this piece corresponds to line 1 to 4 of the second file.+ means "new".We only have 4 lines instead of 6 because 2 lines were removed! The new hunk is just:@@ -11,6 +9,4 @@ for the second hunk is analogous:on the old file, we have 6 lines, starting at line 11 of the old file:on the new file, we have 4 lines, starting at line 9 of the new file:Note that line 11 is the 9th line of the new file because we have already removed 2 lines on the previous hunk: 2 and 3.Hunk headerDepending on your git version and configuration, you can also get a code line next to the @@ line, e.g. the func1() { in:This can also be obtained with the -p flag of plain diff.Example: old file:If we remove line 6, the diff shows:Note that this is not the correct line for func1: it skipped lines 1 and 2.This awesome feature often tells exactly to which function or class each hunk belongs, which is very useful to interpret the diff.How the algorithm to choose the header works exactly is discussed at: Where does the excerpt in the git diff hunk header come from? Here\'s the simple example.Here\'s an explanation (see details here). The default output format (which originally comes from a program known as diff if you want to look for more info) is known as a \xe2\x80\x9cunified diff\xe2\x80\x9d. It contains essentially 4 different types of lines:I advise that you practice reading diffs between two versions of a file where you know exactly what you changed. Like that you\'ll recognize just what is going on when you see it.On my mac: info diff then select: Output formats -> Context -> Unified format -> Detailed Unified :Or online man diff on gnu following the same path to the same section:File: diff.info,  Node: Detailed\n  Unified,  Next: Example Unified,  Up:\n  Unified FormatDetailed Description of Unified Format\n  ......................................The unified output format starts\n  with a two-line header, which looks\n  like this:The time stamp looks like `2002-02-21\n  23:30:39.942229878 -0800\' to indicate\n  the date, time with fractional\n  seconds, and time zone.You can change the header\'s content\n  with the `--label=LABEL\' option; see\n  *Note Alternate Names::.Next come one or more hunks of\n  differences; each hunk shows one area\n  where the files differ.

Just in case, here\'s a quick overview of the header.The first line is something like diff --git a/path/to/file b/path/to/file - obviously it\'s just telling you what file this section of the diff is for. If you set the boolean config variable diff.mnemonic prefix, the a and b will be changed to more descriptive letters like c and w (commit and work tree).Next, there are "mode lines" - lines giving you a description of any changes that don\'t involve changing the content of the file. This includes new/deleted files, renamed/copied files, and permissions changes.Finally, there\'s a line like index 789bd4..0afb621 100644. You\'ll probably never care about it, but those 6-digit hex numbers are the abbreviated SHA1 hashes of the old and new blobs for this file (a blob is a git object storing raw data like a file\'s contents). And of course, the 100644 is the file\'s mode - the last three digits are obviously permissions; the first three give extra file metadata information (SO post describing that).After that, you\'re on to standard unified diff output (just like the classic diff -U). It\'s split up into hunks - a hunk is a section of the file containing changes and their context. Each hunk is preceded by a pair of --- and +++ lines denoting the file in question, then the actual diff is (by default) three lines of context on either side of the - and + lines showing the removed/added lines.
