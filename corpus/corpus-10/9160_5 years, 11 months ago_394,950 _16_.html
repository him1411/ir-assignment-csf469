Is there a built-in or standard library method in Python to calculate the arithmetic mean (average) of a list of numbers?I am not aware of anything in the standard library. However, you could use something like:In numpy, there\'s numpy.mean().NumPy has a numpy.mean which is an arithmetic mean. Usage is as simple as this:In Python 3.4, there is a new statistics module. You can now use statistics.mean:For 3.1-3.3 users, the original version of the module is available on PyPI under the name stats. Just change statistics to stats.You don\'t even need numpy or scipy...Use scipy:Instead of casting to float you can do followingor using lambdaOthers already posted very good answers, but some people might still be looking for a classic way to find Mean(avg), so here I post this (code tested in Python 3.6):I always supposed avg is omitted from the builtins/stdlib because it is as simple asand any caveats would be addressed in caller code for local usage already.Notable caveats:non-float result: in python2, 9/4 is 2. to resolve, use float(sum(L))/len(L) or from __future__ import divisiondivision by zero: the list may be empty. to resolve:
