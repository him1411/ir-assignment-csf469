How can you change the default version of Java on a mac?First run /usr/libexec/java_home -V which will output something like the following:Pick the version you want to be the default (1.6.0_65-b14-462 for arguments sake) then:or you can specify just the major version, if it\'s unique, likeNow when you run java -version you will see:Just add the export JAVA_HOME\xe2\x80\xa6 line to your shell\xe2\x80\x99s init file.A small fish function based on /usr/libexec/java_homeIf you don\'t use fish, you can do something similar in bash:Then to switch between javas do:ref: https://gist.github.com/kenglxn/1843d552dff4d4233271Use jenv is an easy way.1.Install jenv2.Config jenv3.Symlink the jdk path4.You are all setswitch command: jenv use java 1.8set default: jenv default java 1.7It is a little bit tricky, but try to follow the steps described in Installing Java on OS X 10.9 (Mavericks). Basically, you gonna have to update your alias to java.Step by step:After installing JDK 1.7, you will need to do the sudo ln -snf in order to change the link to current java. To do so, open Terminal and issue the command:Note that the directory jdk1.7.0_51.jdk may change depending on the SDK version you have installed.Now, you need to set JAVA_HOME to point to where jdk_1.7.0_xx.jdk was installed. Open again the Terminal and type:You can add the export JAVA_HOME line above in your .bashrc file to have java permanently in your TerminalAdding to the above answers, I put the following lines in my .bash_profile which makes it really convenient to switch:I can switch to Java 8 by typing the following:This answer is an attempt to address: how to control java version system-wide (not just in currently running shell) when several versions of JDK are installed for development purposes on macOS El Capitan & Sierra. As far as I can tell, none of the current answers do that (*).As a developer, I use several JDKs, and I want to switch from one to the other easily. Usually I have the latest stable one (Java 8 now) for general use, and others for tests (e.g one old JDK7 and one "early access" JDK9 for example). But I don\'t want the system to use Java 9 (e.g. when I start my IDE) for now. Default should be latest stable.System launcher will use the JDK with highest version among those that have an Info.plist file.When working in a shell with alternate JDK, pick your method among existing answers (jenv, or custom aliases/scripts around /usr/libexec/java_home, etc).Details of investigation in this gist.(*) Current answers are either obsolete (no longer valid for macOS El Capitan or Sierra), or only address a single JDK, or do not address the system-wide aspect. Many explain how to change $JAVA_HOME, but this only affects the current shell and what is launched from there. It won\'t affect an application started from OS launcher (unless you change the right file and logout/login, which is tedious). Same for jenv, it\'s cool and all, but as far as I can tell it merely changes environment variables, so it has the same limitation.install JDK, not just JREgivesnextTextEdit will show you a blank page which you can fill in.add to doc: \n    export   JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_111.jdk/Contents/Homein terminal:try the command:javac -versionshould output:From the Apple\'s official java_home(1) man page:put this in your ~/.profile and use it in your terminal like so  setjdk 1.8 setjdk 1.7 etc etc...This tool will do the work for you: http://www.guigarage.com/2013/02/change-java-version-on-mac-os/It\'s a simple JavaOne that can be used to define the current Java Version. The version can be used in a shell that is opened after a version was selected in the tool.If you have multiple versions and you want to run something by using a specific version, use this example:Based on @markhellewell answer I created a couple of alias functions that will do it for you.
