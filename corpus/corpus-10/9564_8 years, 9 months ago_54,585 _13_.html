This works by creating a folder with a Gemfile specifying the desired version of Rails and then using bundle exec rails... so that Bundler takes care of running  the appropriate version of rails. e.g. to make a new Rails 4.2.9 projects the steps are:You can generate the skeleton with either version and require the one you want in config/environment.rb:or use the "rails" command form the version you want anyway.You should also take a look at "freezing" your Rails gems into the app. This helps a lot with deployment, specially in shared hosting environments.Just change the RAILS_GEM_VERSION variable in config/environment.rb and issue the freeze rake task:
