I have a background image in the following div, but the image gets cut off:Is there a way to show the background image without cutting it off?You can achieve this with the background-size property, which is now supported by most browsers.To scale the background image to fit inside the div:To scale the background image to cover the whole div:JSFiddle exampleThere also exists a filter for IE 5.5+ support, as well as vendor prefixes for some older browsers.If what you need is the image has the same dimensions of the div, I think this is the most elegant solution:If not, the answer by @grc is the most appropriated.Source:\nhttp://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_background-size.aspyou also use this:I don\'t know your div-values, but let\'s assume you\'ve got those.Again, those are just random numbers.\nIt could quite hard to make the background-image (if you would want to) with a fixed width for the div, so better use max-width. And actually it isn\'t complicated to fill a div with an background-image, just make sure you style the parent element the right way, so the image has a place it can go into.Chris Its either you change your div width and height or set the background size.
