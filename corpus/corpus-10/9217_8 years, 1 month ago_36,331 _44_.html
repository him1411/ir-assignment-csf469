The default git diff behavior is to open each diff file in serial (wait for previous file to be closed before opening next file). I\'m looking for a way to open all the files at once - in BeyondCompare for example this would open all the files in tabs within the same BC window.This would make it easier to review a complex set of changes; flick back and forwards between the diff files and ignore unimportant files.Starting with git v1.7.11, you can use git difftool --dir-diff to perform a directory diff.The answer that follows applies to git installations older than v1.7.11.This same question was asked on the git mail list.I put together a shell script based on that email thread which performs a directory diff between arbitrary commits.Starting with git v1.7.10, the git-diffall script is included in the contrib of the standard git installation.For versions before v1.7.10, you can install from the git-diffall project on GitHub.  Here is the project description:The git-diffall script provides a\n  directory based diff mechanism for\n  git.  The script relies on the\n  diff.tool configuration option to\n  determine what diff viewer is used.This script is compatible with all the\n  forms used to specify a range of\n  revisions to diff:1) git diffall: shows diff between\n  working tree and staged changes\n    2) git diffall --cached [<commit>]: shows\n  diff between staged changes and HEAD\n  (or other named commit)\n    3) git diffall <commit>: shows diff between\n  working tree and named commit\n    4) git diffall <commit> <commit>: show diff\n  between two named commits\n    5) git diffall <commit>..<commit>: same as\n  above\n    6) git diffall <commit>...<commit>: show the changes\n  on the branch containing and up to the\n  second , starting at a    common\n  ancestor of both <commit>Note: all forms take an optional path\n  limiter [--] [<path>]This script is based on an example\n  provided by Thomas Rast on the Git\n  list.Here\'s what I settled on...Copy the following code to a file called git-diffall (no extension):Place the file in the cmd folder of your git install dir (eg C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\cmd)And use like you would git diff:Notes: The key to it is the & param which tells the external diff command to run in a background task so files are processed immediately. In the case of BeyondCompare this opens one screen with each file in its own tab.meld has a neat feature that if you give it a directory under source control (Git, Mercurial, Subversion, Bazaar and probably others) it will automatically list all the changed files and you can double-click to view the individual differences.IMO it\'s much easier to type meld . and have it figure out the VCS than configure your VCS to launch meld. Plus you can use the same command no matter what VCS your project happens to be using, which is great if you switch between them a lot.The only downside is it is slower for meld to scan for changes than to be passed the changes from git/hg/svn, though whether it\'s slow enough to be a problem will depend on how you\'re using it I\'m sure.I did find this method (GitDiff.bat and GitDiff.rb) that copies the files out to old/new temp dirs and then does a folder compare on them. But I\'d rather view the working files directly (from the working dir), as BeyondCompare has the handy feature of being able to edit the file from within the diff window which is great for quick cleanups.Edit: a similar method here in response to my question on the git mailing list.git meld => https://github.com/wmanley/git-meld is an awesome script which will open a neat diff of all the files in a single window.Noticed here that Araxis Merge has a \'-nowait\' command option: -nowait Prevents compare from waiting for a comparison to be closedMaybe this returns an immediate exit code and would work, anyone experienced this? Can\'t find similar option for BeyondCompare...If all you want to do is open all the files that are currently modified, try something like:If you are making commits of "complex sets of changes", you might want to reconsider your workflow.  One of the really nice features of git is that it makes it easy for the developer to reduce complex change sets to a series of simple patches.  Rather than trying to edit all of the files that are currently modified, you might want to look into I\'ve written a powershell script that will duplicate two working trees and compare with DiffMerge.  So you can do:To compare the master branch three checkins ago with the current working tree, for instance.Its shiny and new and probably full of bugs.  One drawback is that files in your working tree that have not been added yet are copied out to both working trees.  It can also be slow.http://github.com/fschwiet/GitNdiffFor those interested in using git-diffall on Mac OS X with Araxis, I forked the git-diffall project on github and added an AppleScript that wraps the Araxis Merge command. Note: this is a slightly modified clone of the araxisgitdiff file that ships with Araxis Merge for Mac OS X.https://github.com/sorens/git-diffallDiffuse also has VCS integration. It interoperates with a plethora of other VCS, including SVN, Mercurial, Bazaar, ... For Git, it will even show three panes if some but not all changes are staged. In the case of conflicts, there will even be four panes.Invoke it within your Git working copy.If you ask me, the best visual differ I\'ve seen for a decade. (And I\'ve tried meld, too.) You can use gitk and see all the differences at the same time
