In many SO questions and bash tutorials I see that I can access command line args in bash scripts in two ways:Which results in:What is the difference between $* and $@?\nWhen should one use the former and when shall one use the latter?The difference appears when the special parameters are quoted. Let me illustrate the differences:one further example on the importance of quoting: note there are 2 spaces between "arg" and the number, but if I fail to quote $word:and in bash, "$@" is the "default" list to iterate over:A nice handy overview table from the Bash Hackers Wiki:$*Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one. When the\n  expansion occurs within double quotes, it expands to a single word\n  with the value of each parameter separated by the first character of\n  the IFS special variable. That is, "$*" is equivalent to "$1c$2c...",\n  where c is the first character of the value of the IFS variable. If\n  IFS is unset, the parameters are separated by spaces. If IFS is null,\n  the parameters are joined without intervening separators.$@Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one. When the\n  expansion occurs within double quotes, each parameter expands to a\n  separate word. That is, "$@" is equivalent to "$1" "$2" ... If the\n  double-quoted expansion occurs within a word, the expansion of the\n  first parameter is joined with the beginning part of the original\n  word, and the expansion of the last parameter is joined with the last\n  part of the original word. When there are no positional parameters,\n  "$@" and $@ expand to nothing (i.e., they are removed).Source: Bash man$@ is same as $*, but each parameter is a quoted string, that is, the parameters are passed on intact, without interpretation or expansion. This means, among other things, that each parameter in the argument list is seen as a separate word.Of course, "$@" should be quoted.http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/internalvariables.html#ARGLIST
