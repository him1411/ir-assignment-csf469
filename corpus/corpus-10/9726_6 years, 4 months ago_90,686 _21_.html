I have a problem with the transfer of variable \'insurance_mode\' by the decorator. I would do it by the following decorator statement:but unfortunately, this statement does not work. Perhaps maybe there is better way to solve this problem.You mean def test_booking_gta_object, right? Anyway, the syntax for decorators with arguments is a bit different - the decorator with arguments should return a function that will take a function and return another function. So it should really return a normal decorator. A bit confusing, right? What I mean is:Here you can read more on the subject - it\'s also possible to implement this using callable objects and that is also explained there.One way of thinking about decorators with arguments istranslates toSo if the decorator had arguments,translates todecorator_with_args is a function which accepts a custom argument and which returns the actual decorator (that will be applied to the decorated function).I use a simple trick with partials to make my decorators easyEven if this question was already answered and accepted, I\'d like to show an idea which is IMHO quite elegant. The solution proposed by t.dubrownik shows a pattern which is always the same: you need the three-layered wrapper regardless of what the decorator does.So I tought this is a job for a meta-decorator, that is a decorator for decorators. As a decorator is a function, it actually works as a regular decorator with arguments:This can be applied to a regular decorator in order to add parameters. So for instance, say we have the decorator which doubles the result of a function:With @parametrized we can build a generic @multiply decorator having a parameterConventionally the first parameter of a parametrized decorator is the function, while the remaining arguments will correspond to the parameter of the parametrized decorator.An interesting usage example could be a type-safe assertive decorator:I presume your problem is passing arguments to your decorator.  This is a little tricky and not straight forward.Here\'s an example of how to do this:Prints:See Bruce Eckel\'s article for more details.Here is a slightly modified version of t.dubrownik\'s answer. Why? 1) As a general template, you should return the return value from the original function. 2) This changes the name of the function, which could affect other decorators / code. So use functools @wraps:
