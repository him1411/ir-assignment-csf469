I have searched high and low and get a lot of different solutions and varialbles containing info to get the absolute path. But they seem to work under some conditions and not under others. Is there one silver bullet way to get the absolute path to the current executing script in php? For me the script will be running from the command line but it should just as well function if run within apache etc.Clarification: The initial executed script, not the file we are currently in__FILE__ constant will give you absolute path to current file.UPD:As soon as question was changed to retrieve the script that initiated runtime the only (??) reliable way to do that is to use the debug_backtrace function.If you place this in an included file, it prints the path to this include. To get the path of the parent script, replace __FILE__ with $_SERVER[\'PHP_SELF\']. But be aware that PHP_SELF is a security risk!example for URL:  http://example.com/folder1/folder2/yourfile.php?var=blabla#12345Notice:hastag (#...) url parts cant be detected from PHP (server-side). For that, use Javascript.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR returns \\ for Windows-type hostings, instead of /.The directory of the file. If used inside an include, the directory of the included file is returned. This is equivalent to dirname(__FILE__). This directory name does not have a trailing slash unless it is the root directory.getcwd() is the proper answer - http://php.net/manual/en/function.getcwd.php__FILE__ will return path with filename for example on XAMPP C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\index.phpWhat You want is to get current working directory so use getcwd() to get C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\will give the absolute route  of the current file from which you are demanding the route, the route of your server directory.example files :www/http/html/index.php ; if you place this code inside your index.php it will return:<?php \necho dirname(__FILE__); // this will return: www/http/html/www/http/html/class/myclass.php ; if you place this code inside your myclass.php it will return:<?php \necho dirname(__FILE__); // this will return: www/http/html/class/If you\'re looking for the absolute path relative to the server root, I\'ve found that this works well:it gives you current script(the script inside which you placed this code) directory without trailing slash.\nthis is important if you want to include other files with the resultJust use below :Here\'s a useful PHP function I wrote for this precisely. As the original question clarifies, it returns the path from which the initial script was executed - not the file we are currently in.For script run under web server $_SERVER[\'SCRIPT_FILENAME\'] will contain the full path to the initially called script, so probably your index.php. realpath() is not required in this case. For the script run from console $_SERVER[\'SCRIPT_FILENAME\'] will contain relative path to your initially called script from your current working dir. So unless you changed working directory inside your script it will resolve to the absolute path. In case of using framework, most of them is not working, so I have found the solution for that. Code:It should give the absolute path, including file name.try this on your script
