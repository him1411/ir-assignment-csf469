Let\'s say I have a directory, /X/Y, which is a git repository. Is it possible to somehow call a command like git pull from inside /X, but targeting the /X/Y directory?EDIT: I guess I was wondering specifically: is it possible to do this using the a git command, but without having to change directories?NOTE: I\'ve accepted VonC\'s answer as it\'s much more elegant than previous options. For people running Git older than 1.8.5, please see bstpierre\'s answer below.Starting git 1.8.5 (Q4 2013), you will be able to "use a Git command, but without having to change directories".Just like "make -C <directory>", "git -C <directory> ..." tells Git to go there before doing anything else.See commit 44e1e4 by Nazri Ramliy:It takes more keypresses to invoke Git command in a different directory without leaving the current directory:The methods shown above are acceptable for scripting but are too cumbersome for quick command line invocations.With this new option, the above can be done with fewer keystrokes:Since Git 2.3.4 (March 2015), and commit 6a536e2 by Karthik Nayak (KarthikNayak), git will treat "git -C \'<path>\'" as a no-op when <path> is empty. \'git -C ""\' unhelpfully dies with error "Cannot change to \'\'", whereas the shell treats cd ""\' as a no-op.\n  Taking the shell\'s behavior as a precedent, teach git to treat -C ""\' as a no-op, as well.Edit:There\'s either a bug with git pull, or you can\'t do what you\'re trying to do with that command. You can however, do it with fetch and merge:Original answer:Assuming you\'re running bash or similar, you can do (cd /X/Y; git pull).The git man page specifies some variables (see "The git Repository") that seem like they should help, but I can\'t make them work right (with my repository in /tmp/ggg2):Running the command below while my cwd is /tmp updates that repo, but the updated file appears in /tmp instead of the working tree /tmp/ggg2:See also this answer to a similar question, which demonstrates the --git-dir and --work-tree flags.You may wrap it in a bash script or git alias:This post is a bit old so could be there was a bug andit was fixed, but I just did this: And it worked. Took me a minute to figure out that it wanted the dotfile and the parent directory (in a standard setup those are always parent/child but not in ALL setups, so they need to be specified explicitly. As some of my servers are on an old Ubuntu LTS versions, I can\'t easily upgrade git to the latest version (which supports the -C option as described in some answers).This trick works well for me, especially because it does not have the side effect of some other answers that leave you in a different directory from where you started.Or, doing it as a one-liner:Both Linux and Windows have pushd and popd commands.You can write a script like this:You can name it something like gitpull.\nIf you\'d rather have it do arbitrary directories instead of /X/Y:Then you can call it with gitpull /X/Z\nLastly, you can try finding repositories.  I have a ~/git folder which contains repositories, and you can use this to do a pull on all of them.For anyone like me that was trying to do this via a drush (Drupal shell) command on a remote server, you will not be able to use the solution that requires you to CD into the working directory:Instead you need to use the solution that breaks up the pull into a fetch & merge:This might be a similar problem, but you can also simply chain you commands. egOn one lineOr via SSH.
