I am using the following code to check if a variable is not nil and not zeroIs there a better way to do this?Beware of the usual disclaimers... great power/responsibility, monkey patching leading to the dark side etc.ok, after 5 years have passed....From Ruby 2.3.0 onward, you can combine the safe navigation operator (&.) with Numeric#nonzero?. &. returns nil if the instance was nil and nonzero? - if the number was 0:Or postfix:You could do this:The order is important here, because if discount is nil, then it will not have a zero? method. Ruby\'s short-circuit evaluation should prevent it from trying to evaluate discount.zero?, however, if discount is nil.You can convert your empty row to integer value and check zero?.update, it will false for discount = falseYou can take advantage of the NilClass provided #to_i method, which will return zero for nil values:If discount can be fractional numbers, you can use #to_f instead, to prevent the number from being rounded to zero.If we pass "" it will return false whereas blank? returns true.\nSame is the case when data = false\nblank? returns true for nil, false, empty, or a whitespace string.\nSo it\'s better to use blank? method to avoid empty string as well.When dealing with a database record, I like to initialize all empty values with 0, using the migration helper:You could initialize discount to 0 as long as your code is guaranteed not to try and use it before it is initialized.  That would remove one check I suppose, I can\'t think of anything else.I believe the following is good enough for ruby code.  I don\'t think I could write a unit test that shows any difference between this and the original.
