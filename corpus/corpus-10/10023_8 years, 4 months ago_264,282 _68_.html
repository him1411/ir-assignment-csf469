What is the difference between JOIN and UNION? Can I have an example?UNION puts lines from queries after each other, while JOIN makes a cartesian product and subsets it -- completely different operations. Trivial example of UNION:similary trivial example of JOIN:UNION combines the results of two or more queries into a single result set that includes all the rows that belong to all queries in the union.By using JOINs, you can retrieve data from two or more tables based on logical relationships between the tables. Joins indicate how SQL should use data from one table to select the rows in another table.The UNION operation is different from using JOINs that combine columns from two tables.UNION Example:Output:JOIN Example:This will output all the rows from both the tables for which the condition a.Id = b.AFKId is true.A join is used for displaying columns with the same or\ndifferent names from different tables. The output displayed\nwill have all the columns shown individually. That is, the\ncolumns will be aligned next to each other.The UNION set operator is used for combining data from two\ntables which have columns with the same datatype.\nWhen a UNION is performed the data from both tables will be\ncollected in a single column having the same datatype.For example:See the two tables shown below:Now for performing a JOIN type the query is shown below.That is a join.UNION means that you have to tables or resultset with the\nsame amount and type of columns and you add this to\ntables/resultsets together. Look at this example:You  may see the same schematic explanations for both, but these are totally confusing.For UNION:For JOIN:They\'re completely different things.A join allows you to relate similar data in different tables.A union returns the results of two different queries as a single recordset.Union makes two queries look like one. Joins are for examining two or more tables in a single query statementJoins and unions can be used to combine data from one or more tables. The difference lies in how the data is combined.In simple terms, joins combine data into new columns. If two tables are joined together, then the data from the first table is shown in one set of column alongside the second table\xe2\x80\x99s column in the same row.Unions combine data into new rows. If two tables are \xe2\x80\x9cunioned\xe2\x80\x9d together, then the data from the first table is in one set of rows, and the data from the second table in another set. The rows are in the same result.Remember that union will merge results (SQL Server to be sure)(feature or bug?)id,value1,3id,value,id,value1,3,1,31.\nThe SQL Joins clause is used to combine records from two or more tables in a database. A JOIN is a means for combining fields from two tables by using values common to each. 2.\nThe SQL UNION operator combines the result of two or more SELECT statements.\nEach SELECT statement within the UNION must have the same number of columns. The columns must also have similar data types. Also, the columns in each SELECT statement must be in the same order.for example:\ntable 1 customers/table 2 ordersinner join:SELECT ID, NAME, AMOUNT, DATEFROM CUSTOMERS\xe2\x80\xa8INNER JOIN ORDERS\xe2\x80\xa8ON CUSTOMERS.ID = ORDERS.CUSTOMER_ID; union:SELECT ID, NAME, AMOUNT, DATE\xe2\x80\xa8FROM CUSTOMERS\xe2\x80\xa8LEFT JOIN ORDERS\xe2\x80\xa8ON CUSTOMERS.ID = ORDERS.CUSTOMER_ID UNION SELECT ID, NAME, AMOUNT, DATE\n\xe2\x80\xa8\nFROM CUSTOMERS\xe2\x80\xa8RIGHT JOIN ORDERS\xe2\x80\xa8ON CUSTOMERS.ID = ORDERS.CUSTOMER_ID; Joins and Unions can be used to combine data from one or more tables.  The difference lies in how the data is combined.In simple terms, joins combine data into new columns.  If two tables are joined together, then the data from the first table is shown in one set of column alongside the second table\xe2\x80\x99s column in the same row.Unions combine data into new rows.  If two tables are \xe2\x80\x9cunioned\xe2\x80\x9d together, then the data from the first table is in one set of rows, and the data from the second table in another set.  The rows are in the same result.Here is a visual depiction of a join.  Table A and B\xe2\x80\x99s columns are combined into a single result.Each row in the result contains columns from BOTH table A and B.  Rows are created when columns from one table match columns from another.  This match is called the join condition.This makes joins really great for looking up values and including them in results.  This is usually the result of denormalizing (reversing normalization) and involves using the foreign key in one table to look up column values by using the primary key in another.Now compare the above depiction with that of a union.  In a union each row within the result is from one table OR the other.  In a union, columns aren\xe2\x80\x99t combined to create results, rows are combined.Both joins and unions can be used to combine data from one or more tables into a single results.  They both go about this is different ways.  Whereas a join is used to combine columns from different tables, the union is used to combine rows.SourceIn the abstract, they are similar, in that two tables or result sets are being combined , but UNION is really for combining result sets with the SAME NUMBER OF COLUMNS with the COLUMNS HAVING SIMILAR DATA TYPES. The STRUCTURE is the same, only new rows are being added. In joins, you can combine tables/result sets with any possible structure, including a cartesian join where there are NO shared/similar columns. The UNION operator is just for combining two or more SELECT statements.While JOIN is for selecting rows from each table, either by the inner, outer, left or right method.Refer to here and here . There is a better explanation with examples.Any modern DBS, like MariaDB, implements a UNION JOIN command. This is an SQL 3 command, but it isn\'t well known or used. Do learn more on UNION JOIN.
