How can I convert a string to a date time object in javascript by specifying a format string?I am looking for something like:I think this can help you: http://www.mattkruse.com/javascript/date/There\'s a getDateFromFormat() function that you can tweak a little to solve your problem.Update: there\'s an updated version of the samples available at javascripttoolbox.comUse new Date(dateString) if your string is compatible with Date.parse(). If your format is incompatible (I think it is), you have to parse the string yourself (should be easy with regular expressions) and create a new Date object with explicit values for year, month, date, hour, minute and second.@Christoph Mentions using a regex to tackle the problem. Here\'s what I\'m using:It\'s by no means intelligent, just configure the regex and new Date(blah) to suit your needs.Edit: Maybe a bit more understandable in ES6 using destructuring:But in all honesty these days I reach for something like Moment No sophisticated date/time formatting routines exist in JavaScript.You will have to use an external library for formatted date output, "JavaScript Date Format" from Flagrant Badassery looks very promising.For the input conversion, several suggestions have been made already. :) Check out Moment.js. It is a modern and powerful library that makes up for JavaScript\'s woeful Date functions (or lack thereof).Just for an updated answer here, there\'s a good js lib at http://www.datejs.com/Date.parse() is fairly intelligent but I can\'t guarantee that format will parse correctly.If it doesn\'t, you\'d have to find something to bridge the two. Your example is pretty simple (being purely numbers) so a touch of REGEX (or even string.split() -- might be faster) paired with some parseInt() will allow you to quickly make a date.External library is an overkill for parsing one or two dates, so I made my own function using Oli\'s and Christoph\'s solutions. Here in central Europe we rarely use aything but the OP\'s format, so this should be enough for simple apps used here.Just to give my 5 cents.My date format is dd.mm.yyyy (UK format) and none of the above examples were working for me. All the parsers  were considering mm as day and dd as month.I\'ve found this library: http://joey.mazzarelli.com/2008/11/25/easy-date-parsing-with-javascript/\nand it worked, because you can say the order of the fields like this:I hope that helps someone.To fully satisfy the Date.parse convert string to format dd-mm-YYYY as specified in RFC822,\nif you use yyyy-mm-dd parse may do a mistakes.Moment.js will handle this:
