Currently it just displays the name of the application and I want it to display something custom and be different for each screen in my app.For example: my home screen could say \'page1\' in the action bar while another activity that the app switches to could have \'page2\' in that screens action bar.FYI, ActionBar was introduced in API Level 11. ActionBar is a window feature at the top of the Activity that may display the activity title, navigation modes, and other interactive items like search.I exactly remember about customizing title bar and making it consistent through the application. So I can make a comparison with the earlier days and can list some of the advantages of using ActionBar:For example:For example:The ActionBar provides you with basic and familiar looks, navigation modes and other quick actions to perform. But that doesn\'t mean it looks the same in every app. You can customize it as per your UI and design requirements. You just have to define and write styles and themes.Read more at: Styling the Action BarAnd if you want to generate styles for ActionBar then this Style Generator tool can help you out.=================================================================================you can Change the Title of each screen (i.e. Activity) by setting their Android:labelBut if you want to Customize title-bar in your own way, i.e. Want to put Image icon and custom-text, then the following code works for me:The strings.xml file is defined under the values folder.You can define the label for each activity in your manifest file. A normal definition of a activity looks like this:Where title text should be replaced by the id of a string resource for this activity.You can also set the title text from code if you want to set it dynamically.with this line the title is set to the city of a specific adress in the oncreate method of my activity.You can define your title programatically using setTitle within your Activity, this method can accept either a String or an ID defined in your values/strings.xml file. Example: We can change the ActionBar title in one of two ways:In the Manifest: in the manifest file, set the label of each Activity.In code: in code, call the setTitle() method with a String or the id of String as the argument.try do this...it works for meInside Activity.onCreate() callback or in the another place where you need to change title:Little bit older but had the same problem. I did it like this:strings.xml<string name="title_awesome_app">My Awesome App</string>and make sure you set this in your AndroidManifest.xml:it\'s easy and you don\'t have to worry about null-references and other stuff.how about the effect of button and checkbox in the view after adopting customized title bar? In my app, the style of button and checkbox changed.\nyou can refer to my post hereFor more information check this link :http://android--code.blogspot.in/2015/09/android-how-to-change-actionbar-title_21.htmlThe easiest way is to call this.setTitle("...") if you are in the activity.\nand if you are in a fragment, just call getActivity().setTitle("...");this way will let you change the title anytime, no need to call it before         setContentView(R.layout.activity_test);The best way to change the action bar name is to go to the AndroidManifest.xml\nand type this code.The Easiest way to change the action bar name is to go to the AndroidManifest.xml and type this code.
