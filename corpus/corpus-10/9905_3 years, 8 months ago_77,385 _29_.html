A guy I work with gave me the EC2 credentials to log onto his EC2 console. I was not the one who set it up. Some of the instances show a public dns name and others have a blank public DNS. I want to be able to connect to the instances that have a blank public DNS. I have not been able to figure out why these show up as blank.I had the same problem an solved it. Have a look at the step-by-step instructions:Hope this helps!CheersThere is a actually a setting in the VPC called "DNS Hostnames". You can modify the VPC in which the EC2 instance exists, and change this to "Yes". That should do the trick.I ran into this issue yesterday and tried the above answer from Manny, which did not work. The VPC setting, however, did work for me.Ultimately I added an EIP and I use that to connect.Sounds like the instance was launched in VPC and while doing so, the check-box for Automatically assign a public IP address to your instances was not checked. Hence the instance does not have a public IPYou can assign an Elastic IP to this instance and then log in using that IP. At the end you will get your Public dns. This is the tip provided to resolve the issue which does not work:Tip - If your instance doesn\'t have a public DNS name, open the VPC console, select the VPC, and check the Summary tab. If either DNS resolution or DNS hostnames is no, click Edit and change the value to yes.Assuming you have done this and you are still not getting a Public IP then go over to the subnet in question in the VPC admin screen and you will probably discover "Auto-Assign Public IP" is not set to yes.  Modify that setting then, and I know you don\'t want to here this, create a new instance in that subnet.  As far as I can tell you cannot modify this on the host, I tried and tried, just terminate it. In my case I found the answer from slayedbylucifer and others that point to the same are valid.\nEven it is set that DNS hostname: yes, no Public IP is assigned on my-pvc (only Privat IP).  It is definitely that Auto assign Public IP has to be set Enable.\n  If it is not selected, then by default it sets to Use subnet setting (Disable) Just launch another instance (and also delete the one in question if it has no use) and make sure this time you check "Autoatically assign a public IP address to your instance".   If not then as slayedbylucifer suggested; assign an Elastic IP (EIP) to the instance and then log in using that IP.  Be careful though, if you are running the free AWS tier, an EIP will cost you money-- that\'s a whole \'nother topic..First of all, there can be two reasons for this:To solve this : i) Go to AWS VPC console and select the VPC you have created. ii) Then click on Actions and then enable DNS Resolution.Here you cannot change the setting; so create an ami image and then recreate the instance from that.For me problem was in subnet settings.Go to VPC console, select your VPC, and click ACTIONS menu, select Edit DNS Hostnames - select Yes. That should fix it. If the instance is in VPC, make sure both "DNS resolution" and "DNS hostnames" is set to "yes". You can do this in the Aws console UI. HTH!For those using CloudFormation, the key properties are EnableDnsSupport and EnableDnsHostnames which should be set to trueThe change to the DNS Hostnames setting can also be done using the AWS CLI:(Where $vpc_id is the ID of the VPC that your instance is attached to.)As soon as the VPC is updated the instance will gain a public DNS.
