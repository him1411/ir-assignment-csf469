When running a program on gdb, usually, the arguments for the program are given at \'run\' command. Is there a way to run the program using gdb and as well as give arguments within a shell script? I saw an answer in a related question, mentioning that we can attach the gdb to the program after script starts executing. But then I will have to \'wait\' the program.I\'m curious whether there is any other way to do this.You can run gdb with --args parameter,If you want it to run automatically, place some commands in a file (e.g. \'run\') and give it as argument: -x /tmp/cmds. Optionally you can run with -batch mode.HTH-ex=r is short for -ex=run and tells gdb to run your program immediately, rather than wait for you to type "run" at the prompt. Then --args says that everything that follows is the command and arguments, just as you\'d normally type them at the commandline prompt.Another way to do this, which I personally find slightly more convenient and intuitive (without having to remember the --args parameter), is to compile normally, and use r arg1 arg2 arg3 directly from within gdb, like so:You could create a file with context:run arg1 arg2 arg3 etcprogram inputAnd call gdb likegdb has --init-command <somefile> where somefile has a list of gdb commands to run, I use this to have //GDB comments in my code, then `as a script, which puts the command to load the debug symbols, and then generates a list of break commands to put a break point for each //GDB comment, and starts it running
