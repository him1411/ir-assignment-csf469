Is there a 64 bit Visual Studio at all? Why not?For numerous reasons, No. Why is explained in this MSDN post.First, from a performance perspective the pointers get larger, so data\n  structures get larger, and the processor cache stays the same size.\n  That basically results in a raw speed hit (your mileage may vary).  So\n  you start in a hole and you have to dig yourself out of that hole by\n  using the extra memory above 4G to your advantage.  In Visual Studio\n  this can happen in some large solutions but I think a preferable thing\n  to do is to just use less memory in the first place.  Many of VS\xe2\x80\x99s\n  algorithms are amenable to this.  Here\xe2\x80\x99s an old article that discusses\n  the performance issues at some length:\n  http://blogs.msdn.com/joshwil/archive/2006/07/18/670090.aspxSecondly, from a cost perspective, probably the shortest path to\n  porting Visual Studio to 64 bit is to port most of it to managed code\n  incrementally and then port the rest.  The cost of a full port of that\n  much native code is going to be quite high and of course all known\n  extensions would break and we\xe2\x80\x99d basically have to create a 64 bit\n  ecosystem pretty much like you do for drivers.  Ouch.No, but the 32-bit version runs just fine on 64-bit Windows.no, but it runs fine on win64, and can create win64 .EXEsNo! There is no 64-bit version of Visual Studio.How to know it is not 64-bit: \nOnce you download Visual Studio and click the install button, you will see that the initialization folder it selects automatically is C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0As per my understanding, all 64-bit programs/applications goes to C:\\Program Files and all 32-bit applications goes to C:\\Program Files (x86) from Windows 7 onwards.
