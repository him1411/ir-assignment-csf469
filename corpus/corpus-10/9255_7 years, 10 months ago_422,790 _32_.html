What is the best practice for creating a yes/no Boolean field when converting from an access database or in general?The equivalent is a bit field.In SQL you use 0 and 1 to set a bit field (just as a yes/no field in Access). In Management Studio it displays as a false/true value (at least in recent versions).When accessing the database through ASP.NET it will expose the field as a boolean value.The BIT datatype is generally used to store boolean values (0 for false, 1 for true).You can use the bit column type.You can use the data type bitValues inserted which are greater than 0 will be stored as \'1\'Values inserted which are less than 0 will be stored as \'1\'Values inserted as \'0\' will be stored as \'0\'This holds true for MS SQL Server 2012 ExpressYou can use the BIT field.For adding a BIT column to an existing table, the SQL command would look like:ALTER TABLE table_name ADD yes_no BITIf you want to create a new table, you could do: CREATE TABLE table_name (yes_no BIT).bit will be the simplest and also takes up the least space. Not very verbose compared to "Y/N" but I am fine with it.There are already answers saying use of Bit. I will add more to these answers.You should use bit for representing Boolean values.Remarks from MSDN article.Bit can take a value of 1, 0, or NULL.The SQL Server Database Engine optimizes storage of bit columns. If\n  there are 8 or less bit columns in a table, the columns are stored as\n  1 byte. If there are from 9 up to 16 bit columns, the columns are\n  stored as 2 bytes, and so on.The string values TRUE and FALSE can be converted to bit values: TRUE\n  is converted to 1 and FALSE is converted to 0.Converting to bit promotes any nonzero value to 1.As Bit have values 1, 0 and NULL. See truth table for this. So plan values accordingly. It might add confusion by allowing NULL value for bit data type.References 1 2Sample usage while creating a table:bit is the most suitable option. Otherwise I once used int for that purpose. 1 for true & 0 for false.You can use the BIT fieldTo create new table:Adding Column in existing Table:To Insert record:
