I\'d like to get all of a mysql table\'s col names into an array in php?Is there a query for this? The best way is to use the INFORMATION_SCHEMA metadata virtual database.  Specifically the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS table...It\'s VERY powerful, and can give you TONS of information without need to parse text (Such as column type, whether the column is nullable, max column size, character set, etc)...Oh, and it\'s standard SQL (Whereas SHOW ... is a MySQL specific extension)...For more information about the difference between SHOW... and using the INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables, check out the MySQL Documentation on INFORMATION_SCHEMA in general...You can use following query for MYSQL:Below is the example code which shows How to implement above syntax in php to list the names of columns: For Details about output of SHOW COLUMNS FROM TABLE visit: MySQL Refrence.Seems there are 2 ways:orMore on DESCRIBE here: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/describe.htmlI have done this in the past.Edit: Today I learned the better way of doing this. Please see ircmaxell\'s answer.Parse the output of SHOW COLUMNS FROM table;Here\'s more about it here: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/show-columns.htmlAn old PHP function "mysql_list_fields()" is deprecated. So, today the best way to get names of fields is a query "SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name [LIKE \'name\']". So, here is a little example:Use mysql_fetch_field() to view all column data.  See manual."Warning\nThis extension is deprecated as of PHP 5.5.0, and will be removed in the future."SHOW COLUMNS in mysql 5.1 (not 5.5) uses a temporary disk table.So it can be considered slow for some cases. At least, it can bump up your created_tmp_disk_tables value. Imagine one temporary disk table per connection or per each page request.SHOW COLUMNS is not really so slow, possibly because it uses file system cache. Phpmyadmin says ~0.5ms consistently. This is nothing compared to 500ms-1000ms of serving a wordpress page. But still, there are times it matters. There is a disk system involvement, you never know what happens when server is busy, cache is full, hdd is stalled etc.Retrieving column names through SELECT * FROM ... LIMIT 1 was around ~0.1ms, and it can use query cache as well.So here is my little optimized code to get column names from a table, without using show columns if possible:Notes:Not sure if this is what you were looking for, but this worked for me:That returns a simple array of the column names / variable names in your table or array as strings, which is what I needed to dynamically build MySQL queries. My frustration was that I simply don\'t know how to index arrays in PHP very well, so I wasn\'t sure what to do with the results from DESC or SHOW. Hope my answer is helpful to beginners like myself!To check result:  print_r($col_names);when you want to check your all table structure with some filed then use this code. In this query i select column_name,column_type and table_name for more details . I use order by column_type so i can see it easily. If you want to check only double type filed then you can do it easily \nif you want to check which field allow null type etc then you can use this you want to check more then thik link also help you.https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/columns-table.htmlIN WORDPRESS:Try this one out I personally use it:if you use php, use this gist.it can get select fields full info with no result\xef\xbc\x8cand all custom fields such as:if above sql return no data,will also get the field names aname, bname, b\'s other field namejust two line:This query fetches a list of all columns in a database without having to specify a table name. It returns a list of only column names: However, when I ran this query in phpmyadmin, it displayed a series of errors. Nonetheless, it worked. So use it with caution. This question is old, but I got here looking for a way to find a given query its field names in a dynamic way (not necessarily only the fields of a table). And since people keep pointing this as the answer for that given task in other related questions, I\'m sharing the way I found it can be done, using Gavin Simpson\'s tips:This can be easily modded to insert the field names in an array.Using a simple: $sql="SELECT * FROM myTable LIMIT 1" can give you the fields of any table, without needing to use SHOW COLUMNS or any extra php module, if needed (removing the data dump part).Hopefully this helps someone else.i no expert, but this works for me..
