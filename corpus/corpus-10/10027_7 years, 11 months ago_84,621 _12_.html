How do you build a Maven project without running unit tests?Currently restructuring some code I have for a Servlet and would like to try it out in my web browser (which means running mvn install to get the .war to upload to Tomcat). I\'m fully aware my UNIT tests are failing and I\'m fine with that because I will fix it once I have the code the way I want. Can anyone advise?Edit - As pointed by @cetnar in comments. The above commend will skip running and compiling tests. If you want to compile but not run tests use If you are using eclipse there is a "Skip Tests" checkbox on the configuration page.Run configurations \xe2\x86\x92\n  Maven Build \xe2\x86\x92\n  New \xe2\x86\x92\n  Main tab \xe2\x86\x92\n  Skip Tests\n  mvn clean install -DskipTests=truemvn clean install -Dskiptests=trueIf you call your classes tests Maven seems to run them automatically, at least they did for me. Rename the classes and Maven will just go through to verification without running them.I like short version: mvn clean install -DskipTests It\'s work too: mvn clean install -DskipTests=trueIf you absolutely must, you can also use the maven.test.skip property to skip compiling the tests. maven.test.skip is honored by Surefire, Failsafe and the Compiler Plugin.\nmvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=trueand you can add config in maven.xml
