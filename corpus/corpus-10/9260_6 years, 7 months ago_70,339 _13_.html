This question already has an answer here:Using Git X and must have fumbled royally on something.  Looks like a few days ago I created a branch called detached HEAD and have been committing to it.  My normal process is to commit to master and then push that to origin.  But I can\'t push detached HEAD.My next stop screwed me. I selected git checkout master - and my detached HEAD branch disappeared. Going back to my project all of my changes in the past few days have been wiped.Is there anyway I can get those changes back?If checkout master was the last thing you did, then the reflog entry HEAD@{1} will contain your commits (otherwise use git reflog or git log -p to find them). Use git merge HEAD@{1} to fast forward them into master.EDIT:As noted in the comments, Git Ready has a great article on this.git reflog and gitreflog --all will give you the commit hashes of the mis-placed commits.Source: http://gitready.com/intermediate/2009/02/09/reflog-your-safety-net.htmlIf your detached HEAD is a fast forward of master and you just want the commits upstream, you canto push directly, orwill merge it back into your local master.
