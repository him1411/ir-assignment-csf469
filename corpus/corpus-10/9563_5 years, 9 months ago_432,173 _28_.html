This question already has an answer here:I have the following codeHowever, empty($error) still returns true, even though nothing is set.What\'s not right?There are two elements in array and this definitely doesn\'t mean that array is empty. As a quick workaround you can do following:array_filter() function\'s default behavior will remove all values from array which are equal to null, 0, \'\' or false.Otherwise in your particular case empty() construct will always return true if there is at least one element even with "empty" value.You can also check it by doing.Try to check it\'s size with sizeof if 0 no elements.PHP\'s built-in empty() function checks to see whether the variable is empty, null, false, or a representation of zero. It doesn\'t return true just because the value associated with an array entry is false, in this case the array has actual elements in it and that\'s all that\'s evaluated.If you\'d like to check whether a particular error condition is set to true in an associative array, you can use the array_keys() function to filter the keys that have their value set to true.You can then use the empty() function to check whether this array is empty, simultaneously telling you whether there are errors and also which errors have occurred.However, empty($error) still returns true, even though nothing is set.That\'s not how empty() works. According to the manual, it will return true on an empty array only. Anything else wouldn\'t make sense.array with zero elements converts to falsehttp://php.net/manual/en/language.types.boolean.phpFrom the PHP-documentation:Returns FALSE if var has a non-empty and non-zero value.The following things are considered to be empty:function empty() does not work for testing empty arrays!\nexample:a function is necessary:ok, this is a very old question :) , but i found this thread searching for a solution and i didnt find a good one.bye\n(sorry for my english)In PHP, even if the individual items within an array or properties of an object are empty, the array or object will not evaluate to empty using the empty($subject) function. In other words, cobbling together a bunch of data that individually tests as "empty" creates a composite that is non-empty.\nUse the following PHP function to determine if the items in an array or properties of an object are empty:Example Usage:hi array is one object so it null type or blankI can\'t replicate that (php 5.3.6):exactly where are you doing the empty() call that returns true?
