I\'m on a quest to reach 100/100 on PageSpeed and i\'m almost there.  I\'m trying to find a good solution to cache Google Analytics.  Here is the message I get:Leverage browser caching\nSetting an expiry date or a maximum age in the HTTP headers for static resources instructs the browser to load previously downloaded resources from local disk rather than over the network.\nLeverage browser caching for the following cacheable resources:\nhttp://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js (2 hours)The only solution i\'ve found was from 2012 and I do not think it is a good solution.  Essentially you copy the GA code and host it yourself.  You then run a CHRON job to recheck Google once a day to grab the latest GA code and replace it.  http://diywpblog.com/leverage-browser-cache-optimize-google-analytics/What else can I do to reach 100/100 while also using Google Analytics?Thank you.Well, if Google is cheating on you, you can cheat Google back:This is the user-agent for pageSpeed:You can insert a conditional to avoid serving the analytics script to PageSpeed:Obviously, it won\'t make any real improvement, but if your only concern is getting a 100/100 score this will do it.There\'s a subset of Google Analytics js library called ga-lite that you can cache however you want.The library uses Google Analytics\' public REST API to send the user tracking data to Google. You can read more from the blog post about ga-lite.Disclaimer: I am the author of this library. I struggled with this specific problem and the best result I found was to implement this solution.I wouldn\'t worry about it. Don\'t put it on your own server, it sounds like this is an issue with Google, but as good as it gets. Putting the file on your own server will create many new problems.They probably need the file to get called every time rather than getting it from the client\'s cache, since that way you wouldn\'t count the visits. If you have a problem to feel fine with that, run the Google insights URL on Google insights itself, have a laugh, relax and get on with your work.Here is a really simple solution using JS, for basic GA tracking, which will also work for edge caches/proxies (this was converted from a comment):Note: This is the default GA script. You may have other ga() calls, and if so, you would need to always check the user agent before calling ga(), otherwise it may error out.In the Google docs, they\'ve identified a pagespeed filter that will load the script asynchronously:You can find the documentation here: https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/filter-make-google-analytics-asyncOne thing to highlight is that the filter is considered high risk. From the docs:The make_google_analytics_async filter is experimental and has not had extensive real-world testing. One case where a rewrite would cause errors is if the filter misses calls to Google Analytics methods that return values. If such methods are found, the rewrite is skipped. However, the disqualifying methods will be missed if they come before the load, are in attributes such as "onclick", or if they are in external resources. Those cases are expected to be rare.You can try to host the analytics.js locally and update it\'s contents with a caching script or manually.The js file is updated only few times a year and if you don\'t need any new tracking features update it manually.https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/changelogstore localy analytics.js, but it is not recommended by google:\nhttps://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1032389?hl=enit is not recommended cause google can update script when they want, so just do a script that download analytics javascript each week and you will not have trouble !By the way this solution prevent adblock from blocking google analytics scriptsYou can proxy the google analytics script via your own server, save it locally and  auto update the file every hour to make sure it\'s always latest version from google.I\'ve done this on a couple of sites now and all is working fine.Google Analytics Proxy Route in NodeJS / MEAN StackThis is how I implemented it on my blog that\'s built with the MEAN stack.Google Analytics Proxy Action Method in ASP.NET MVCThis is how I implemented it on other sites built with ASP.NET MVC.e.g. http://www.marshallgibson.com.au which has a perfect score of 100/100.This is the CompressAttribute used by the MVC ProxyController for Gzip compressionUpdated Google Analytics ScriptOn the client side I append the analytics path with the current date up to the hour so the browser won\'t use a cached version more than an hour old.varvy.com (100/100 Google page speed insight) loads google analitycs code only if user make a scroll of the page:To fix this issue you would have to download the file locally and run a cron job to keep updating. Note: this doesn\'t make your website any faster at all so its best to just ignore it.For demonstration purposes however, follow this guide:\nhttp://diywpblog.com/leverage-browser-cache-optimize-google-analytics/try this just insert before Please change xx-xxxxxxx-x to your code, please check to implementation here http://www.gee.web.id/2016/11/how-to-leverage-browser-caching-for-google-analitycs.htmlGoogle cautions against using local copies of the analtics scripts. \nHowever if you are doing it, you will probably want to use local copies of the plugins & the debug script.A second concern with agressive caching is that you will be getting hits from cached pages - which may have changed or have been removed from the site.This may do the trick :) For Nginx:Then change path https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js to https://yoursite.com/analytics.jsAdd this in your HTML or PHP code:This works fine with JavaScript:NiloVelez already said: Obviously, it won\'t make any real improvement, but if your only concern is getting a 100/100 score this will do it.You can minify all your scripts in page, including analytics.js using:Remember to minify the files before using it. Otherwise it will consume more processing time.
