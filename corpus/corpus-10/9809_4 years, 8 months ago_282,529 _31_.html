I\'m trying to do some things on the ActionBar in Android.I\'ve already added new items in the right side of the action bar.How can I change the left side of the action bar? I want to change the icon and the text, and I want to add a "Back Button" in the action bar for the other screensThis is very simple to accomplishIf you want to change it in code, call:And set the values to whatever you please.Or, in the Android manifest XML file:To enable the back button in your app use:The code should all be placed in your onCreate so that the label/icon changing is transparent to the user, but in reality it can be called anywhere during the activity\'s lifecycle.To make a single icon be usable by all your action bars you can do this in your Android Manifest.If you want to change the Action bar title just give the following 1 line code in the onCreate() of your Activity You can change the icon in your by adding whatever icon you want to your respective drawable folders, then changing this line in your AndroidManifest.xml file:to match whatever the name of your icon is in there.  Or put your icon as ic_launcher, if they\'re the same icon.  As for what it says, add or change whatever strings match up to that in your res/values/strings.xml file.  Then, once again in your AndroidManifest.xml file, change this line:to whatever the string you have in their.  You\'ll have to do this for the application as a whole, and whichever activities you want, but the lines are the same.Hope this helps.You just need to add these 3 lines of code. Replace the icon with your own icon. If you want to generate icons use thisFor that, you can do it in 2 ways: XML or Java. See here: How to change the text on the action barSo:XML: Java:For set Title : getActionBar().setTitle("Title");For set Icon : getActionBar().setIcon(R.drawable.YOUR_ICON_NAME);The action bar title will, by default, use the label of the current activity, but you can also set it programmatically via ActionBar.setTitle().To implement the "Back" (more precisely, "Up") button functionality you\'re talking about, read the "Using the App Icon for Navigation" section of the Action Bar developer guide.Finally, to change the icon, the guide covers that as well. In short, the action bar will display the image supplied in android:icon in your manifest\'s application or activity element, if there is one. The typical practice is to create an application icon (in all of the various densities you\'ll need) named ic_launcher.png, and place it in your drawable-* directories.I got non-static method setTitle(CharSequence) cannot be referenced from a static context error because I used setTitle() in static PlaceholderFragment class. I solved it by using getActivity().getActionBar().setTitle("new title");In Android 5.0 material design guidelines discourage the use of icon in actionBarto enable it add the following codecredit goes to author of this article I used the following call inside onNavigationItemSelected:
