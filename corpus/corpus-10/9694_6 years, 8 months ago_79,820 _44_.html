What is the best way to deploy Node.js?I have a Dreamhost VPS (that\'s what they call a VM), and I have been able to install Node.js and set up a proxy. This works great as long as I keep the SSH connection that I started node with open.2016 answer: nearly every Linux distribution comes with systemd, which means forever, monit, etc. are no longer necessary - your OS already handles these tasks.Make a myapp.service file (replacing \'myapp\' with your app\'s name, obviously):Copy your service file into the /etc/systemd/system folder.Tell systemd about the new service with systemctl daemon-reload.Start it with systemctl start myapp.Enable it to run on boot with systemctl enable myapp.See logs with journalctl -u myappMore details at: How we deploy node apps on Linux, 2016 editionUse Forever. It runs Node.js programs in separate processes and restarts them if any dies.Usage:I\'ve written about my deployment method here: Deploying node.js appsIn short:pm2 does the tricks.Features are: Monitoring, hot code reload, built-in load balancer, automatic startup script, and resurrect/dump processes.You can use monit, forever, upstart or systemd to start your server.You can use Varnish or HAProxy instead of Nginx (Nginx is known not to work with websockets).As a quick and dirty solution you can use nohup node your_app.js & to prevent your app terminating with your server, but forever, monit and other proposed solutions are better.I made an Upstart script currently used for my apps:Customize all before #########, create a file in /etc/init/your-service.conf and paste it there.Then you can:Here\'s a longer article on solving this problem with systemd: http://savanne.be/articles/deploying-node-js-with-systemd/Some things to keep in mind:All of these things are easily done with systemd.If you have root access you would better set up a daemon so that it runs safe and sound in the background. You can read how to do just that for Debian and Ubuntu in blog post Run Node.js as a Service on Ubuntu.I\'ve written a pretty comprehensive guide to deploying Node.js, with example files:Tutorial: How to Deploy Node.js Applications, With ExamplesIt covers things like http-proxy, SSL and Socket.IO.Forever will do the trick. @Kevin: You should be able to kill processes fine. I would double check the documentation a bit. If you can reproduce the error it would be great to post it as an issue on GitHub.Try this: http://www.technology-ebay.de/the-teams/mobile-de/blog/deploying-node-applications-with-capistrano-github-nginx-and-upstart.htmlA great and detailed guide for deploying Node.js apps with Capistrano, Upstart and NginxAs Box9 said, Forever is a good choice for production code. But it is also possible to keep a process going even if the SSH connection is closed from the client.While not necessarily a good idea for production, this is very handy when in the middle of long debug sessions, or to follow the console output of lengthy processes, or whenever is useful to disconnect your SSH connection, but keep the terminal alive in the server to reconnect later (like starting the Node.js application at home and reconnecting to the console later at work to check how things are going).Assuming that your server is a *nix box, you can use the screen command from the shell to do keep the process running even if the client SSH is closed. You can download/install screen from the web if not already installed (look for a package for your distribution if Linux, or use MacPorts if OSÂ X).It works as following:You can have multiple screen sessions running concurrently like this if you need, and you can connect to any of it from any client. Read the documentation online for all the options.Forever is a good option for keeping apps running (and it\'s npm installable as a module which is nice).But for more serious \'deployment\' -- things like remote management of deploying, restarting, running commands etc -- I would use capistrano with the node extension. https://github.com/loopj/capistrano-node-deployhttps://paastor.com is a relatively new service that does the deploy for you, to a VPS or other server. There is a CLI to push code. Paastor has a free tier, at least it did at the time of posting this. In your case you may use the upstart daemon. For a complete deployment solution, I may suggest capistrano. Two useful guides are How to setup Node.js env and How to deploy via capistrano + upstart.Try node-deploy-server. It is a complex toolset for deploying an application onto your private servers. It is written in Node.js and uses npm for installation.
