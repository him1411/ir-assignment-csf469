What is the type for a BOOL value in SQLite? I want to store in my table TRUE/FALSE values.I could create a column of INTEGER and store in it values 0 or 1, but it won\'t be the best way to implement BOOL type.Is there a way?Thanks.There is no native boolean data type for SQLite. Per the Datatypes doc:SQLite does not have a separate Boolean storage class. Instead, Boolean values are stored as integers 0 (false) and 1 (true).SQLite Boolean Datatype:\nSQLite does not have a separate Boolean storage class. Instead, Boolean values are stored as integers 0 (false) and 1 (true).You can convert boolean to int in this way:You can convert int back to boolean as follows:If you want to explore sqlite, here is a tutorial.\nI have given one answer here. It is working for them.In SQLite the best you can do is use the integers 0 and 1 to represent false and true. You could  declare the column type like this:Omit the NOT NULL if you want to allow NULL in addition to 0 and 1.The use of the type name BOOLEAN here is for readability, to SQLite it\'s just a type with NUMERIC affinity.Note that CHECK constraints have been supported since SQLite 3.3.0 (2006).Here are some example INSERTs that will work: (note how strings and floating point numbers are parsed as integers)and some that will fail:In other situations, using default with check is very useful:Note that, somewhat confusingly, since the check only allows integer zero or integer one, the value indeed can never be null. So in this case:it will insert the default value, integer zero.Note that if you ALSO add the not null constraint,that means that inserts like this:are simply disallowed, they cannot happen and would cause an error.using the Integer data type with values 0 and 1 is the fastest.Further to ericwa\'s answer. CHECK constraints can enable a pseudo boolean column by enforcing a TEXT datatype and only allowing TRUE or FALSE case specific values e.g.But,if you want to store a bunch of them you could bit-shift them and store them all as one int, a little like unix file permissions/modes.For mode 755 for instance, each digit refers to a different class of users: owner, group, public.  Within each digit 4 is read, 2 is write, 1 is execute so 7 is all of them like binary 111.  5 is read and execute so 101.  Make up your own encoding scheme.I\'m just writing something for storing TV schedule data from Schedules Direct and I have the binary or yes/no fields: stereo, hdtv, new, ei, close captioned, dolby, sap in Spanish, season premiere.  So 7 bits, or an integer with a maximum of 127.  One character really.A C example from what I\'m working on now.  has() is a function that returns 1 if the 2nd string is in the first one.  inp is the input string to this function.  misc is an unsigned char initialized to 0.So I\'m storing 7 booleans in one integer with room for more.You could simplify the above equations using the following:If the int representation (sqlInt) of the boolean is 0 (false), the boolean (flag) will be false, otherwise it will be true.Concise code is always nicer to work with :)UPDATE table SET Boolcolumn = \'1\' WHERE ......Another way to do it is a TEXT column. And then convert the boolean value between Boolean and String before/after saving/reading the value from the database.Ex. You have "boolValue = true;"To String:And back to boolean:
