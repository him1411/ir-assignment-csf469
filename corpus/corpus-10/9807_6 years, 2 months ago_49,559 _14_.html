I am using this code for hyperlink:By default it is showing blue color, but how do I change color of hyperlink in Android?Add android:textColorLink="yourcolorhere" to your TextViewIf you want to change it programmatically:You need to use the android:textColorLink="#000000" where 000000 is your color\'s hex code. Hope it helps.You can use on your XML file: the "Code" can be e.g. #ff0000 or @color/redYou can use on your JAVA code :  The color can be e.g Color.RED or Color.parseColor("#ff0000");You can also open colors.xml and change the following color to whatever you want:You need to use  android:textColorLink="colorCode" . Hope it will work.If anyone needs to know the hex value for this blue it is #7bc9c2.I used Eye Dropper to figure this out as I couldn\'t find it documented anywhere, it isn\'t on the Google Color Palatte anyway:https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html#color-color-palette
