I have been running MAMP Pro 3.05 successfully in Yosemite up to DP4 on a partition that was a clean install of Yosemite.I now have run the installer for DP5 over my Mavericks install, and now that MAMP Pro install will not start Apache.  It says to check the logs, but I don\'t see anything pertinent.I\'m assuming that since this is a pre-existing install, something in its config is wrong for Yosemite\'s Apache.Any ideas?MAMP Folks just posted the workaroundWorkaround for the 10.10 Preview 5 bug: Rename the file \xe2\x80\x9cenvvars\xe2\x80\x9d located in /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin into \xe2\x80\x9c_envvars\xe2\x80\x9dTest Update: It works! Works for Yosemite release too! Just found workaround from MAMP on TwitterWorkaround for the 10.10 Preview 5 bug: \nRename the file \xe2\x80\x9cenvvars\xe2\x80\x9d located in  into \xe2\x80\x9c_envvars\xe2\x80\x9dThis works also for Mamp Pro 2.1.1 on Yosemite.MAMP Folks just posted the workaroundWorkaround for the 10.10 Preview 5 bug: Rename the file \xe2\x80\x9cenvvars\xe2\x80\x9d\n  located in /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin into \xe2\x80\x9c_envvars\xe2\x80\x9dTest Update: It works!Apparently the MAMP folks are working on a work-around:https://twitter.com/mamp_en/status/496655943506350081Follow their account for updates.MAMP Pro 3.0.7.3 should run fine on Yosemite, but after installing it on a brand new machine, I experienced the same problem.In my case, the problem occurred because I had defined Additional Parameters for my virtual host that contained quotes. By default, Yosemite keyboard settings are set to convert straight quotes to smart quotes ("no-cache" became \xe2\x80\x9cno-cache\xe2\x80\x9d. Depending on font and font size, this may not be immediately obvious). This made Apache crash, even when the host was disabled.To change this settings, go to System Preferences -> Keyboard. In the Text tab, uncheck Use smarts quotes and dashes.Today, I upgraded to MAMP Pro 3.0.7.3 after I upgraded to OSX Yosemite 10.10 (official release) and I experienced this same problem. Apache could not start and it has an empty log file.I tried this fix, but I noticed that the file is named "envvars_" not "envvars". I renamed it to envvars, restarted MAMP Pro and apache could not start and it had an empty log file. I also noticed that the envvars file had been renamed to envvars_ after I had renamed it.I was running MAMP 3.0.5 on Mavericks. After upgrading Mavericks to El Capitan, I ran into the same issue. Mysql did start normally but Apache did not.After renaming envvars to _envvars in the folder /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin such as suggested for Yosemite, I was able to start Apache as before.So, this fix works for El Capitan as well!I didn\'t get it working by changing envvar to _envvar but was able to resolve by changing the apache port from 8888 to 80 then noticed I was missing the mod_example.so. See how I resolved below:Why won't Apache Server start in MAMP?I tried that solution and others over and over and did not work until I realised I should be restarting completely MAMP, after doing so, this simple change from envvars to _envvars worked like a charm.You can completely restart MAMP checking if there\'s any process going on, open the terminal:That will output a list of the processes that involves mysql at the time, with a PDI associated, so you only have to take that number and:Where PDI is the number associated to the process, after that, if you write again the command ps -cvx | grep "mysql" the pointer should be empty.Once done, only execute MAMP.The approved answer didn\'t work for me because the _envvars file was already there. I had to download the latest version of MAMP and install it and it worked.Sometimes, it\'s not always the envars files that\'s the culprit. If you\'ve been editing the vhost file at /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf, a syntax error could cause MAMP\'s apache to not start without a warning.In that case, you can run the following command and see if any errors are encountered.Try this::Rename the file \xe2\x80\x9cenvvars\xe2\x80\x9d located in /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin into \xe2\x80\x9c_envvars\xe2\x80\x9d only for OS X Yosemite.I got MAMP v3.4 working.I renamed "envars_" to "_envars" ... but that didn\'t work.I had to also go into preferences, and hit the "Set Web & MySql ports to 80 & 3306" button!Works!
