I have a String that represents an integer value and would like to convert it to an int. Is there a groovy equivalent of Java\'s Integer.parseInt(String)?Use the toInteger() method to convert a String to an Integer, e.g.An alternative, which avoids using a deprecated method (see below) isIf you need to check whether the String can be converted before performing the conversion, use If you\'re converting a request parameter in a Grails controller, there\'s an even better wayOne of the nice features of this technique is that it\'s safe, i.e. if the parameter cannot be converted to an Integer it returns null rather than throwing an exception.In recent versions of Groovy one of the  toInteger() methods has been deprecated. The following is taken from org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.StringGroovyMethods in Groovy 2.4.4You can force the non-deprecated version of the method to be called using something awful like:Personally, I much prefer:Several ways to do it, this one\'s my favorite:As an addendum to Don\'s answer, not only does groovy add a .toInteger() method to Strings, it also adds toBigDecimal(), toBigInteger(), toBoolean(), toCharacter(), toDouble(), toFloat(), toList(), and toLong().In the same vein, groovy also adds is* eqivalents to all of those that return true if the String in question can be parsed into the format in question.The relevant GDK page is here.I\'m not sure if it was introduced in recent versions of groovy (initial answer is fairly old), but now you can use:orI recommend using floats or even doubles instead of integers in the case if the provided string is unreliable.Well, Groovy accepts the Java form just fine. If you are asking if there is a Groovier way, there is a way to go to Integer.Both are shown here:also you can make static import and after this use toInteger() method is available in groovy, you could use that.Groovy Style conversion:If you have request parameter:Several ways to achieve this. Examples are as belowHope this helps
