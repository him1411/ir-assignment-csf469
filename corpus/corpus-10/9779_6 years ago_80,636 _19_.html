Should files be named something-with-hyphens.js, camelCased.js, or something else?I didn\'t find the answer to this question here.One possible naming convention is to use something similar to the naming scheme jQuery uses. It\'s not universally adopted but it is pretty common.where the product-name + plugin pair can also represent a namespace and a module. The version and filetype are usually optional.filetype can be something relative to how the content of the file is. Often seen are:Examples: I\'m not aware of any particular convention for javascript files as they aren\'t really unique on the web versus css files or html files or any other type of file like that.  There are some "safe" things you can do that make it less likely you will accidentally run into a cross platform issue:There is no official, universal, convention for naming JavaScript files.There are some various options:are all valid naming conventions, however I prefer the jQuery suggested naming convention (for jQuery plugins, although it works for any JS)The beauty to this naming convention is that it explicitly describes the global namespace pollution being added.Because I left out versioning: it should come after the full name, preferably separated by a hyphen, with periods between major and minor versions:The question in the link you gave talks about naming of JavaScript variables, not about file naming, so forget about that for the context in which you ask your question.As to file naming, it is purely a matter of preference and taste. I prefer naming files with hyphens because then I don\'t have to reach for the shift key, as I do when dealing with camelCase file names; and because I don\'t have to worry about differences between Windows and Linux file names (Windows file names are case-insensitive, at least through XP).So the answer, like so many, is "it depends" or "it\'s up to you." The one rule you should follow is to be consistent in the convention you choose.I generally prefer hyphens with lower case, but one thing not yet mentioned is that sometimes it\'s nice to have the file name exactly match the name of a single module or instantiable function contained within.For example, I have a revealing module declared with var knockoutUtilityModule = function() {...} within its own file named knockoutUtilityModule.js, although objectively I prefer knockout-utility-module.js.Similarly, since I\'m using a bundling mechanism to combine scripts, I\'ve taken to defining instantiable functions (templated view models etc) each in their own file, C# style, for maintainability. For example, ProductDescriptorViewModel lives on its own inside ProductDescriptorViewModel.js (I use upper case for instantiable functions).
