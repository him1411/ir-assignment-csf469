So, I can see in CSS references how to set image transparency and how to set a background image. But how can I combine these two in order to set a transparent background image?I have an image that I\'d like to use as a background, but it is too bright - I\'d like to turn the opacity down to about 0.2. How can I do this?Two methods:  Solution with 1 div and NO transparent image:You can use the multibackground CSS3 feature and put two backgrounds: one with the image, another with a transparent panel over it (cause I think there\'s no way to set directly the opacity of the background image):You can\'t use rgba(255,255,255,0.5) because alone it is only accepted on the back, so you I\'ve used generated gradients for each browser for this example (that\'s why it is so long). But the concept is the following:http://jsfiddle.net/pBVsD/1/if you need to set the gradient to background-image only:I saw this and in CSS3 you can now place code in like this. Lets say I want it to cover the whole background I would do something like this. Then with hsla(0,0%,100%,0.70) or rgba you use a white background with whatever percentage saturation or opacity to get the look you desire.  I have used the answer of @Dan Eastwell and it work very well. the code is similar to his code but with some addingIn your CSS add...In JavaScript use...NB: Add vendor prefixes as required but Chromium should be fine without.A great way to do it for a simple image is to do it using only CSS to set the background of the HTML element like so.If you want to get fancy, and set its opacity, then, in IE9+*, you can set a transparent background color of the body. This works by overlaying semitransparent white to make the image whiter, and appear to be brighter. For example, white with 75% opacity (rgba(255,255,255,.75)) would produce the following effect.This could even be expanded to something comparable to, but still very distinct from, CSS filters by changing around the body\'s RGBA color background. For example, rgba(0,255,0,.75) would create a very green tint as you can see in the code snippet.*A full compatibility table can be found at Can I Use. However, please also note that you need to click the "Show All" to see that IE9 supports it.Since I have already answered the question but I have more I want to add, I am titling this section addendum and having it add some potentially helpful information. So, to extrapolate even further on the content above, you could use an SVG as a background image to do wicked awesome things. For example, you could create a loading screen background featuring a cool website icon as you can see in the example of a base64 encoded SVG below.You can use CSS psuedo selector ::after to achieve this. Here is a working demo.Well the only CSS way of doing only background transparency is via RGBa but since you want to use an image I would suggest using Photoshop or Gimp to make the image transparent and then using it as the background.Since I don\'t like neither using a png (proably heavier than the jpg) nor an extra element for setting an opacity and considering this would be a presentational enhacement, then I suggest to try \nJPEGs with Alpha Channels, a technique that uses canvas. Maybe it could be a nice technique to implement even I don\'t know if it\'s appliable in your specific case.I just added position=absolute,top=0,width=100% in the #main and set the opacity value to the #backgroundI applied the background to a div before the main.I came across this post as I had the same issue then I thought why mess about with css, adjusting values and hitting refresh when you can easily adjust the opacity in Photoshop? Copy the image, paste it as a new layer then move the opacity slider.I had a similar issue and I just took the background image with photoshop and created a new .png with the opacity I needed. Problem solved without worrying about if my CSS worked accross all devices & browsers
