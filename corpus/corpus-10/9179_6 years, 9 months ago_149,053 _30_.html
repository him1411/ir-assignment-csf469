How do you get a string to a character array in JavaScript?I\'m thinking getting a string like "Hello world!" to the array [\'H\',\'e\',\'l\',\'l\',\'o\',\' \',\'w\',\'o\',\'r\',\'l\',\'d\',\'!\']Just split it by an empty string.See String.prototype.split() MDN docs.Since this question is originally asked more than five years ago, people are still misopetating this type of task. As hippietrail suggests, meder\'s answer can break surrogate pairs and misinterpret \xe2\x80\x9ccharacters.\xe2\x80\x9d For example:I suggest using one of the following ES2015 features to correctly handle these character sequences.If you are still in ES5.1 era, you can use this alternative (transpiled by Babel):The spread-OperatorYou can use the spread operator, an Array Initializer introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) standard:ExamplesAll examples contain ["H", "e", "l", "l", "o", " ", "W", "o", "r", "l", "d"]Browser SupportCheck the ECMAScript ES6 compatibility table.Further readingThe spread-operator is also referenced as "splat-operator" (e.g. in PHP or Ruby or as "scatter-operator" (e.g. in Python).DemoTry before buyIt already is:Or for a more older browser friendly version, use:You can also use Array.from.This method has been introduced in ES6.Array.fromThis is an old question but I came across another solution not yet listed.You can use the Object.assign function to get the desired output:Not necessarily right or wrong, just another option.Object.assign is described well at the MDN site.Without using any function:You do not need to do anything. It is already array of char.
