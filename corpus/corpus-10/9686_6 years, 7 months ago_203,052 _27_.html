How do I "dynamically" edit JavaScript code in the Chrome debugger? It\'s not for me, so I don\'t have access to the source file. I want to edit code and see what effects they have on the page, in this case stopping an animation from queuing up a bunch of times.You can use the built-in JavaScript debugger in Chrome Developer Tools under the "Scripts" tab (in later versions it\'s the "Sources" tab), but changes you apply to the code are expressed only at the time when execution passes through them. That means changes to the code that is not running after the page loads will not have an effect. Unlike e.g. changes to the code residing in the mouseover handlers, which you can test on the fly.There is a video from Google I/O 2010 event introducing other capabilities of Chrome Developer Tools.I came across this today, when I was playing around with someone else\'s website.I realized I could attach a break-point in the debugger to some line of code before what I wanted to dynamically edit. And since break-points stay even after a reload of the page, I was able to edit the changes I wanted while paused at break-point and then continued to let the page load.So as a quick work around, and if it works with your situation:This is an awesome tutorial for the Chrome debugger. It shows the very simple steps for making in-debugger changes to your scripts.This is what you are looking for:1.- Navigate to the Source tab and open the javascript file2.- Edit the file, right-click it and a menu will appear: click Save and save it locally.In order to view the diff or revert your changes, right-click and select the option Local Modifications... from the menu. You will see your changes diff with respect to the original file if you expand the timestamp shown.More detailed info here: http://www.sitepoint.com/edit-source-files-in-chrome/Pretty easy, go to the \'scripts\' tab. And select the source file you want and double-click any line to edit it.here\'s a gentle introduction to the js debugger in chrome that i wrote. Maybe it will help others looking for info on this: http://meeech.amihod.com/getting-started-with-javascript-debugging-in-chrome/you can edit the javascrpit files dynamically in the Chrome debugger, under the Sources tab, however your changes will be lost if you refresh the page, to pause page loading before doing your changes, you will need to set a break point then reload the page and edit your changes and finally unpause the debugger to see your changes take effect.\nI was looking for a way to change the script and debug that new script. Way I managed to do that is:Set the breakpoint in the first line of the script you want to change and debug.Reload the page so the breakpoint is being hitPaste your new script and set desired breakpoints in itCtrl+s, and the page will refresh causing that breakpoint in first line to be hit. F8 to continue, and now your newly pasted script replaces original one as long as no redirections and reloads are made.If its javascript that runs on a button click, then making the change under Sources>Sources (in the developer tools in chrome ) and pressing Ctrl +S to save, is enough. I do this all the time. If you refresh the page, your javascript changes would be gone, but chrome will still remember your break points.As this is quite popular question that deals with live-editing of JS, I want to point out another useful option. As described by svjacob in his answer:I realized I could attach a break-point in the debugger to some line of code before what I wanted to dynamically edit. And since break-points stay even after a reload of the page, I was able to edit the changes I wanted while paused at break-point and then continued to let the page load.The above solution didn\'t work for me for quite large JS (webpack bundle - 3.21MB minified version, 130k lines of code in prettified version) - chrome crashed and asked for page reloading which reverted any saved changes. The way to go in this case was Fiddler where you can set AutoRespond option to replace any remote resource with any local file from your computer - see this SO question for details.In my case I also had to add CORS headers to fiddler to successfully mock response.
