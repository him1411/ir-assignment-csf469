I want to completely remove Python 2.7 from my Mac OS X 10.6.4. I managed to remove the entry from the PATH variable by reverting my .bash_profile. But I also want to remove all directories, files, symlinks, and entries that got installed by the Python 2.7 install package. I\'ve got the install package from http://www.python.org/. What directories/files/configuration file entries do I need to remove? Is there a list somewhere?The complete list is documented here.  Basically, all you need to do is the following:Remove the Python 2.7 frameworksudo rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7Remove the Python 2.7 applications directorysudo rm -rf "/Applications/Python 2.7"Remove the symbolic links in /usr/local/bin that point to this Python version see ls -l /usr/local/bin | grep \'../Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7\' and then run the following command to remove all the links:If necessary, edit your shell profile file(s) to remove adding /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7 to your PATH environment file.  Depending on which shell you use, any of the following files may have been modified:\n~/.bash_login, ~/.bash_profile, ~/.cshrc, ~/.profile, ~/.tcshrc, and/or ~/.zprofile.This one works:Description:\nIt list all the links, removes @ character and then removes them.If you installed it using the PKG installer, you can do:or better:which will output something like:you can now select which packages you will unlink (remove).This is the unlink documentation: In my example you will typeor in one single line:Important: --unlink is not available anymore starting with Lion (as of Q1`2014 that would include Lion, Mountain Lion, and Mavericks). If anyone that comes to this instructions try to use it with lion, should try instead to adapt it with what this post is saying: https://wincent.com/wiki/Uninstalling_packages_(.pkg_files)_on_Mac_OS_XUninstalling with brew uninstall python will not remove the natively installed python but rather the verson installed with brew.In regards to deleting the symbolic links, I found this to be useful.I uninstalled Python 2.7.10 on Mac OSX Yosemite by doing the following "brew uninstall python". It successfully completed as follows:Obviously you have to have brew installed first for this to work... https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Installation.md#installation**If you want to uninstall the Python3 with brew:No need to uninstall old python versions.Just install new version say python-3.3.2-macosx10.6.dmg\nand change the soft link of python to newly installed python3.3Check the path of default python and python3.3 with following commands"which python" and "which python3.3"then delete existing soft link of python and point it to python3.3Onur G\xc3\xbczel provides the solution in his blog post, "Uninstall Python Package from OS X.You should type the following commands into the terminal:sudo rm -rf "/Applications/Python x.y"where command x.y is the version of Python installed. According to your question, it should be 2.7. In Onur\'s words:WARNING: This commands will remove all Python versions installed with packages. Python provided from the system will not be affected.If you have more than 1 Python version installed from python.org, then run the fourth command again, changing "x.y" for each version of Python that is to be uninstalled.
