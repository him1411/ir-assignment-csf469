Many times I\'m using the string match function to know if a string matches a regular expression.Is there any difference between this:They seem to give the same result?First, let\'s see what each function does:regexObject.test( String )Executes the search for a match between a regular expression and a specified string. Returns true or false.string.match( RegExp )Used to retrieve the matches when matching a string against a regular expression. Returns an array with the matches or null if there are none.Since null evaluates to false,Is there any difference regarding performance? Yes. I found this short note in the MDN site:If you need to know if a string matches a regular expression regexp, use regexp.test(string).Is the difference significant? The answer once more is YES! This jsPerf I put together shows the difference is  ~30% - ~60% depending on the browser:Use .test if you want a faster boolean check. Use .match to retrieve all matches when using the g global flag.Don\'t forget to take into consideration the global flag in your regexp :This is because Regexp keeps track of the lastIndex when a new match is found.
