I came across the following lineWhat do the ? and : mean in this context?It is called the Conditional Operator (which is a ternary operator).It has the form of: condition ? value-if-true : value-if-false\nThink of the ? as "then" and : as "else".Your code is equivalent toProperly parenthesized for clarity, it is meaning return eitherhsb.s = max != 0 ? 255 * delta / max : 0;? is a ternary operator, it works like an if in conjunction with the : != means not equalsSo, the long form of this line would beThis is probably a bit clearer when written with brackets as follows:What it does is evaluate the part in the first brackets. If the result is true then the part after the ? and before the : is returned. If it is false, then what follows the : is returned.? : isn\'t this the ternary operator?var x= expression ? true:falseBe careful with this.  A -1 evaluates to true although -1 != true and -1 != false.  Trust me, I\'ve seen it happen.so -1 ? "true side" : "false side" evaluates to "true side"
