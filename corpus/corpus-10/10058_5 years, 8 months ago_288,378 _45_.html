I am gettingopen failed: EACCES (Permission denied)on the line OutputStream myOutput = new FileOutputStream(outFileName);I checked the root, and I tried android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE.How can I fix this problem?I had the same problem... The <uses-permission was in the wrong place. This is right:The uses-permission tag needs to be outside the application tag.For API 23+ you need to request the read/write permissions even if they are already in your manifest.AndroidManifest.xmlFor official documentation about requesting permissions for API 23+, check https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting.htmlI have observed this once when running the application inside the emulator. In the emulator settings, you need to specify the size of external storage ("SD Card") properly. By default, the "external storage" field is empty, and that probably means there is no such device and EACCES is thrown even if permissions are granted in the manifest.In addition to all the answers, make sure you\'re not using your phone as a USB storage.I was having the same problem on HTC Sensation on USB storage mode enabled. I can still debug/run the app, but I can\'t save to external storage.My issue was with "TargetApi(23)" which is needed if your minSdkVersion is bellow 23.So, I have request permission with the following snippetIt turned out, it was a stupid mistake since I had my phone still connected to the desktop PC and didn\'t realize this.So I had to turn off the USB connection and everything worked fine.I had the same problem on Samsung Galaxy Note 3, running CM 12.1. The issue for me was that i hadand had to use it to take and store user photos. When I tried to load those same photos in ImageLoader i got the (Permission denied) error. The solution was to explicitly addsince the above permission only limits the write permission up to API version 18, and with it the read permission.I would expect everything below /data to belong to "internal storage". You should, however, be able to write to /sdcard.I had the same problem and none of suggestions helped. But I found an interesting reason for that, on a physical device, Galaxy Tab.When USB storage is on, external storage read and write permissions don\'t have any effect.\nJust turn off USB storage, and with the correct permissions, you\'ll have the problem solved.In addition to all answers, if the clients are using Android 6.0, Android added new permission model for (Marshmallow).Trick: If you are targeting version 22 or below, your application will request all permissions at install time just as it would on any device running an OS below Marshmallow. If  you are trying on the emulator then from android 6.0 onwards you need to explicitly go the settings->apps-> YOURAPP  -> permissions and change the permission if you have given any.When your application belongs to the system application, it can\'t access the SD card.Change a permission property in your /system/etc/permission/platform.xml\nand group need to mentioned as like below.Strangely after putting a slash "/" before my newFile my problem was solved. I changed this:to this:I had the same error when was trying to write an image in DCIM/camera folder on Galaxy S5 (android 6.0.1) and I figured out that only this folder is restricted. I simply could write into DCIM/any folder but not in camera.\nThis should be brand based restriction/customization.I am creating a folder under /data/ in my init.rc (mucking around with the aosp on Nexus 7) and had exactly this problem.It turned out that giving the folder rw (666) permission was not sufficient and it had to be rwx (777) then it all worked!The post 6.0 enforcement of storage permissions can be bypassed if you have a rooted device via these adb commands:Add Permission in manifest.Maybe the answer is this:on the API >= 23 devices, if you install app (the app is not system app), you should check the storage permission in "Setting - applications", there is permission list for every app, you should check it on! tryI had the same problem (API >= 23).The solution https://stackoverflow.com/a/13569364/1729501 worked for me, but it was not practical to disconnect app for debugging.my solution was to install proper adb device driver on Windows. The google USB driver did not work for my device.STEP 1: Download adb drivers for your device brand.STEP 2: Go to device manager -> other devices -> look for entries with word "adb" -> select Update driver -> give location in step 1In my case I was using a file picker library which returned the path to external storage but it started from /root/. And even with the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission granted at runtime I still got error EACCES (Permission denied). \nSo use Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() to get the correct path to external storage.Example: \nCannot write: /root/storage/emulated/0/newfile.txt\nCan write: /storage/emulated/0/newfile.txtOutput 1:Output 2:
