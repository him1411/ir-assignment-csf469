I try to integrate Swift code in my app.My app is written in Objective-C and I added a Swift class. I\'ve done everything described here. But my problem is that Xcode haven\'t created the -Swift.h file, only the bridging headers. So I created it, but it\'s actually empty.\nI can use all my ObjC classes in Swift, but I can\'t do it vice versa. I marked my swift class with @objc but it didn\'t help. What can I do now?EDIT: Apple says:" When you import Swift code into Objective-C, you rely on an Xcode-generated header file to expose those files to Objective-C. [...] The name of this header is your product module name followed by adding \xe2\x80\x9c-Swift.h\xe2\x80\x9d. "Now when I want to import that File, it gives an error:Here is my FBManager.swift file:I spent about 4 hours trying to enable Swift in my Xcode Objective-C based project. My "myproject-Swift.h" file was created successfully, but my Xcode didn\'t see my Swift-classes. So, I decided to create a new Xcode Objc-based project and finally I found the right answer! Hope this post will help someone :-)Implement your Swift class with @objc attribute:Open Build Settings and check those parameters:Make sure that your Product Module Name doesn\'t contain any special charactersOnce you\'ve added *.swift file to the project this property will appear in Build SettingsThis header is auto generated by XcodeImport Swift interface header in your *.m fileDon\'t create the header file yourself. Delete the one you created.Make sure your Swift classes are tagged with @objc or inherit from a class that derives (directly or indirectly) from NSObject.Xcode won\'t generate the file if you have any compiler errors in your project - make sure your project builds cleanly.Allow Xcode to do its work, do not add/create Swift header manually. Just add @objc before your Swift class ex. In your project setting search for below flags and change it to YES (Both Project and Target)Then clean the project and build once, after build succeed (it should probably) import below header file in your objective-c class .m fileBoooom!Also probably helpful for those of you with a Framework target:The import statement of the auto-generated header file looks a bit different from app targets. In addition to the other things mentioned in other answers useinstead ofas per Apples documentation on Mix & Match for framework targets.Make sure your project defines a module and you have given a name to the module. Then rebuild, and Xcode will create the -Swift.h header file and you will be able to import.You can set module definition and module name in your project settings.I had the same issue and it turned out special symbols in the module name are replaced by xcode  (in my case dashes ended up being underscores). In project settings check "module name" to find the module name for your project. After that either use ModuleName-Swift.h or rename the module in settings.The file is created automatically (talking about Xcode 6.3.2 here). But you won\'t see it, since it\'s in your Derived Data folder. After marking your swift class with @objc, compile, then search for Swift.h in your Derived Data folder. You should find the Swift header there.I had the problem, that Xcode renamed my my-Project-Swift.h to my_Project-Swift.h Xcode doesn\'t like\n"." "-" etc. symbols. With the method above you can find the filename and import it to a Objective-C class.Just include \n  #import "myProject-Swift.h" in .m or .h fileP.S You will not find "myProject-Swift.h" in file inspector it\'s hidden. But it is generated by app automatically.Details: Objective-C project with Swift 3 code in Xcode 8.1Tasks:ObjcClass.hObjcClass.mIn my sample I use SwiftCode.h to detect Swift code in Objective-C. This file generate automatically (I did not create a physical copy of this header file in a project), and you can only set name of this file:  If the compiler can not find your header file Swift code, try to compile the project.You need to create bridging header file. When you add Swift file in Objective-C project, or Objective-C file in swift project Xcode will suggest you to create  bridging header.You can change bridging header file name here:Bridging-Header.hFull integration steps Objective-c and Swift described above. Now I will write some other code examples.Swift classObjective-C code (calling code)ResultObjective-C class (ObjcClass.h)ObjcClass.mSwift code (calling code)ResultSwift extensionObjective-C code (calling code)Objective-C extension (UIViewExtension.h)UIViewExtension.mSwift code (calling code)There is two condition,So, For that purpose, you have to follow this steps:Go to Build Settings and perform below steps with search, After that, clean and rebuild your project.In that case,First write "@objc" before your class in swift file.After that ,In your objective c file, write this,In that case, In your header file, write this,I hope this will help you.@sig answer is one of the best, however, it did not work for me with the old project (not new!), I needed some modifications. After a lot of variations I found the recipe for me (using XCode 7.2):The last point (5) was crucial. I put it only on the second section (Targets field), the Project field should be left empty:  Otherwise, it did not generate the right "Project-Swift.h" file for me (it did not include swift methods).In my case, apart from these steps:I have needed to put the class as public in order to create productName-Swift.h file:I just discovered that adding a directory of swift files to a project won\'t work.  You need to create a group first for the directory, then add the swift files...I had the same problem and finally it appeared that they weren\'t attached to the same targets. \nThe ObjC class is attached to Target1 and Target2, the Swift class is only attached to the Target1 and is not visible inside the ObjC class.Hope this helps someone.I have the same error: myProjectModule-Swift.h file not found", but, in my case, real reason was in wrong deployment target:\n"Swift is unavailable on OS X earlier than 10.9; please set MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET to 10.9 or later (currently it is \'10.7\')"\nso, when I\'ve changed deployment target to 10.9 - project had been compiled successfully.My issue was that the auto-generation of the -swift.h file was not able to understand a subclass of CustomDebugStringConvertible.  I changed class to be a subclass of NSObject instead.  After that, the -swift.h file now included the class properly.my problem was I got stuck after xcode created the bridge file but still I got error in header file name  MYPROJECTNAME-swift.h 1.I check in terminal and search for all auto created swift bridge files:find ~/library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/ -name "*-Swift.h"|xargs basename|sort -you see what xcode created.I had issues in that I would add classes to my objective-c bridging header, and in those objective-c headers that were imported, they were trying to import the swift header.  It didn\'t like that.So in all my objective-c classes that use swift, but are also bridged, the key was to make sure that you use forward class declarations in the headers, then import the "*-Swift.h" file in the .m file.
