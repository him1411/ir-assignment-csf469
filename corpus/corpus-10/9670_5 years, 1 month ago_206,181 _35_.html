I\'m new to programming. Can someone explain what .map would do in:The map method takes an enumerable object and a block, and runs the block for each element, outputting each returned value from the block (the original object is unchanged unless you use map!):Array and Range are enumerable types. map with a block returns an Array.  map! mutates the original array.Where is this helpful, and what is the difference between map! and each? Here is an example:The output:map, along with select and each is one of Ruby\'s workhorses in my code.It allows you to run an operation on each of your array\'s objects and return them all in the same place. An example would be to increment an array of numbers by one:If you can run a single method on your array\'s elements you can do it in a shorthand-style like so:To do this with the above example you\'d have to do something like thisTo more simply use the ampersand shortcut technique, let\'s use a different example:Transforming data in Ruby often involves a cascade of map operations. Study map & select, they are some of the most useful Ruby methods in the primary library. They\'re just as important as each.(map is also an alias for collect. Use whatever works best for you conceptually.)More helpful information:If the Enumerable object you\'re running each or map on contains a set of Enumerable elements (hashes, arrays), you can declare each of those elements inside your block pipes like so:In the case of a Hash (also an Enumerable object, a Hash is simply an array of tuples with special instructions for the interpreter). The first "pipe parameter" is the key, the second is the value.To answer the actual question:Assuming that params is a hash, this would be the best way to map through it: Use two block parameters instead of one to capture the key & value pair for each interpreted tuple in the hash.It "maps" a function to each item in an Enumerable - in this case, a range. So it would call the block passed once for every integer from 0 to param_count (exclusive - you\'re right about the dots) and return an array containing each return value.Here\'s the documentation for Enumerable#map. It also has an alias, collect.0..param_count means "up to and including param_count".\n0...param_count means "up to, but not including param_count".Range#map does not return an Enumerable, it actually maps it to an array. It\'s the same as Range#to_a.I\'ll try a different method of explanation to those above:What does map doI used to work in photo copy place back in the day. We\'d be given a stack of papers. And basically we had to:In other words we were given certain pages which we had to transform into something new. In this case, the end result was a photocopy with a new stamp on them.I could just have easily: (i) redacted out the first line, or (ii) destroyed the new photocopy entirely.This is basically what the map function does: it allows you to transform a series of items to anything you like!In the above case, we transformed a basket of food into a new basket of food with a huge bite in each of the fruits. That\'s how it was transformed!ImportantAs @Anthony notes below, the original basket of fruit remains untoched: it is still there, and there aint no bites in them.You can confirm this in the ruby documentation here: https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html#method-i-mapI hope this helps you.Using ruby 2.4 you can do the same thing using transform_values, this feature extracted from rails to ruby.Map is a part of the enumerable module. Very similar to "collect" For Example: Map provides values iterating through an array that are returned by the block parameters.
