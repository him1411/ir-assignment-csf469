We are using a git repository to store our project. We have our branches departing from the original branch. But now we want to create a small new project to track some documentation. For that we would want to create a new empty branch to start storing our files, and I would want other users of the network to clone that branch.How can we do that?I tried some things, but they didnt work.It seems to push the branch ok, but when I do a fetch or pull, it downloads information from other branches, and then I also get some extra files from other projects. What\'s the best solution?You can create a branch as an orphan:This will create a new branch with no parents. Then, you can clear the working directory with: and add the documentation files, commit them and push them up to github.A pull or fetch will always update the local information about all the remote branches. If you only want to pull/fetch the information for a single remote branch, you need to specify it.The correct answer is to create an orphan branch. I explain how to do this in detail on my blog: http://sidja.in/post/62663941071...Before starting, upgrade to the latest version of GIT. To make sure\n  you\xe2\x80\x99re running the latest version, runIf it spits out an old version, you may need to augment your PATH with\n  the folder containing the version you just installed. Ok, we\xe2\x80\x99re ready. After doing a cd into the folder containing your git\n  checkout, create an orphan branch. For this example, I\xe2\x80\x99ll name the\n  branch \xe2\x80\x9cmybranch\xe2\x80\x9d.Delete everything in the orphan branchMake some changesAdd and commit the changesThat\xe2\x80\x99s it. If you runyou\xe2\x80\x99ll notice that the commit history starts from scratch. To switch\n  back to your master branch, just runYou can return to the orphan branch by runningMake an empty new branch like this:If your proj-doc files are already in a commit under a single subdir you can make the new branch this way:which might be more convenient than git branch --orphan if that would leave you with a lot of git rm and git mving to do.Try and see if that helps with your fetching-too-much problem.  Also if you really only want to fetch a single branch it\'s safest to just specify it on the commandline.if git version does not have --orphan option, this method should be use; After doing some workslet\'s say you have a master branch with files/directories:master.git\ndirectory1\ndirectory2\nfile_1\n..\nfile_nIn step 2 we simply remove all the files locally to avoid confusion with the files on your new branch and those ones you keep in \'master\' branch. \nThen we unlink all those files in step 3. And since the step 4 we are working with our new empty branch.  Once you\'ve done, you can easily switch between your branches:git checkout master \ngit checkout new_branch
