How can I create a Cygwin shortcut that will open Cygwin at a specific folder? This would obviate having to typeeach time I launch Cygwin.When you install Cygwin (or if you\xe2\x80\x99ve already installed it, download it again and start setup again to run an update), make sure that you select the chere package under the "Shells" category.After Cygwin is launched, open up a Cygwin terminal (as an administrator) and type the command: chere -i -t mintty.Now you should have "Bash Prompt Here" in the Windows right-click context menu.(mintty is Cygwin\'s default terminal. If you don\'t choose it with the -t option, your "Bash Prompt Here" will use the same terminal as the Windows Command Prompt, which prevents horizontal resizing.)Here\'s what I use. It doesn\'t require chere package or registry tinkering.  Works on Windows 7.Go to your "Send To" folder:Create a shortcut named Bash Here having this in the Target field:In the Windows Explorer, you right-click on a folder & select Send To > Bash Here.And here\'s the opposite trick, opening a Windows Explorer in your current bash dir.  Create this alias:Note: the cygpath -w . part above is enclosed in back-ticks.  Now just type winx at the bash prompt, and a Win Explorer pops up there.Note: If winx directs you to your documents folder, try I made a .reg file that puts an "Open Cygwin Here" option in the right-click context menu.\nIt depends on the Cygwin "chere" package, which you can install using apt-cyg if you didn\'t install it in the initial setup.From the cygwin terminal, run this command:echo "cd your_path" >> ~/.bashrcThe .bashrc script is run when you open a new bash session.  The code above with change to the your_path directory when you open a new cygwin session.For cygwin64 or installations without chere you can use the following command in a registry entry (assuming windows due to your path, also assuming cygwin installation directory is c:\\cygwin64)Works on Windows 7 and 8\nRegistry file available for download here: http://tomkay.me/blog/Cygwin64---Open-Here-18If you want to have that directory as your default, simply add a cd statement to your ~/.profile file.What I tend to do is use that method to set my usual directory, plus define aliases for my common cases as well:or your equivalent. This lets me change directories very fast.I use and Icon to launch my cygwin without the chere package.As two7s_clash said you first need to install chere package and setup mintty:You are now able to open cygwin in specific directory with a Right mouse click in Windows Explorer (Context Menu) and select "Bash Prompt Here".You can also open cygwin from a specific directory using windows command prompt:Execute C:\\cygwin64\\bin\\mintty.exe C:\\cygwin64\\bin\\env.exe CHERE_INVOKING=1 C:\\cygwin64\\bin\\bash.exe -lThis command will open cygwin with current directory taken from command prompt.This command can also be used to open cygwin from custom file manager, like FreeCommander.To open cygwin with current directory taken from FreeCommander, do the following:Add a new toolbar (+ Icon), Shortcut: InsertYou can add custom shortcut to open cygwin from FreeCommander:Great reference: MinTTY Wiki, article Tips: Starting in a particular directoryI used the following lines of code to start zsh in the current directory in Win7.note that i used %V instead of %L or %1 (since both didn\'t work for me)Open Cygwin terminal as Administrator In powershell (using chocolatey):In cygwin\nWill Install right-click menuNow you can right click and use "Bash Prompt Here" in any folder.In the answer that uses the registry, I found that on Windows 2008 R2 SP1, you need to drop the Background out of the path. Further, since the chere and xhere are not part of cygwin64, here is a solution that works for both, combining the registry and the Send To solutions. Replace \'E:\\cygwin64\' with your install location:\nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Directory\\shell\\cygwin_bash]\n@="Open Cygwin Here"[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Directory\\shell\\cygwin_bash\\command]\n@="E:\\cygwin64\\bin\\mintty.exe -i /Cygwin-Terminal.ico --exec /bin/bash.exe --login -c \\"cd \'%1\' ; exec bash -rcfile ~/.bashrc\\""\nThis is the only Cygwin64 registry solution that worked for me in Windows 8.1:Make sure you modify your \'C:\\cygwin64\' path as necessary.I have made a registry edit script to open Cygwin at any folder you right click. It\'s on my GitHub. Here\'s my GitHubI have created the batch file and put it to the Cygwin\'s /bin directory. This script was developed so it allows to install/uninstall the registry entries for opening selected folders and drives in Cygwin. For details see the link http://with-love-from-siberia.blogspot.com/2013/12/cygwin-here.html. update: This solution does the same as early suggestions but all manipulations with Windows Registry are hidden within the script. Perform the command to installPerform the command to uninstallFind file Cygwin.bat and make content like this:Add path to cygwin.bat to environment PATH.Now in any folder you can type to address bar:Also you can type it when you in cmd.exeYou can add the icon to the shell by adding an Icon field set to the path to your Cygwin.ico file.On my Windows machine it was not taking:chere -i -t minttyBecause mintty shell was not available,but you might have choice of various other shells like ash bash cmd dash mksh pdksh posh tcsh zsh passwd.so I used :chere -i -s bashCreate a bash file say move.sh which has the following code \nC:\\cygwin64\\bin\\run.exe -p /bin bash runFile.sh\nThis starts the Cygwin and executes the runFile.sh present in the bin directory of Cygwin\nSuppose you want to navigate to a specific directory say E:\\code\nthen runFile.sh has the following code cd E:\ncd codeWhen a fresh install is needed, I create a Windows "user environment variable " named HOME and assigns it the path of wherever "My Documents" reside.The cygwin installer detects the HOME variable, automatically translates this into a cygpath and selects this it to be my ~ directory.This has worked fine for every workstation I have used professionally the last 5 years (about 3 or 4, Win7). I have always been the only user on these machines, cannot say what the effect is.Copy above commands in a text file and save it as .bat in any of "your folder of interest".\nIt should open cygwin in "your folder of interest".based on @LindseyD answer I created a simple BAT file, that opens cygwin in current directory, it may be useful (for me it is). Assuming that You have cygwin\'s bin directory in PATH.I had also problem with git, that used to "steal" my cygwin commands - so i needed to run \n  C:\\cygwin\\bin\\mintty.exe - \nbut after installing chere and executing chere -i -t mintty -f  as admin (see above), you can simply use : \n C:\\cygwin\\bin\\mintty.exe -e /bin/xhere /bin/bash.exe "." \nI added this in Total Commander as custom button (right click on panel > add ...)  and it works very well. I don\'t know why I had to wast so much time, but this works for me on win 10, 64 bit:Probably the simplest one:1) Create file foo.reg2) Insert content:3) Execute foo.regNow just right-click in any folder, click open mintty and it will spawn mintty in that folder.Best to do like below:
