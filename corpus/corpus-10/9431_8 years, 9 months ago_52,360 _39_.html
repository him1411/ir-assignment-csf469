How can I setup GNU screen to allow the mouse\'s scrollwheel to scroll around in the scrollback buffer? I tried to Google about this, but most hits where on how to allow applications inside screen to use the scrollwheel.I believe you can just add a line like this to your ~/.screenrc:Where "xterm*" is a glob match of your current TERM. To confirm it works, ^A^D to detach from your screen, then screen -d -r to reattach, then ls a few times, and try to scroll back.  It works for me.What is this magic? Well, let\'s consult the manual pages.screen(1) says:From termcap(5):In screen, you must first enter "scrollback mode" (or "copy mode") to be able to scroll around in the scrollback buffer: key combo Ctrl-a Esc, or Ctrl-a Ctrl-[. Then you can scroll around the history using  Up and Down keys (or Ctrl-b, Ctrl-f to move a page).In that mode, your mousewheel should also work, if it works in other apps.\nYou end  "scrollback mode" with Esc.As for scrolling the scrollback buffer without first entering scrollback mode, that is probably not possible without modifying screen. I have never heard of a way to access the scrollback buffer, apart from scrollback mode.The excellent article that Jon Z is referring to is no longer available, but I was able to fish the text-only version of it from the Google cache. I\'m saving it here in case Google drops that as well in the future. Original post was by Mikael St\xc3\xa5ldal so credit where credit is due.--How to use mousewheel in GNU ScreenGNU Screen has support for scrollback, but by default you have to use awkward keys to use it. I would like to be able to use Shift-PageUp, Shift-PageDown and the mousewheel to scroll, just like you can do in xterm.It was not easy to configure Screen for this, and it involves cooperation with the terminal emulator. But I finally managed to achieve a solution which works pretty well. Add this to your ~/.Xresources file (you need to log out for this to take effect):Then add this to your ~/.screenrc file:This works in xterm. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if it works in other terminal emulators.Note that this disables the normal scrolling support in xterm, you will only be able to scroll when using Screen. You might want to start xterm like this to always use Screen:For OS X (Snow Leopard), the following worked for me:http://slaptijack.com/system-administration/mac-os-x-terminal-and-gnu-screen-scrollback/Briefly, it involves adding the following to ~/.screenrc on the remote host (the one you\'re running screen on):And to use the scrollwheel in a VIM inside GNU Screen:[.vimrc]Press Ctrl+a followed by [The title bar of your terminal should now say Copy mode.Now the arrow keys and the mouse wheel should work as expected.To return to normal press Esc or press Enter a couple of times.The following worked for me in both Cygwin and Putty:\nEdit .screenrc and addSetting TERM variable to vt100 instead of xterm before running screen also works.\nI\'ve been using this for a long time, works like a charm.Add this to your .bashrc:--For reference, my .screenrc has this (not needed for this AFAIK):If the answers above don\'t work for you, make sure you don\'t have a caption or the alwayslastline option set in your .screenrc. If you have them, this will not work:If you need this information, you can try setting it in the title of your terminal (with termcapinfo)The solution when using "Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS" is as follows:a). Update $HOME/.screenrc as previous answers have specified:b). Use "Settings"."Preferred Applications" to alter the default terminal to xterm, by selecting the "X Terminal" one in the drop-down list.Some superfluous notesNone of the other terminals, including installing "lxterminal",\nworked for me, even when I altered the termcapinfo line to "*"\ninstead of "xterm*".By clicking the menu button in the top-left corner of the screen, you\ncan get the Settings dialog using the 3rd icon from the bottom right\ncorner.
