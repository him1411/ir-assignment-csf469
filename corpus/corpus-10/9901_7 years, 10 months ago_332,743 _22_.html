What is the best way to test for an empty string with jquery-out-of-the-box, i.e. without plugins? I tried this. But it did\'t work at least out-of-the-box. It would be nice to use something that\'s builtin.I wouldn\'t like to repeat everywhere if some  if (isempty(a))   would be available.To ignore white space for strings:If you need legacy support (IE8-) for trim(), use $.trim or a polyfill.The link you gave seems to be attempting something different to the test you are trying to avoid repeating.tests if the string is an empty string or null. The article you linked to tests if the string consists entirely of whitespace (or is empty).The test you described can be replaced by:Because in javascript, an empty string, and null, both evaluate to false in a boolean context.Based on David\'s answer I personally like to check the given object first if it is a string at all. Otherwise calling .trim() on a not existing object would throw an exception:Usage:andif you want to accept null but reject emptyEDIT: woops, forgot your condition is if it IS emptyTry executing this in your browser console or in a node.js repl.Therefore, a simple branching construct will suffice for the test.Since you can also input numbers as well as fixed type strings, the answer should actually be:Check if data is a empty string (and ignore any white space) with jQuery:Meanwhile we can have one function that checks for all \'empties\' like null, undefined, \'\', \' \', {}, [].\nSo I just wrote this.Use cases and results.Try this
