What\'s your preferred way of getting current system status (current CPU, RAM, free disk space, etc.) in Python? Bonus points for *nix and Windows platforms.There seems to be a few possible ways of extracting that from my search:Using a library such as PSI (that currently seems not actively developed and not supported on multiple platform) or something like pystatgrab (again no activity since 2007 it seems and no support for Windows).Using platform specific code such as using a os.popen("ps") or similar for the *nix systems and MEMORYSTATUS in ctypes.windll.kernel32 (see this recipe on ActiveState) for the Windows platform. One could put a Python class together with all those code snippets.It\'s not that those methods are bad but is there already a well-supported, multi-platform way of doing the same thing?The psutil library will give you some system information (CPU / Memory usage) on a variety of platforms:psutil is a module providing an interface for retrieving information on running processes and system utilization (CPU, memory) in a portable way by using Python, implementing many functionalities offered by tools like ps, top  and Windows task manager.It currently supports Linux, Windows, OSX, Sun Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD, both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures, with Python versions from 2.6 to 3.5 (users of Python 2.4 and 2.5 may use 2.1.3 version).Use the psutil library.  For me on Ubuntu, pip installed 0.4.3.  You can check your version of psutil by doing in Python.To get some memory and CPU stats:I also like to do:which gives the current memory use of your Python script.There are some more in-depth examples on the pypi page for 4.3.0 and 0.5.0.For Ubuntu 16 and 14, installing from pip gave me version 4.3.0, which doesn\'t have the phymem_usage() method. To get 0.5.0, download the tar.gz file, then do Here\'s something I put together a while ago, it\'s windows only but may help you get part of what you need done.Derived from:\n"for sys available mem"\nhttp://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa455130.aspx"individual process information and python script examples"\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/technet/scriptcenter/scripts/default.mspx?mfr=trueNOTE: the WMI interface/process is also available for performing similar tasks\n        I\'m not using it here because the current method covers my needs, but if someday it\'s needed to extend or improve this, then may want to investigate the WMI tools a vailable.WMI for python:http://tgolden.sc.sabren.com/python/wmi.htmlThe code:http://monkut.webfactional.com/blog/archive/2009/1/21/windows-process-memory-logging-pythonBelow codes, without external libraries worked for me. I tested at Python 2.7.9CPU UsageAnd Ram Usage, Total, Used and Free"... current system status (current CPU, RAM, free disk space, etc.)"  And "*nix and Windows platforms" can be a difficult combination to achieve.The operating systems are fundamentally different in the way they manage these resources.  Indeed, they differ in core concepts like defining what counts as system and what counts as application time."Free disk space"?  What counts as "disk space?"  All partitions of all devices?  What about foreign partitions in a multi-boot environment?I don\'t think there\'s a clear enough consensus between Windows and *nix that makes this possible.  Indeed, there may not even be any consensus between the various operating systems called Windows.  Is there a single Windows API that works for both XP and Vista?One-liner for the RAM usage with only stdlib dependency:You can use psutil or psmem with subprocess\nexample code Reference  http://techarena51.com/index.php/how-to-install-python-3-and-flask-on-linux/https://github.com/Leo-g/python-flask-cmdI don\'t believe that there is a well-supported multi-platform library available. Remember that Python itself is written in C so any library is simply going to make a smart decision about which OS-specific code snippet to run, as you suggested above.
