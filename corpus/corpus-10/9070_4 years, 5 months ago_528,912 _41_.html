I have a List of doubles in java and I want sorted ArrayList in descending orderInput ArrayList is like-       The out put should be like thisThat will do what you want. Remember to import Collections though!Here is the documentation for Collections.Use util method of java.util.Collections class, i.eIn fact, if you want to sort custom object you can usesee collections apiDescending:Using lambdas (Java8), and stripping it down to the barest of syntax (the JVM will infer plenty in this case), you get:A more verbose version:\nThe use of a lambda is possible because the Comparator interface has only a single method to implement, so the VM can infer which method is implementing. Since the types of the params can be inferred, they don\'t need to be stated (i.e. (a, b) instead of (Double a, Double b). And since the lambda body has only a single line, and the method is expected to return a value, the return is inferred and the braces aren\'t necessary.For your example, this wil do the magic in Java 8But if you want to sort by some of the field of the object you are sorting, you can do it easily and smoothly by:or orSources:  https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.htmlWith Java8 there is a default sort method on the List interface that will allow you to sort the collection if you provide a Comparator.  You can easily sort the example in the question as follows:Note: the args in the lambda are swapped when passed in to Double.compare to ensure the sort is descendingYou can use Collections.sort(list) to sort list if your list contains Comparable elements. Otherwise I would recommend you to implement that interface like here:and of course provide your own realization of compareTo method like here:And then you can again use Colection.sort(list) as now list contains objects of Comparable type and can be sorted. Order depends on compareTo method. Check this https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/order.html for more detailed information.Collections.sort allows you to pass an instance of a Comparator which defines the sorting logic. So instead of sorting the list in natural order and then reversing it, one can simply pass Collections.reverseOrder() to sort in order to sort the list in reverse order:As mentioned by @Marco13, apart from being more idiomatic (and possibly more efficient), using the reverse order comparator makes sure that the sort is stable (meaning that the order of elements will not be changed when they are equal according to the comparator, whereas reversing will change the order)if you are using Java SE 8, then this might be of help.you can do like this:Collection has a default Comparator that can help you with that.Also, if you want to use some Java 8 new features, you can do like that:You can use like that With Eclipse Collections you could create a primitive double list, sort it and then reverse it to put it in descending order.  This approach would avoid boxing the doubles.  If you want a List<Double>, then the following would work.If you want to keep the type as ArrayList<Double>, you can initialize and sort the list using the ArrayListIterate utility class as follows:Note: I am a committer for Eclipse Collections.|*| Sorting an List :|=> Sort Asc Order :|=> Sort Dsc Order :|*| Reverse the order of List :In JAVA 8 its much easy now.--For reverse use this.sorted(Comparator.reverseOrder())Just use loop or default sort() function.
