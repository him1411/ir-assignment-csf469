I triedBut, I got an error sayingThis will work: For Swift 4, the method of which you want to get the selector must be exposed to Objective-C, thus @objc attribute must be added to the method declaration.Here are some somewhat fuller examples updated for Swift 3.You can use a timer to do an action multiple times, as seen in the following example. The timer calls a method to update a label every half second.Here is the code for that:You can also use a timer to schedule a one time event for some time in the future. The main difference from the above example is that you use repeats: false instead of true.The above example calls a method named delayedAction two seconds after the timer is set. It is not repeated, but you can still call timer.invalidate() if you need to cancel the event before it ever happens.Nobody needs userInfo?As of iOS 10 there is also a new block based Timer factory method which is cleaner than using the selector:Check with:Swift 3, pre iOS 10Swift 3, iOS 10+NotesYou will need to use Timer instead of NSTimer in Swift 3.Here is an example:for swift 3 and Xcode 8.2\n(nice to have blocks, but if You compile for iOS9 AND want userInfo):...In Swift 3 something like this with @objc:If you init method of timer then add it to loop using method other selector will not be calledNOTE : If you are want this to repeat make repeats true and keep the reference of timer otherwise update method will not be called.If you are using this method.keep a reference for later use if repeats is true.This is a simple timer class in swift that enables you to:Originally from github: https://github.com/eonist/SimpleTimer
