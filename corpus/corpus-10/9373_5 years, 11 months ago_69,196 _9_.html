I have found myself using JavaScript and I ran across childNodes and children properties. I am wondering what the difference between them is. Also is one preferred to the other?.children is a property of an Element. Only Elements have children, and these children are all of type Element.However .childNodes is a property of Node. .childNodes can contain any node.So a concrete example would be Of course .children is DOM4 so browser support is shaky, however if you use the DOM-shim, your cross browser problems will go away!Most of the time you want to use .children because generally you don\'t want to loop over TextNodes or Comments in your DOM manipulation.If you do want to manipulate TextNodes you probably want .textContent instead.Element.children returns only element children, while Node.childNodes returns all node children.  Note that elements are nodes, so both are available on elements.I believe childNodes is more reliable.  For example, MDC (linked above) notes that IE only got children right in IE 9.  childNodes provides less room for error by browser implementors.
