How do you prevent an ENTER key press from submitting a form in a web-based application?[revision 2012, no inline handler, preserve textarea enter handling]Now you can define a keypress handler on the form:\n<form [...] onkeypress="return checkEnter(event)">Here is a jQuery handler that can be used to stop enter submits, and also stop backspace key -> back.  The (keyCode: selectorString) pairs in the "keyStop" object are used to match nodes that shouldn\'t fire their default action.Remember that the web should be an accessable place, and this is breaking keyboard users expectations. That said, in my case the web application I am working on doesn\'t like the back button anyway, so disabling its\' key shortcut is OK.  The "should enter -> submit" discussion is important, but not related to the actual question asked.Here is the code, up to you to think about accessability and why you would actually want to do this!Simply return false from the onsubmit handleror if you want a handler in the middleYou will have to call this function whic will just cancel the default submit behaviour of the form. You can attach it to any input field or event.The ENTER key merely activates the form\'s default submit button, which will be the first the browser finds within the form.Therefore don\'t have a submit button, but something likeEDIT: In response to discussion in comments:This doesn\'t work if you have only one text field - but it may be that is the desired behaviour in that case.The other issue is that this relies on Javascript to submit the form. This may be a problem from an accessibility point of view. This can be solved by writing the <input type=\'button\'/> with javascript, and then put an <input type=\'submit\' /> within a <noscript> tag. The drawback of this approach is that for javascript-disabled browsers you will then have form submissions on ENTER. It is up to the OP to decide what is the desired behaviour in this case.I know of no way of doing this without invoking javascript at all.All the answers I found on this subject, here or in other posts has one drawback and that is it prevents the actual change trigger on the form element as well. So if you run these solutions onchange event is not triggered as well. To overcome this problem I modified these codes and developed the following code for myself. I hope this becomes useful for others.\nI gave a class to my form "prevent_auto_submit" and added the following JavaScript:In short answer in pure Javascript is:This only disables the "Enter" keypress action for input type=\'text\'. Visitors can still use "Enter" key all over the website.If you want to disable "Enter" for other actions as well, you can add console.log(e); for your your test purposes, and hit F12 in chrome, go to "console" tab and hit "backspace" on the page and look inside it to see what values are returned, then you can target all of those parameters to further enhance the code above to suit your needs for "e.target.nodeName", "e.target.type" and many more...See my detailed answer for a similar question hereThen on your form:Though, it would be better if you didn\'t use obtrusive JavaScript.I\'ve spent some time making this cross browser for IE8,9,10, Opera 9+, Firefox 23, Safari (PC) and Safari(MAC)JSFiddle Example: http://jsfiddle.net/greatbigmassive/ZyeHe/Base code - Call this function via "onkeypress" attached to your form and pass "window.event" into it.In my case, this jQuery JavaScript solved the problemPreventing "ENTER" to submit form may inconvenience some of your users. So it would be better if you follow the procedure below:Write the \'onSubmit\' event in your form tag:write Javascript function as follows:What ever the reason, if you want to prevent the form submission on pressing Enter key, you can write the following function in javascript:thanks.Add this tag to your form - onsubmit="return false;"\nThen you can only submit your form with some JavaScript function.How about:Please check this article How to prevent ENTER keypress to submit a web form?To prevent form submit when pressing enter in a textarea or input field, check the submit event to find what type of element sent the event.A better solution is if you don\'t have a submit button and you fire the event with a normal button. It is better because in the first examlple 2 submit events are fired, but in the second example only 1 submit event is fired.You will find this more simple and useful :DYou can trap the keydown on a form in javascript and prevent the even bubbling, I think.  ENTER on a webpage basically just submits the form that the currently selected control is placed in.This link provides a solution that has worked for me in Chrome, FF, and IE9 plus the emulator for IE7 and 8 that comes with IE9\'s developer tool (F12).http://webcheatsheet.com/javascript/disable_enter_key.phpAnother approach is to append the submit input button to the form only when it is supposed to be submited and replace it by a simple div during the form fillingSimply add this attribute to your FORM tag:Then, in your SCRIPT tag, add this:Then, when you make a button or for any other reason (like in a function) you finally permit a submit, simply flip the global boolean and do a .submit() call, similar to this example:I\'ve always done it with a keypress handler like the above in the past, but today hit on a simpler solution. The enter key just triggers the first non-disabled submit button on the form, so actually all that\'s required is to intercept that button trying to submit:That\'s it. Keypresses will be handled as usual by the browser / fields / etc. If the enter-submit logic is triggered, then the browser will find that hidden submit button and trigger it. And the javascript handler will then prevent the submision.This worked for me.\nonkeydown="return !(event.keyCode==13)"I Have come across this myself because I have multiple submit buttons with different \'name\' values, so that when submitted they do different things on the same php file. The enter / return button breaks this as those values aren\'t submitted.\nSo I was thinking, does the enter / return button activate the first submit button in the form?\nThat way you could have a \'vanilla\' submit button that is either hidden or has a \'name\' value that returns the executing php file back to the page with the form in it.\nOr else a default (hidden) \'name\' value that the keypress activates, and the submit buttons overwrite with their own \'name\' values.\nJust a thought.put into javascript external file or somewhere inside body tagI had the same problem (forms with tons of text fields and unskilled users).I solved it in this way:using this in the HTML code:In this way the ENTER key works as planned, but a confirmation (a second ENTER tap, usually) is required.I leave to the readers the quest for a script sending the user in the field where he pressed ENTER if he decide to stay on the form.
