I\'d like for my chrome extension to reload every time I save a file in the extension folder, without having to explicitly click "reload" in chrome://extensions/. Is this possible?Edit: I\'m aware I can update the interval at which Chrome reloads extensions, which is a half-way solution, but I\'d rather either making my editor (emacs or textmate) trigger on-save a reload or asking Chrome to monitor the directory for changes.You can use "Extensions Reloader" for Chrome:Reloads all unpacked extensions using the extension\'s toolbar button or by browsing to "http://reload.extensions"If you\'ve ever developed a Chrome extension, you might have wanted to\n  automate the process of reloading your unpacked extension without the\n  need of going through the extensions page."Extensions Reloader" allows you to reload all unpacked extensions \n  using 2 ways:1 - The extension\'s toolbar button.2 - Browsing to "http://reload.extensions".The toolbar icon will reload unpacked extensions using a single click.The "reload by browsing" is intended for automating the reload process\n  using "post build" scripts - just add a browse to\n  "http://reload.extensions" using Chrome to your script, and you\'ll\n  have a refreshed Chrome window.Update: As of January 14, 2015, the extension is open-sourced and available on GitHub.Update: I have added an options page, so that you don\'t have to manually find and edit the extension\'s ID any more. CRX and source code are at: https://github.com/Rob--W/Chrome-Extension-Reloader\nUpdate 2: Added shortcut (see my repository on Github).\nThe original code, which includes the basic functionality is shown below.Create an extension, and use the Browser Action method in conjunction with the chrome.extension.management API to reload your unpacked extension.The code below adds a button to Chrome, which will reload an extension upon click.icon48.png: Pick any nice 48x48 icon, for example:\nGoogle Chrome http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/google/chrome/48/Google-Chrome-icon.png in any function or eventwill reload your extension. You also need to change the manifest.json file, adding:I\'ve made a simple embeddable script doing hot reload:https://github.com/xpl/crx-hotreloadIt watches for file changes in an extension\'s directory. When a change detected, it reloads the extension and refreshes the active tab (to re-trigger updated content scripts).Chrome Extensions have a permission system that it wouldn\'t allow it (some people in SO had the same problem as you), so requesting them to "add this feature" is not going to work IMO. There\'s a mail from Chromium Extensions Google Groups with a proposed solution (theory) using chrome.extension.getViews(), but is not guaranteed to work either.If it was possible to add to the manifest.json some Chrome internal pages like chrome://extensions/, it would be possible to create a plugin that would interact to the Reload anchor, and, using an external program like XRefresh (a Firefox Plugin - there\'s a Chrome version using Ruby and WebSocket), you would achieve just what you need:XRefresh is a browser plugin which\n  will refresh current web page due to\n  file change in selected folders. This\n  makes it possible to do live page\n  editing with your favorite HTML/CSS\n  editor.It\'s not possible to do it, but I think you can use this same concept in a different way.You could try to find third-party solutions instead that, after seeing modifications in a file (I don\'t know emacs neither Textmate, but in Emacs it would be possible to bind an app call within a "save file" action), just clicks in an specific coordinate of an specific application: in this case it\'s the Reload anchor from your extension in development (you leave a Chrome windows opened just for this reload).(Crazy as hell but it may work)Another solution would be to create custom livereload script (extension-reload.js):This script connects to the livereload server using websockets. Then, it will issue a chrome.runtime.reload() call upon reload message from livereload. The next step would be to add this script to run as background script in your manifest.json, and voila!Note: this is not my solution. I\'m just posting it. I found it in the generated code of Chrome Extension generator (Great tool!). I\'m posting this here because it might help.Here\'s a function that you can use to watch files for changes, and reload if changes are detected. It works by polling them via AJAX, and reloading via window.location.reload(). I suppose you shouldn\'t use this in a distribution package.Maybe I\'m a little late to the party, but I\'ve solved it for me by creating https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-unpacked-extension/fddfkmklefkhanofhlohnkemejcbamln It works by reloading chrome://extensions page, whenever file.change events are incoming via websockets.A Gulp-based example of how to emit file.change event upon file changes in an extension folder can be found here: https://github.com/robin-drexler/chrome-extension-auto-reload-watcherWhy reloading the entire tab instead of just using the extensions management api to reload/re-enable extensions? Currently disabling and enabling extensions again causes any open inspection window (console log etc.) to close, which I found to be too annoying during active development.Your content files such has html and manifest files are not changeable without installation of the extension, but I do believe that the JavaScript files are dynamically loaded until the extension has been packed.I know this because of a current project im working on via the Chrome Extensions API, and seems to load every-time i refresh a page.Maybe a bit late answer but I think crxreload might work for you. It\'s my result of trying to have a reload-on-save workflow while developing.Use npm init to create a package.json in directory root, thennpm install --save-dev gulp-open && npm install -g gulpthen create a gulpfile.jswhich looks like:This works for me developing with CrossRider, you might watch to change the path you watch the files at, also assuming you have npm and node installed.Just found a newish grunt based project that provides bootstrapping, scaffolding, some automated pre-processing faculty, as well as auto-reloading (no interaction needed). Bootstrap Your Chrome Extension from WebsecurifyThanks to @GmonC and @Arik and some spare time, I managet to get this working. I have had to change two files to make this work.(1) Install LiveReload and Chrome Extension for that application. \nThis will call some script on file change. (2) Open <LiveReloadInstallDir>\\Bundled\\backend\\res\\livereload.js(3) change line #509 to this.window.location.href = "http://reload.extensions";(4) Now install another extension Extensions Reloader which has useful link handler that reload all development extensions on navigating to "http://reload.extensions"(5) Now change that extension\'s background.min.js in this wayif((d.installType=="development")&&(d.enabled==true)&&(d.name!="Extensions Reloader"))replace withOpen LiveReload application, hide Extension Reloader button and activate LiveReload extension by clicking on button in toolbar, you will now reload page and extensions on each file change while using all other goodies from LiveReload (css reload, image reload etc.)Only bad thing about this is that you will have to repeat procedure of changing scripts on every extension update. To avoid updates, add extension as unpacked. When I\'ll have more time to mess around with this, I probably will create extension that eliminates need for both of these extensions.Untill then, I\'m working on my extension Projext AxemanI\'ve forked LiveJS to allow for live reloading of Packaged Apps. Just include the file in your app and every time you save a file the app will autoreload.As mentioned in the docs: the following command line will reload an app so I just created a shell script and called that file from gulp. Super simple:run your necessary watch commands on scripts and call the reload task when you want to. Clean, simple. This is where software such as AutoIt or alternatives shine. The key is writing a script which emulates your current testing phase. Get used to using at least one of them as many technologies do not come with clear workflow/testing paths.Obviously you change the code to suit your testing/iterating needs. Make sure tab clicks are true to where the anchor tag is in the chrome://extensions site. You could also use relative to window mouse movements and other such macros.I would add the script to Vim in a way similar to this:This means that when I\'m in Vim I press the button above ENTER (usually responsible for: | and \\) known as the leader button and follow it with a capital \'A\' and it saves and begins my testing phase script.Please make sure to fill in the {input...} sections in the above Vim/hotkey script appropriately.Many editors will allow you to do something similar with hotkeys.Alternatives to AutoIt can be found here.For Windows: AutoHotkeyFor Linux: xdotool, xbindkeysFor Mac: AutomatorIf you have a Mac, \xc2\xa1the easiest way is with Alfred App!Just get Alfred App with Powerpack, then add the workflow provided in the link below and customise the hotkey you want (I like to use \xe2\x8c\x98 + \xe2\x8c\xa5 + R). That\'s all.Now, every time you use the hotkey, Google Chrome will reload, no matter which application you\'re at that moment.If you want to use other browser, open the AppleScript inside Alfred Preferences Workflows and replace "Google Chrome" with "Firefox", "Safari", ...I also will show here the content of the /usr/bin/osascript script used in the ReloadChrome.alfredworkflow file so you can see what it is doing.The workflow file is ReloadChrome.alfredworkflow.I want to reload (update) my extensions overnight, this is what I use in background.js:Regards, \nPeterDisclaimer: I developed this extension myself.Connect to a LiveReload compatible server to automatically reload your extension every time you save.Bonus: with a little extra work on your part, you can also automatically reload the webpages that your extension alters.Most webpage developers use a build system with some sort of watcher that automatically builds their files and restarts their server and reloads the website.Developing extensions shouldn\'t need to be that different. Clerc brings this same automation to Chrome devs. Set up a build system with a LiveReload server, and Clerc will listen for reload events to refresh your extension.The only big gotcha is changes to the manifest.json. Any tiny typos in the manifest will probably cause further reload attempts to fail, and you will be stuck uninstalling/reinstalling your extension to get your changes loading again.Clerc forwards the complete reload message to your extension after it reloads, so you can optionally use the provided message to trigger further refresh steps.It can\'t be done directly.  Sorry.If you would like to see it as a feature you can request it at http://crbug.com/newYes,you can do it indirectly! Here is my solution.In manifest.jsonIn inject.jsYour injected script can inject other script from any location.Another benefit from this technic is that you can just ignore the limitation of isolated world. see content script execution environment
