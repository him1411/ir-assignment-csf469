Is there a math function in JavaScript that converts numbers to positive value?You could use this...What about x *= -1? I like its simplicity.Math.abs(x) or if you are certain the value is negative before the conversion just prepend a regular minus sign: x = -x.The minus sign (-) can convert positive numbers to negative numbers and negative numbers to positive numbers. x=-y is visual sugar for x=(y*-1). I find this solution easy to understand.If you\'d like to write interesting code that nobody else can ever update, try this:~--xI did something like this myself.It checks if the number is negative and if it is, multiply with -1\nThis does return a value, its up to you if you capture it. In case you want to assign it to something, you should probably do something like:But it really depends what your goal is. For me it was simple, make it positive if negative, else do nothing. Hence the \'\' in the code.\nIn this case i used tertiary operator cause I wanted to, it could very well be:I saw the bitwise solution here and wanted to comment on that one too.This soultion is very fancy in my opinion, we could rewrite it like this:In simple terms, we take the negative number, take one away from it and then bitwise invert it. If we had bitwise inverted it normally we would get a value 1 too small.\nYou can also do this:That will do the same but will invert first and then add 1 to the positive number.\nAlthough you CANT do this:That will not work cause of precedence, postfix operators such as num++ would be evaluated before ~ and the reason prefix ++num wouldnt work even though it is on the same precedence as bitwise NOT(~), is cause it is evaluated from right to left. I did try to swap them around but it seems that prefix is a little finicky compared to bitwise NOT.\nThe +1 will work because \'+\' has a higher precedence and will be evaluated later.I found that solution to be rather fun and decided to expand on it as it was just thrown in there and post people looking at it were probably ignoring it. Although yes, it wont work with floats.My hopes are that this post hasn\'t moved away from the original question. :/I know this is a bit late, but for people struggling with this, you can useFor Converting Negative To PositiveFor Converting Positive To NegativeOr you could simply do this short method.For Converting Positive To Negative & Vice VersaJavaScript - without using functions :\nNOTE: may not works in the old browsers.You can use ~ operator that logically converts the number to negative and adds 1 to the negative:My minimal approach For converting negative to number to positive & vice-versa\n
