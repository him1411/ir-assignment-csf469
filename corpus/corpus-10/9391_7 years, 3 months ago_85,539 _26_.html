There is a handy dynamic attribute in active-record called find_or_create_by:Model.find_or_create_by_<attribute>(:<attribute> => "")But what if I need to find_or_create by more than one attribute?Say I have a model to handle a M:M relationship between Group and Member called GroupMember. I could have many instances where member_id = 4, but I don\'t ever want more than once instance where member_id = 4 and group_id = 7.

This is useful if you are validating the presence of a field that you aren\'t searching by.Assuming:thenwill create a new GroupMember with the name "John Doe" if it doesn\'t find one with member_id 4 and group_id 7You can do:Or to just initialize:
