Somehow I\'ve managed to completely bugger the install of postgresql on Ubuntu karmic.  I want to start over from scratch, but when I "purge" the package with apt-get it still leaves traces behind such that the reinstall configuration doesn\'t run properly.After I\'ve done:It saidI have a "/etc/postgresql" with nothing in it and "/etc/postgresql-common/" has a \'pg_upgradecluser.d\' directory and root.crt and user_clusters files.The /etc/passwd has a postgres user; the purge script doesn\'t appear to touch it.  There\'s been a bunch of symptoms which I work through only to expose the next. Right this second, when I run that command "pg_createcluster..." it complains that \'/var/lib/postgresql/8.4/main/postgresql.conf does not exist\', so I\'ll go find one of those but I\'m sure that won\'t be the end of it.Is there not some easy one-liner (or two) which will burn it completely and let me start over?First: If your install isn\'t already damaged, you can drop unwanted PostgreSQL servers ("clusters") in Ubuntu using pg_dropcluster. Use that in preference to a full purge and reinstall if you just want to start with a freshly initdb\'d PostgreSQL instance.If you really need to do a full purge and reinstall, first make sure PostgreSQL isn\'t running. ps -C postgres should show no results.Now run:to remove everything PostgreSQL from your system. Just purging the postgres package isn\'t enough since it\'s just an empty meta-package.Once all PostgreSQL packages have been removed, run:You should now be able to:or for a complete install:I had a similar situation: I needed to purge postgresql 9.1 on a debian wheezy ( I had previously migrated from 8.4 and I was getting errors ). What I did:First, I deleted config and databaseThen removed postgresqland then reinstalledIn my case I noticed /etc/postgresql/9.1 was empty, and running service postgresql start returned nothing So, after more googling I got to this command:With that I could start the server, but now I was getting log-related errors. After more searching, I ended up changing permissions to the /var/log/postgresql directoryThat fixed the issue, Hope this helpsI know an answer has already been provided, but dselect didn\'t work for me. Here is what worked to find the packages to remove:Finally, editing /etc/passwd and /etc/groupSteps that worked for me on Ubuntu 8.04.2 to remove postgres 8.3List All Postgres related packagesRemove all above listedRemove the following foldersis enough.Following ae the steps i followed to uninstall and reinstall. Which worked for me.First remove the installed postgres :- sudo apt-get purge postgr*sudo apt-get autoremoveThen  install \'synaptic\':sudo apt-get install synapticsudo apt-get updateThen install postgressudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contribI just ran into the same issue for Ubuntu 13.04. These commands removed Postgres 9.1:It occurs to me that perhaps only the second command is necessary, but from there I was able to install Postgres 9.2 (sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.2).I was following the replies,\nWhen editing /etc/group I also deleted this line:then, when trying to install postgresql, I got this error Putting the "ssl-cert:x:112:postgres" line back in /etc/group seems to fix it (so I was able to install postgresql)
