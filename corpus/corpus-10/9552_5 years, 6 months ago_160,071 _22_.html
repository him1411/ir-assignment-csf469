I switch to master after develop on a branch for a long time. The log shows:Your branch is behind \'origin/master\' by 167 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.I tried:It has no effect. This is cause because that I have checkout out an intermediate commit on master.How to make master stay on head? Doing:will fetch and merge the origin/master branch (you may just say git pull as origin is the default).Try git merge origin/master.  If you want to be sure that it only does a fast-forward, you can say git merge --ff-only origin/master.In your situation, git rebase would also do the trick. Since you have no changes that master doesn\'t have, git will just fast-forward. If you are working with a rebase workflow, that might be more advisable, as you wouldn\'t end up with a merge commit if you mess up. should do the job.You will get the "Your branch is behind" message every time when you work on a branch different than master, someone does changes to master and you git pull.now the origin/master reference is pulled, but your master is not merged with itnow master is behind origin/master and can be fast forwardednow your master and origin/master are in syncIf you are standing on a different branch and want to checkout the newest version of master you can also dogit checkout -B master origin/masterNo complexities required \njust stand at your branch and do a git pull  it worked for meOr, as a second try git pull origin master  only in case if you are unlucky with the first commandMove your brunch pointer to the HEAD:Your branch master already exists, so git will not allow you to overwrite it, unless you use... -f (this argument stands for --force)Or you can use rebase:Do it on your own risk ;)
