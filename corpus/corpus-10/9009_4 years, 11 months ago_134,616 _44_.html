I am using entity framework and ASP.NET MVC 4 to build an applicationMy solution is split into two projects;My problem is that when I attempt to use the \'MyEntites\' DbContext I get the the following error:No connection string named \'MyEntities\' could be found in the\n  application config file.I guess the problem has something to do with the fact that connection string lies within the app.config of the class library rather than the MVC project.Does anyone have any suggestions?Try copying the connections string to the .config file in the MVC project.You are right, this happens because the class library (where the .edmx file) is not your startup / main project.You\'ll need to copy the connection string to the main project config file.Incase your startup / main project does not have a config file (like it was in my Console Application case) just add one (Startup project - Add New Item -> Application Configuration File).More relevant information can be found here:\nMetadataException: Unable to load the specified metadata resourcemake sure that you make your project (with the DbContext) as startupORAdd to the project that is set as startup your connection string in the app.config (or web.config)ORCall the command like this Update-Database -Script -ProjectName \'<project name>\' -StartupProjectName \'<project name>\' -ConnectionString \'data source=.;initial catalog=<db name>;integrated security=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=True\' -ConnectionProviderName \'System.Data.SqlClient\'Then try againYou could just pass the connection string to EntityFramework and get on with your life:If you have multiple projects in solution, then setUp project as started where you have your truth App.config.As you surmise, it is to do with the connection string being in app.config of the class library.Copy the entry from the class app.config to the container\'s app.config or web.config file copy connection string to app.config or web.config file in project which has set to "Set as StartUp Project" and if using entity framework in data layer, please install entity framework nuget in main project.It also happens if the startup project is changed to the one, which does not have the connection strings.Yeah, it\'s silly.  You can avoid copying the connection string by using a connection builder.  VB.Net code (used in production, but slightly modified here, so treat as untested, happy to assist with any issues), where I have a serverName variable, a databaseName variable, I pass them into a method and have it generate the connection for me:are you using more than one project on your solution?Because if you are, the web config you must check is the one on the same project as de .edmx fileAdd ConnectionString to MVC Project Web.config fileI have faced the same issue. I was missed to put connection string to startup project as I am performing data access operation from other layer. also if you don\'t have app.config in your startup project then add app.config file and then add a connection string to that config file.Add Connectoinstrnig in web.config fileThe connection string generated by the project containing the .edmx file generates the connection string, this would appear to be a holdover from the app.config sorts of files that were copied to the output directory and referenced by the executable to store runtime config information.This breaks in the web project as there is no automatic process to add random .config information into the web.config file for the web project.Easiest is to copy the connection string from the config file to the connections section of the web.config file and disregard the config file contents. The best way I just found to address this is to temporarily set that project (most likely a class library) to the startup project. This forces the package manager console to use that project as it\'s config source. part of the reason it is set up this way is because of the top down model that th econfig files usually follow. The rule of thumb is that the project that is closest to the client (MVC application for instance) is the web.config or app.config that will be used.Make sure you\'ve placed the connection string in the startup project\'s ROOT web.config.I know I\'m kinda stating the obvious here, but it happened to me too - though I already HAD the connection string in my MVC project\'s Web.Config (the .edmx file was placed at a different, class library project) and I couldn\'t figure out why I keep getting an exception...\nLong story short, I copied the connection string to the Views\\Web.Config by mistake, in a strange combination of tiredness and not-scrolling-to-the-bottom-of-the-solution-explorer scenario.\nYeah, these things happen to veteran developers as well :)This problem happen when you are using Layers in your Project and defined or install Entity frame work in DataLayer and try to run your ProjectSo to overcome from this problem copy the connection string from the layer where the Edmx file is there and paste the connection string in main web.config.I\'ve had this problem when I use multiple proyects, the start proyect with web.config and app.config for EntityFramework project.for avoid this problem you must:Add a connection string in the root web.config file of \'container\' MVC project that references the class library as following:If you do not want to use "MyEntities" as connection name then change it as you wish but make the following change in your MyEntities DbContext class:Reason for this error is, If we will not specify the name of connection string Or connect string in derived class of DbConext(In your case it is MyEntities) then DbContext will automatically search for a connection string in root web.config file whoes name is same as derived class name (In your case it is My Entities).
