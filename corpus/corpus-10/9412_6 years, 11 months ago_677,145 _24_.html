I am working on application which can deal with multiple database servers like "MySQL" and "MS SQL Server".I want to get tables\' names of a particular database using a general query which should suitable for all database types. I have tried following:But it is giving table names of all databases of a particular server but I want to get tables names of selected database only. How can I restrict this query to get tables of a particular database?Probably due to the way different sql dbms deal with schemas.Try the followingFor SQL Server:For MySQL:For Oracle I think the equivalent would be to use DBA_TABLES.Stolen from here:try this:Just put the DATABASE NAME in front of INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES:We can deal without GO in-place of you can use semicolon ;.In mysql, use:After selecting the DB with:For Mysql you can do simple.   SHOW TABLES;I did not see this answer but hey this is what I do :Yes oracle is :That is if you only want objects owned by the logged in user/schema otherwise you can use all_tables or dba_tables which includes system tables.Following is the right query to see how many Tables are in any database :Where Demo will be your Database Name.Building from Michael Baylon\'s answer, I needed a list which also included schema information and this is how I modified his query.If you are working with multiple schemata on an MS SQL server, then SELECT-ing TABLE_NAME without also simultaneously selecting TABLE_SCHEMA might be of limited benefit, so I have assumed we are interested in the tables belonging to a known schema when using MS SQL Server.I have tested the query above with SQL Server Management Studio using an SQL Server database of mine and with MySQL Workbench using a MySQL database, and in both cases it gives the table names.The query bodges Michael Baylon\'s two different queries into one that can then run on either database type. The first part of the WHERE clause works on MySQL databases and the second part (after the OR) works on MS SQL Server databases. It is ugly and logically a little incorrect as it supposes that there is no undesired schema with the same name as the database. This might help someone who is looking for one single query that can run on either database server.
