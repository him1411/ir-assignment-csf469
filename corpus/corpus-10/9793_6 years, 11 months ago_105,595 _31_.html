Possible Duplicate:\n  Horizontal ListView in Android? Like many things in Android, you wouldn\'t think this would be such a hard problem but ohhh, by golly, would you be wrong.  And, like many things in Android, the API doesn\'t even provide a reasonably extensible starting point.  I\'ll be damned if I\'m going to roll my own ListView, when all I want is to take the thing and turn it on its side.  \\rantOkay, now that I\'m done fuming, let\'s talk about the problem itself.  What I need is basically something exactly like the Gallery, but without the center-locking feature.  I don\'t really need ListView\'s listSelector but it\'s a nice-to-have.  Mostly, I could do what I want with a LinearLayout inside a ScrollView, but I need the child views to come from a ListAdapter and I would really like to have a view recycler.  And I really don\'t want to write any layout code.I peeked into the source code for some of these classes...Gallery: It looks like I could use the Gallery if I override most of the \'onXyz\' methods, copy all their source code, but refrain from calling scrollIntoSlots().  But I\'m sure that if I do that I\'ll run into some member field that\'s inaccessible or some other unforeseen consequence.AbsSpinner: Since the mRecycler field is package-private I doubt I\'ll be able to extend this class.AbsListView: It looks like this class is only meant for vertical scrolling, so no help there.AdapterView: I\'ve never had to extend this class directly.  If you tell me it\'s easy to do, and that it\'s easy to roll my own RecycleBin, I\'ll be very skeptical but I\'ll give it a shot.I suppose I could possibly copy both AbsSpinner and Gallery to get what I want... hopefully those classes aren\'t using some package-private variable I can\'t access.  Do y\'all think that\'s a good practice?  Does anyone have any tutorials or third-party solutions that might put me in the right direction?Update:\nThe only solution I\'ve found so far is to do it all myself.  Since asking this question, I have overridden AdapterView and implemented my own "HorizontalListView" from scratch.  The only way to truly override the Gallery\'s center-locking feature is to override the private scrollIntoSlots method, which I believe would require generating a subclass at runtime.  If you\'re bold enough to do that, it\'s arguably the best solution, but I don\'t want to rely on undocumented methods that could change.Swathi EP below suggested that I give the Gallery an OnTouchListener and override the scroll functionality.  If you don\'t care about having fling support in your list, or if it\'s okay for the views to snap to the center at the end of the fling animation, then this will work for you!  However, in the end it still proves impossible to remove the center-locking feature without removing fling support.  And I ask you, what kind of list doesn\'t fling?So, alas, this did not work for me. :-(  But if you\'re interested in this approach, read on...I also had to make some additions to Swathi\'s code to get what I wanted.  In GestureListener.onTouch, in addition to delegating to the gesture detector, I also had to return true for ACTION_UP and ACTION_CANCEL events.  That successfully disabled the center-locking feature, but it also disabled flinging.  I was able to re-enable fling by having my own GestureListener delegate to the Gallery\'s onFling method.  If you want to try it out, go into your ApiDemos sample code and replace the Gallery1.java class with the following code:After reading this post, I have implemented my own horizontal ListView. You can find it here: http://dev-smart.com/horizontal-listview/ Let me know if this helps.Have you looked into using a HorizontalScrollView to wrap your list items? That will allow each of your list items to be horizontally scrollable (what you put in there is up to you, and can make them dynamic items similar to ListView). This will work well if you are only after a single row of items.You know, it might be possible to use an existing ListView with some judicious overriding of dispatchDraw() (to rotate the Canvas by 90 degrees), onTouch() (to swap the X and Y of the MotionEvent coords) and maybe onMeasure() or whatever to fool it into thinking it\'s y by x rather than x by y...I have no idea if this would actually work but it\'d be fun to find out. :)This might be a very late reply but it is working for us. We are using the same gallery provided by Android, just that, we have adjusted the left margin such a way that the screens left end is considered as Gallery\'s center. That really worked well for us. I used Pauls (see his answer) Implementation of HorizontalListview and it works, thank you so much for sharing! I slightly changed his HorizontalListView-Class (btw. Paul there is a typo in your classname, your classname is "HorizontialListView" instead of "HorizontalListView", the "i" is too much) to update child-views when selected.UPDATE: My code that I posted here was wrong I suppose, as I ran into trouble with selection (i think it has to do with view recycling), I have to go back to the drawing board...UPDATE 2: Ok Problem solved, I simply commented "removeNonVisibleItems(dx);" in "onLayout(..)", I guess this will hurt performance, but since I am using only very small Lists this is no Problem for me. I basically used this tutorial here on developerlife and just replaced ListView with Pauls HorizontalListView, and made the changes to allow for "permanent" selection (a child that is clicked on changes its appearance, and when its clicked on again it changes it back). I am a beginner, so probably many ugly things in the code, let me know if you need more details.Gallery is the best solution, i have tried it. I was working on one mail app, in which mails in the inbox where displayed as listview, i wanted an horizontal view, i just converted listview to gallery and everything worked fine as i needed without any errors. For the scroll effect i enabled gesture listener for the gallery. I hope this answer may help u. Have you looked into the ViewFlipper component? Maybe it can help you.http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ViewFlipper.htmlWith this component, you can attach two or more view childs. If you add some translate animation and capture Gesture detection, you can have a nicely horizontal scroll.My app uses a ListView in portraint mode which is simply switches to Gallery in landscape mode. Both of them use one BaseAdapter. This looks like shown below.To handle scrolling events I\'ve inherited my own widget from Gallery and override onFling().\nHere\'s the layout.xml:and code:
