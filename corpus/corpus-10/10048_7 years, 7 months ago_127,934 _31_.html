My users can change the Locale within the app (they may want to keep their phone settings in English but read the content of my app in French, Dutch or any other language ...)Why is this working perfectly fine in 1.5/1.6 but NOT in 2.0 anymore ???The problem is that the MENU "shrinks" more and more everytime the user is going through the lines of code above ... This is the Menu that gets shrunk:What should I do in API Level 5 to make this work again ?HERE IS THE FULL CODE IF YOU WANT TO TEST THIS :AND HERE IS THE MANIFEST :THIS IS WHAT I FOUND :=> IT WORKS JUST FINE ...=> Menu shrinks every time you change the locale !!!as I want to keep my application accessible for users on 1.5, what should I do ??Through the original question is not exactly about the locale itself all other locale related questions are referencing to this one. That\'s why I wanted to clarify the issue here. I used this question as a starting point for my own locale switching code and found out that the method is not exactly correct. It works, but only until any configuration change (e.g. screen rotation) and only in that particular Activity. Playing with a code for a while I have ended up with the following approach:I have extended android.app.Application and added the following code:This code ensures that every Activity will have custom locale set and it will not be reset on rotation and other events. I have also spent a lot of time trying to make the preference change to be applied immediately but didn\'t succeed: the language changed correctly on Activity restart, but number formats and other locale properties were not applied until full application restart.Don\'t forget to add android:configChanges="layoutDirection|locale" to every activity at AndroidManifest, as well as the android:name=".MyApplication" to the <application> element.After a good night of sleep, I found the answer on the Web  (a simple Google search on the following line "getBaseContext().getResources().updateConfiguration(mConfig, getBaseContext().getResources().getDisplayMetrics());"), here it is :link text\n=> this link also shows screenshots of what is happening ! Density was the issue here,  I needed to have this in the AndroidManifest.xmlThe most important is the android:anyDensity =" true ". Don\'t forget to add the following in the AndroidManifest.xml for every activity (for Android 4.1 and below):This version is needed when you build for Android 4.2 (API level 17) explanation here:In Android M the top solution won\'t work. I\'ve written a helper class to fix that which you should call from your Application class and all Activities (I would suggest creating a BaseActivity and then make all the Activities inherit from it.Note: This will also support properly RTL layout direction. Helper class:Application:BaseActivity:This is for my comment on Andrey\'s answer but I cant include code in the comments.Is you preference activity being called from you main activity? you could place this in the on resume...I couldn\'t used android:anyDensity="true" because objects in my game would be positioned completely different... seems this also does the trick:If you want to effect on the menu options for changing the locale immediately.You have to do like this.
