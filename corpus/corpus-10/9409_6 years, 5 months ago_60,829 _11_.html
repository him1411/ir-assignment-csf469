Is there a way to capture a list of specific type using mockitos ArgumentCaptore. This doesn\'t work:The nested generics-problem can be avoided with the @Captor annotation:Yeah, this is a general generics problem, not mockito-specific.There is no class object for ArrayList<SomeType>, and thus you can\'t type-safely pass such an object to a method requiring a Class<ArrayList<SomeType>>.You can cast the object to the right type:This will give some warnings about unsafe casts, and of course your ArgumentCaptor can\'t really differentiate between ArrayList<SomeType> and ArrayList<AnotherType> without maybe inspecting the elements.(As mentioned in the other answer, while this is a general generics problem, there is a Mockito-specific solution for the type-safety problem with the @Captor annotation. It still can\'t distinguish between an ArrayList<SomeType> and an ArrayList<OtherType>.)Take also a look at tenshis comment. You can change the original code from Pa\xc5\xadlo Ebermann to this (much simpler)If you\'re not afraid of old java-style (non type safe generic) semantics, this also works and is reasonably simple(r):I had the same issue with testing activity in my Android app. I used ActivityInstrumentationTestCase2 and MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(this); didn\'t work.\nI solved this issue with another class with respectively field. For example:Then, in activity test method:
