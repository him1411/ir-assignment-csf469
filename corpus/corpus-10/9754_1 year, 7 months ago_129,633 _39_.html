I have a number of elements that I want to be visible under certain conditions.In AngularJS I would writeHow can I do this in Angular 2?Just bind to the hidden propertySee also issueshidden has some issues though because it can conflict with CSS for the display property.   See how some in Plunker example doesn\'t get hidden because it has a style set. (This might behave differently in other browsers - I tested with Chrome 50)workaroundYou can fix it by addingTo a global style in index.html.another pitfallare the same asand will not show the element. hidden="false" will assign the string "false" which is considered truthy.\nOnly the value false or removing the attribute will actually make the element \nvisible. Using {{}} also converts the expression to a string and won\'t work as expected. Only binding with [] will work as expected because this false is assigned as false instead of "false".*ngIf vs [hidden]*ngIf effectively removes its content from the DOM while [hidden] modifies the display property and only instructs the browser to not show the content but the DOM still contains it.ORThese are two ways to show/hide element. The only difference between *ngIf and [hidden] is that *ngIf will add or completely remove the element from DOM but with [hidden] the browser will show/hide the element using CSS\'s display property and it will remain in DOM.Sorry, I have to disagree with binding to hidden which is considered to be unsafe when using Angular 2. This is because the hidden style could be overwritten easily for example using The recommended approach is to use *ngIf which is safer.

(not) before the ngShowVal, and for hide behavior in Angular2 we don\'t need to add ! (not) before the ngHideVal.Use hidden like you bind any model with control and specify css for it:HTML:CSS:myExpression may be set to true or false If you are using Bootstrap is as simple as this:
