I learned something simple about SQL the other day:Has the same result as:What I am curious of, is there anything different in the way an SQL engine processes the command, or are they truly the same thing?  I personally prefer the distinct syntax, but I am sure it\'s more out of habit than anything else.EDIT: This is not a question about aggregates. The use of GROUP BY with aggregate functions is understood.MusiGenesis\' response is functionally the correct one with regard to your question as stated; the SQL Server is smart enough to realize that if you are using "Group By" and not using any aggregate functions, then what you actually mean is "Distinct" - and therefore it generates an execution plan as if you\'d simply used "Distinct."However,I think it\'s important to note Hank\'s response as well - cavalier treatment of "Group By" and "Distinct" could lead to some pernicious gotcha\'s down the line if you\'re not careful.  It\'s not entirely correct to say that this is "not a question about aggregates" because you\'re asking about the functional difference between two SQL query keywords, one of which is meant to be used with aggregates and one of which is not.A hammer can work to drive in a screw sometimes , but if you\'ve got a screwdriver handy, why bother?GROUP BY lets you use aggregate functions, like AVG, MAX, MIN, SUM, and COUNT. \nOther hand DISTINCT just removes duplicates.For example, if you have a bunch of purchase records, and you want to know how much was spent by each department, you might do something like:This will give you one row per department, containing the department name and the sum of all of the amount values in all rows for that department.There is no difference (in SQL Server, at least).  Both queries use the same execution plan.http://sqlmag.com/database-performance-tuning/distinct-vs-groupMaybe there is a difference, if there are sub-queries involved:http://blog.sqlauthority.com/2007/03/29/sql-server-difference-between-distinct-and-group-by-distinct-vs-group-by/There is no difference (Oracle-style):http://asktom.oracle.com/pls/asktom/f?p=100:11:0::::P11_QUESTION_ID:32961403234212Use DISTINCT if you just want to remove duplicates. Use GROUPY BY if you want to apply aggregate operators (MAX, SUM, GROUP_CONCAT, ..., or a HAVING clause).I expect there is the possibility for subtle differences in their execution.\nI checked the execution plans for two functionally equivalent queries along these lines in Oracle 10g:The middle operation is slightly different:  "HASH GROUP BY" vs. "HASH UNIQUE", but the estimated costs etc. are identical.  I then executed these with tracing on and the actual operation counts were the same for both (except that the second one didn\'t have to do any physical reads due to caching).But I think that because the operation names are different, the execution would follow somewhat different code paths and that opens the possibility of more significant differences.I think you should prefer the DISTINCT syntax for this purpose.  It\'s not just habit, it more clearly indicates the purpose of the query.For the query you posted, they are identical.  But for other queries that may not be true.For example, it\'s not the same as:They have different semantics, even if they happen to have equivalent results on your particular data.If you use DISTINCT with multiple columns, the result set won\'t be grouped as it will with GROUP BY, and you can\'t use aggregate functions with DISTINCT.I read all the above comments but didn\'t see anyone pointed to the main difference between Group By and Distinct apart from the aggregation bit.Distinct returns all the rows then de-duplicates them whereas Group By de-deduplicate the rows as they\'re read by the algorithm one by one.This means they can produce different results!For example, the below codes generate different results:If there are 10 names in the table where 1 of which is a duplicate of another then the first query returns 10 rows whereas the second query returns 9 rows.The reason is what I said above so they can behave differently!GROUP BY has a very specific meaning that is distinct (heh) from the DISTINCT function.GROUP BY causes the query results to be grouped using the chosen expression, aggregate functions can then be applied, and these will act on each group, rather than the entire resultset.Here\'s an example that might help:Given a table that looks like this:This query:Will produce output like this:Which is obviously very different from using DISTINCT. If you want to group your results, use GROUP BY, if you just want a unique list of a specific column, use DISTINCT. This will give your database a chance to optimise the query for your needs.If you are using a GROUP BY without any aggregate function then internally it will treated as DISTINCT, so in this case there is no difference between GROUP BY and DISTINCT.But when you are provided with DISTINCT clause better to use it for finding your unique records because the objective of GROUP BY is to achieve aggregation.group by is used in aggregate operations -- like when you want to get a count of Bs broken down by column Cdistinct is what it sounds like -- you get unique rows.In sql server 2005, it looks like the query optimizer is able to optimize away the difference in the simplistic examples I ran. Dunno if you can count on that in all situations, though.Please don\'t use GROUP BY when you mean DISTINCT, even if they happen to work the same.  I\'m assuming you\'re trying to shave off milliseconds from queries, and I have to point out that developer time is orders of magnitude more expensive than computer time.Apart from the fact that unlike DISTINCT, GROUP BY allows for aggregating data per group (which has been mentioned by many other answers), the most important difference in my opinion is the fact that the two operations "happen" at two very different steps in the logical order of operations that are executed in a SELECT statement. Here are the most important operations:As you can see, the logical order of each operation influences what can be done with it and how it influences subsequent operations. In particular, the fact that the GROUP BY operation "happens before" the SELECT operation (the projection) means that:An example where not depending on the projection is useful is if you want to calculate window functions on distinct values:When run against the Sakila database, this yields:The same couldn\'t be achieved with DISTINCT easily:That query is "wrong" and yields something like:This is not what we wanted. The DISTINCT operation "happens after" the projection, so we can no longer remove DISTINCT ratings because the window function was already calculated and projected. In order to use DISTINCT, we\'d have to nest that part of the query:Side-note: In this particular case, we could also use DENSE_RANK()One of SQL\'s drawbacks is its verbosity at times. For the same reason as what we\'ve seen before (namely the logical order of operations), we cannot "easily" group by something we\'re projecting.This is invalid SQL:This is valid (repeating the expression)This is valid, too (nesting the expression)I\'ve written about this topic more in depth in a blog postIn that particular query there is no difference. But, of course, if you add any aggregate columns then you\'ll have to use group by.From a \'SQL the language\' perspective the two constructs are equivalent and which one you choose is one of those \'lifestyle\' choices we all have to make. I think there is a good case for DISTINCT being more explicit (and therefore is more considerate to the person who will inherit your code etc) but that doesn\'t mean the GROUP BY construct is an invalid choice. I think this \'GROUP BY is for aggregates\' is the wrong emphasis. Folk should be aware that the set function (MAX, MIN, COUNT, etc) can be omitted so that they can understand the coder\'s intent when it is.The ideal optimizer will recognize equivalent SQL constructs and will always pick the ideal plan accordingly. For your real life SQL engine of choice, you must test :)PS note the position of the DISTINCT keyword in the select clause may produce different results e.g. contrast: You\'re only noticing that because you are selecting a single column.Try selecting two fields and see what happens.Group By is intended to be used like this:Which would show the sum of all transactions for each person.I know it\'s an old post. But it happens that I had a query that used group by just to return distinct values when using that query in toad and oracle reports everything worked fine, I mean a good response time. When we migrated from Oracle 9i to 11g the response time in Toad was excellent but in the reporte it took about 35 minutes to finish the report when using previous version it took about 5 minutes.The solution was to change the group by and use DISTINCT and now the report runs in about 30 secs.I hope this is useful for someone with the same situation.The way I always understood it is that using distinct is the same as grouping by every field you selected in the order you selected them. i.e:is the same as:I had this question before, I need to append three columns from my 4 million rows table (the three columns into one new column of a new table) but only the different ones. So I ran my stored procedure which contains this query with the \'group by\' method and it took 32 minutes. Then I ran it again, but with \'distinct\' method and it took 25 minutes. It\'s the same result, but it was a little bit faster with the 2nd methodThere is no significantly difference between group by and distinct clause except the usage of aggregate functions.\nBoth can be used to distinguish the values but if in performance point of view group by is better.\nWhen distinct keyword is used , internally it used sort operation which can be view in execution plan. Try simple example Declare @tmpresult table\n(\n  Id tinyint\n)Insert into @tmpresult\nSelect 5\nUnion all\nSelect 2\nUnion all\nSelect 3\nUnion all\nSelect 4Select distinct \nId\nFrom @tmpresult
