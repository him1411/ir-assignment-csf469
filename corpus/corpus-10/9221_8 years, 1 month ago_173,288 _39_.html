I\'m trying to parse some JSON data from the Google AJAX Search API. I have this URL and I\'d like to break it down so that the results are displayed. I\'ve currently written this code, but I\'m pretty lost in regards of what to do next, although there are a number of examples out there with simplified JSON strings.Being new to C# and .NET in general I\'ve struggled to get a genuine text output for my ASP.NET page so I\'ve been recommended to give JSON.NET a try. Could anyone point me in the right direction to just simply writing some code that\'ll take in JSON from the Google AJAX Search API and print it out to the screen?EDIT: ALL FIXED! All results are working fine. Thank you again Dreas Grech!The code currently compiles and runs perfectly, but isn\'t returning any results. Could someone help me with returning what I require, the results ready to print out to the screen?Edit:Json.NET works using the same JSON and classes as the example above.Link: Serializing and Deserializing JSON with Json.NETC# - parsing json formatted data into nested hashtables\nParse JSON array[Update]\nI\'ve just realized why you weren\'t receiving results back... you have a missing line in your Deserialize method.  You were forgetting to assign the results to your obj :Also, just for reference, here is the Serialize method : EditIf you want to use Json.NET here are the equivalent Serialize/Deserialize methods to the code above..Deserialize:Serialize:This are already part of Json.NET so you can just call them on the JsonConvert class.Link: Serializing and Deserializing JSON with Json.NETNow, the reason you\'re getting a StackOverflow is because of your Properties.Take for example this one : Notice that in the getter, you are returning the actual property (ie the property\'s getter is calling itself over and over again), and thus you are creating an infinite recursion.Properties (in 2.0) should be defined like such : You have a private field and then you return the value of that field in the getter, and set the value of that field in the setter.Btw, if you\'re using the 3.5 Framework, you can just do this and avoid the backing fields, and let the compiler take care of that : Your data class doesn\'t match the JSON object.  Use this instead:Also, you don\'t have to instantiate the class to get its type for deserialization:I found this approach which parse JSON into a dynamic object, it extends a DynamicObject and JavascriptConverter to turn the string into an object.DynamicJsonObjectConverterUsage (sample json):This method has to return true, otherwise it will throw an error. E.g. you can throw an error if a key does not exist.Returning true and emptying result will return an empty value rather than throwing an error.I just think the whole example would be useful. This is the example for this problem.I tried to use the code above but didn\'t work. The JSON structure returned by Google is so different and there is a very important miss in the helper function: a call to DataContractJsonSerializer.ReadObject() that actually deserializes the JSON data into the object.Here is the code that WORKS in 2011:To get the content of the first result, do:Thank you all for your help.\nThis is my final version, and it works thanks to your combined help ! \nI am only showing the changes i made, all the rest is taken from Joe Chung\'s workandGoogle Map API request and parse DirectionsResponse with C#, change the json in your url to xml\nand use the following code to turn the result into a usable C# Generic List Object. Took me a while to make. But here it isI hope this will help someone.
