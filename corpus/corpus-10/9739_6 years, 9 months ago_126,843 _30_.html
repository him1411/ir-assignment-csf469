I would like to be able to assign a xml attribute or style to a TextView that will make whatever text it has in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.The attributes android:inputType="textCapCharacters" and android:capitalize="characters" do nothing and look like they are for user inputed text, not a TextView.I would like to do this so I can separate the style from the content.  I know I could do this programmically but again I want keep style out of the content and the code.I though that was a pretty reasonable request but it looks like you cant do it at this time. What a Total Failure. lol You can now use \ntextAllCaps\n to force all caps.\nWhat about android:textAllCaps?By using AppCompat textAllCaps in Android Apps supporting older API\'s (less than 14)There is one UI widgets that ships with AppCompat named CompatTextView is a Custom TextView extension that adds support for textAllCapsFor newer android API > 14 you can use :A simple example:Source:developer.androidUpdate:As it so happens CompatTextView was replaced by AppCompatTextView in\n  latest appcompat-v7 library ~  Eugen PechanecIt is really very disappointing that you can\'t do it with styles (<item name="android:textAllCaps">true</item>) or on each XML layout file with the textAllCaps  attribute, and the only way to do it is actually using theString.toUpperCase() on each of the strings  when you do a textViewXXX.setText(theString).In my case, I did not wanted to have theString.toUpperCase() everywhere in my code but to have a centralized place to do it because I had some Activities and lists items layouts with TextViews that where supposed to be capitalized all the time (a title) and other who did not... so... some people may think is an overkill, but I created my own CapitalizedTextView class extending android.widget.TextView and overrode the setText method capitalizing the text on the fly.At least, if the design changes or I need to remove the capitalized text in future versions, I just need to change to normal TextView in the layout files.Now, take in consideration that I did this because the App\'s Designer actually wanted this text (the titles) in CAPS all over the App no matter the original content capitalization, and also I had other normal TextViews where the capitalization came with the the actual content.This is the class:And whenever you need to use it, just declare it with all the package in the XML layout:Some will argue that the correct way to style text on a TextView is to use a SpannableString, but I think that would be even a greater overkill, not to mention more resource-consuming because you\'ll be instantiating another class than TextView.I\'ve come up with a solution which is similar with RacZo\'s in the fact that I\'ve also created a subclass of TextView which handles making the text upper-case.The difference is that instead of overriding one of the setText() methods, I\'ve used a similar approach to what the TextView actually does on API 14+ (which is in my point of view a cleaner solution).If you look into the source, you\'ll see the implementation of setAllCaps():The AllCapsTransformationMethod class is not (currently) public, but still, the source is also available. I\'ve simplified that class a bit (removed the setLengthChangesAllowed() method), so the complete solution is this:PixlUI project allows you to use textAllCaps in any textview or subclass of textview including:\nButton,\nEditText\nAutoCompleteEditText\nCheckbox\nRadioButton\nand several others.You will need to create your textviews using the pixlui version rather than the ones from the android source, meaning you have to do this:PixlUI also allows you to set a custom typeface/font which you put in your assets folder.I\'m working on a Gradle fork of the PixlUI framework which uses gradle and allows one to specify textAllCaps as well as the typeface from styles rather than requiring them inline as the original project does.It seems like there is permission on mobile keypad setting, so the easiest way to do this is:hope this will work
