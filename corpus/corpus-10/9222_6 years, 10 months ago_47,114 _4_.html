I wanted to know what the aria-* attributes are used for. What values can they have, and are they defined values or can I create my own values?ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications and is designed to improve the accessibility of Rich Internet Applications, i.e. to make them more usable for people with disabilities.Help on the various attributes is available here.I don\'t think you can create your own ARIA attributes.
