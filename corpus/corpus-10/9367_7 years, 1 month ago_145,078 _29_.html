I have recently moved from SVN to Git and am a bit confused about something. I needed to run the previous version of a script through a debugger, so I did git checkout <previous version hash> and did what I needed to do.Now I want to get back to the newest version, but I don\'t know the hash for it. When I type git log, I don\'t see it.How can I do this? Also, is there an easier way to change versions than by typing out hashes - something like "go back two versions" or "go to the most chronologically recent"?git checkout master should do the trick. To go back two versions, you could say something like git checkout HEAD~2, but better to create a temporary branch based on that time, so git checkout -b temp_branch HEAD~2When you checkout to a specific commit, git creates a detached branch. So, if you call: You will see something like:To come back to the master branch head you just need to checkout to your master branch again: This command will automatically delete the detached branch.If git checkout doesn\'t work you probably have modified files conflicting between branches. To prevent you to lose code git requires you to deal with these files. You have three options: Stash your modifications (you can pop them later):Discard the changes reset-ing the detached branch:Create a new branch with the previous modifications and commit them:After this you can go back to your master branch (most recent version):This did the trick for me (I still was on the master branch):git reset --hard origin/masterI am just beginning to dig deeper into git, so not sure if I understand correctly, but I think the correct answer to the OP\'s question is that you can run git log --all with a format specification like this: git log --all --pretty=format:\'%h: %s %d\'. This marks the current checked out version as (HEAD) and you can just grab the next one from the list.BTW, add an alias like this to your .gitconfig with a slightly better format and you can run git hist --all:Regarding the relative versions, I found this post, but it only talks about older versions, there is probably nothing to refer to the newer versions.You can check out using branch names, for one thing.I know there are several ways to move the HEAD around, but I\'ll leave it to a git expert to enumerate them.I just wanted to suggest gitk --all -- I found it enormously helpful when starting with git.When you go back to a previous version,You can see your feature log(hash) with this command even in this situation;master can be replaced with another branch name.Then checkout it, you\'ll be able to get back to the feature.A more elegant and simple solution is to use It will return to the most resent local version of the branch and also save your changes in stash, so if you like to undo this action do:To return to the latest version:For example, git checkout master or git checkout dev
