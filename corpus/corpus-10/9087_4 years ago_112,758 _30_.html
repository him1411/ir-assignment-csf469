I started using git sometime back and do not fully understand the intricacies. My basic question here is to find out the difference between a git pull and git pull --rebase , since adding the --rebase option does not seem to do something very different : just does a pull.Please help me with understanding the difference.git pull = git fetch + git merge against tracking upstream branchgit pull --rebase = git fetch + git rebase against tracking upstream branchIf you want to know how git merge and git rebase differ, read this.Sometimes we have an upstream that rebased/rewound a branch we\'re depending on. This can be a big problem -- causing messy conflicts for us if we\'re downstream.The magic is git pull --rebaseA normal git pull is, loosely speaking, something like this (we\'ll use a remote called origin and a branch called foo in all these examples):At first glance, you might think that a git pull --rebase does just this:But that will not help if the upstream rebase involved any "squashing" (meaning that the patch-ids of the commits changed, not just their order).Which means git pull --rebase has to do a little bit more than that. Here\'s an explanation of what it does and how.Let\'s say your starting point is this:Time passes, and you have made some commits on top of your own "foo":Meanwhile, in a fit of anti-social rage, the upstream maintainer has not only rebased his "foo", he even used a squash or two. His commit chain now looks like this:A git pull at this point would result in chaos. Even a git fetch; git rebase origin/foo would not cut it, because commits "b" and "c" on one side, and commit "b+c" on the other, would conflict. (And similarly with d, e, and d+e).What git pull --rebase does, in this case, is:This gives you:You may still get conflicts, but they will be genuine conflicts (between p/q/r and a/b+c/d+e/f), and not conflicts caused by b/c conflicting with b+c, etc.Answer taken from (and slightly modified):\nhttp://gitolite.com/git-pull--rebaseSuppose you have two commits in local branch:After "git pull", will be:After "git pull --rebase", there will be no merge point G. Note that D and E become different commits:In the very most simple case of no collisionsSee also:man git-pullMore precisely, git pull runs git fetch with the given parameters and\n         calls git merge to merge the retrieved branch heads into the current\n         branch. With --rebase, it runs git rebase instead of git merge.See also:\nWhen should I use git pull --rebase?\nhttp://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing For this is important to understand the difference between Merge and Rebase.Rebases are how changes should pass from the top of hierarchy downwards\n  and merges are how they flow back upwards.For details refer - http://www.derekgourlay.com/archives/428
