I have a collection of MyClass that I\'d like to query using LINQ to get distinct values, and get back a Dictionary<string, string> as the result, but I can\'t figure out how I can do it any simpler than I\'m doing below.  What would some cleaner code be that I can use to get the Dictionary<string, string> as my result?Use the ToDictionary method directly.Look at the ToLookup and/or ToDictionary extension methods.
