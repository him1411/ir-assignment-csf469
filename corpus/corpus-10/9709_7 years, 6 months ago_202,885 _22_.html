I realized that Android has no built-in method of displaying PDF files. How can I render a PDF file using Java on Android?Taken from my blog:Since API Level 21 (Lollipop) Android provides a PdfRenderer class:For more information see the sample app.For older APIs I recommend Android PdfViewer library, it is very fast and easy to use, licensed under Apache License 2.0:I have made a hybrid approach from some of the answers given to this and other similar posts:This solution checks if a PDF reader app is installed and does the following:\n- If a reader is installed, download the PDF file to the device and start a PDF reader app\n- If no reader is installed, ask the user if he wants to view the PDF file online through Google DriveNOTE! This solution uses the Android DownloadManager class, which was introduced in API9 (Android 2.3 or Gingerbread). This means that it doesn\'t work on Android 2.2 or earlier.I wrote a blog post about it here, but I\'ve provided the full code below for completeness:I finally was able to modify butelo\'s code to open any PDF file in the Android filesystem using pdf.js. The code can be found on my GitHubWhat I did was modified the pdffile.js to read HTML argument file like this: So what you need to do is just append the file path after the index.html like this:Update the path variable to point to a valid PDF in the Adroid filesystem.Download the source code here (Display PDF file inside my android application)Add this dependency in your Grade:\ncompile \'com.github.barteksc:android-pdf-viewer:2.0.3\'activity_main.xmlMainActivity.javaTo add a little light to this, I would have to go with the pdf.js solution from Mozilla. Here is the link to an already well written implementation of this: https://bitbucket.org/butelo/pdfviewer/.Here are the edits that I added in my Android Activity:Here are the edits I made in pdffile.js:I used the below code to open and print the PDF using Wi-Fi. I am sending my whole code, and I hope it is helpful.
