Numpy proposes a way to get the index of the maximum value of an array via np.argmax. I would like a similar thing, but returning the indexes of the N maximum values.For instance, if I have an array [1, 3, 2, 4, 5], it function(array, n=3) would return [4, 3, 1].Thanks :)The simplest I\'ve been able to come up with is:This involves a complete sort of the array. I wonder if numpy provides a built-in way to do a partial sort; so far I haven\'t been able to find one.If this solution turns out to be too slow (especially for small n), it may be worth looking at coding something up in Cython.Newer NumPy versions (1.8 and up) have a function called argpartition for this. To get the indices of the four largest elements, doUnlike argsort, this function runs in linear time in the worst case, but the returned indices are not sorted, as can be seen from the result of evaluating a[ind]. If you need that too, sort them afterwards:To get the top-k elements in sorted order in this way takes O(n + k log k) time.EDIT: Modified to include Ashwini Chaudhary\'s improvement.For regular Python lists:If you use Python 2, use xrange instead of range.Source: http://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.htmlSimpler yet:where n is the number of maximum values.If you don\'t care about the order of the K-th largest elements you can you use argpartition, which should perform better than a full sort through argsort.Credits to this question.I ran a few tests and it looks loke argpartition outperforms argsort as the size of the array and the value of K increase.If you happen to be working with a multidimensional array then you\'ll need to flatten and unravel the indices:For example:This will be faster than a full sort depending on the size of your original array and the size of your selection:It, of course, involves tampering with your original array.  Which you could fix (if needed) by making a copy or replacing back the original values.  ...whichever is cheaper for your use case.bottleneck has a partial sort function, if the expense of sorting the entire array just to get the N largest values is too great.I know nothing about this module; I just googled numpy partial sort.For multidimensional arrays you can use axis keyword in order to apply the partitioning along the expected axis.And for grabbing the items:But note that this won\'t return a sorted result. In that case you can use np.argsort() along the intended axis:Here is an example:Now the result list would contain N tuples (index, value) where value is maximized
