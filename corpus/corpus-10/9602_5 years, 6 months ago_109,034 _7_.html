This question already has an answer here:What would be the most elegant and efficient way of finding/returning the first list item that matches a certain criterion?For example, if I have a list of objects and I would like to get the first object of those with attribute obj.val==5. I could of course use list comprehension, but that would incur O(n) and if n is large, it\'s wasteful. I could also use a loop with break once the criterion was met, but I thought there could be a more pythonic/elegant solution.If you don\'t have any other indexes or sorted information for your objects, then you will have to iterate until such an object is found:This is however faster than a complete list comprehension. Compare these two:The first one needs 5.75ms, the second one 58.3\xc2\xb5s (100 times faster because the loop 100 times shorter).it\'ll return the object if found else it\'ll return "not found"
