i have this htmlHow can i select the form that the input[name="submitButton"] is part of ?\n(when i click on the submit button i want to select the form and append some fields in it)I would suggest using closest, which selects the closest matching parent element:Instead of filtering by the name, I would do this:You can use the form reference which exists on all inputs, this is much faster than .closest() (5-10 times faster in Chrome and IE8). Works on IE6 & 7 too.To me, this looks like the simplest/fastest:see also jquery/js -- How do I select the parent form based on which submit button is clicked?
