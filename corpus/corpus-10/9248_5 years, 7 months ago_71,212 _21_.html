I\'m thinking that my application is getting quite large now, too large to handle each View with a single ViewModel.So I\'m wondering how difficult it would be to create multiple ViewModels and load them all into a single View. With a note that I also need to be able to pass X ViewModel data into Y ViewModel data so the individual ViewModels need to be able to communicate with each other or at least be aware of each other.For instance I have a <select> drop down, that select drop down has a selected state which allows me to pass the ID of the selected item in the <select> to another Ajax call in a separate ViewModel....Any points on dealing with numerous ViewModels in a single View appreciated :)If they all need to be on the same page, one easy way to do this is to have a master view model containing an array (or property list) of the other view models.Then your masterVM can have other properties if needed, for the page itself. Communication between the view models would not be difficult in this situation as you could relay through the masterVM, or you could use the $parent / $root in bindings, or some other custom options.Knockout now supports multiple model binding. The ko.applyBindings() method takes an optional parameter - the element and its descendants to which the binding will be activated. For example:This restricts the activation to the element with ID someElementId and its descendants. See documentation for more details.This is my answer after completing very large project with lots of ViewModels in single view.Html ViewFor this view I\'m creating 2 view models for id=container1 and id=container2 in two separate javascript files.Container1ViewModel.jsContainer2ViewModel.jsThen after these 2 viewmodels are registering as separate viewmodels in DataFunction.jsLike this you can add any number of viewmodels for separate divs. But make sure do not create separate view model for a div inside registered div.   Check MultiModels plugin for Knockout JS - https://github.com/sergun/Knockout-MultiModelsWe use components to achieve that. (http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/component-overview.html)For example, we have this component library we are developing: https://github.com/EDMdesigner/knobjsIf you dig into the code, you will see that for example we reuse the knob-button component in several places.
