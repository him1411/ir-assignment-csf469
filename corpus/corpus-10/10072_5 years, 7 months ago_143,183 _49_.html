In Ubuntu it\'s quite simple; I can run the application using:However this doesn\'t work on Windows. Is there a configuration file where I can set the attribute?Try to useThis should be executed in the command prompt where you intend to run your Node.js application.The above line would set the environment variable NODE_ENV for the command prompt where you execute the command.To set environment variables globally so they persist beyond just the single command prompt, you can find the tool from System in Control Panel (or by typing \'environment\' into the search box in the start menu).In PowerShell:I just found a nice Node.js package that can help a lot to define environment variables using a unique syntax, cross platform.https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-envIt allow you to write something like this:Which is pretty convenient! No Windows or Unix specific commands any more!It would be ideal if you could set parameters on the same line as your call to start Node.js on Windows. Look at the following carefully, and run it exactly as stated:You have these two options:At the command line:orRun "npm run start_windows" at the command line with your package.json file configured as belowThe trick for it to work on Windows is you need to remove the whitespace before and after the "&&".You can useIt is probably the best way to do it, because it\'s compatible on both Windows and Unix.From the npm run-script documentation:The env script is a special built-in command that can be used to list environment variables that will be available to the script at runtime. If an "env" command is defined in your package it will take precedence over the built-in.If you are using Visual Studio with NTVS, you can set the environment variables on the project properties page:As you can see, the Configuration and Platform dropdowns are disabled (I haven\'t looked too far into why this is), but if you edit your .njsproj file as follows:The \'Debug / Release\' dropdown will then control how the variable is set before starting Node.js.My experience using Node.js on Windows 7 64-bit in Visual Studio 2013 is that you need to usefrom a cmd window. AND you have to restart Visual Studio in order for the new value to be recognized.The set syntax only lasts for the duration of the cmd window in which it is set.Simple test in Node.js:It returns \'undefined\' when using set, and it will return \'development\' if using setx and restarting Visual Studio.To run your application in PowerShell (since && is disallowed):Note that the text output of what the server\'s doing is suppressed, and I am not sure if that\'s fixable. (Expanding on @jsalonen\'s answer.)Just to clarify, and for anyone else that may be pulling their hair out...If you are using git bash on Windows, set node_env=production&& node whatever.js does not seem to work. Instead, use the native cmd. Then, using set node_env=production&& node whatever.jsworks as expected.My use case:  I develop on Windows because my workflow is a lot faster, but I needed to make sure that my application\'s development-specific middleware were not firing in the production environment.NODE_ENV=production node script.jsWhich normally becomesNODE_ENV=production node app.jsYou could also set N number of environment variables by runningNODE_ENV=production NODE_APP_INSTANCE=3 node app.jsThis would make npm config read the default.js file followed by the production.js file overwriting anything that is duplicate, then finally reading production-3.js and once again overwriting duplicate entries.For multiple environment variables, an .env file is more convenient. As an example .env:It\'s easy to use with dotenv:Don\'t forget to ignore the file in your VCS, e.g. with the glob *.env, if the file contains credentials.To test on start if all environments are set, use dotenv-safe. With it, you have the following files:and the start fails if a variable in .env.example is not set in .env (here: KEY).Changing package.json file works for me in windows 10. Change:
