Does jQuery or jQuery-UI have any functionality to disable text selection for given document elements?In jQuery 1.8, this can be done as follows:If you use jQuery UI, there is a method for that, but it can only handle mouse selection (i.e. CTRL+A is still working):The code is realy simple, if you don\'t want to use jQuery UI :I found this answer ( Prevent Highlight of Text Table ) most helpful, and perhaps it can be combined with another way of providing IE compatibility.Here\'s a more comprehensive solution to the disconnect selection, and the cancellation of some of the hot keys (such as Ctrl+a and Ctrl+c. Test: Cmd+a and Cmd+c)and call example:jsfiddle.net/JBxnQ/This could be also not enough for old versions of FireFox (I can\'t tell which). If all this does not work, add the following:The following would disable the selection of all classes \'item\' in all common browsers (IE, Chrome, Mozilla, Opera and Safari):This can easily be done using JavaScript This is applicable to all BrowsersCall to this functionThis is actually very simple.\nTo disable text selection (and also click+drag-ing text (e.g a link in Chrome)), just use the following jQuery code:All this does is prevent the default from happening when you click with your mouse (mousedown()) in the body and html tags. You can very easily change the element just by changing the text in-between the two quotes (e.g change $(\'body, html\') to $(\'#myUnselectableDiv\') to make the myUnselectableDiv div to be, well, unselectable.A quick snippet to show/prove this to you:Please note that this effect is not perfect, and performs the best while making the whole window not selectable. You might also want to addthe cancellation of some of the hot keys (such as Ctrl+a and Ctrl+c. Test: Cmd+a and Cmd+c)as well, by using that section of Vladimir\'s answer above. (get to his post here)1 line solution for CHROME:  and FF:  IE requires setting the "unselectable" attribute (details on bottom).I tested this in Chrome and it works. This property is inherited so setting it on the body element will disable selection in your entire document.  Details here: http://help.dottoro.com/ljrlukea.phpIf you\'re using Closure, just call this function:It handles all browsers transparently.The non-IE browsers are handled like this:Defined here:\nhttp://closure-library.googlecode.com/svn/!svn/bc/4/trunk/closure/goog/docs/closure_goog_style_style.js.source.htmlThe IE portion is handled like this:I think this code works on all browsers and requires the least overhead. It\'s really a hybrid of all the above answers. Let me know if you find a bug!Add CSS:Add jQuery:Optional: To disable selection for all children elements as well, you can change the IE block to:Usage:One solution to this, for appropriate cases, is to use a <button> for the text that you don\'t want to be selectable. If you are binding to the click event on some text block, and don\'t want that text to be selectable, changing it to be a button will improve the semantics and also prevent the text being selected.Best and simplest way I found it, prevents ctrl + c, right click. In this case I blocked everything, so I don\'t have to specify anything.
