I am making an expand/collapse call rates table for the company I work for. I currently have a table with a button under it to expand it, the button says "Expand". It is functional except I need the button to change to "Collapse" when it is clicked and then of course back to "Expand" when it is clicked again. The writing on the button is a background image.So basically all I need is to change the background image of a div when it is clicked, except sort of like a toggle.Should do the trick, just hook it up in a click event on the elementI personally would just use the JavaScript code to switch between 2 classes.Have the CSS outline everything you need on your div MINUS the background rule, then add two classes (e.g: expanded & collapsed) as rules each with the correct background image (or background position if using a sprite).CSS with different imagesOr CSS with image spriteThen...JavaScript code with imagesJavaScript with spriteNote: the elegant toggleClass does not work in Internet Explorer 6, but the below addClass/removeClass method will work fine in this situation as wellThe most elegant solution (unfortunately not Internet Explorer 6 friendly)As far as I know this method will work accross browsers, and I would feel much more comfortable playing with CSS and classes than with URL changes in the script.There are two different ways to change a background image CSS with jQuery.Look carefully to note the differences. In the second, you can use conventional CSS and string multiple CSS properties together.If you use a CSS sprite for the background images, you could bump the background offset +/- n pixels depending on whether you were expanding or collapsing.  Not a toggle, but closer to it than having to switch background image URLs.Here is how I do it:CSSJSOne way to do this is to put both images in the HTML, inside a SPAN or DIV, you can hide the default either with CSS, or with JS on page load.  Then you can toggle on click.  Here is a similar example I am using to put left/down icons on a list:This works on all current browsers on WinXP.  Basically just checking what the current backgrond image is.  If it\'s image1, show image2, otherwise show image1.The jsapi stuff just loads jQuery from the Google CDN (easier for testing a misc file on the desktop).The replace is for cross-browser compatibility (opera and ie add quotes to the url  and firefox, chrome and safari remove quotes).I did mine using regular expressions, since I wanted to preserve a relative path and not use add the addClass function. I just wanted to make it convoluted, lol.Old post, but this would allow you to use an image sprite and adjust the repeat as well as positioning by using the shorthand for the css property (background, repeat, left top). Mine is animated:I\'ve found a solution in a forum, Toggle Background Img.CSS Sprites work best. I tried switching classes and manipulating the \'background-image\' property with jQuery, none worked. I think it\'s because the browsers (at least the latest stable Chrome) can\'t "reload" an image already loaded.Bonus : CSS Sprites are faster to download and faster to display. Less HTTP requests means faster page load. Reducing the number of HTTP is the best way to improve front end performance, so I recommend going this route all the time.This is a fairly simple response changes the background of the site with a list of items
