I\'m using the jQuery DatePicker control for the first time. I\'ve got it working on my form, but it\'s about twice as big as I would like, and about 1.5 times as big as the demo on the jQuery UI page. Is there some simple setting I\'m missing to control the size?Edit: I found a clue, but it opens up new problems. In the CSS file, it states the component will scale according to the parent element\'s font size. They recommend setting to make 1em = 10px. Doing this gives me a nicely sized datepicker, but obviously it messes up the rest of my site (I currently have font-size: .9em).I tried throwing a DIV around my text box and setting its font size, but it seems to ignore that. So there must be some way to shrink the datepicker by changing the font of its parent, but how do I do that without messing up the rest of my site?You don\'t have to change it in the jquery-ui css file (it can be confusing if you change the default files), it is enough if you addin a stylesheet loaded after the ui-filesdiv.ui-datepicker is needed in case ui-widget is mentioned after ui-datepicker in the declarationI can\'t add a comment, so this is in reference to the accepted answer by Keijro.  I actually added the following to my stylesheet instead:and it worked as well.  This might be preferable to the absolute value of 10px.Not sure whether some body has suggested following way, if yes, just ignore my comments. I tested this today and it works for me. By just resizing the font before the control gets displayed:Using the callback function beforeShowI change the following line in ui.theme.css:to:Addin a stylesheet loaded after the ui-files.\nThis will also resize the date items.For me, this was the easiest solution:\nI added the font-size:62.5%; to the first .ui-datepicker tag in the jquery custom css file:before:after:I was trying these examples without success. Apparently other stylesheets on the page were setting default font sizes for different tags. If you adjust the ui-datepicker you are changing a div.  If you change a div you need to make sure the contents of that div inherit that size.  This is what finally worked for me:Good luck!I was using an input to collect and show the calendar, and to be able to resize the calendar I have been using this code:It works like a charm.$(\'.ui-datepicker\').css(\'font-size\', $(\'.ui-datepicker\').width() / 20 + \'px\');This worked for me and seems simple...I tried the approach of using the callback function beforeShow but found I had to also set the line height.  My version looked like:the best place to change the size of the calendar is in the file jquery-ui.cssThis code will work on Calender buttons.\nsize of numbers will increase by using "line-height".you can change jquery-ui-1.10.4.custom.css as followsAnother approach:$(\'div.ui-datepicker\').css({ fontSize: \'12px\' }); work if we call it after \n$("#DueDate").datepicker();FiddleThe Jacob Tsui solution works perfect for me:I think I found it - I had to go into the CSS file and change the font-size for the datepicker control directly. Obvious once you know about it, but confusing at first.open ui.all.cssat the end putand go !To get this to work in Safari 5.1 with Rails 3.1, I had to add:
