I have seen some people creating properties in C# really fast, but how did they do it?What shortcuts are available in Visual Studio (currently using Visual Studio 2010) to create properties?I am using C#.For example,You could type "prop" and then press tab twice. That will generate the following.Then you change "TYPE" and "Type":You can also get the full property typing "propfull" and then tab twice. That would generate the field and the full property.In addition to Amra\'s answer, you can find other snippets by typingCtrl + K, Ctrl + XWhich is mapped to Edit.InsertSnippet in my Visual Studio and shows you the full list of snippets available.Place cursor inside your field private int _i; and then Edit menu or RMB - Refactor - Encapsulate Field... (CtrlR, CtrlE) to create the standard property accessors.Type "propfull". It is much better to use, and it will generate the property and private variable.Type "propfull" and then TAB twice.After typing "prop" + Tab + Tab as suggested by Amra, \nyou can immediately type the property\'s type (which will replace the default int), type another tab and type the property name (which will replace the default MyProperty). Finish by pressing Enter.I think Alt+R+F is the correct one for creating property from a variable declarationStart from:When you select "myVar" and right click then select "Refactor" and select "Encapsulate Field".It will automatically create:Or you can shortcut it by pressing Ctrl + R + E.When you write in Visual Studio,ReSharper will keep suggesting to convert it to:ReSharper offers property generation in its extensive feature set. (It\'s not cheap though, unless you\'re working on an open-source project.)Type P + Tab + Tab.Change the datatype, press TAB, change the property name, and press End + Enter.Using VsVim the code snippets seem to work a little funny. The shortcut I was looking for when I ended up here is much simpler: after a member name type {g;s;I have delimiter auto-closing turned on, so the closing brace appears on {, and typing a semicolon triggers an autocomplete for get and set.It works on VS2013 and VS2015, and VS2012 just lacks the automatic brace matching.If you are using Visual Studio 2013, 2015 or above, just click the link below.
