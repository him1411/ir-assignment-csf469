For instance can select 5 and 10 or they are excluded from the range?The BETWEEN operator is inclusive.From Books Online:BETWEEN returns TRUE if the value of\n  test_expression is greater than or\n  equal to the value of begin_expression\n  and less than or equal to the value of\n  end_expression.DateTime CaveatNB: With DateTimes you have to be careful; if only a date is given the value is taken as of midnight on that day; to avoid missing times within your end date, or repeating the capture of the following day\'s data at midnight in multiple ranges, your end date should be 3 milliseconds before midnight on of day following your to date.  3 milliseconds because any less than this and the value will be rounded up to midnight the next day.e.g. to get all values within June 2016 you\'d need to run:where myDateTime between \'2016-06-01\' and dateadd(millisecond, -3, \'2016-07-01\')i.e.where myDateTime between \'2016-06-01 00:00:00.000\' and \'2016-07-01 23:59:59.997\'Yes, but be careful when using between for dates.is really interpreted as 12am, orso will miss anything that occurred during the day of Jan 31st. In this case, you will have to use:orUPDATE: It is entirely possible to have records created within that last second of the day, with a datetime as late as 01/01/2009 23:59:59.997!! For this reason, the BETWEEN (firstday) AND (lastday 23:59:59) approach is not recommended. Use the myDate >= (firstday) AND myDate < (Lastday+1) approach instead.Good article on this issue here.Real world example from SQL Server 2008.if you hit this, and don\'t really want to try and handle adding a day in code, then let the DB do it..BETWEEN (Transact-SQL)Specifies a(n) (inclusive) range to test.ArgumentsIs the expression to test for in the range defined by begin_expression\n  and end_expression. test_expression\n  must be the same data type as both\n  begin_expression and end_expression.Specifies that the result of the predicate be negated.Is any valid expression. begin_expression must be the same data\n  type as both test_expression and\n  end_expression.Is any valid expression. end_expression must be the same data\n  type as both test_expression and\n  begin_expression.Acts as a placeholder that indicates test_expression should be\n  within the range indicated by\n  begin_expression and end_expression.RemarksTo specify an exclusive range, use the\n  greater than (>) and less than\n  operators (<). If any input to the\n  BETWEEN or NOT BETWEEN predicate is\n  NULL, the result is UNKNOWN.Result ValueBETWEEN returns TRUE if the value of\n  test_expression is greater than or\n  equal to the value of begin_expression\n  and less than or equal to the value of\n  end_expression.NOT BETWEEN returns TRUE if the value\n  of test_expression is less than the\n  value of begin_expression or greater\n  than the value of end_expression.If the column data type is datetime then you can do this following to eliminate time from datetime and compare between date range only.It does includes boundaries.I\'ve always used this:WHERE myDate BETWEEN startDate AND (endDate+1)
