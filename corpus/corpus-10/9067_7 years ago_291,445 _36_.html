Want to remove all new lines from string.I\'ve this regex, it can catch all of them, the problem is I don\'t know with which function should I use it.$string should become:You have to be cautious of double line breaks, which would cause double spaces. Use this really efficient regular expression:Multiple spaces and newlines are replaced with a single space.Edit: As others have pointed out, this solution has issues matching single newlines in between words. This is not present in the example, but one can easily see how that situation could occur. An alternative is to do the following:A few comments on the accepted answer:The + means "1 or more". I don\'t think you need to repeat \\s. I think you can simply write \'/\\s+/\'.Also, if you want to remove whitespace first and last in the string, add trim.With these modifications, the code would be:Just use preg_replace()You could get away with str_replace() on this one, although the code doesn\'t look as clean:See it live on ideoneYou should use str_replace for its speed and using double quotes with an arrayPCRE regex replacements can be done using preg_replace:\nhttp://php.net/manual/en/function.preg-replace.phpWould replace new line or return characters with a space. If you don\'t want anything to replace them, change the 2nd argument to \'\'.Use this:replace series of newlines with an empty string:or you probably want to replace newlines with a single space:Whats about:This should be a pretty robust solution because \\n doesn\'t work correctly in all systems if i\'m not wrong ...I\'m not sure if this has any value against the already submitted answers but I can just as well post it.this is the pattern I would useThis one also removes tabsYou can try below code will preserve any white-space and new lines in your text.I was surprised to see how little everyone knows about regex.Strip newlines in php isIn perlMeaning replace any newline character at the end of the line (for efficiency) - optionally preceded by a carriage return - with a space.\\n or \\015 is newline.\n\\r or \\012 is carriage return.\n? in regex means match 1 or zero of the previous character.\n$ in regex means match end of line.The original and best regex reference is perldoc perlre, every coder should know this doc pretty well:\nhttp://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html\nNote not all features are supported by all languages.maybe this works:Escape sequence \\R matches a generic newlinethat is, anything considered a linebreak sequence by Unicode. This includes all characters matched by \\v (vertical whitespace), and the multi character sequence \\x0D\\x0A...In 8-bit non-UTF-8 mode \\R is equivalent to the following: (?>\\r\\n|\\n|\\x0b|\\f|\\r|\\x85)... pcre.orgRegex101 Demo
