if you provide 0 as the dayValue in Date.setFullYear you get the last day of the previous month:There is reference to this behaviour at mozilla. Is this a reliable cross-browser feature or should I look at alternative methods?Output differences are due to differences in the toString() implementation, not because the dates are different.Of course, just because the browsers identified above use 0 as the last day of the previous month does not mean they will continue to do so, or that browsers not listed will do so, but it lends credibility to the belief that it should work the same way in every browser.I would use an intermediate date with the first day of the next month, and return the date from the previous day:I find this to be the best solution for me. Let the Date object calculate it for you.Setting day parameter to 0 means one day less than first day of the month which is last day of the previous month.My colleague stumbled upon the following which may be an easier solutionstolen from http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/2099In computer terms, new Date() and regular expression solutions are slow! If you want a super-fast (and super-cryptic) one-liner, try this one (assuming m is in Jan=1 format). I keep trying different code changes to get the best performance.My current fastest version:After looking at this related question Leap year check using bitwise operators (amazing speed) and discovering what the 25 & 15 magic number represented, I have come up with this optimized hybrid of answers:JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/TrueBlueAussie/H89X3/22/JSPerf results: http://jsperf.com/days-in-month-head-to-head/5For some reason, (m+(m>>3)&1) is more efficient than (5546>>m&1) on almost all browsers.The only real competition for speed is from @GitaarLab, so I have created a head-to-head JSPerf for us to test on: http://jsperf.com/days-in-month-head-to-head/5It works based on my leap year answer here: javascript to find leap year this answer here Leap year check using bitwise operators (amazing speed) as well as the following binary logic.A quick lesson in binary months:If you interpret the index of the desired months (Jan = 1) in binary you will notice that months with 31 days either have bit 3 clear and bit 0 set, or bit 3 set and bit 0 clear.That means you can shift the value 3 places with >> 3, XOR the bits with the original ^ m and see if the result is 1 or 0 in bit position 0 using & 1. Note: It turns out + is slightly faster than XOR (^) and (m >> 3) + m gives the same result in bit 0.JSPerf results: http://jsperf.com/days-in-month-perf-test/6A slight modification to solution provided by lebreeze:try this one. example:output:This works for me.\nWill provide last day of given year and month:This one works nicely:I think the best solution like this: For selected date, you can easily set spesific date set month you need to date and then set the day to zero ,so month begin in 1 - 31 in date function then get the last day^^I know it\'s just a matter of semantics, but I ended up using it in this form. Since functions are resolved from the inside argument, outward, it works the same. You can then just replace the year, and month / year with the required details, whether it be from the current date. Or a particular month / year.No, not all browsers will use 0 as the last day.  IE and Firefox will but Opera will not.Check out the following source for more info:Last day of Month
