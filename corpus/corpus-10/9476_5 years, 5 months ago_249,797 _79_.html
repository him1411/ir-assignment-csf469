When I run the following query I get an error:The error message is:Why am I getting that error? How do I fix it?This commonly occurs when exporting views/triggers/procedures from one database or server to another as the user that created that object no longer exists.You have two options:This is possibly easiest to do when initially importing your database objects, by removing any DEFINER statements from the dump.Changing the definer later is a more little tricky:Run this SQL to generate the necessary ALTER statementsCopy and run the ALTER statementsExample:Be careful, because this will change all the definers for all databases.If you\'ve found following error while using MySQL database:  Then you can solve\n  it by using following :From http://www.lynnnayko.com/2010/07/mysql-user-specified-as-definer-root.htmlThis worked like a charm - you only have to change someuser to the name of the missing user. On a local dev server, you might typically just use root.Also consider whether you actually need to grant the user ALL permissions or whether they could do with less. The user who originally created the SQL view or procedure has been deleted.  If you recreate that user, it should address your error.If the user exists, then:Create the deleted user like this : orFor future googlers: I got a similar message trying to update a table in a database that contained no views. After some digging, it turned out I had imported triggers on that table, and those were the things defined by the non-existant user. Dropping the triggers solved the problem.Follow these steps:Hope it helpsSolution is just a single line query as below :Replace ROOT with your mysql user name.\nReplace PASSWORD with your mysql password.The user \'web2vi\' does not exist on your mysql server. See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/error-messages-server.html#error_er_no_such_userIf that user does exist, check what servers it can access from, although I would have thought that would be a different error (EG you might have web2vi@localhost, but you are accessing the db as web2vi@% (At anything)My 5 cents.I had same error while I tried to select from a view.However problem appears to be that this view, selected from another view that was restored from backup from different server.and in fact, YES, user was invalid, but was not obvious where to from the first look.Try to set your procedure as \nSECURITY INVOKER Mysql default sets procedures security as "DEFINER" (CREATOR OF).. you must set the security to the "invoker". quick fix to work around and dump the file:I had the same problem with root user ans it worked for me when I replaced bySo, if the user \'web2vi\' is allowed to connect from \'localhost\', you can try:I\'m connected remotely to the database.In my case, the table had a trigger with a DEFINER user that didn\'t exist.Fixed by running this following comments.    if you are getting some_other instead of web2vi then you have to change the name accordingly.Your view, "view_quotes" may have been copied from a different database where "web2vi" is a valid user into a database where "web2vi" is not a valid user. \nEither add the "web2vi" user to the database or alter the view (normally removing the DEFINER=\'web2vi\'@\'%\' part and executing the script will do the trick) Go into the edit routine section and and at the bottom, change Security Type from Definer to Invoker.The problem is clear - MySQL cannot find user specified as the definer.I encountered this problem after synchronizing database model from development server, applying it to localhost, making changes to the model and then reapplying it to localhost. Apparently there was a view (I modified) defined and so I couldn\'t update my local version.How to fix (easily):Note: it involves deleting so it works just fine for views but make sure you have data backed-up if you try this on tables.P.S. This is neither a proper nor best-all-around fix. I just posted it as a possible (and very simple) solution.I had your very same problem minutes ago, I ran into this issue after deleting an unused user from mysql.user table, but doing an alter view fixed it, here is a handy command that makes it very simple:Mix this with the mysql command line (assuming *nix, not familiar with windows):Note: the command generates and extra SELECT CONCAT on the file, making mysql -uuser -ppass databasename < alterView.sql fail if you don\'t remove it.Source: https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/4129/modify-definer-on-many-viewsOne or several of your views where created/registered by another user. You\'ll have to check the owner of the view and:I had this problem once.I was trying to migrate views, from BD1 to BD2, using SQLYog. SQLYog recreated the views in the other DataBase (DB2), but it kept the user of BD1 (they where different). Later I realized that the views I was using in my query were having the same error as you, even when I wasn\'t creating any view.Hope this help.You can try this:when mysql.proc is empty, but system always notice "user@192.168.%" for table_name no exist,you just root in mysql command line and type:over!This happened to me after I imported a dump on Windows 10 with MYSQL Workbench 6.3 Community, with "root@% does not exist". Even though the user existed. \nFirst I tried to comment out the DEFINER however, this did not work. \nI then did a string replace on "root@%" with "root@localhost" and reimported the dump. This did the trick for me.From MySQL reference of CREATE VIEW:The DEFINER and SQL SECURITY clauses specify the security context to be used when checking access privileges at view invocation time. This user must exist and is always better to use \'localhost\' as hostname. So I think that if you check that the user exists and change it to \'localhost\' on create view you won\'t have this error.If this is a stored procedure, you can do:But this is not advised.For me, better solution is to create the definer:The database user also seems to be case-sensitive, so while I had a root\'@\'% user I didn\'t have a ROOT\'@\'% user. I changed the user to be uppercase via workbench and the problem was resolved!Why am I getting that error? How do I fix it?I spent a hour before found a decision for a problem like this. But, in my case, I ran this:If you really want to find the problem, just run this commands one by one:...and, after each of them, look for the field \'definer\'.In my case it was bearded old trigger, that somebody of developers forgot to delete.in my case I had a trigger on that table that I could not update data getting the same error.MySQL error 1449: The user specified as a definer does not existthe solution was to delete the triggers on that table and recreate them again, this fixed the issue, since the the trigger was made with another user from another server, and the user name changed on the new server after changing hosting company . that\'s my 2 centsi came here for the same problem, i couldn\'t find anywhere in my code where a certain user was making the action.\napparently it was from a trigger that was using a user which was long deleted (db was restored from an older version)\nso in case you are puzzled as i were, take a look at your db events/triggers/routines.\nhope this will help someone. you can create user with name web2vi and grant all privilageexample:
