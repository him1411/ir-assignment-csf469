If I add a file to the same directory opened in NERDTree, the only way I can see the file added is if I quit vim and start it again . Is there a way I can reload the files in NERDTree?You could close and reopen NERDTree or simply hit r to refresh the current directory\'s listing or R to refresh the root directory\'s listing .Do you see "Press ? for help" at the top of the NERDTree window? It means that you can press ? for help. If you do, you will see an exhaustive listing of NERDTree shortcuts. That\'s neat.More generally, many plugins have a thorough documentation that you can access with :help <pluginame>.As @romainl answered above; press r to refresh current directory or R to refresh root directory.However, you can consider adding new files from nerdTree itself by pressing m, then a to add a new file/directory. This way you don\'t need to refresh nerdTree to see the new added file.Instead of hitting R in the NERDTree window, I use a custom map that does it for me:I\'ve mapped it to Leader + r, but you can map it to whatever you want.Explanation:Note 1: You must use recursive map (i.e. map or nmap instead of noremap or nnoremap)Note 2: You can add a last step to refresh CtrlP along with NERDTreeYou can hit R button by using feedkeys function. Just like this:  I have defined a function in my .vimrc file: So, when I type ctrl+l, the NERDTree will be toggled and refresh root directory.
