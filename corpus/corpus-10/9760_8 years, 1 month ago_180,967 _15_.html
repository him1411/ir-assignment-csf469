I am trying to use Wget to download a page, but I cannot get past the login screen.How do I send the username/password using post data on the login page and then download the actual page as an authenticated user?Based on the manual page:Make sure the --post-data parameter is properly percent-encoded (especially ampersands!) or the request will probably fail. Also make sure that user and password are the correct keys; you can find out the correct keys by sleuthing the HTML of the login page (look into your browser\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinspect element\xe2\x80\x9d feature and find the name attribute on the username and password fields).I directly gave cookies of an existing connection to wget with --no-cookies and the Cookie HTTP request header. In my case it was a Moodle university login where logging in looks more complex (using multiple requests with a login ticket). I added --post-data because it was a POST request.\nFor example, get all Moodle users list:wget --no-cookies --header "Cookie: <name>=<value>" --post-data \'tab=search&name=+&personsubmit=Rechercher&keywords=&keywordsoption=allmine\' https://moodle.unistra.fr/message/index.phpI had the same problem. My solution was to do the login via Chrome and save the cookies data to a textfile. This is easily done with this Chrome extention: Chrome cookie.txt export extension.When you get the cookies data, there is also an example on how to use them with wget. A simple copy-paste command line is provided to you. If you need it for one time use, you can log in via browser and copy needed headers afterwards:\nUse "Copy as cURL" in the Network tab of Developer Tools (reload the page after opening) and replace curl\'s header flag -H with wget\'s --header.You don\'t need cURL to do POSTed form data. --post-data \'key1=value1&key2=value2\' works just fine. Note: you can also pass a file name to wget with the POST data in the file.If they\'re using basic authentication:If they\'re using POSTed form data, you\'ll need to use something like cURL instead.I wanted a one-liner that didn\'t download any files; here is an example of piping the cookie output into the next request. I only tested the following on Gentoo, but it should work in most *nix environments:If you want the output saved to a file, change -O - to -O /some/file/name
