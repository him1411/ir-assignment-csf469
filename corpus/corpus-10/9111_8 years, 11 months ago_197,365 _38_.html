What does the "bus error" message mean, and how does it differ from a segfault?Bus errors are rare nowadays on x86 and occur when your processor cannot even attempt the memory access requested, typically:Segmentation faults occur when accessing memory which does not belong to your process, they are very common and are typically the result of:PS: To be more precise this is not manipulating the pointer itself that will cause issues, it\'s accessing the memory it points to (dereferencing).A segfault is accessing memory that you\'re not allowed to access.  It\'s read-only, you don\'t have permission, etc...A bus error is trying to access memory that can\'t possibly be there.  You\'ve used an address that\'s meaningless to the system, or the wrong kind of address for that operation.I believe the kernel raises SIGBUS\n  when an application exhibits data\n  misalignment on the data bus. I think\n  that since most[?] modern compilers\n  for most processors pad / align the\n  data for the programmers, the\n  alignment troubles of yore (at least)\n  mitigated, and hence one does not see\n  SIGBUS too often these days (AFAIK).From: HereYou can also get SIGBUS when a code page cannot be paged in for some reason.One classic instance of a bus error is on certain architecures, such as the SPARC (at least some SPARCs, maybe this has been changed), is when you do a mis-aligned access. For instance:This snippet tries to write the 32-bit integer value 0xdeadf00d to an address that is (most likely) not properly aligned, and will generate a bus error on architectures that are "picky" in this regard. The Intel x86 is, by the way, not such an architecture, it would allow the access (albeit execute it more slowly).It depends on your OS, CPU, Compiler, and possibly other factors.In general it means the CPU bus could not complete a command, or suffered a conflict, but that could mean a whole range of things depending on the environment and code being run.-AdamIt normally means an un-aligned access.An attempt to access memory that isn\'t physically present would also give a bus error, but you won\'t see this if you\'re using a processor with an MMU and an OS that\'s not buggy, because you won\'t have any non-existent memory mapped to your process\'s address space.A specific example of a bus error I just encountered while programming C on OS X:In case you don\'t remember the docs strcat appends the second argument to the first by changing the first argument(flip the arguments and it works fine). On linux this gives a segmentation fault(as expected), but on OS X it gives a bus error. Why? I really don\'t know.I was getting a bus error when the root directory was at 100%.mmap minimal POSIX 7 example"Bus error" happens when the kernel sends SIGBUS to a process.A minimal example that produces it because ftruncate was forgotten:Run with:Tested in Ubuntu 14.04.POSIX describes SIGBUS as:Access to an undefined portion of a memory object.The mmap spec says that:References within the address range starting at pa and continuing for len bytes to whole pages following the end of an object shall result in delivery of a SIGBUS signal.And shm_open says that it generates objects of size 0:The shared memory object has a size of zero.So at *map = 0 we are touching past the end of the allocated object.My reason for bus error on Mac OS X was that I tried to allocate about 1Mb on the stack. This worked well in one thread, but when using openMP this drives to bus error, because Mac OS X has very limited stack size for non-main threads.To add to what blxtd answered above, bus errors also occur when your process cannot attempt to access the memory of a particular \'variable\'.Notice the \'inadvertent\' usage of variable \'i\' in the first \'for loop\'? That\'s what is causing the bus error in this case.I just found out the hard way that on an ARMv7 processor you can write some code that gives you a segmentation fault when unoptimized, but gives you a bus error when compiled with -O2 (optimize more).\nI am using gcc arm gnueabihf cross compiler from ubuntu x64.A typical buffer overflow which results in Bus error is,Here if size of the string in double quotes ("") is more than buf size it gives bus error.This could refer to human problems too. In various fields of research (perhaps wider), the slang "bus error" has a different meaning, which I think could be a relevant answer. When there\'s only one person who knows how to do something crucial to a particular workflow, and that person suddenly becomes unavailable (i.e., "falls under a bus" - but most likely just ups and leaves unexpectedly), this is referred to as a bus error. It is just as catastrophic as a "real" bus error, since without this person\'s knowledge of how to maintain or even execute the research workflow, the entire system falls apart. Being vulnerable to bus errors is a sign of bad management.
