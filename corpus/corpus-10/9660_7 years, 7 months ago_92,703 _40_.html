I have a simple text area in a form like this:I keep getting extra white space in this textarea. When I tab into it my cursor is like in the middle of the textarea and not in the beginning? What is the explanation?Look closely at your code. In it, there are already three line breaks, and a ton of white space before </textarea>. Remove those first so that there are no line breaks in between the tags any more. It might already do the trick.Well, everything between  <textarea> and </textarea> is used as the default value for your textarea box. There is some whitespace in your example there. Try to eliminate all of that.Open (and close!) your PHP tags right after, and before, your textarea tags:Basically it should beIf there are some predefined spaces lets say due to code formatting like belowThe spaces shown by dots keeps on adding on each submit.In short: \n<textarea> should be closed immediately on the same line where it started.General Practice: this will add-up line-breaks and spaces used for indentation in the code.Correct PracticeAnother work around would be to use javascript:This is what I did. Removing white-spaces and line-breaks in the code makes the line too long.To make it look a bit cleaner, consider using the ternary operator:Please make sure there is no linebreak or space after , it\'s to make sure there is no whitespace or tab, just copy and paste this code :) I had fix it for youAny space in between textarea openning and closing tags will be consider as whitespace. So for your above code, the correct way will be :I\'m against HTML code mixed with PHP code.However try this:The text area shows mysterious spaces because there is a real space exists in the tags. <textarea>                    <php? echo $var; ?>                          </textarea>\nafter removing these extra spaces between the tags  will solve the issue  , as following.      <textarea><php? echo $var; ?></textarea> One solution that has worked for me is adding the style white-space: normal; to the textarea because at times it is not feasible to eliminate all the whitespace (for example when you want your code to abide to your coding guidelines which requires adding tabs, whitespaces and line breaks)Please note that the default for textarea, at least in chrome is:\nwhite-space: pre-wrap;I know its late but may help others.use this in when document indentation is required.same questionAlso, when you say that the cursor is in the "middle" of the textarea, it makes me think you could also either have extra padding or text-align: center defined somewhere in your CSS.Make sure first that your $siteLink_val isn\'t returning white space as a value. The <textarea> element by default has an empty value so if the variable you\'re echo\'ing for some reason has spaces, there\'s your problem right off the bat. To make the code the absolute cleanest, I would suggest you could do something like this, allowing for some more flexibility later. I\'ve made a function that returns either a NULL if the variable isn\'t present (what you seem to be aiming for in the original post) and the absolute value otherwise. Once you\'ve made sure of your variable\'s contents, try this:And the following code in your textarea would now read:This is assuming your PHP install is configured for short-hand variable calls, as seen in the shortened "<?=?>" tags. If you cannot output this way, remember to preface your PHP code with "<?php" and close with "?>". Avoid line breaks between <textarea>\'s because it can create the potential of erroneous characters. Also, check your CSS to make sure there isn\'t a padding rule pushing text inward.Also, you specify a cols and rows value on the textarea, and then style a width and height. These rules are counter-productive, and will result in inconsistent visuals. Stick with either defining the size through style (I recommend giving the element a class) or the rows/cols.Furthermore: the textarea tag shows spaces for new lines, tabs, etc, in multiline code.keep textarea code with no additional white spaces insidemoreover if you see extra blank lines\nthere is solution in meta language:it will print lines without additional blank lines\nof course it depends if your lines ending with \'\\n\', \'\\r\\n\' or \'\' - please adaptIf you still like to use indentation, do it after opening the <?php tag, like so:Moving ...> down works for me. Html element might be open tags and close tagsif you want to use one tag using <tagName/>
