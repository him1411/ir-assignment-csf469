Why do you need to place columns you create yourself (for example select 1 as "number") after HAVING and not WHERE in MySQL?And are there any downsides instead of doing WHERE 1 (writing the whole definition instead of a column name)?Why is it that you need to place columns you create yourself (for example "select 1 as number") after HAVING and not WHERE in MySQL?WHERE is applied before GROUP BY, HAVING is applied after (and can filter on aggregates).In general, you can reference aliases in neither of these clauses, but MySQL allows referencing SELECT level aliases in GROUP BY, ORDER BY and HAVING.And are there any downsides instead of doing "WHERE 1" (writing the whole definition instead of a column name)If your calculated expression does not contain any aggregates, putting it into the WHERE clause will most probably be more efficient.All answers upon didn\'t hit the key point.Assume we have a table:And have 10 rows with both id and value from 1 to 10:Try the following 2 queries:You will get exactly the same results, you can see the HAVING clause can work without GROUP BY clause.Here\'s the difference:Error #1054 - Unknown column \'v\' in \'where clause\'WHERE clause requires a condition to be a column in a table, but HAVING clause can use either column or alias.This is because WHERE clause filters data before select, but HAVING clause filters data after select.So put the conditions in WHERE clause will be more efficient if you have many many rows in a table.Try EXPLAIN to see the key difference:You can see either WHERE or HAVING uses index, but the rows are different.The main difference is that WHERE cannot be used on grouped item (such as SUM(number)) whereas HAVING can. The reason is the WHERE is done before the grouping and HAVING is done after the grouping is done.HAVING is used to filter on aggregations in your GROUP BY.For example, to check for duplicate names:These 2 will be feel same as first as both are used to say about a condition to filter data. Though we can use \xe2\x80\x98having\xe2\x80\x99 in place of \xe2\x80\x98where\xe2\x80\x99 in any case, there are instances when we can\xe2\x80\x99t use \xe2\x80\x98where\xe2\x80\x99 instead of \xe2\x80\x98having\xe2\x80\x99. This is because in a select query, \xe2\x80\x98where\xe2\x80\x99 filters data before \xe2\x80\x98select\xe2\x80\x99 while \xe2\x80\x98having\xe2\x80\x99 filter data after \xe2\x80\x98select\xe2\x80\x99. So, when we use alias names that are not actually in the database, \xe2\x80\x98where\xe2\x80\x99 can\xe2\x80\x99t identify them but \xe2\x80\x98having\xe2\x80\x99 can.Ex: let the table Student contain student_id,name, birthday,address.Assume birthday is of type date.Having is only used with aggregation but where with non aggregation statements\nIf you have where word put it before aggregation (group by)A HAVING clause is used to filter values from a group. Before we\ngo any further let\xe2\x80\x99s review the format of an SQL Statement.  It isSELECT   SalesOrderID,\n         SUM(UnitPrice * OrderQty) AS TotalPrice\nFROM     Sales.SalesOrderDetail\nWHERE    LineTotal > 100\nGROUP BY SalesOrderID\nHAVING   SUM(UnitPrice * OrderQty) > 10000Key point, which is also the main difference between WHERE and HAVING clause in SQL is that, condition specified in WHERE clause is used while fetching data (rows) from table, and data which doesn\'t pass the condition will not be fetched into result set, on the other hand HAVING clause is later used to filter summarised data or grouped data. In short if both WHERE and HAVING clause is used in a SELECT query with aggregate function or GROUP BY clause, it will execute before HAVING clause.
