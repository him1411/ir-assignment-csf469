With Java:I have a byte[] that represents a file.How do I write this to a file (ie. C:\\myfile.pdf)I know it\'s done with InputStream, but I can\'t seem to work it out.Use Apache Commons IOOr, if you insist on making work for yourself...Without any libraries:With Google Guava:With Apache Commons:All of these strategies require that you catch an IOException at some point too. Another solution using java.nio.file:From Java 7 onward you can use the try-with-resources statement to avoid leaking resources and make your code easier to read. More on that here.To write your byteArray to a file you would do:Also since Java 7, one line with java.nio.file.Files:Where data is your byte[] and filePath is a String.  You can also add multiple file open options with the StandardOpenOptions class.  Add throws or surround with try/catch.Try an OutputStream or more specifically FileOutputStreamI know it\'s done with InputStreamActually, you\'d be writing to a file output...Basic example:You can try Cactoos:More details: http://www.yegor256.com/2017/06/22/object-oriented-input-output-in-cactoos.htmlThis is a program where we are reading and printing array of bytes offset and length using String Builder and Writing the array of bytes offset length to the new file.`Enter code hereO/P in console : fghij                  O/P in new file :cdefg//////////////////////////  1] File to Byte [] //////////////////////////////////////////   2] Byte [] to File ///////////////////////////
