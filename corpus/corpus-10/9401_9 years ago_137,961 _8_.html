What MySQL query will do a text search and replace in one particular field in a table?I.e. search for foo and replace with bar so a record with a field with the value hello foo becomes hello bar.Change table_name and field to match your table name and field in question:And if you want to search and replace based on the value of another field you could do a CONCAT:Just to have this one here so that others will find it at once.Like for example, if I want to replace all occurrences of John by Mark I will use below, The Replace string function will do that.I used the above command line as follow:\nupdate TABLE-NAME set FIELD = replace(FIELD, \'And\', \'and\');\nthe purpose was to replace And with and ("A" should be lowercase). The problem is it cannot find the "And" in database, but if I use like "%And%" then it can find it along with many other ands that are part of a word or even the ones that are already lowercase.
