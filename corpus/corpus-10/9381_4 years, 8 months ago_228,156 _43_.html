I\'m learning through this tutorial to learn bash scripts to automate a few tasks for me. I\'m connecting to a server using putty.The script, located in .../Documents/LOG, is:And I executed the following for read/write/execute permissionsThen, when I enter ./my_script, I\'m getting the error given in the title.Some similar questions wanted to see these, so I think they might help:/bin/bashand/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/bin/mhI tried adding current directory to PATH, but that doesn\'t work..I have seen this issue when creating scripts in Windows env and then porting over to run on a unix environment.Try running this on the script:Or just rewrite the script in your unix env using vi and test.Unix uses different line feeds and carriage returns so can\'t read the file you created on Windows. Hence it is seeing ^M as an illegal character.If you want to write a file on Windows and then port over, make sure your editor is set to create files in UNIX format.In notepad++ in the bottom right of the screen it tells you the document format. By default it will say Dos\\Windows. To change it go to Run following command in terminalThen try It should work.If you use Sublime Text on Windows or Mac to edit your scripts:Click on View > Line Endings > Unix and save the file again.This is caused by editing file in windows and importing and executing in unix. dos2unix -k -o filename should do the trick.In notepad++ you can set it for the file specifically by pressing Edit --> EOL Conversion --> UNIX/OSX Formatproblem is with dos line ending. Following will convert it for unixNB: you may need to install dos2unix first with yum install dos2unixanother way to do it is using sed command to search and replace the dos line ending characters to unix format:Your file has Windows line endings, which is confusing Linux.Remove the spurious CR characters. You can do it with the following command:I was able to resolve the issue by opening the script in gedit and saving it with the proper Line Ending option:In the bottom left of the "Save As" prompt, there are drop-down menus for Character Encoding and Line Ending. Change the Line Ending from "Windows" to "Unix/Linux," then Save.gedit "Save As" promptFor Eclipse users, you can either change the file encoding directly from the menu File > Convert Line Delimiters To > Unix (LF, \\n, 0\xce\x91, \xc2\xb6):Or change the New text file line delimiter to Other: Unix on Window > Preferences > General > Workspace panel:Atom has a built-in line ending selector packageMore details here: https://github.com/atom/line-ending-selectorI develop on Windows and Mac/Linux at the same time and I avoid this ^M-error by simply running my scripts as I do in Windows:$ php ./my_scriptNo need to change line endings.
