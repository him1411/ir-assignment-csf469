How can I calculate an age in years, given a birth date of format YYYYMMDD? Is it possible using the Date() function?I am looking for a better solution than the one I am using now:I would go for readability:Disclaimer: This also has precision issues, so this cannot be completely trusted either. It can be off by a few hours, on some years, or during daylight saving (depending on timezone).Instead I would recommend using a library for this, if precision is very important. Also @Naveens post, is probably the most accurate, as it doesn\'t rely on the time of day.Benchmarks: http://jsperf.com/birthday-calculation/15Try this.I believe the only thing that looked crude on your code was the substr part.Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/codeandcloud/n33RJ/Important: This answer doesn\'t provide an 100% accurate answer, it is off by around 10-20 hours depending on the date. There are no better solutions ( not in these answers anyway ). - naveenI of course couldn\'t resist the urge to take up the challenge and make a faster and shorter birthday calculator than the current accepted solution.\nThe main point for my solution, is that math is fast, so instead of using branching, and the date model javascript provides to calculate a solution we use the wonderful mathThe answer looks like this, and runs ~65% faster than naveen\'s plus it\'s much shorter:The magic number: 31557600000 is 24 * 3600 * 365.25 * 1000\nWhich is the length of a year, the length of a year is 365 days and 6 hours which is 0.25 day. In the end i floor the result which gives us the final age.Here is the benchmarks: http://jsperf.com/birthday-calculationTo support OP\'s data format you can replace +new Date(dateString); \n with +new Date(d.substr(0, 4), d.substr(4, 2)-1, d.substr(6, 2));If you can come up with a better solution please share! :-)With momentjs:Some time ago I made a function with that purpose:It takes a Date object as input, so you need to parse the \'YYYYMMDD\' formatted date string:Here\'s my solution, just pass in a parseable date:To test whether the birthday already passed or not, I define a helper function Date.prototype.getDoY, which effectively returns the day number of the year. The rest is pretty self-explanatory.I just had to write this function for myself - the accepted answer is fairly good but IMO could use some cleanup. This takes a unix timestamp for dob because that was my requirement but could be quickly adapted to use a string: Notice I\'ve used a flat value of 31 in my measureDays function.  All the calculation cares about is that the "day-of-year" be a monotonically increasing measure of the timestamp.If using a javascript timestamp or string, obviously you\'ll want to remove the factor of 1000.To get the age when european date has entered:Alternate solution, because why not:I\'ve checked the examples showed before and they didn\'t worked in all cases, and because of this i made a script of my own. I tested this, and it works perfectly.I think that could be simply like that:Works also with a timestampGet the age (years, months and days) from the date of birth with javascriptFunction calcularEdad (years, months and days)Function esNumeroI used this approach using logic instead of math.\nIt\'s precise and quick.\nThe parameters are the year, month and day of the person\'s birthday.\nIt returns the person\'s age as an integer.Adopting from naveen\'s and original OP\'s posts I ended up with a reusable method stub that accepts both strings and / or JS Date objects.I named it gregorianAge() because this calculation gives exactly how we denote age using Gregorian calendar. i.e. Not counting the end year if month and day is before the month and day of the birth year.Two more options:I\'ve did some updated to one previous answer.I hope that helps :Dhere is a simple way of calculating age: One more possible solution with moment.js:I know this is a very old thread but I wanted to put in this implementation that I wrote for finding the age which I believe is much more accurate. Ofcourse you could adapt this to fit in other formats of getting the parameters. Hope this helps someone looking for a better solution.Here\'s the simplest, most accurate solution I could come up with:And here is a sample that will consider Feb 29 -> Feb 28 a year.It even works with negative age!Yet another solution:With momentjs "fromNow" method, \nThis allows you to work with formatted date, ie: 03/15/1968var dob = document.getElementByID("dob");\nvar age = moment(dob.value).fromNow(true).replace(" years", "");\n//fromNow(true) => suffix "ago" is not displayed\n//but we still have to get rid of "years";\nAs a prototype version}Assuming if a person is born Sep 11 1991, he would not be 1 year old until Sep 12 1992.I have a pretty answer although it\'s not my code. Unfortunately I forgot the original post. see this example you get full year month day information from here If you need the age in months (days are approximation):Calculate age from date picker
