The msdn blog has this to say:\n"After the installation of the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6, users may experience the following dialog box displayed in Microsoft Visual Studio when either creating new Web Site or Windows Azure project or when opening existing projects....."According to the Blog the dialog is benign. just click OK, nothing is effected by the dialog...\nThe comments in the blog suggests that VS 2015 has the same problem, maybe even worse.If ASP.NET 4.0 is not registered with IIS Go toC Drive \n-->>windows\n-->>Microsoft.Net\n-->>Framework\n-->>v4.0.30319 I had this problem on Windows 8.1 which wouldn\'t support the aspnet_regiis -i approach.Instead you need to go to Control Panel, locate the "Turn Windows features on or off" option and drill down as follows:Internet Information Services\n-> World Wide Web Services\n-> Application Development Features\nand check the "ASP.NET 4.5" option. In checking this box, other options such as ".NET Extensibility 4.5" and the ISAPI options will be checked automatically.Apply the changes by clicking OK. Restart your website in IIS and your site should now be accessible.
