So returns a string containing the first occurrence of a number in subjectString.Int32.Parse(resultString) will then give you the number.go through the string and use Char.IsDigitHere\'s how I cleanse phone numbers to get the digits only:use regular expression ...What I use to get Phone Numbers without any punctuation...Here\'s a Linq version:Regex.Split can extract numbers from strings. You get all the numbers that are found in a string.  Output:Number: 4\n  Number: 40\n  Number: 30\n  Number: 10Just use a RegEx to match the string, then convert:Another simple solution using Regex\nYou should need to use this and the code isYou can also try thisThe question doesn\'t explicitly state that you just want the characters 0 to 9 but it wouldn\'t be a stretch to believe that is true from your example set and comments. So here is the code that does that.Why you don\'t want to use Char.IsDigit() - Numbers include characters such as fractions, subscripts, superscripts, Roman numerals, currency numerators, encircled numbers, and script-specific digits.return new String(input.Where(Char.IsDigit).ToArray()); which gives only number from string.Extension method to get all positive numbers contained in a string:If you want negative numbers as well simply modify this code to handle the minus sign (-)Given this input:The resulting numbers list will be:Here is another Linq approach which extracts the first number out of a string.
