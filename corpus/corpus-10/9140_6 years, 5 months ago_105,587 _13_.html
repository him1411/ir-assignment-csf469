For example:but I expected 1.8. How can I get the correct decimal (non-integer) result? Why is it returning 1 at all?It\xe2\x80\x99s doing integer division. You can make one of the numbers a Float by adding .0:It\xe2\x80\x99s doing integer division. You can use to_f to force things into floating-point mode:This also works if your values are variables instead of literals. Converting one value to a float is sufficient to coerce the whole expression to floating point arithmetic.There is also the Numeric#fdiv method which you can use instead:You can check it with irb:You can include the ruby mathn module.This way, you are going to be able to make the division normally.This way, you get exact division (class Rational) until you decide to apply an operation that cannot be expressed as a rational, for example Math.sin.Change the 5 to 5.0. You\'re getting integer division.Fixnum#to_r is not mentioned here, it was introduced since ruby 1.9. It converts Fixnum into rational form. Below are examples of its uses. This also can give exact division as long as all the numbers used are Fixnum. Example where a float operated on a rational number coverts the result to float.
