Maybe this is obvious, but I don\'t know how to declare class properties in Objective-C.I need to cache per-class a dictionary and wonder how put it in the class.properties have a specific meaning in Objective-C, but I think you mean something that\'s equivalent to a static variable? E.g. only one instance for all types of Foo?To declare class functions in Objective-C you use the + prefix instead of - so your implementation would look something like:I\'m using this solution:And i found it extremely useful as a replacement of Singleton pattern.To use it, simply access your data with dot notation:If you\'re looking for the class-level equivalent of @property, then the answer is "there\'s no such thing". But remember, @property is only syntactic sugar, anyway; it just creates appropriately-named object methods.You want to create class methods that access static variables which, as others have said, have only a slightly different syntax.As seen in WWDC 2016/XCode 8 (what\'s new in LLVM session @5:05).  Class properties  can be declared as followsNote that class properties are never synthesizedHere\'s a thread safe way of doing it:These edits ensure that fooDict is only created once.From Apple documentation: "dispatch_once - Executes a block object once and only once for the lifetime of an application." Properties have values only in objects, not classes.If you need to store something for all objects of a class, you have to use a global variable. You can hide it by declaring it static in the implementation file.You may also consider using specific relations between your objects: you attribute a role of master to a specific object of your class and link others objects to this master. The master will hold the dictionary as a simple property. I think of a tree like the one used for the view hierarchy in Cocoa applications.Another option is to create an object of a dedicated class that is composed of both your \'class\' dictionary and a set of all the objects related to this dictionary. This is something like NSAutoreleasePool in Cocoa.As of Xcode 8 Objective-C now supports class properties:Since class properties are never synthesised you need to write your own implementation.You access the class properties using normal dot syntax on the class name:If you have many class level properties then a singleton pattern might be in order.\nSomething like this:AndNow access your class-level properties like this:[Try this solution it\'s simple] You can create a static variable in a Swift class then call it from any Objective-C class.
