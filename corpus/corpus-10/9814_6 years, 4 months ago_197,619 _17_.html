Is it possible to set drop shadow for an svg element using css3 , something likeI saw some remarks on creating shadow using filter effects. Is there an example of using css alone. Below is a working code where the cusor style is correctly applied, but no shadow effect. Please help me to get the shadow effect with least bit of code.Here\'s an example of applying dropshadow to some svg using the \'filter\' property. If you want to control the opacity of the dropshadow have a look at this example. The slope attribute controls how much opacity to give to the dropshadow.Relevant bits from the example:Box-shadow is defined to work on CSS boxes (read: rectangles), while svg is a bit more expressive than just rectangles. Read the SVG Primer to learn a bit more about what you can do with SVG filters.Use the new CSS filter property.Supported by webkit browsers, Firefox 34+ and Edge.You can use this polyfill that will support FF < 34, IE6+.You would use it like so:And your html would be:This approach differs from the box-shadow effect in that it accounts for opacity and does not apply the drop shadow effect to the box but rather to the corners of the svg element itself.You can see a live example here.Please Note: This approach only works when the class is placed on the <svg> element alone. You can NOT use this on an inline svg element such as <rect>.Read more about css filters on html5rocks.So, as was mentioned in the buried comments of the accepted answer by Lorenzo Polidori, the easiest option that works for me in Chrome (and I\'m sure other Webkit browsers) is:I\'m not aware of a CSS-only solution. As you mentioned, filters are the canonical approach to creating drop shadow effects in SVG. The SVG specification includes an example of this: http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/filters.html#AnExample
