Is there any way to detect HTTP or HTTPS and then force usage of HTTPS with JavaScript?I have some codes for detecting the HTTP or HTTPS but I can\'t force it to use https: .I\'m using the window.location.protocol property to set whatever the site is to https: then refresh the page to hopefully reload a new https\'ed URL loaded into the browser.Try thisIt is not good idea because you just temporary redirect user to https and browser doesn\'t save this redirect.You describe task for web-server (apache, nginx etc) http 301, http 302 How about this?Ideally you\'d do it on the server side, though.Setting location.protocol navigates to a new URL:Firefox 49 has a bug where https works but https: does not (NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED). Said to be fixed in Firefox 54.Not a Javascript way to answer this but if you use CloudFlare you can write page rules that redirect the user much faster to HTTPS and it\'s free. Looks like this in CloudFlare\'s Page Rules:Hi i used this solution works perfectly.No Need to check, just use https.greets BrAiNeeI have just had all the script variations tested by Pui Cdm,  included answers above and many others using php, htaccess, server configuration, and Javascript, the results are that the script provided by vivek-srivastava\nworks best and you can add further security in java script.
