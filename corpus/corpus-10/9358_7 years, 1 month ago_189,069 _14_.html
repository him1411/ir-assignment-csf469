I\'m utilizing the magic of jQuery.ajax( settings ).However, I\'m wondering if anyone has played with the timeout setting much?I know it\'s basically for dictating the local time for a request, but can it trigger anything if the timeout is reached?  Or does it simply stop listening for a response?Reading the jQuery site, I can see there are no arguments passed, so it seems like a simple setting with one capability.  Which is fine.  But, I\'d like to trigger an alert or some function if the timeout is reached. I can see that the error setting doesn\'t get triggered, in this case.Here\'s my snippet:Does anyone know how to work more with timeout?If your error event handler takes the three arguments (xmlhttprequest, textstatus, and message) when a timeout happens, the status arg will be \'timeout\'. Per the jQuery documentation:Possible values for the second\n  argument (besides null) are "timeout",\n  "error", "notmodified" and\n  "parsererror".You can handle your error accordingly then. I created this fiddle that demonstrates this.With jsFiddle, you can test ajax calls -- it will wait 2 seconds before responding.  I put the timeout setting at 1 second, so it should error out and pass back a textstatus of \'timeout\' to the error handler.Hope this helps!
