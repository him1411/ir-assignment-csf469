I need a way to export a stashed change to another computer.On Computer1 I didI\'m trying to get the stash patch to a file and then import it to another computerThis command gives me a file that I can move to another computer where this repo is cloned, but the question is how to import it as a stash again.ThanksYou can apply a patch file (without committing the changes yet) by simply runningThen you can simply create a new stash from the current working directory:alternatively you can create a branch from your stash (on computer 1), usingcommit your changes:then add it as a remote on computer 2:now you can retrieve the remote information usingnow you can import the commit in the way you want; using git cherry-pick, git rebase or whatever you like...\nIf you want it to look like you just did git stash apply; you can use git cherry-pick --no-commit.If you have no direct connection between computer1 and computer2; you can use a remote (like github or something similar):and on computer2:Alternatively you can export the entire local stashes to another compter as followsAnother option is to rsync the .git folder from one computer to another computer.  rsync processes only file changes (faster than a copy).One downside to this approach is the configs would also be overwritten, which may not be desired if you run different .git configs between the two machines.  But you could overcome this by excluding files with the --exclude option in rsync.Overall I think a native Git solution is cleaner, but this rsync hack could be nice for someone in a hurry who might be more familiar with rsync than git.
