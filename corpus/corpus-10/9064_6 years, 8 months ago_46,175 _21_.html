I am writing my first razor page today, can\'t figure out how to enter #if debug #else #endifHow can i enter preprocessor in razor?DOES NOT WORK: See Shawn\'s answer below.Hope this help.Sorry!\nThis code always DEBUG.I was wrong. and recommended model approach. if in use only Web, reference HttpContext.Current.IsDebuggingEnabled property.I just created an extension method:Then used it in my views like so:Since the helper is compiled with the DEBUG/RELEASE symbol, it works.This is built in to HttpContext:IMO, this makes more sense than conditional compilation for views and comes in handy for some testing scenarios. (See Code Chief\'s comment below.)C# and ASP.NET MVC: Using #if directive in a viewActually that answer has the right answer. You\'re going to have to pass whether or not you\'re in debug mode via the Model. (or ViewBag) since all views are compiled in debug mode.I know this is not a direct answer to the question but as I\'m pretty sure debug configuration is corollary to the fact that you are actually executing locally, you can always use the Request.IsLocal property as a debug like test. Thus : By default MVC views are not compiled so #IF DEBUG can\'t work in a view.  If you want to compile view in order to access IF DEBUG config,  you need to : change the following attribute from false to truereload your project and then views are going to be compiled.The only other work around would be to have a function in your code behindand then call it from view :
