I tried to import a large sql file through phpMyAdmin...But it kept showing error \'MySql server has gone away\'What to do?As stated here:Two most common reasons (and fixes) for the MySQL server has gone away\n  (error 2006) are:Server timed out and closed the connection. How to fix: check that wait_timeout variable in your mysqld\xe2\x80\x99s my.cnf configuration file is large enough. On Debian: sudo nano\n  /etc/mysql/my.cnf, set wait_timeout = 600 seconds (you can\n  tweak/decrease this value when error 2006 is gone), then sudo\n  /etc/init.d/mysql restart. I didn\'t check, but the default value for\n  wait_timeout might be around 28800 seconds (8 hours).Server dropped an incorrect or too large packet. If mysqld gets a packet that is too large or incorrect, it assumes that something has\n  gone wrong with the client and closes the connection. You can increase\n  the maximal packet size limit by increasing the value of\n  max_allowed_packet in my.cnf file. On Debian: sudo nano\n  /etc/mysql/my.cnf, set max_allowed_packet = 64M (you can\n  tweak/decrease this value when error 2006 is gone), then sudo\n  /etc/init.d/mysql restart.For me this solution didn\'t work out so I executedin my SQL client.If not able to change this with MYSql service running, you should stop the service and change the variable in "my.ini" file.For example: If you are running with default values then you have a lot of room to optimize your mysql configuration.The first step I recommend is to increase the max_allowed_packet to 128M.Then download the MySQL Tuning Primer script and run it. It will provide recommendations to several facets of your config for better performance.Also look into adjusting your timeout values both in MySQL and PHP.How big (file size) is the file you are importing and are you able to import the file using the mysql command line client instead of PHPMyAdmin?If you are using MAMP on OS X, you will need to change the max_allowed_packet value in the template for MySQL.You can find it at: File > Edit template > MySQL my.cnfThen just search for max_allowed_packet, change the value and\nsave.Hope this helps someone.If you are working on XAMPP then you can fix the MySQL Server has gone away issue with following changes..open your my.ini file\nmy.ini location is (D:\\xampp\\mysql\\bin\\my.ini)change the following variable values The other reason this can happen is running out of memory.  Check /var/log/messages and make sure that your my.cnf is not set up to cause mysqld to allocate more memory than your machine has.Your mysqld process can actually be killed by the kernel and then re-started by the "safe_mysqld" process without you realizing it.Use top and watch the memory allocation while it\'s running to see what your headroom is.make a backup of my.cnf before changing it.I had this error and other related ones, when I imported at 16 GB SQL file. For me, editing my.ini and setting the following (based on several different posts) in the [mysqld] section:If you are running under Windows, go to the control panel, services, and look at the details for MySQL and you will see where my.ini is. Then after you edit and save my.ini, restart the mysql service (or restart the computer).If you are using HeidiSQL, you can also set some or all of these using that.I solved my issue with this short /etc/mysql/my.cnf file : If your data includes BLOB data:Note that an import of data from the command line seems to choke on BLOB data, resulting in the \'MySQL server has gone away\' error.To avoid this, re-create the mysqldump but with the --hex-blob flag:http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysqldump.html#option_mysqldump_hex-blobwhich will write out the data file with hex values rather than binary amongst other text.PhpMyAdmin also has the option "Dump binary columns in hexadecimal notation (for example, "abc" becomes 0x616263)" which works nicely.Note that there is a long-standing bug (as of December 2015) which means that GEOM columns are not converted:\nBack up a table with a GEOMETRY column using mysqldump?\nso using a program like PhpMyAdmin seems to be the only workaround (the option noted above does correctly convert GEOM columns).I updated "max_allowed_packet" to 1024M, but it still wasn\'t working. It turns out my deployment script was running: Be sure to explicitly specify a bigger number from the command line if you are donig it this way.If it takes a long time to fail, then enlarge the wait_timeout variable. If it fails right away, enlarge the max_allowed_packet variable; it it still doesn\'t work, make sure the command is valid SQL. Mine had unescaped quotes which screwed everything up.Also, if feasible, consider limiting the number of inserts of a single SQL command to, say, 1000. You can create a script that creates multiple statements out of a single one by reintroducing the INSERT... part every n inserts.i got a similar error.. to solve this just open my.ini file..here at line no 36 change the value of maximum allowed packet size ie. max_allowed_packet = 20MI had similar error today when duplicating database (MySQL server has gone away...), but when I tried to restart mysql.server restart I got errorThis is how I solved it:\nI opened up Applications/Utilities/ and ran Activity Monitorthen was able to solve the error problem withI am doing some large calculations which involves the mysql connection to stay long time and with heavy data. i was facing this "Mysql go away issue". So i tried t optimize the queries but that doen\'t helped me then i increased the mysql variables limit which is set to a lower value by default. wait_timeout\nmax_allowed_packetTo the limit what ever suits to you it should be the Any Number * 1024(Bytes). you can login to terminal using \'mysql -u username - p\' command and can check and change for these variable limits.
