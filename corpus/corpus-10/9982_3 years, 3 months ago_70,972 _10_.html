In my previous projects, I can find the .pch file under Supporting Files. But now in Xcode 6, I couldn\'t find any .pch file. Any steps should I do to produce this file?Add the pch file which is under Others in File-New...and don\'t forget to add it to your LLVM6.0 - Language section of Build Settings as Project/whateveryounamedyourpchfile.pchRob Napier\'s answer at Why isn't ProjectName-Prefix.pch created automatically in Xcode 6? is worth reading. He points out that a PCH file is probably not a good idea, and suggests explicitly including .h files into modules that need them.I\'ve found out that with Xcode 6. You need to manually create the PCH File.File -> New -> File -> iOS -> C and C++ -> PCH File.There is a minor error in the answer provided above.Please note that in the build setting under prefix.header you just need to type your .pch file name \xe2\x80\x93    In my case issue was getting ,no input file errorI fixed by Removing .pch file from project and adding again this work for me.hope this help someone.
