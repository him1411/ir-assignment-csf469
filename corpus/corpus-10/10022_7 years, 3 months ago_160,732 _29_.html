Thisproduces as outputinstead ofWhat should I do to have a newline in a string?Note: This question is not about echo.\nI\'m aware of echo -e, but I\'m looking for a solution that allows passing a string (which includes a newline) as an argument to other commands that do not have a similar option to interpret \\n\'s as newlines.The solution is to use $\'string\', for example:Here is an excerpt from the Bash manual page:Echo is so nineties and so fraught with perils that its use should result in core dumps no less than 4GB. Seriously, echo\'s problems were the reason why the Unix Standardization process finally invented the printf utility, doing away with all the problems.So to get a newline in a string:There! No SYSV vs BSD echo madness, everything gets neatly printed and fully portable support for C escape sequences. Everybody please use printf now and never look back.What I did based on the other answers wasThe problem isn\'t with the shell.  The problem is actually with the echo command itself, and the lack of double quotes around the variable interpolation.  You can try using echo -e but that isn\'t supported on all platforms, and one of the reasons printf is now recommended for portability.You can also try and insert the newline directly into your shell script (if a script is what you\'re writing) so it looks like...or equivalentlyThe only simple alternative is to actually type a new line in the variable:Yes, that means writing Enter where needed in the code.There are several equivalents to a new line character. But all those require "an interpretation" by some tool (POSIX printf):And therefore, the tool is required to build a string with a new-line:In some shells, the sequence $\' is an special shell expansion. \nKnown to work in ksh93, bash and zsh:Of course, more complex solutions are also possible:Or  I find the -e flag elegant and straight forwardSTR="Hello\\nWorld"\necho -e $STR\n#outputs\nHello\nWorldIf the string is the output of another command, I just use quotesindexes_diff=$(git diff index.yaml)\necho "$indexes_diff"I\'m no bash expert, but this one worked for me:I found this easier to formatting the texts.A $ right before single quotation marks \'...\\n...\' as follows, however double quotation marks doesn\'t work.
