I\'ve been studying OpenCV tutorials and came across the assert function; what does it do?assert will terminate the program (usually with a message quoting the assert statement) if its argument turns out to be false. it\'s commonly used during debugging to make the program fail more obviously if an unexpected condition occurs.for example:You can also add a more informative message to be displayed if it fails like so:Or else like this:When you\'re doing a release (non-debug) build, you can also remove the overhead of evaluating assert statements by defining the NDEBUG macro, usually with a compiler switch. The corollary of this is that your program should never rely on the assert macro running.The assert computer statement is analogous to the statement make sure in English.Take a look atassert() example program in C++Many compilers offer an assert()\n  macro. The assert() macro returns TRUE\n  if its parameter evaluates TRUE and\n  takes some kind of action if it\n  evaluates FALSE. Many compilers will\n  abort the program on an assert() that\n  fails; others will throw an exceptionOne powerful feature of the assert()\n  macro is that the preprocessor\n  collapses it into no code at all if\n  DEBUG is not defined. It is a great\n  help during development, and when the\n  final product ships there is no\n  performance penalty nor increase in\n  the size of the executable version of\n  the program.EgThe assert() can diagnose program bugs. It is defined in ASSERT.H, and its prototype isvoid assert(int expression);\nThe argument expression can be anything you want to test--a variable or any C expression. If expression evaluates to TRUE, assert() does nothing. If expression evaluates to FALSE, assert() displays an error message on stderr and aborts program execution.How do you use assert()? It is most frequently used to track down program bugs (which are distinct from compilation errors). A bug doesn\'t prevent a program from compiling, but it causes it to give incorrect results or to run improperly (locking up, for example). For instance, a financial-analysis program you\'re writing might occasionally give incorrect answers. You suspect that the problem is caused by the variable interest_rate taking on a negative value, which should never happen. To check this, place the statementassert(interest_rate >= 0);\nat locations in the program where interest_rate is used. If the variable ever does become negative, the assert() macro alerts you. You can then examine the relevant code to locate the cause of the problem.To see how assert() works, run the sample program below. If you enter a nonzero value, the program displays the value and terminates normally. If you enter zero, the assert() macro forces abnormal program termination. The exact error message you see will depend on your compiler, but here\'s a typical example:Assertion failed: x, file list19_3.c, line 13\nNote that, in order for assert() to work, your program must be compiled in debug mode. Refer to your compiler documentation for information on enabling debug mode (as explained in a moment). When you later compile the final version in release mode, the assert() macros are disabled.Enter an integer value: 10You entered 10.Enter an integer value: -1Error Message:\nAbnormal program terminationYour error message might differ, depending on your system and compiler, but the general idea is the same.stuff like \'raises exception\' and \'halts execution\' might be true for most compilers, but not for all. (btw are there assert statements that really thrwo exceptions?)Here\'s an interesting, slightly different meaning of assert used by c6x and other TI compilers: upon seeing certain assert statements, these compilers use the information in that statement to perform certain optimizations. Wicked.Example in C:This tells de compiler the arrays are aligned on 32bits boundaries, so the compiler can generate specific instructions made for that kind of alignment.Assert allows you to halt execution if a condition (assertion) is false.For instance (Pseudocode):If myBank is NULL, the function will stop execution, and an error produced. This is very good for making certain reusable code accept correct conditions, etc.It is a function that will halt program execution if the value it has evaluated is false. Usually it is surrounded by a macro so that it is not compiled into the resultant binary when compiled with release settings. It is designed to be used for testing the assumptions you have made. For example:The ideal you want is that you can make an error in your program, like calling a function with invalid arguments, and you hit an assert before it segfaults (or fails to work as expected)C++11 N3337 standard drafthttp://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3337.pdf19.3 Assertions1 The header , described in (Table 42), provides a macro for documenting C ++ program assertions\n  and a mechanism for disabling the assertion checks.2 The contents are the same as the Standard C library header .C99 N1256 standard drafthttp://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n1256.pdf7.2 Diagnostics 1 The header <assert.h> defines the assert macro and refers to another macro, NDEBUG which is not defined by <assert.h>. If NDEBUG is defined as a macro name at the\n  point in the source file where  is included, the assert macro is defined\n  simply asThe assert macro is redefined according to the current state of NDEBUG each time that\n  <assert.h> is included.2.\n  The assert macro shall be implemented as a macro, not as an actual function.
