I guess I\'m not clear on how to do "and" tests.  I wanted to make sure an argument existed which was working well with [ -e $VAR ] but turns out that was also evaluating as true on empty string; which I do not want.How do I \'and\' them together?  Or is there another unary test that accomplishes what I want?From the bash manpage:[[ expression ]] - return  a status of 0 or 1 depending on the evaluation of the conditional expression expression.And, for expressions, one of the options is:expression1 && expression2 - true if both expression1 and expression2 are true.So you can and them together as follows (-n is the opposite of -z so we can get rid of the !):However, I don\'t think it\'s needed in this case, -e xyzzy is true if the xyzzy file exists and can quite easily handle empty strings. If that\'s what you want then you don\'t actually need the -z non-empty check:In other words, just use:Â Simply quote your variable:This evaluates to [ -e "" ] if $VAR is empty.Your version does not work because it evaluates to [ -e ]. Now in this case, bash simply checks if the single argument (-e) is a non-empty string.From the manpage:test and [ evaluate conditional expressions using a set of rules based on the number of arguments. ...1 argument The expression is true if and only if the argument is not null. (Also, this solution has the additional benefit of working with filenames containing spaces)I found an answer now, thanks for your suggestions!any comments on that? It seems inefficient to grep twice, but it works...
