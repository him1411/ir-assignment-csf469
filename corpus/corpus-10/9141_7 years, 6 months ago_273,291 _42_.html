I have a update view, where I need to preselect the value stored in database for a Spinner.I was having in mind something like this, but the Adapter has no indexOf method, so I am stuck.Suppose your Spinner is named mSpinner, and it contains as one of its choices: "some value".To find and compare the position of "some value" in the Spinner use this:A simple way to set spinner based on value isWay to complex code are already there, this is just much plainer. I keep a separate ArrayList of all the items in my Spinners.  This way I can do indexOf on the ArrayList and then use that value to set the selection in the Spinner.Based on Merrill\'s answer, I came up with this single line solution... it\'s not very pretty, but you can blame whoever maintains the code for Spinner for neglecting to include a function that does this for that.You\'ll get a warning about how the cast to a ArrayAdapter<String> is unchecked... really, you could just use an ArrayAdapter as Merrill did, but that just exchanges one warning for another.Based on Merrill\'s answer\nhere is how to do with a CursorAdapterIf you need to have an indexOf method on any old Adapter (and you don\'t know the underlying implementation) then you can use this:You can use this also,if you are using string array this is the best way:    Use following line to select using value:Here is how to do it if you are using a SimpleCursorAdapter (where columnName is the name of the db column that you used to populate your spinner):(Maybe you will also need to close the cursor, depending on whether you are using a loader.)Also (a refinement of Akhil\'s answer) this is the corresponding way to do it if you are filling your Spinner from an array:This is my simple method to get the index by string.There is actually a way to get this using an index search on the AdapterArray and all this can be done with reflection.  I even went one step further as I had 10 Spinners and wanted to set them dynamically from my database and the database holds the value only not the text as the Spinner actually changes week to week so the value is my id number from the database.Here is the indexed search you can use on almost any list as long as the fields are on top level of object.Cast method which can be create for all primitives  here is one for string and int.here is my solutionand getItemIndexById belowHope this help!I am using a custom adapter, for that this code is enough:So, your code snippet will be like this:To make the application remember the last selected spinner values, you can use below code:Below code reads the spinner value and sets the spinner position accordingly.    And put below code where you know latest spinner values are present, or somewhere else as required.\nThis piece of code basically writes the spinner value in SharedPreferences.I had the same issue when trying to select the correct item in a spinner populated using a cursorLoader. I retrieved the id of the item I wanted to select first from table 1 and then used a CursorLoader to populate the spinner. In the onLoadFinished I cycled through the cursor populating the spinner\'s adapter until I found the item that matched the id I already had. Then assigned the row number of the cursor to the spinner\'s selected position. It would be nice to have a similar function to pass in the id of the value you wish to select in the spinner when populating details on a form containing saved spinner results. As some of the previous answers are very right, I just want to make sure from none of you fall in such this problem.If you set the values to the ArrayList using String.format, you MUST get the position of the value using the same string structure String.format.An example:You must get the position of needed value like this:Otherwise, you\'ll get the -1, item not found!I used Locale.getDefault() because of Arabic language.I hope that will be helpful for you.Here is my hopefully complete solution. I have following enum:used in following classCode to set the spinner by HTTPMethod enum-member:Where R.id.spinnerHttpmethod is defined in a layout-file, and android.R.layout.simple_spinner_item is delivered by android-studio.you have to pass your custom adapter with position like REPEAT[position]. and it works properly.
