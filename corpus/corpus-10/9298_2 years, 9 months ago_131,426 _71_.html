Can anyone tell me how to round a double value to x number of decimal places in Swift?I have: With totalWorkTime being an NSTimeInterval (double) in second.totalWorkTimeInHours will give me the hours, but it gives me the amount of time in such a long precise number e.g. 1.543240952039......How do I round this down to, say, 1.543 when I print totalWorkTimeInHours?You can use Swift\'s round function to accomplish this.To round a Double with 3 digits precision, first multiply it by 1000, round it and divide the rounded result by 1000:Other than any kind of printf(...) or String(format: ...) solutions, the result of this operation is still of type Double.EDIT:\nRegarding the comments that it sometimes does not work, please read this: What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point ArithmeticA more general solution is the following extension, which works with Swift 2 & iOS 9:In Swift 3 round is replaced by rounded:\nExample which returns Double rounded to 4 decimal places:Use the String constructor which takes a format string:In Swift 2.0 and Xcode 7.2:Example:With Swift 3, according to your needs, you can choose one of the eight following styles in order to have a rounded result from a Double.In the simplest case, you may use the Double round() method.Usage:Usage:Foundation offers a round function via Darwin.Usage:If you want to repeat the previous operation many times, refactoring your code can be a good idea.Usage:If needed, NSDecimalNumber offers a verbose but powerful solution for rounding decimal numbers.Usage:If you want to return a NSString from your rounding operation, using NSString initializer is a simple but efficient solution.Usage:Swift\xe2\x80\x99s String type is bridged with Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s NSString class (you can learn more about it by reading The Swift Programming Language). Therefore, you can use the following code in order to return a String from your rounding operation:Usage:If you accept to get a String? from your rounding operation, NumberFormatter offers a highly customizable solution.Usage:Building on Yogi\'s answer, here\'s a Swift function that does the job:In Swift 3.0 and Xcode 8.0: Use this extension like this,A handy way can be the use of extension of type DoubleUsage:I would useand change .3f to any number of decimal numbers you needThis is a sort of a long workaround, which may come in handy if your needs are a little more complex. You can use a number formatter in Swift.Suppose your variable you want to print is This will make sure it is returned in the desired format:The result here will thus be "3.6" (rounded). While this is not the most economic solution, I give it because the OP mentioned printing (in which case a String is not undesirable), and because this class allows for multiple parameters to be set.Use the built in Foundation Darwin librarySWIFT 3Usage:Outputs: 12.988Not Swift but I\'m sure you get the idea.The best way to format a double property is to use the Apple predefined methods. FloatingPointRoundingRule is a enum which has following possibilitiesEnumeration Cases: case awayFromZero\nRound to the closest allowed value whose magnitude is greater than or equal to that of the source.case down\nRound to the closest allowed value that is less than or equal to the source.case toNearestOrAwayFromZero\nRound to the closest allowed value; if two values are equally close, the one with greater magnitude is chosen.case toNearestOrEven\nRound to the closest allowed value; if two values are equally close, the even one is chosen.case towardZero\nRound to the closest allowed value whose magnitude is less than or equal to that of the source.case up\nRound to the closest allowed value that is greater than or equal to the source.round a double value to x number of decimal \nNO. of digits after decimalvar x = 1.5657676754\nvar y = (x*10000).rounded()/10000\nprint(y)  // 1.5658 var x = 1.5657676754 \nvar y = (x*100).rounded()/100\nprint(y)  // 1.57 var x = 1.5657676754\nvar y = (x*10).rounded()/10\nprint(y)  // 1.6This is more flexible algorithm of rounding to N significant digitsSwift 3 solution I found this wondering if it is possible to correct a user\'s input. That is if they enter three decimals instead of two for a dollar amount.  Say 1.111 instead of 1.11 can you fix it by rounding?  The answer for many reasons is no!  With money anything over i.e. 0.001 would eventually cause problems in a real checkbook.Here is a function to check the users input for too many values after the period. But which will allow 1., 1.1 and 1.11. It is assumed that the value has already been checked for successful conversion from a String to a Double.Problem Statement:I needed 0.03Solution:
