I\'m trying to install libv8 3.16.14.3 but getting an error on OSX Mavericks using latest stable rvm and ruby-1.9.3-p125.This is the output of running the command \'gem install libv8\':This is due to the fact that OS X 10.9+ is using version 4.8 of GCC. This is not supported officially in older versions of libv8 as mentioned in the pull request (https://github.com/cowboyd/libv8/pull/95). Please try bumping up the version of libv8 in your Gemfile (or) a bundle update should suffice. Hope this helps.From the libv8 READMEBring your own V8Because libv8 is the interface for the V8 engine used by therubyracer, you may need to use libv8, even if you have V8 installed already. If you wish to use your own V8 installation, rather than have it built for you, use the --with-system-v8 option.Using RubyGems:gem install libv8 [-v YOUR_VERSION] -- --with-system-v8Using Bundler (in your Gemfile):bundle config build.libv8 --with-system-v8Please note that if you intend to run your own V8, you must install both V8 and its headers (found in libv8-dev for Debian distros).Bring your own compilerYou can specify a compiler of your choice by either setting the CXX environment variable before compilation, or by adding the --with-cxx= option to the bundle configuration:bundle config build.libv8 --with-cxx=clang++Edit:If this issue is brought on by therubyracer, try the following as suggested by rider_on_rails here:gem uninstall libv8gem install therubyracer -v YOUR_RUBY_RACER_VERSIONgem install libv8 -v YOUR_VERSION -- --with-system-v8You can actually install that version on Mavericks:I can confirm this works with rbenv and ruby 1.9.3p448El Capitan Solution for me:Where REQUIRED_LIBV8_VERSION for me was 3.16.14.7, but you need to check which is the one you need in your bundle (this was the one for rails 4.2.5)You may also need to run the commands above as the superuser (if your gems and system libraries are global)When I tried the accepted answer, libv8 would install successfully with gem install libv8, but bundle install would fail on libv8. I think that bundle install was trying to install a different version of libv8. I was able to find a solution that worked for me.I needed libv8 because therubyracer depends on it. To get it to install, I noted the version that was failing to install in the gem_make.out log for therubyracer. (The path for the gem_make.out log will be in the failure message.) In my case it was 3.16.14.7. (This version will probably change over time, in case you\'re reading this three years from now.) Then I did this:gem install libv8 -v 3.16.14.7 -- --with-v8-lib <-- note different flag from accepted answerwhich allowed this to work:gem install therubyracerwhich allowed me to complete my bundle install.This worked for me on OSX Yosemite.https://github.com/cowboyd/therubyracer/issues/339jasonlynes\'s solution found on that link made the trick for me. anything else didn\'t work.Try with what I summarized in this question: "gem install therubyracer -v '0.10.2'" on osx mavericks not installingIt worked for me (OS X Mavericks)I had this same problem when I upgraded from OSX Mountain Lion to OSX Mavericks.\nThe accepted answer worked for libv8, but not when I went to bundle install therubyracer gem.Upgrading from ruby-1.8.7-p354 to ruby-1.8.7-375 did the trick for me.\nlibv8 (3.16.14.3-x86_64-darwin-13) and the therubyracer (0.12.0) gems installed without problem.assuming you use rbenv:This worked fine for me: Try installing this pre-compiled gem: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7919548/gems/libv8/libv8-3.11.8.17-x86_64-darwin-13.gem \n  (sha1:5ce07aaf4085fff5a5e10fe018fd6b22021bef3b)Or if you prefer to build your own:Source: https://github.com/cowboyd/libv8/issues/107Thanks to Felix B\xc3\xbcnemann for the fix!You can try manually compiling and installing the gem via the method mentioned on the libv8 github site.In MAC-Yosemite with RVM environment and ruby-2.1.1 versiongem install libv8 -v 3.16.14.3 -- --with-v8-lib\ngem install therubyracerIt works with the help of above command, can confirm this.What really worked for me was upgrading ruby to 2.2.0, removing Gemfile.lock and bundling over again.Worked like a charm!This is what worked for me.replace 3.16.14.7 with your version.I have faced a similar problem on El Cap. Here\'s what I did.And then,Finally,I tried a number of solutions outlined in previous answers, but found that running bundle (to install other, missing gems) would attempt to re-compile libv8 (despite having already installed it successfully using --with-system-v8) and thus suffer from the same issue.Eventually, I found that removing the libv8 gem, fetching the gem file from rubygems, and then manually installing the .gem file with the --with-system-v8 flag worked for me.i.e.Thanks to \nGaurav Agarwal\'s answer for leading me down the right path!I was using a beta version of Xcode for another project and had forgotten. Switch back with xcode-select. Something like:Remove from Gemfile:gem \'therubyracer\', :platforms => :ruby
