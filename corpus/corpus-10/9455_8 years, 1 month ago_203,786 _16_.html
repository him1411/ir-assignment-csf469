it does an OPTIONS request to that URL, and then the callback is never called with anything. When it isn\'t cross domain, it works fine.Shouldn\'t jQuery just make the call with a <script> node and then do the callback when its loaded? I understand that I won\'t be able to get the result (since it is cross domain), but that\'s OK; I just want the call to go through. Is this a bug, or am I doing something wrong?According to MDN,Preflighted requestsUnlike simple requests (discussed above), "preflighted" requests first\n  send an HTTP OPTIONS request header to the resource on the other\n  domain, in order to determine whether the actual request is safe to\n  send.  Cross-site requests are preflighted like this since they may\n  have implications to user data.  In particular, a request is\n  preflighted if:The OPTIONS is from http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/ See http://metajack.im/2010/01/19/crossdomain-ajax-for-xmpp-http-binding-made-easy/ for a bit more infoI don\'t believe jQuery will just naturally do a JSONP request when given a URL like that.  It will, however, do a JSONP request when you tell it what argument to use for a callback:It\'s entirely up to the receiving script to make use of that argument (which doesn\'t have to be called "jsoncallback"), so in this case the function will never be called.  But, since you stated you just want the script at metaward.com to execute, that would make it.It\'s looking like Firefox and Opera (tested on mac as well) don\'t like the cross domainness of this (but Safari is fine with it). You might have to call a local server side code to curl the remote page. In fact, cross-domain AJAX (XMLHttp) requests are not allowed because of security reasons (think about fetching a "restricted" webpage from the client-side and sending it back to the server \xe2\x80\x93 this would be a security issue).The only workaround are callbacks. This is: creating a new script object and pointing the src to the end-side JavaScript, which is a callback with JSON values (myFunction({data}), myFunction is a function which does something with the data (for example, storing it in a variable).If you\'re trying to POSTMake sure to JSON.stringify your form data and send as text/plain.Just change the "application/json" to "text/plain" and do not forget the JSON.stringify(request):
