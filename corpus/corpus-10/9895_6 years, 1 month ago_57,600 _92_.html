I\'m just wondering why we usually use logical OR || between two booleans not bitwise OR |, though they are both working well.I mean, look at the following:Can we use | instead of ||? Same thing with & and &&.If you use the || and && forms, rather than the | and & forms of these operators, Java will not bother to evaluate the right-hand operand alone.It\'s a matter of if you want to short-circuit the evaluation or not -- most of the time you want to.A good way to illustrate the benefits of short-circuiting would be to consider the following example.Another benefit, as Jeremy and Peter mentioned, for short-circuiting is the null reference check: more info| does not do short-circuit evaluation in boolean expressions. || will stop evaluating if the first operand is true, but | won\'t.In addition, | can be used to perform the bitwise-OR operation on byte/short/int/long values. || cannot.So just to build on the other answers with an example, short-circuiting is crucial in the following defensive checks:Using | and & instead could result in a NullPointerException being thrown here.Logical || and && check the right hand side only if necessary. The | and & check both all the time.For example:Rewrite it:Another example:Rewrite it:Also notice a common pitfall: The non lazy operators have precedence over the lazy ones, so:Be careful when mixing them.In addition to short-circuiting, another thing to keep in mind is that doing a bitwise logic operation on values that can be other than 0 or 1 has a very different meaning than conditional logic.  While it USUALLY is the same for | and ||, with & and && you get very different results (e.g. 2 & 4 is 0/false while 2 && 4 is 1/true).If the thing you\'re getting from a function is actually an error code and you\'re testing for non-0-ness, this can matter quite a lot.This isn\'t as much of an issue in Java where you have to explicitly typecast to boolean or compare with 0 or the like, but in other languages with similar syntax (C/C++ et al) it can be quite confusing.Also, note that & and | can only apply to integer-type values, and not everything that can be equivalent to a boolean test.  Again, in non-Java languages, there are quite a few things that can be used as a boolean with an implicit != 0 comparison (pointers, floats, objects with an operator bool(), etc.) and bitwise operators are almost always nonsensical in those contexts.The only time you would use | or & instead of || or && is when you have very simple boolean expressions and the cost of short cutting (i.e. a branch) is greater than the time you save by not evaluating the later expressions.However, this is a micro-optimisation which rarely matters except in the most low level code.|| is the logical or operator while | is the bitwise or operator.In Addition to the fact that | is a bitwise-operator: || is a short-circuit operator - when one element is false, it will not check the others.if something is TRUE, || will not evaluate someotherthing, while | will do. If the variables in your if-statements are actually function calls, using || is possibly saving a lot of performance.a | b: evaluate b in any casea || b: evaluate b only if a evaluates to falseThe Java || and && operators only evaluate the right hand side of the boolean expression if they need to. This is known as a lazy evaluation. The equivalent code for the || operator isThis takes a lot less time to evaluate certain expressions. However, sometimes you may want to use the | operator:Because the right-hand side of the expression has a side-effect, we want it to be evaluated no matter what. This is a quite bad practice though. The operators || and && are called conditional operators, while | and & are called bitwise operators. They serve different purposes.Conditional operators works only with expressions that statically evaluate to boolean on both left- and right-hand sides.Bitwise operators works with any numeric operands.If you want to perform a logical comparison, you should use conditional operators, since you will add some kind of type safety to your code.A side note: Java has |= but not an ||=An example of when you must use || is when the first expression is a test to see if the second expression would blow up. e.g. Using a single | in hte following case could result in an NPE.|| returns a boolean value by OR\'ing two values (Thats why its known as a LOGICAL or)IE:Would return true if either A or B is true, or false if they are both false.| is an operator that performs a bitwise operation on two values. To better understand bitwise operations, you can read here:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operationOne main difference is that || and && exhibit "short-circuiting", so the RHS will only be evaluated if needed. For e.g. Above if a is true then b will not be tested and path1 is executed. If | was used then both sides would be evaluated even if \'a\' is true. See Here and here, for a little more information.Hope this helps.Non short-circuiting can be useful.  Sometimes you want to make sure that two expressions evaluate.  For example, say you have a method that removes an object from two separate lists.  You might want to do something like this:If your method instead used the conditional operand, it would fail to remove the object from the second list if the first list returned false.It\'s not amazingly useful, and (as with most programming tasks) you could achieve it with other means.  But it is a use case for bitwise operands.The basic difference between them is that | first converts the values to binary then performs the bit wise or operation. Meanwhile, || does not convert the data into binary and just performs the or expression on it\'s original state.Read more: http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2015/01/difference-between-bitwsie-and-logical.html#ixzz45PCxdQhk| = bitwise or, || = logic or|| is a logical or and | is a bit-wise or.Java operators| is bitwise or, || is logical or.Take a look at:http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/operators.html| is bitwise inclusive OR|| is logical ORusually I use when there is pre increment and post increment operator. Look at the following code:output:it will print in first if\n  i is: 11\n  it will print in second if\n  x is: 10both if blocks are same but result is different.\nwhen there is |, both the conditions will be evaluated. But if it is ||, it will not evaluate second condition as the first condition is already true. There are many use cases suggesting why should you go for || rather than | . Some use cases have to use | operator to check all the conditions.For example, if you want to check form validation and you want to show the user all the invalid fields with error texts rather than just a first invalid field.|| operator would be, So with above snippet, if user submits the form with ALL empty fields, ONLY nameField would be shown with error message. But, if you change it to,It will show proper error message on the each field irrespective of true conditions.The other answers have done a good job of covering the functional difference between the operators, but the answers could apply to just about every single C-derived language in existence today. The question is tagged with java, and so I will endeavor to answer specifically and technically for the Java language.& and | can be either Integer Bitwise Operators, or Boolean Logical Operators. The syntax for the Bitwise and Logical Operators (\xc2\xa715.22) is:The syntax for EqualityExpression is defined in \xc2\xa715.21, which requires RelationalExpression defined in \xc2\xa715.20, which in turn requires ShiftExpression and ReferenceType defined in \xc2\xa715.19 and \xc2\xa74.3, respectively. ShiftExpression requires AdditiveExpression defined in \xc2\xa715.18, which continues to drill down,  defining the basic arithmetic, unary operators, etc. ReferenceType drills down into all the various ways to represent a type. (While ReferenceType does not include the primitive types, the definition of primitive types is ultimately required, as they may be the dimension type for an array, which is a ReferenceType.)The Bitwise and Logical Operators have the following properties:The distinction between whether the operator serves as a bitwise operator or a logical operator depends on whether the operands are "convertible to a primitive integral type" (\xc2\xa74.2) or if they are of types boolean or Boolean (\xc2\xa75.1.8).If the operands are integral types, binary numeric promotion (\xc2\xa75.6.2) is performed on both operands, leaving them both as either longs or ints for the operation. The type of the operation will be the type of the (promoted) operands. At that point, & will be bitwise AND, ^ will be bitwise exclusive OR, and | will be bitwise inclusive OR. (\xc2\xa715.22.1)If the operands are boolean or Boolean, the operands will be subject to unboxing conversion if necessary (\xc2\xa75.1.8), and the type of the operation will be boolean. & will result in true if both operands are true, ^ will result in true if both operands are different, and | will result in true if either operand is true. (\xc2\xa715.22.2)In contrast, && is the "Conditional-And Operator" (\xc2\xa715.23) and || is the "Conditional-Or Operator" (\xc2\xa715.24). Their syntax is defined as:&& is like &, except that it only evaluates the right operand if the left operand is true. || is like |, except that it only evaluates the right operand if the left operand is false.Conditional-And has the following properties:Conditional-Or has the following properties:In short, as @JohnMeagher has repeatedly pointed out in the comments, & and | are, in fact, non-short-circuiting boolean operators in the specific case of the operands being either boolean or Boolean. With good practices (ie: no secondary effects), this is a minor difference. When the operands aren\'t booleans or Booleans, however, the operators behave very differently: bitwise and logical operations simply don\'t compare well at the high level of Java programming.1).(expression1 | expression2), | operator will evaluate expression2 irrespective of whether the result of expression1 is true or false.Example:2).(expression1 || expression2), || operator will not evaluate expression2 if expression1 is true.Example:| is a bitwise operator. || is a logical operator.One will take two bits and or them.One will determine truth (this OR that) If this is true or that is true, then the answer is true.Oh, and dang people answer these questions fast.
