We now have a "stiging" branch, where "staging" seems to be a far better semantic fit. What\'s a good strategy for handling this?Update to the stiging branch and create a new branch off of it. Then close the old branch.In summary:For future readers: With the rebase extension, you can make a new branch with the same parent as stiging and move the entire branch history to it, like this:This assumes that stiging has only one parent. Of course you can just use explicit revision numbers instead. Note 1: If branch stiging includes merges with other branches, I think that this will preserve them, as long as staging and stiging have the same parent.  But I\'d certainly double-check.Note 2: Since this edits the history, the old branch won\'t simply disappear from cloned repositories (see the rebase documentation). Unless everyone can clone anew, it might not be a very practical solution for a large group.Note3/Edit (courtesy of @JasonRCoombs): Now that phases are standard in mercurial, rebase will refuse to modify changesets that have already been pushed. Either fool it by changing the phase back to draft (with hg phases), or let the old branch stay where it is, and just make a properly named copy (e.g., with `hg rebase --keep\').If you have changesets on it, then you\'ll have to use the convert extension with a branchmap to rename it. Everyone will then have to clone the new repo or strip off the old branch.Make a new branch called "staging" and forget the other...This modifies the history and is only for advanced Mercurial users. Don\'t do this if you don\'t know what that means.If stiging is local only, you can change it to staging with a combination of graft and strip. Start by updating to the ancestor changeset where stiging had diverged. Create the staging branch and graft each commit from stiging to staging. Staging should now be a copy of stiging. Lastly, destroy stiging by stripping its first commit.
