I\'ve successfully used the following sed command to search/replace text in Linux:However, when I try it on my Mac OS X, I get:"command c expects \\ followed by text"I thought my Mac runs a normal BASH shell.  What\'s up?EDIT:According to @High Performance, this is due to Mac sed being of a different (BSD) flavor, so my question would therefore be how do I replicate this command in BSD sed?EDIT: Here is an actual example that causes this:If you use the -i option you need to provide an extension for your backups.If you have:The command:create 2 backup files like:There is no portable way to avoid making backup files because is impossible to find a mix of sed commands that works on all cases:I believe on OS X when you use -i an extension for the backup files is required. Try:Using GNU sed the extension is optional.This works with both GNU and BSD versions of sed:or with backup:Note missing space after -i option! (Necessary for GNU sed)Or, you can install the GNU version of sed in your Mac, called gsed, and use it using the standard Linux syntax.For that, install gsed using ports (if you don\'t have it, get it at http://www.macports.org/) by running sudo port install gsed. Then, you can run sed -i \'s/old_link/new_link/g\' *Your Mac does indeed run a BASH shell, but this is more a question of which implementation of sed you are dealing with.  On a Mac sed comes from BSD and is subtly different from the sed you might find on a typical Linux box.  I suggest you man sed.Sinetris\' answer is right, but I use this with find command to be more specific about what files I want to change. In general this should work (tested on osx /bin/bash):In general when using sed without find in complex projects is less efficient.Works on both BSD & LinuxHad the same problem in Mac and solved it with brew:and use asyou can set as well set sed as alias to gsed (if you want):As the other answers indicate, there is not a way to use sed portably across OS X and Linux without making backup files. So, I instead used this Ruby one-liner to do so:In my case, I needed to call it from a rake task (i.e., inside a Ruby script), so I used this additional level of quoting:Here\'s how to apply environment variables to template file (no backup need).Working both macOS 10.12.4 and Ubuntu 14.04.5
