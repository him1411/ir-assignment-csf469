randrange(start, stop) only takes integer arguments. So how would I get a random number between two float values?Use random.uniform(a, b):random.uniform(a, b) appears to be what your looking for.  From the docs:Return a random floating point number N such that a <= N <= b for a <= b and b <= N <= a for b < a.See here.
