I have put log4j to my buildpath, but I get the following message when I run my application:What do these warnings mean?  Whats the appender here?This Short introduction to log4j guide is a little bit old but still valid.That guide will give you some information about how to use loggers and appenders.Just to get you going you have two simple approaches you can take.First one is to just add this line to your main method:Second approach is to add this standard log4j.properties (taken from the above mentioned guide) file to your classpath:It looks like you need to add the location of your log4j.properties file to the Classpath in Eclipse.Make sure your project is open in Eclipse, then click on the "Run" menu at the top of Eclipse and click on the following:The error message should no longer appear.Quick solution:add code to main function:create a file named log4j.properties at /path/toThis is just a warning.This occurs when the default configuration files log4j.properties and log4j.xml can not be found and the application performs no explicit configuration.To fix that, simply create/copy log4j.properties or log4j.xml into your a location on the classpath (usually the same as the jar files).Optionally set java option: -Dlog4j.configuration=file:///path/to/log4j.properties.log4j uses Thread.getContextClassLoader().getResource() to locate the default configuration files and does not directly check the file system. Knowing the appropriate location to place log4j.properties or log4j.xml requires understanding the search strategy of the class loader in use. log4j does not provide a default configuration since output to the console or to the file system may be prohibited in some environments.For debugging, you may try to use -Dlog4j.debug=true parameter.Sample configuration of log4j.properties:Here is another configuration file that uses multiple appenders:If using Solr, copy <solr>/example/resources/log4j.properties into a location on the classpath.Sample configuration of log4j.properties from Solr goes like:See also:You use the Logger in your code to log a message. The Appender is a Object appended to a Logger to write the message to a specific target. There are FileAppender to write to text-files or the ConsoleAppender to write to the Console. You need to show your code of the Logger and Appender setup for more help.please read the tutorial for a better understanding of the interaction of Logger and Appender.As explained earlier there are 2 approaches First one is to just add this line to your main method:Second approach is to add this standard log4j.properties file to your classpath:While taking second approach you need to make sure you initialize the file properly,\nEg.Make sure you create required folder to store log files.I get the same error. Here the problem which leads to this error message:I create some objects which use the Logger before I configure the log4j:Solution: \nConfigure the log4j at the beginning in the main method:I think you should understand where the log4j jar file or the Java code looks for the log4j configuration files.src/main/resources/log4j.properties is Eclipse path.\nPlace them in a proper location so that you don\'t have to hard code the absolute path  in code.Read my article and sample solution for that \nhttp://askyourquestions.info/2016/03/27/how-to-see-where-the-log-is-logger-in-slf4j/Most of the answers here suggested that log4j.properties file should be placed in the right location(for maven project, it should be located in src/main/resources)But for me, the problem is that my log4j.properties is not correctly configured. Here\'s a sample that works for me, you can try it out first.Make sure the properties file has properly set.\nAnd again, it seems like that the compiler cannot find the properties file, you can set as follow at the pom  (only when you use maven project).In my case, the error was the flag "additivity". If it\'s "false" for you root project package, then the child packages will not have an appender and you will see the "appender not found" error. I ran into this issue when trying to build an executable jar with maven in intellij 12. It turned out that because the  java manifest file didn\'t include a class path the log4j properties file couldn\'t be found at the root level (where the jar file was executed from.) FYI I was getting the logger like this:And I was able to get it to work with a pom file that included this:Make sure your project is open in Eclipse, then click on the "Run" menu at the top of Eclipse and click on the following:RunRun ConfigurationsClasspath (tab)User Entriesadd jar on the right add log4j jar fileApplyRunThe error message should no longer appear.The reason can be lack of the word static in some:If I make logger the instance field, I am getting exactly this very warning: What is worse, the warning points not to ProcessorTest, where the mistake lives, but to an absolutely different class (Sender) as a source of problems. That class has correct set logger and need not any changes! We could look for the problem for ages!I faced the same problem when I use log4j2. My problem is caused by using wrong dependent library:Instead, I should use:In my case, I have a log4j2.xml defined in my "resources" directory, and specified to use it by:Another reason this may happen (in RCP4) is that you are using multiple logging frameworks in your target file.  As an example, this will occur if you use a combination of slf4j, log4j and ch.qos.logback.slf4j in your target files content tab.My Eclipse installation could not find log4j.properties when running JUnit tests from Eclipse, even though the file was located at src/test/resources.The reason was that Eclipse (or the m2e connector) did not copy content from src/test/resources to the expected output folder target/test-classes - the root cause was that in the project\'s properties under Java Build Path -> Source tab -> Source folders on build path -> src/test/resources, somehow there was an Excluded: ** entry. I removed that excluded entry.Alternatively, I could have manually copied src/test/resources/log4j.properties to target/test-classes/log4j.properties.If log4j.properties is indeed on the classpath, you are using Spring Boot to make a WAR file for deployment to an app server, you are omitting a web.xml file in favour of Spring Boot\'s autoconfigure, and you are not getting any log messages whatsoever, you need to explicitly configure Log4j. Assuming you are using Log4j 1.2.x:In java eclipse copy your conf_ref to conf folder.
