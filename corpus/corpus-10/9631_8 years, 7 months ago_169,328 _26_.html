I want to add * to the end of each line in Vim.I tried the code unsuccessfully:%s/$/\\*/g should work. So should :%s/$/*/g as MrWiggles points out correctly.Even shorter than the :search command:This is what it means:Also:Also:I think using visual block mode is a better and more versatile method for dealing with this type of thing. Here\'s an example:This is the First line.\nThis is the second.\nThe third.To insert " Hello world." (space + clipboard) at the end of each of these lines:The result is: This is the First line. Hello world.\nThis is the second. Hello world.\nThe third. Hello world.  (example from http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Inserting_text_in_multiple_lines)If u want to add Hello world at the end of each line:If you want to do this for specific number of line say, from 20 to 30 use:If u want to do this at start of each line then use:You don\'t really need the g at the end. So it becomes:Or if you just want the * at the end of, say lines 14-18:or...and to prepend (add the beginning of) each line with *, One option is::g/$/s//*This will find every line end anchor and substitute it with *. I say "substitute" but, in actual fact, it\'s more of an append since the anchor is a special thing rather than a regular character. For more information, see Power of g - Examples.Your first one is correct anywhere else, but Vim has to have different newline handling for some reason.this will do the trick, and ensure leading spaces are ignored.
