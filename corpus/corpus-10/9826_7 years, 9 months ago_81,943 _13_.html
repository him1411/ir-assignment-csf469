With Jquery, I need to select just the first "n" items from the page, for example the first 20  links instead of selecting all of them with the usualSounds simple but the jQuery manual has no evidence of something like this.You probably want to read up on slice.  Your code will look something like this:Use lt pseudo selector:This matches the elements before the nth one (the nth element excluded). Numbering starts from 0.I found this note in the end of the lt() docs:Additional Notes:\n  \n  Because :lt() is a jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification, queries using :lt() cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided by the native DOM querySelectorAll() method. For better performance in modern browsers, use $("your-pure-css-selector").slice(0, index) instead.So use $("selector").slice(from, to) for better performances.Try the :lt selector: http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors/lt#index.slice() isn\'t always better. In my case, with jQuery 1.7 in Chrome 36, .slice(0, 20) failed with error:RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceededI found that :lt(20) worked without error in this case. I had probably tens of thousands of matching elements.JQuery Documentation
