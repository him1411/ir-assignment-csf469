I\'m using Android Studio 0.2.3 and when opened an activity layout normally, the preview should appear on the right side, so that I can switch between Text and Design mode, which should again show the preview of the layout. But no preview is shown not on the right side neither when I\'m in text mode nor in the design mode. I just get the error rendering problems...When I compile everything and install the app on my device, it works without any errors. For developing and experimenting with the layout, it would still be nice if I could get the preview to work.I have also tried to switch between different devices in the studio, but no success. Does anyone know how solve this?Change your android version on your designer preview into your current version depend on your Manifest. rendering problem caused your designer preview used higher API level than your current android API level.Adjust with your current API Level. If the API level isn\'t in the list, you\'ll need to install it via the SDK Manager. I was able to fix this in Android Studio 0.2.0 by changing API from API 18: Android 4.3 to API 17: Android 4.2.2This is under the Android icon menu in the top right of the design window. This was a solution from  http://www.hankcs.com/program/mobiledev/idea-this-version-of-the-rendering-library-is-more-recent-than-your-version-of-intellij-idea-please-update-intellij-idea.html.This required a Google translation into English since it was in another language.Hope it helps.Change:to something like:In new update android studio 2.2 facing rendering issue then follow this steps.I fixed it - in styles.xml file I changedtoIt\'s some kind of hack I came across a long time ago to solve similar rendering problems in previous Android Studio versions. I have solved the Problem by changing style.xmlthis was an awesom solution.I had the same problem, current update, but rendering failed because I need to update.Try changing the update version you are on. The default is Stable, but there are 3 more options, Canary being the newest and potentially least stable. I chose to check for updates from the Dev Channel, which is a little more stable than Canary build. It fixed the problem and seems to work fine.To change the version, Check for Updates, then click the Updates link on the popup that says you already have the latest version.it still happens in Android Studio 1.5.1. on Ubuntu and you can solve it simply changing a setting from Gradle:1) on app/build.gradle dependencies change from:to:2) rebuild project3) refresh viewBest regards,/AngelRendering didn\'t work for me too. I had <null> value on the right side of the android icon. I ranI restarted Android studio then and <null> value changed to 23. Voila, it renders now! :)Just download minimum prefered SDK from SDK Manager, then build. Works for me.Make sure your designer version and targetSdkVersion both is same.\nExample : If your targetSdkVersion is 22 then change your designer version also 22, so this problem do not occur.Be sure that your application targetSdkVersion is downloaded, otherwise download required sdk version. None of these helped me. I updated the Android studio and then it worked.
