I am a complete Noob when it comes to GIT.  I have been just taking my first steps over the last few days.  I setup a repo on my laptop, pulled down the Trunk from an SVN project (had some issues with branches, not got them working), but all seems ok there.I now want to be able to pull or push from the laptop to my main desktop.  The reason being the laptop is handy on the train as I spend 2 hours a day travelling and can get some good work done.  But my main machine at home is great for development.  So I want to be able to push / pull from the laptop to the main computer when I get home.  I thought the most simple way of doing this would be to just have the code folder shared out across the LAN and do:unfortunately this doesn\'t seem to be working for me:so I open a git bash cmd and type the above command, I am in C:\\code (the shared folder for both machines) this is what I get back:How can I share the repository between the two machines in the most simple of ways.There will be other locations that will be official storage points and places where the other devs and CI server etc will pull from, this is just so that I can work on the same repo across two machines.As per Sebastian\'s suggestion I get the following:**EDIT - ANSWER **Thanks to all that helped.  I tried the mapping a drive and that worked so thought I would go back and retry without mapping.  The final result was:This worked great.ThanksYou can specify the remote\xe2\x80\x99s URL by applying the UNC path to the file protocol. This requires you to use four slashes:For example, if your main machine has the IP 192.168.10.51 and the computer name main, and it has a share named code which itself is a git repository, then both of the following commands should work equally:If the Git repository is in a subdirectory, simply append the path:The above command uses POSIX path notation for the directory with your git repository. For Windows it is (directory C:/path/to/repo contains .git directory):The repository will be clone to C:\\some\\dir\\my_project. If you omit file:/// part then --local option is implied.the answer with the host name didn\'t work for me \nbut this did :git clone file:////home/git/repositories/MyProject.git/Maybe map the share as a network drive and then doMostly just a guess; I always do this stuff using ssh.  Following that suggstion of course will mean that you\'ll need to have that drive mapped every time you push/pull to/from the laptop.  I\'m not sure how you rig up ssh to work under windows but if you\'re going to be doing this a lot it might be worth investigating.I was successful in doing this using file://, but with one additional slash to denote an absolute path.In my case I\'m using Git on Cygwin for Windows, which you can see because of the /cygdrive/c part in my paths. With some tweaking to the path it should work with any git installation.Adding a remote works the same wayNot sure if it was because of my git version (1.7.2) or what, but the approaches listed above using machine name and IP options were not working for me. An additional detail that may/may not be important is that the repo was a bare repo that I had initialized and pushed to from a different machine. I was trying to clone project1 as advised above with commands like:andWhat did work for me was something simpler:Note - even though the repo being cloned from was bare, this did produce a \'normal\' clone with all the actual code/image/resource files that I was hoping for (as opposed to the internals of the git repo).For example the first one below uses absolute paths : (this is from inside the folder which contains the repository and the backup as subfolders. also remember that the backup folder is not modified if it already contains anything. and if it is not present, a new folder will be created )The following uses relative paths :
