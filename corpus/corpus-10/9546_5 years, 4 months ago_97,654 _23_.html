I have a piece of javascript code that I am executing using the node.js interpreter.I want to know how to measure the time taken by these db insert operations. I could compute the difference of Date values after and before this piece of code but that would be incorrect because of the asynchronous nature of the code.Use the Node.js console.time() and console.timeEnd():There is a method that is designed for this. Check out process.hrtime(); .So, I basically put this at the top of my app.Then I use it to see how long functions take. Here\'s a basic example that prints the contents of a text file called "output.txt":Here\'s a quick test you can run in a terminal (BASH shell):Invoking console.time(\'label\') will record the current time in milliseconds, then later calling console.timeEnd(\'label\') will display the duration from that point. The time in milliseconds will be automatically printed alongside the label, so you don\'t have to make a separate call to console.log to print a label:Old question but for a simple API and light-weight solution; you can use  perfy which uses high-resolution real time (process.hrtime) internally.Note that each time perfy.end(label) is called, that instance is auto-destroyed. Disclosure: Wrote this module, inspired by D.Deriso\'s answer. Docs here.You could give Benchmark.js a try. It supports many platforms among them also node.js. You could also try exectimer. It gives you feedback like:[edit] There is even a simpler way now to use exectimer because now it can wrap the code to be measured. Your code could wrapped like this:For anyone want to get time elapsed value instead of console output :use process.hrtime() as @D.Deriso suggestion, below is my simpler approach : I would recommend trying NodeTime which seems to be a good fit for what you are trying to do.And another option is to use the express-debug tool:express-debug is a development tool for express. It\'s simple middleware that injects useful debugging output into your html, in a non-obstructive way.It conveniently offers a profiling panel:total req processing time. middleware, param, and route timings.Also. to add to the above answers, you can check this answer to enable any profiling code for development environment only.
