I have a div and it has several input elements in it... I\'d like to iterate through each of those elements. Ideas?Use children() and each(), you can optionally pass a selector to childrenYou could also just use the immediate child selector:It is also possible to iterate through all elements within a specific context, no mattter how deeply nested they are:The second parameter $(\'#mydiv\') which is passed to the jQuery \'input\' Selector is the context. In this case the each() clause will iterate through all input elements within the #mydiv container, even if they are not direct children of #mydiv.It can be done that way as well.\n$(\'input\', \'#div\').each(function () {\n    console.log($(this)); //log every element found to console output\n});If you need to loop through child elements recursively:NOTE:\n  In this example I show the events handlers registered with an object.
