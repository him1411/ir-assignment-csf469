Does anyone know how I can prevent the text in a table cell from wrapping?  This is for the header of a table, and the heading is a lot longer than the data under it, but I need it to display on only one line.  It is okay if the column is very wide.The HTML of my (simplified) table looks like this:The heading itself is wrapped in a div inside the th tag for reasons pertaining to the javascript on the page.  The table is coming out with the headings wrapping onto multiple lines.  This seems to only happen when the table is sufficiently wide, as the browser is trying to avoid horizontal scrolling.  In my case, though, I want horizontal scrolling.Any ideas?Have a look at the white-space property, used like this:This will force the contents of <th> to display on one line.From linked page, here are the various options for white-space:normal\n  This value directs user agents to collapse sequences of white space, and break lines as necessary to fill line boxes.pre\n  This value prevents user agents from collapsing sequences of white space. Lines are only broken at preserved newline characters.nowrap\n  This value collapses white space as for \'normal\', but suppresses line breaks within text.pre-wrap\n  This value prevents user agents from collapsing sequences of white space. Lines are broken at preserved newline characters, and as necessary to fill line boxes.pre-line\n  This value directs user agents to collapse sequences of white space. Lines are broken at preserved newline characters, and as necessary to fill line boxes.ororThere are at least two ways to do it:Use nowrap attribute inside the "td" tag:Use non-breakable spaces between your words:I came to this question needing to prevent text wrapping at the hyphen.This is how I did it:Reference:How to prevent line break at hyphens on all browsers
