I\'ve seen this in a few placesAnd I can see that it is returning a timestamp rather than a date object, but I can\'t find any documentation on what the plus sign is doing.Can anyone explain?that\'s the + unary operator, it\'s equivalent to:see:\nhttp://xkr.us/articles/javascript/unary-add/and in MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators#Unary_plusJavaScript is loosely typed, so it performs type coercion/conversion in certain circumstances:http://blog.jeremymartin.name/2008/03/understanding-loose-typing-in.html\nhttp://www.jibbering.com/faq/faq_notes/type_convert.htmlOther examples:Here is the specification regarding the "unary add" operator.
