I am creating a page in JSP where I have a dropdown list and once the user selects a value he has to click on the go button and then the value is sent to the Servlet.How do I make it so that it does it on change? E.g. when the user selects John all his details are retrived from the DB and displayed. I want the system to do it without having to click the go button.Just ask assistance of JavaScript.Simple JavaScript will do - Here is a link for a good javascript tutorial.
