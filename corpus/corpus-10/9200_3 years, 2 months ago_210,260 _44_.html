This is my first attempt at Android Studio.  I installed 0.8.0 and updated to 0.8.2.  As soon as a project is created I get the error message:Error:(1, 0) Plugin with id \'com.android.application\' not foundC:\\Users\\Bob\\AndroidStudioProjects\\HelloAgain6\\app\\build.gradleand C:\\Users\\Bob\\AndroidStudioProjects\\HelloAgain6\\build.gradleLatest Gradle: 4.1Version check: How to update: Latest Android Gradle Plugin: 2.3.3If you add the following code snippet to the top of your build.gradle file, gradle will update the build tools.Read more here: http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system and about version compatibility here: http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/version-compatibility.I had this same error, you need to make sure your Gradle version is compatible with your Android Gradle Plugin.The latest version of Gradle is 2.0 but you need to use 1.12 in order to use the Android Gradle Plugin.This can happen if you miss adding the Top-level build file.Just add build.gradle to top level.Root-gradle file:Gradle-wrapper.properties file:I am writing this not as a solution meant for many, but for some people who may commit a simple mistake like specifying the wrong url for importing projects from SVN. It is intended for those guys :)This happened to me when I imported the project from SVN -> automatic prompt by Studio to open the project -> It asked for Gradle location  -> D:\\Software\\Android\\gradle-2.5 -> Then the error.The same project in a different SVN branch works fine with the Gradle plugin and Gradle which I have configured in Studio. I tried changing Android Gradle plugin and Gradle to get it working on the erring branch without any success.Finally, I figured out that it was my following mistake:\nI tried importing a specific Application alone instead of importing the application along with dependent library projects.\nThe url which I used for import initially had the Application porject\'s name at the end. Once I removed it, and specified the parent directory which contained both application project and its dependent project, everything went smooth :)The other answers didn\'t work for me, I guess something wrong happens between ButterKnife and 3.0.0 alpha5.However, I found that when I annotated any one sentence, either BUtterKnife or 3.0.0 alpha5, it works normally.So, you should just avoid the duplication or conflict.I was using IntelliJ IDEA 13.1.5 and faced with the same problem after I changed versions of Picasso and Retrofit in dependencies in build.gradle file.  I tried use many solutions, but without result. \nThen I cloned my project from remote git (where I pushed it before changing versions of dependencies) and it worked! After that I just closed current project and imported old project from Gradle file to IntelliJ IDEA again and it worked too! So, I think it was strange bug in intersection of IDEA, Gradle and Android plugin. I hope this information can be useful for IDEA-users or anyone else.This just happened to me using Android Studio 1.3.2, however, since I had just created the project, I deleted it and created it again.\nIt seems that it had not been properly created by Android Studio the first time, not even the project folders where as expected.module  app build.gradle file   If you run a the module task with android plugin 1.2.3 in module directory , the problem appears. Try this:Go to your grade file where you can see this:And change classpath to this:Make sure your two build.gradle and settings.gradle files are in the correct directories as stated in https://developer.android.com/studio/build/index.htmlThen open "as existing project" in Visual StudioGradle is very finicky about this.I found the problem after one hour struggling with this error message: I accidentally renamed the root build.gradle to filename in builde.gradle, so Android Studio didn\'t recognize it anymore.Renaming it to build.gradle resolved the issue!I got this error message after making the following change in my top-level build.gradle to update to the latest version of gradle:I foolishly made the change while I was connected behind a hostile workplace proxy. The proxy caused the .jar files for the new version of gradle to become corrupt. This can be verified by inspecting the jars to see if they are an unusual size or whether they can be unzipped.In order to fix the mistake, I connected to my network at home (which is not behind a proxy) and did a refresh dependencies from the Terminal:This caused the newer version of gradle to be re-downloaded and the error no longer occurs.If problem happened after importing or adding module. Then check for duplicate of settings.gradle file. If found then resolve the conflict it will work .In this case of issues check below code and gradle-wrapper.properties inside your project directory check below disctributionUrl:If these are not compatible with each other then you end up in this issue.For com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.5. you need a version at least 2.8 but if you switch to a higher version like com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.1.0 then you need to update your gradle to 2.9 and above this can be done by changing distributionUrl in gradle-wrapper.properties to 2.9 or higher as below
