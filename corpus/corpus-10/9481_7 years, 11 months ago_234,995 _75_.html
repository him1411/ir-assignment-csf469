This is supposed to change the #password input field (with id="password") that is of type password to a normal text field, and then fill in the text \xe2\x80\x9cPassword\xe2\x80\x9d.It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work, though. Why?Here is the form:It\'s very likely this action is prevented as part of the browser\'s security model.Edit: indeed, testing right now in Safari, I get the error type property cannot be changed.Edit 2: that seems to be an error straight out of jQuery. Using the following straight DOM code works just fine:Edit 3: Straight from the jQuery source, this seems to be related to IE (and could either be a bug or part of their security model, but jQuery isn\'t specific):Even easier... there\'s no need for all the dynamic element creation. Just create two separate fields, making one the \'real\' password field (type="password") and one a \'fake\' password field (type="text"), setting the text in the fake field to a light gray color and setting the initial value to \'Password\'. Then add a few lines of Javascript with jQuery as below:So when the user enters the \'fake\' password field it will be hidden, the real field will be shown, and the focus will move to the real field. They will never be able to enter text in the fake field.When the user leaves the real password field the script will see if it\'s empty, and if so will hide the real field and show the fake one.Be careful not to leave a space between the two input elements because IE will position one a little bit after the other (rendering the space) and the field will appear to move when the user enters/exits it.One step solutionNowadays, you can just useBut of course, you should really just do thisin all but IE. There are placeholder shims out there to mimic that functionality in IE as well.A more cross-browser solution\xe2\x80\xa6 I hope the gist of this helps someone out there.This solution tries to set the type attribute, and if it fails, it simply creates a new <input> element, preserving element attributes and event handlers.changeTypeAttr.js (GitHub Gist):This works for me.An ultimate way to use jQuery:Leave the original input field hidden from the screen.Create new input field on the fly by JavaScript.Migrate the ID and value from hidden input field to the new input field.To get around the error on IE like type property cannot be changed, you may find this useful as belows:Attach click/focus/change event to new input element, in order to trigger the same event on hidden input.Old hidden input element is still inside the DOM so will react with the event triggered by new input element. As ID is swapped, new input element will act like the old one and respond to any function call to old hidden input\'s ID, but looks different.A little bit tricky but WORKS!!! ;-)I haven\'t tested in IE (since I needed this for an iPad site) - a form I couldn\'t change the HTML but I could add JS:(Old school JS is ugly next to all the jQuery!)But, http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/1957 links to MSDN: "As of Microsoft Internet Explorer 5, the type property is read/write-once, but only when an input element is created with the createElement method and before it is added to the document." so maybe you could duplicate the element, change the type, add to DOM and remove the old one?Have you tried using .prop()?http://api.jquery.com/prop/Just create a new field to bypass this security thing:I received the same error message while attempting to do this in Firefox 5.I solved it using the code below:And to use it, just set the onFocus and onBlur attributes of your fields to something like the following:I use this for a username field as well, so it toggles a default value. Just set the second parameter of the function to \'\' when you call it.Also it might be worth noting that the default type of my password field is actually password, just in case a user doesn\'t have javascript enabled or if something goes wrong, that way their password is still protected. The $(document).ready function is jQuery, and loads when the document has finished loading. This then changes the password field to a text field. Obviously you\'ll have to change \'password_field_id\' to your password field\'s id.Feel free to use and modify the code!Hope this helps everyone who had the same problem I did :)-- CJ KentEDIT:\nGood solution but not absolute. Works on on FF8 and IE8 BUT not fully on Chrome(16.0.912.75 ver). Chrome does not display the Password text when the page loads.\nAlso - FF will display your password when autofill is switched on.Simple solution for all those who want the functionality in all browsers:HTMLjQueryType properties can\'t be changed you need to replace or overlay the input with a text input and send the value to the password input on submit.Try this \nDemo is hereuse this one it is very easyThis will do the trick. Although it could be improved to ignore attributes that are now irrelevant.Plugin:Usage:Fiddle:http://jsfiddle.net/joshcomley/yX23U/Simply this:such asThis is assuming that your input field was set to "text" before hand. Here is a little snippet that allows you to change the type of elements in documents.jquery.type.js (GitHub Gist):It gets around the issue by removing the input from the document, changing the type and then putting it back where it was originally.Note that this snippet was only tested for WebKit browsers \xe2\x80\x93 no guarantees on anything else!I guess you could use a background-image that contains the word "password" and change it back to an empty background-image on .focus()..blur()  ----> image with "password".focus() -----> image with no "password"You could also do it with some CSS and jQuery. Have a text field show up exactly on top of the password field, hide() is on focus() and focus on the password field... It works much easier with that:and in order to turn it back to password field again,(assuming the password field is the 2nd input tag with text type):I like this way, to change the type of an input element: old_input.clone()....\nHere is an example. There is an check box "id_select_multiple". If this is is changed to "selected", input elements with name "foo" should be changed to check boxes. If it gets unchecked, they should be become radio buttons again.heres a DOM solutionI\'ve created a jQuery extension to toggle between text and password.  Works in IE8 (probably 6&7 as well, but not tested) and won\'t lose your value or attributes:Works like a charm.  You can simply call $(\'#element\').togglePassword(); to switch between the two or give an option to \'force\' the action based on something else (like a checkbox): $(\'#element\').togglePassword($checkbox.prop(\'checked\'));Here is a method which uses an image next to the password field to toggle between seeing the password (text input) and not seeing it (password input).  I use an "open eye" and "closed eye" image, but you can use whatever suits you.  The way it works is having two inputs/images and upon clicking the image, the value is copied from the visible input to the hidden one, and then their visibility is swapped.  Unlike many of the other answers which use hardcoded names, this one is general enough to use it multiple times on a page.  It also degrades gracefully if JavaScript is unavailable.Here is what two of these look like on a page.  In this example, the Password-A has been revealed by clicking on its eye.
