PHP must track the amount of CPU time a particular script has used in order to enforce the max_execution_time limit.  Is there a way to get access to this inside of the script?  I\'d like to include some logging with my tests about how much CPU was burnt in the actual PHP (the time is not incremented when the script is sitting and waiting for the database).I am using a Linux box.  On unixoid systems (and in php 7.0.0 on Windows as well), you can use getrusage, like:Note that you don\'t need to calculate a difference if you are spawning a php instance for every test.If all you need is the wall-clock time, rather than the CPU execution time, then it is simple to calculate: Note that this will include time that PHP is sat waiting for external resources such as disks or databases, which is not used for max_execution_time.Shorter version of talal7860\'s answerAs pointed out, this is \'wallclock time\' not \'cpu time\'The easiest way:I created an ExecutionTime class out of phihag answer that you can use out of box:usage:Note: getrusage function only works in unixoid systems, and in php 7.0.0 on Windows.Gringod at developerfusion.com gives this good answer:From (http://www.developerfusion.com/code/2058/determine-execution-time-in-php/)I think you should look at xdebug.  The profiling options will give you a head start toward knowing many process related items.http://www.xdebug.org/The cheapest and dirtiest way to do it is simply make microtime() calls at places in your code you want to benchmark.  Do it right before and right after database queries and it\'s simple to remove those durations from the rest of your script execution time.A hint: your PHP execution time is rarely going to be the thing that makes your script timeout.  If a script times out it\'s almost always going to be a call to an external resource.PHP microtime documentation:\nhttp://us.php.net/microtimeYou may only want to know the execution time of parts of your script. The most flexible way to time parts or an entire script is to create 3 simple functions (procedural code given here but you could turn it into a class by putting class timer{} around it and making a couple of tweaks). This code works, just copy and paste and run:I wrote a function that check remaining execution time.Warning: Execution time counting is different on Windows and on Linux platform.Using:As an alternative you can just put this line in your code blocks and check php logs, for really slow functions it\'s pretty useful: For serious debugging use XDebug + Cachegrind, see https://blog.nexcess.net/2011/01/29/diagnosing-slow-php-execution-with-xdebug-and-kcachegrind/
