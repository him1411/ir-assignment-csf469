I have forked a repository, then I made some changes and it looks like I\'ve messed up everything.  I wish to start it again from scratch, using the current upstream/master as the base for my work.\nShould I rebase my repository or delete it at all?The simplest solution would be (using \'upstream\' as the remote name referencing the original repo forked):(Similar to this GitHub page, section "What should I do if I\xe2\x80\x99m in a bad situation?")Be aware that you can loose changes done on the master branch (both locally, because of the reset --hard, and on the remote side, because of the push --force).An alternative would be, if you want to preserve your commits on master, to replay those commits on top of the current upstream/master.\nReplace the reset part by a git rebase upstream/master. You will then still need to force push.\nSee also "What should I do if I\xe2\x80\x99m in a bad situation?"A more complete solution, backing up your current work (just in case) is detailed in "Cleanup git master branch and move some commit to new branch".See also "Pull new updates from original GitHub repository into forked GitHub repository" for illustrating what "upstream" is.Note: recent GitHub repos do protect the master branch against push --force.\nSo you will have to un-protect master first (see picture below), and then re-protect it after force-pushing).Love VonC\'s answer. Here\'s an easy version of it for beginners. There is a git remote called origin which I am sure you are all aware of. Basically, you can add as many remotes to a git repo as you want. So, what we can do is introduce a new remote which is the original repo not the fork. I like to call it original Let\'s add original repo\'s to our fork as a remote.Now let\'s fetch the original repo to make sure we have the latest codedAs, VonC suggested, make sure we are on the master. Now to bring our fork up to speed with the latest code on original repo, all we have to do is hard reset our master branch in accordance with the original remote.And you are done :)Following @VonC great answer. GitHub new policy doesn\'t allow \'force push\' on master. If you get an error message like this one please try the following steps. \nremote: error: GH003: Sorry, force-pushing to master is not allowed.To effectively reset your fork you need to follow these steps :Open your fork on GitHub, in "Settings -> Branches -> Default branch" choose \'new_master\' as the new default branch. Now you can force push on the \'master\' branch :Then you must set back \'master\' as the default branch in the GitHub settings. To delete \'tmp_master\' : Other answers warning about lossing your change still apply, be carreful.
