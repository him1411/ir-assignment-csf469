I\'m using angularjs ng-class at the following way:and I wondered if I can use if-else expression, can I do something similar to this:meaning whenever call.State different from first or second use classC and not specify each value.thanks!for example :And make sure it\'s readable by your colleagues :)you could try by using a function like that :Then put your logic in the function itself :I made a fiddle with an example : http://jsfiddle.net/DotDotDot/nMk6M/I had a situation where I needed two \'if\' statements that could both go true and an \'else\' or default if neither were true, not sure if this is an improvement on Jossef\'s answer but it seemed cleaner to me: Where value.one and value.two are true, they take precedent over the .else-classClearly! We can make a function to return a CSS class name with following fully example.\nCSSJSAnd then You can refer to full code page at ng-class if exampleA workaround of mine is to manipulate a model variable just for the ng-class toggling:For example, I want to toggle class according to the state of my list:1) Whenever my list is empty, I update my model:2) Whenever my list is not empty, I set another state3) When my list is not ever touched, I want to give another class (this is where the page is initiated):3) I use this additional model on my ng-class:The above solutions didn\'t work for me for classes with background images somehow. What I did was I create a default class (the one you need in else) and set class=\'defaultClass\' and then the ng-class="{class1:abc,class2:xyz}"P.S: The classes that are in condition should override the default class i.e marked as !importantThis is the best and reliable way to do this.\nHere is a simple example and after that you can develop your custom logic:
