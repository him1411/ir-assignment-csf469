How can I put some text into a textbox which is removed automatically when user types something in it? (In WPF)This is a sample which demonstrates how to create a watermark textbox in WPF:TextInputToVisibilityConverter is defined as:Note: This is not my code. I found it here, but I think this is the best approach.You can create a watermark that can be added to any TextBox with an Attached Property.  Here is the source for the Attached Property:The Attached Property uses a class called WatermarkAdorner, here is that source:Now you can put a watermark on any TextBox like this:The watermark can be anything you want (text, images ...).  In addition to working for TextBoxes, this watermark also works for ComboBoxes and ItemControls.This code was adapted from this blog post.Just using XAML, no extensions, no converters:I can\'t believe that no one posted the obvious Extended WPF Toolkit - WatermarkTextBox from CodePlex. It works quite well and is open source in case you want to customise.There is an article on CodeProject on how to do it in "3 lines of XAML".Ok, well it might not be 3 lines of XAML formatted, but it is pretty simple.One thing to note though, is that it uses a non-standard extension method on the Text property, called "IsEmpty". You need to implement this yourself, however the article doesn\'t seem to mention that.I saw John Myczek\'s solution, and its comments about Compatibility to ComboBox and PasswordBox, so I improved John Myczek\'s solution, and here it is:Now, a ComboBox can be also Editable, and PasswordBox can add a watermark too.\nDon\'t forget to use JoanComasFdz\'s comment above to solve the margin problem.And, of course, All the credit goes to John Myczek.I have created siple code-only implementation which works fine for WPF and Silverlight as well:Usage:I ran into a bit of difficulty when using @john-myczek\'s code with a bound TextBox. As the TextBox doesn\'t raise a focus event when it\'s updated, the watermark would remain visible underneath the new text. To fix this, I simply added another event handler:https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsdesktop/In-place-hit-messages-for-18db3a6c This library has a watermark.Nuget packageSample usage:@Veton - I really like the simplicity of your solution but my reputation isn\'t high enough to bump you yet.@Tim Murphy - That "Two-way binding requires Path or XPath" error was an easy fix... updated code including some other little tweaks (only WPF tested):David Owens has a more complicated example of a full "Search Box" here.you can use GetFocus() and LostFocus() events to do thishere is the example:If you are writing UWP apps on Windows 10 this is much easier.More info: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.textbox.placeholdertext.aspxThis can help check it with your code.When applied to password box,it will show Password,which will disappear when usertypes.Well here is mine: not necessarily the best, but as it is simple it is easy to edit to your taste.The converter, as it is written now it is not necessary that it is a MultiConverter, but in this wasy it can be extended easilyand finally the code behind:MahApps.Metro for WPF has a built-in watermark control, if you\'d rather not roll your own. It\'s fairly straightforward to use.Set up the text box with placeholder text in a soft color...When the text box gets the focus, clear it and change the text colorhi i put this task into a behavior. so you just have to add somthing like this to your textboxyou can find my blog post hereMy solution is quite simple.In my login window. the xaml is like this.the code is like this.Just decide to hide or show the watermark textbox is enough. Though not beautiful,but work well.This technique uses the Background property to show / hide placeholder textbox.\nPlaceholder is shown event when Textbox has the focusHow it works:Here is basic example.  For my own purposes I turned this into a UserControl.Here is the ValueConverter to detect non-empty strings in the DataTrigger.You can keep a seperate value for the entered text and you can set it along with the "Text" field of the text box in the "GotFocus" and "LostFocus" events. When you get the focus, you\'ll want to clear the text box if there is no value. And when you loss the focus, you\'ll want to set the get the "Text" value from the text box and then reset the "Text" value of the text box to the place holder if it is empty.Then you just have to make sure that the "Text" value of the text box is initialized to the place holder text.You can further extract this into a class that extends the "TextBox" class and then reuse it through out your project.And then this can be added in the directly in the xaml.If rather than having the watermark\'s visibility depend on the control\'s focus state, you want it to depend on whether the user has entered any text, you can update John Myczek\'s answer (from OnWatermarkChanged down) to This makes more sense if your textbox gets focus automatically when displaying the form, or when databinding to the Text property.Also if your watermark is always just a string, and you need the style of the watermark to match the style of the textbox, then in the Adorner do:Here\'s my approach Is great for MVVM where I also check if the Text box has focus, you can also use a regular trigger just for the text value  as well the point is I just change the background Image when value changes: I decided to solve this via a Behavior. It uses a Hint property to define the text to display (could also be an object, if you prefer) and a Value property to evaluate wether the hint should be visible or not.The Behavior is declared as follows:It wraps the target with it\'s own template, adding to it a label:To use it, just add it as a behavior and bind your values (in my case I add it in a ControlTemplate, hence the binding):I would love feedback if this is considered a clean solution. It does not require static dictionaries and hence has no memory leak.I found this way to do it in a very fast and easy wayMaybe it can help to anyone trying to do thisSource: http://www.admindiaries.com/displaying-a-please-select-watermark-type-text-in-a-wpf-combobox/Add mahapps.metro to your project. \nAdd textbox with the above code to the window.
