How can I install the Google Play .apk onto my Android 4.0 emulator?Download Google apps (GoogleLoginService.apk , GoogleServicesFramework.apk  , Phonesky.apk) from here. Start your emulator:Then use the following commands:For future visitors.As of now Android 4.2.2 platform includes Google Play services. Just use an emulator running Jelly Bean. Details can be found here:Setup Google Play Services SDKEDIT:Another option is to use Genymotion (runs way faster)EDIT 2:As @gdw2 commented: "setting up the Google Play Services SDK does not install a working Google Play app -- it just enables certain services provided by the SDK"After version 2.0 Genymotion does not come with Play Services by default, but it can be easily installed manually. Just download the right version from here and drag and drop into the virtual device (emulador).I do this in a more permanent way - instead of installing the APKs each time with adb, permanently add them to the system image that the emulator uses. You will need Yaffey on Windows, or a similar utility on other systems, to modify YAFFS2 images. Copy GoogleLoginService.apk, GoogleServicesFramework.apk, and Phonesky.apk (or Vending.apk in older versions of Android) to the /system/app folder of the system.img file of the emulator. Afterwards I can start the emulator normally, without messing with adb, and Play Store is always there.Downloading Google Apps from some Internet site may not be quite legal, but if you have a phone or tablet with a corresponding Android version, just pull them out of your device:You must have root-level access (run adb root) to the device in order to pull these files from it.  Now start yaffey on Windows or a similar utility on Linux or Mac, and open system.img for the emulator image you want to modify. I modify most often the one in [...]\\android-sdk\\system-images\\android-17\\x86.Rename the original system.img to system-original.img. Under yaffey, copy the APK files you pulled from your device to /app folder. Save your modified image as system.img in the original folder. Then start your emulator (in my case it would be Android 4.2 emulator with Intel Atom processor running under Intel HAX, super-fast on Windows machines) and you\'ll have Play Store there. I did not find it necessary to delete SdkSetup.apk and SdkSetup.odex - the Play Store and other services still work fine for me with these files present.When finished with your testing, to alleviate your conscience guilty of temporarily pirating the Google Apps from your device, you may delete the modified system.img and restore the original from system-original.img.You could download it from a Android 4.0 phone and then mount the system image rw and copy it over. Didnt tried it before but it should work.It is simple for me i downloaded the apk file in my computer and drag that file to emulator it install the google play for me\nHope it help some onePlaystore + Google Play Services In Linux(Ubuntu 14.04)Download Google apps (GoogleLoginService.apk , GoogleServicesFramework.apk )from here http://www.securitylearn.net/2013/08/31/google-play-store-on-android-emulator/and Download ( Phonesky.apk)\nfrom here https://basketbuild.com/filedl/devs?dev=dankoman&dl=dankoman/Phonesky.apkGO TO ANDROID SDK LOCATION>>cd  -Android SDK\'s tools Location-TO RUN EMULATOR>>Android/Sdk/tools$ ./emulator64-x86 -avd Kitkat -partition-size 566 -no-audio -no-boot-animSET PERMISSIONS>>cd Android/Sdk/platform-tools\nplatform-tools$ adb shell mount -o remount,rw -t yaffs2 /dev/block/mtdblock0 /systemplatform-tools$ adb shell chmod 777 /system/appplatform-tools$ adb push /home/nazmul/Downloads/GoogleLoginService.apk /system/app/.PUSH PLAY APKS >>platform-tools$ adb push /home/nazmul/Downloads/GoogleServicesFramework.apk /system/app/.\nplatform-tools$ adb push /home/nazmul/Downloads/Phonesky.apk /system/app/.\nplatform-tools$ adb shell rm /system/app/SdkSetup*Have you ever tried Genymotion? I\'ve read about it last week and it is great. They have several Android Images that you run (with their own software). The images are INCREDIBLY fast and they have Google Play installed on them. Check it out if it is the kind of thing that you need. http://www.genymotion.com/
