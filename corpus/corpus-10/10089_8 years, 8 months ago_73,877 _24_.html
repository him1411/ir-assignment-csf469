In JUnit 3, I could get the name of the currently running test like this:which would print "Current test is testSomething". Is there any out-of-the-box or simple way to do this in JUnit 4?Background: Obviously, I don\'t want to just print the name of the test. I want to load test-specific data that is stored in a resource with the same name as the test. You know, convention over configuration and all that.Thanks!JUnit 4.7 added this feature it seems using TestName-Rule. Looks like this will get you the method name:Since JUnit 4.9, the TestWatchman class has been deprecated in favour of the TestWatcher class, which has invocation:The following approach will print method names for all tests in a class:Consider using SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java) provides some neat improvements using parameterized messages. Combining SLF4J with JUnit 4 rule implementations can provide more efficient test class logging techniques.A convoluted way is to create your own Runner by subclassing org.junit.runners.BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.You can then do something like this:Then for each test class, you\'ll need to add a @RunWith(NameAwareRunner.class) annotation. Alternatively, you could put that annotation on a Test superclass if you don\'t want to remember it every time. This, of course, limits your selection of runners but that may be acceptable.Also, it may take a little bit of kung fu to get the current test name out of the Runner and into your framework, but this at least gets you the name.Try this instead:The output looks like this:NOTE: This DOES NOT work if your test is a subclass of TestCase!  The test runs but the @Rule code just never runs.JUnit 4 does not have any out-of-the-box mechanism for a test case to get it\xe2\x80\x99s own name (including during setup and teardown).In JUnit 5 there is dependency injection which simplifies meta data providing to test methods. For example:See more: JUnit 5 User guide, TestInfo javadoc.Based on the previous comment and further considering I created an extension of TestWather which you can use in your JUnit test methods with this:The test helper class is the next:Enjoy!I\'d suggest you decouple the test method name from your test data set. I would model a DataLoaderFactory class which loads/caches the sets of test data from your resources, and then in your test case cam call some interface method which returns a set of test data for the test case. Having the test data tied to the test method name assumes the test data can only be used once, where in most case i\'d suggest that the same test data in uses in multiple tests to verify various aspects of your business logic.   You can achieve this using Slf4j and TestWatcher
