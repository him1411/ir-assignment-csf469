I have some old branches in my git repository that are no longer under active development. I would like to archive the branches so that they don\'t show up by default when running git branch -l -r. I don\'t want to delete them, because I want to keep the history. How can I do this?I know that it\'s possible to create a ref outside of refs/heads. For example, refs/archive/old_branch. Are there any consequences of doing that?I believe the proper way to do this is to tag the branch. If you delete the branch after you have tagged it then you\'ve effectively kept the branch around but it won\'t clutter your branch list.If you need to go back to the branch just check out the tag. It will effectively restore the branch from the tag.To archive and delete the branch:To restore the branch some time later:The history of the branch will be preserved exactly as it was when you tagged it.Jeremy\'s answer is correct in principle, but IMHO the commands he specifies are not quite right.  Here\'s how to archive a branch to a tag without having to checkout the branch (and, therefore, without having to checkout to another branch before you can delete that branch):And here\'s how to restore a branch:You could archive the branches in another repository. Not quite as elegant, but I\'d say it\'s a viable alternative.Here is an alias for that:Add it like this:Bear in mind there is git archive command already so you cannot use archive as an alias name.Also you can define alias to view the list of the \'archived\' branches:about adding aliasesI am using following aliases to hide archived branches:So git br to show actively developed branches and git bra to show all branches including "archived" ones.Yes, you can create a ref with some non-standard prefix using git update-ref (e.g. git update-ref refs/archive/old-topic topic.) I have seen no problem so far.Benefits are: unlike normal branches or tags, these won\'t show up on usual git branch, git log nor git tag while you can see them with git log --all.I\'m using following aliases:Also you may want to configure remotes like push = +refs/archive/*:refs/archive/* to push automatically (or git push origin refs/archive/*:refs/archive/* for one-shot).Edit: Found a perl implementation of the same idea by @ap: git-atticEdit^2: Found a blog post where Gitster himself using the same technique.I would not archive branches.  Put another way, branches archive themselves.  What you want is to ensure the information relevant to archeologists can be found by reliable means.  Reliable in that they aid daily development and doesn\'t add an extra step to the process of getting work done.  That is, I don\'t believe people will remember to add a tag once they\'re done with a branch.Here\'s two simple steps that will greatly help archeology and development.That\'s it.  Why?  Because as a code archeologist, rarely do I start with wanting to know what work was done on a branch.  Far more often it\'s why in all the screaming nine hells is the code written this way?! I need to change code, but it has some odd features, and I need to puzzle them out to avoid breaking something important.The next step is git blame to find the associated commits and then hope the log message is explanatory.  If I need to dig deeper, I\'ll find out if the work was done in a branch and read the branch as a whole (along with its commentary in the issue tracker).Let\'s say git blame points at commit XYZ.  I open up a Git history browser (gitk, GitX, git log --decorate --graph, etc...), find commit XYZ and see...There\'s my branch!  I know QQ, UU, XYZ, JJ and MM are all part of the same branch and I should look at their log messages for details.  I know GG will be a merge commit and have the name of the branch which hopefully is associated with an issue in the tracker.If, for some reason, I want to find an old branch I can run git log and search for the branch name in the merge commit.  It is fast enough even on very large repositories.That is what I mean when I say that branches archives themselves.Tagging every branch adds unnecessary work to getting things done (a critical process which should be ruthlessly streamlined), gums up the tag list (not speaking of performance, but human readability) with hundreds of tags that are only very occasionally useful, and isn\'t even very useful for archeology.My approach is to rename all branches I don\'t care about with a "trash_" prefix, then use:To retain the coloring of the active branch, one would need:Extending Steve\'s answer to reflect the changes on the remote, I didTo restore from the remote, see this question.You can use a script that will archive the branch for you archbranchIt creates a tag for you with the prefix archive/ and then deletes the branch. But check the code before you use it.Usage - $/your/location/of/script/archbranch [branchname] [defaultbranch]If you want to run the script without writing the location to it add it to your pathThen you can call it byThe [defaultbranch] is the branch that it will go to when the archiving is done. There are some issues with the color coding but other then that it should work. I\'ve been using it in projects for a long time, but it is still under development.
