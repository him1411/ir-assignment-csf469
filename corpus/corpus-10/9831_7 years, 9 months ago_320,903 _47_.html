Is there a nice way in MySQL to replicate the SQL Server function ROW_NUMBER()?For example:Then I could, for example, add a condition to limit intRow to 1 to get a single row with the highest col3 for each (col1, col2) pair.I want the row with the single highest col3 for each (col1, col2) pair.That\'s a groupwise maximum, one of the most commonly-asked SQL questions (since it seems like it should be easy, but actually it kind of isn\'t).I often plump for a null-self-join:\xe2\x80\x9cGet the rows in the table for which no other row with matching col1,col2 has a higher col3.\xe2\x80\x9d (You will notice this and most other groupwise-maximum solutions will return multiple rows if more than one row has the same col1,col2,col3. If that\'s a problem you may need some post-processing.)There is no ranking functionality in MySQL.  The closest you can get is to use a variable:so how would that work in my case? I\'d need two variables, one for each of col1 and col2? Col2 would need resetting somehow when col1 changed..?Yes.  If it were Oracle, you could use the LEAD function to peak at the next value.  Thankfully, Quassnoi covers the logic for what you need to implement in MySQL.I always end up following this pattern. Given this table:You can get this result:By running this query, which doesn\'t need any variable defined:Hope that helps!Check out this Article, it shows how to mimic SQL ROW_NUMBER() with a partition by in MySQL.   I ran into this very same scenario in a WordPress Implementation. I needed ROW_NUMBER() and it wasn\'t there. http://www.explodybits.com/2011/11/mysql-row-number/The example in the article is using a single partition by field. To partition by additional fields you could do something like this: Using concat_ws handles null\'s. I tested this against 3 fields using an int, date, and varchar. Hope this helps. Check out the article as it breaks this query down and explains it.I would define a function:then I could do:Now you don\'t have a subquery, which you can\'t have in views.I would also vote for Mosty Mostacho\'s solution with minor modification to his query code:Which will give the same result:for the table:With the only difference that the query doesn\'t use JOIN and GROUP BY, relying on nested select instead.query for row_number in mysqlThe solution I found to work the best was using a subquery like this:The PARTITION BY columns just get compared with \'=\' and separated by AND.  The ORDER BY columns would be compared with \'<\' or \'>\', and separated by OR.I\'ve found this to be very flexible, even if it is a little bit costly.The rownumber functionality can\'t be mimicked. You might get the results you expect, but you\'ll most likely get disappointed at some stage.\nHere\'s what mysql documentation says:For other statements, such as SELECT, you might get the results you expect, but this is not guaranteed. In the following statement, you might think that MySQL will evaluate @a first and then do an assignment second:\n  SELECT @a, @a:=@a+1, ...;\n  However, the order of evaluation for expressions involving user variables is undefined. Regards,\nGeorgi.MariaDB 10.2 is implementing "Window Functions", including RANK(), ROW_NUMBER() and several other things:https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/window-functions/Based on a talk at Percona Live this month, they are reasonably well optimized.The syntax is identical to the code in the Question.There is no funtion like rownum, row_num() in MySQL but the way around is like below:A bit late but may also help to someone who looks for answers...Between rows/row_number example - recursive query that may be used in any SQL:This allows the same functionality that ROW_NUMBER() AND PARTITION BY provides to be achieved in MySQLAlso a bit late but today I had the same need so I did search on Google and finally a simple  general approach found here in Pinal Dave\'s article http://blog.sqlauthority.com/2014/03/09/mysql-reset-row-number-for-each-group-partition-by-row-number/I wanted to focus on Paul\'s original question (that was my problem as well) so I summarize my solution as a working example.Beacuse we want to partition over two column I would create a SET variable during the iteration to identify if a new group was started.The 3 means at the first parameter of MAKE_SET that I want both value in the SET (3=1|2).\nOf course if we do not have two or more columns constructing the groups we can eliminate the MAKE_SET operation. The construction is exactly the same. This is working for me as required. Many thanks to Pinal Dave for his clear demonstration.I don\'t see any simple answer covering the "PARTITION BY" part so here\'s mine :In this simple example I only put one but you can have several "PARTITION BY" partsThis Work perfectly for me to create RowNumber when we have more than one column.  In this case two column.
