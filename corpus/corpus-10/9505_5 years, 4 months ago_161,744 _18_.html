I\'m using Handlebars.js for client side view rendering.  If Else works great but I\'ve encountered a 3 way conditional that requires ELSE IF:This doesn\'t work:How do I do ELSE IF with handlebars?Handlebars supports {{else if}} blocks as of 3.0.0.Handlebars v3.0.0 or greater:Prior to Handlebars v3.0.0, however, you will have to either define a helper that handles the branching logic or nest if statements manually:I usually use this form:The spirit of handlebars is that it is "logicless". Sometimes this makes us feel like we are fighting with it, and sometimes we end up with ugly nested if/else logic. You could write a helper; many people augment handlebars with a "better" conditional operator or believe that it should be part of the core. I think, though, that instead of this,you might want to arrange things in your model so that you can have this,Just make sure that only one of these flags is ever true. Chances are, if you are using this if/elsif/else in your view, you are probably using it somewhere else too, so these variables might not end up being superfluous.Keep it lean.Handlebars now supports {{else if}} as of 3.0.0.\nTherefore, your code should now work.You can see an example under "conditionals" (slightly revised here with an added {{else}}:http://handlebarsjs.com/block_helpers.htmlI wrote this simple helper:It\'s something like Chain Of Responsibility pattern in HandlebarsExample:It\'s not a else if but in some cases it may help you)
