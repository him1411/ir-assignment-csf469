I can\'t compile/debug our Android app, because the localization files are not perfect yet.My IDE\'s validation tool Lint create errors saying:newCardsOrderVals is not translated in ar, bg, ca, csCompiling/installing/running with Ant works fine, but I would like to use my IDE to ease debugging.Is there a way to turn off this particular check, or ideally make it a warning rather than an error?I understand that before release we will really need to get localisation files right, but for the time being it is not a priority as the screens themselves are being modified very frequently.Android Studio:Eclipse:Find the MissingTranslation line, and set it to Warning as seen below:You can set the attribute translatable="false" on the  definition like this:For more information: http://tools.android.com/recent/non-translatablestringsTo ignore this in a gradle build add this to the android section of your build file: This will cause Lint to ignore the missing translation error for ALL strings in the file, yet other string resource files can be verified if needed.If you want to turn off the warnings about the specific strings, you can use the following:strings.xmlIf you want to warn on specific strings instead of an error, you will need to build a custom Lint rule to adjust the severity status for a specific thing.http://tools.android.com/tips/lint-custom-rulesInsert in the lint.xml file this:For more details: Suppressing Lint Warnings.add the lines in your /res/values.xml file in resource root tab like this:tools:locale set the local language to English, no need of language translation later on that for all resource strings and tools:ignore let Lint to isnore the missing translations of the resource string values.Add following at the header of your strings.xml fileThis lets you tell the tools which language you\'re using in your base values folder. For strings in values-de or values-en folder it\'s obvious, but not in the base "values" folder. Lint will use the locale information to pick the right dictionary when looking for misspells in your default strings.In addition,Not project dependent properities, Eclipse Preferences.\nIn Mac, Eclipse > Preferences Another approach is to indicate the languages you intend to support and filter out the rest using the \'resConfigs\' option with Gradle. Check out this other answer for detailsThis is better, I think, because you don\'t have to completely ignore legitimate translation mistakes for languages you actually want to supportYou can also put resources which you do not want to translate to file called donottranslate.xml.Example and explanation: http://tools.android.com/recent/non-translatablestringsMany of them has a given a different working answers, and i too got the same lint errors\ni make it ignore by doing the following with eclipse.Thats it.The following worked for me.
