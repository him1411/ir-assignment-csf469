When getting file names in a certain folder:by fi.Name we get a file name with its extension: file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txtHow better to get file names without file extensions file1, file2, file3?You can use Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension:Although I am surprised there isn\'t a way to get this directly from the FileInfo (or at least I can\'t see it).Use Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension().This solution also prevents the addition of a trailing comma.I dislike the DirectoryInfo, FileInfo for this scenario.DirectoryInfo and FileInfo collect more data about the folder and the files than is needed so they take more time and memory than necessary.Use Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension. Path is in System.IO namespace.As an additional answer (or to compound on the existing answers) you could write an extension method to accomplish this for you within the DirectoryInfo class. Here is a sample that I wrote fairly quickly that could be embellished to provide directory names or other criteria for modification, etc:Edit: I also think this method could probably be simplified or awesome-ified if it used LINQ to achieve the construction of the array, but I don\'t have the experience in LINQ to do it quickly enough for a sample of this kind.Edit 2 (almost 4 years later): Here is the LINQ-ified method I would use:if file name contains directory and you need to not lose directory:Just for the record:DirectoryInfo di = new DirectoryInfo(currentDirName);\n    FileInfo[] smFiles = di.GetFiles("*.txt");\n    string fileNames = String.Join(", ", smFiles.Select<FileInfo, string>(fi => Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(fi.FullName)));\nThis way you don\'t use StringBuilder but String.Join(). Also please remark that Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension() needs a full path (fi.FullName), not as I saw in one of the answers fi.Name.This returns the file name only without the extension type. You can also change it so you get both name and the type of filesource:https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.path(v=vs.110).aspxFileInfo knows its own extension, so you could just remove itor if you\'re paranoid that it might appear in the middle, or want to microoptimize:
