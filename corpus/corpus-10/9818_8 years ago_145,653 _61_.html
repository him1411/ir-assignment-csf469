How would you find a particular class name inside lots of jar files?(Looking for the actual class name, not the classes that reference it.)Eclipse can do it, just create a (temporary) project and put your libraries on the projects classpath. Then you can easily find the classes.Another tool, that comes to my mind, is Java Decompiler. It can open a lot of jars at once and helps to find classes as well. Use the jar (or unzip -v), grep, and find commands.For example, the following will list all the class files that match a given name:If you know the entire list of Java archives you want to search, you could place them all in the same directory using (symbolic) links.Or use find (case sensitively) to find the JAR file that contains a given class name:For example, to find the name of the archive containing IdentityHashingStrategy:If the JAR could be anywhere in the system and the locate command is available:Open a command prompt, change to the directory (or ancestor directory) containing the JAR files, then:Here\'s how it works:Use a search engine that scans JAR files.some time ago, I wrote a program just for that: https://github.com/javalite/jar-explorergives you the name of the jargives you the package of the classI didn\'t know of a utility to do it when I came across this problem, so I wrote the following:To locate jars that match a given string:find . -name \\*.jar -exec grep -l YOUR_CLASSNAME {} \\;There are also two different utilities called both "JarScan" that do exactly what you are asking for:\nJarScan (inetfeedback.com) and JarScan (java.net)user1207523\'s script works fine for me. Here is a variant that searches for jar files recusively using find instead of simple expansion;I found this new waySo this lists the jar and the class if found, if you want you can give ls -1 *.jar or input to xargs with find command HTH Someone.I\'ve always used this on Windows and its worked exceptionally well.findstr.exe comes standard with Windows and the params:Hope this helps someone.Check JBoss Tattletale; although I\'ve never used it personally, this seems to be the tool you need.Not sure why scripts here have never really worked for me. This works:To search all jar files in a given directory for a particular class, you can do this:or, even simpler,Output looks like this:It\'s very fast because the -F option means search for Fixed string, so it doesn\'t load the the regex engine for each grep invocation.  If you need to, you can always omit the -F option and use regexes.A bash script solution using unzip (zipinfo). Tested on Ubuntu 12.Script to find jar file: find_jar.shUsage: ./find_jar.sh < top-level directory containing jar files > < Class name to find>This is similar to most answers given here. But it only outputs the file name, if grep finds something. If you want to suppress grep output you may redirect that to /dev/null but I prefer seeing the output of grep as well so that I can use partial class names and figure out the correct one from a list of output shown.The class name can be both simple class name Like "String" or fully qualified name like "java.lang.String"You can find a class in a directory full of jars with a bit of shell:Looking for class "FooBar":Basically let me look at the root of the problem brought up.\nIf you are on a new project - why not come to the PM or technical lead and ask him - how does he track dependencies?One thing to add to all of the above: if you don\'t have the jar executable available (it comes with the JDK but not with the JRE), you can use unzip (or WinZip, or whatever) to accomplish the same thing.Just use FindClassInJars util, it\'s a simple swing program, but useful. You can check source code or download jar file at http://code.google.com/p/find-class-in-jars/shameless self promotion, but you can try a utility I wrote : http://sourceforge.net/projects/zfindIt supports most common archive/compressed files (jar, zip, tar, tar.gz etc) and unlike many other jar/zip finders, supports nested zip files (zip within zip, jar within jar etc) till unlimited depth.A bit late to the party, but nevertheless...I\'ve been using JarBrowser to find in which jar a particular class is present.  It\'s got an easy to use GUI which allows you to browse through the contents of all the jars in the selected path.Following script will help you outTo add yet another too... this is a very simple and useful tool for windows. A simple exe file you click on, give it a directory to search in, a class name and it will find the jar file that contains that class. Yes, it\'s recursive.http://sourceforge.net/projects/jarfinder/This one works well in MinGW ( windows bash environment ) ~ gitbashPut this function into your .bashrc file in your HOME directory:Grepj is a command line utility to search for classes within jar files. I am the author of the utility.You can run the utility like grepj package.Class my1.jar my2.war my3.earMultiple jar, ear, war files can be provided. For advanced usage use find to provide a list of jars to be searched.Check this Plugin for eclipse which can do the job you are looking for.https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/jarchiveexplorerUnder a Linux environment you could do the following :Where name is the name of the class file that you are looking inside the jars distributed across the hierarchy of directories rooted at the base_dir.You can use locate and grep:Make sure you run updatedb before using locate.Use this.. you can find any file in classpath.. guaranteed..
