Is it possible write string or log into the console?Just like in jsp, if we print something like system.out.println("some") it will be there at console not at page.FirefoxOn Firefox you can use an extension called FirePHP which enables the logging and dumping of information from your PHP applications to the console. This is an addon to the awesome web development extension Firebug.ChromeHowever if you are using Chrome there is a PHP debugging tool called webug or Chrome Logger.More recently Clockwork is in active development which extends the Developer Tools by adding a new panel to provide useful debugging and profiling information. It provides out of the box support for Laravel 4 and Slim 2 and support can be added via its extensible API. Using XdebugA better way to debug your PHP would be via Xdebug. Most browsers provide helper extensions to help you pass the required cookie/query string to initialize the debugging process. Or you use the trick from this website\nPHP Debug to consoleFirst you need a little PHP helper functionThen you can use it like thisThis will create an ouput like this:If you\'re looking for a simple approach, echo as JSON:By default, all output goes to stdout, which is the HTTP response or the console, depending on whether your script is run by Apache or manually on the command line. But you can use error_log for logging and various I/O streams can be written to with fwrite.Try this it is working : Some great answers that add more depth; but I needed something simpler and more like the JS console.log() command.I use PHP in a lot of "gathering data and turn into xml" in AJAX application.  the JS console.log doesn\'t work in that case; it breaks the xml output. (Maybe someone has a solution for this?)Xdebug etc had similar issues.My solution in Windows:This solution is simple, meets my needs most the time, standard PHP, and the preview pane automatically updates every time PHP writes to it.I find this helpful:And use it like:Which outputs in console:And you can switch off less important logs by limiting them using $debug valueAs author of the linked webpage int the popular answer above I would like to add my last version of this simple helper function, much more solid.I use json_encode() to make a check for the var type not necessary and add also a buffer to solve problems with frameworks, there not have a solid return or excessive usage of header(). Also a simple example as image to understand much easier.Short and easy, for arrays, strings or also objects.I think it can be used --If you want write to the PHP log file, and not the JavaScript console you can use this: error_log ( "This is logged only to the PHP log" )Reference: http://php.net/manual/en/function.error-log.phpFor Chrome there is an extension called Chrome Logger allowing to log PHP messages.The Firefox DevTools even have integrated support for the Chrome Logger protocol.To enable the logging, you just need to save the \'ChromePhp.php\' file in your project. Then it can be used like this:Example taken from the GitHub page.The output may then look like this:There is also great Google Chrome extension PHP Console with php library  that allows to:I have abandoned all of the above in favour of http://phptoolcase.com/guides/ptc-debug-guide.html I cannot praise it enough!Just click on one of the tabs at top right, or on the "click here" to expand/hide.Notice the different "categories". You can click any array to expand/collpase it.Fromn the web page"Main Features:"\nGreat post thank you, I was looking for a way to debug code in a Wordpress plugin that I was developing and came across this post.I took the bits of code that are most applicable to me from the responses above  and combined these into a function that I can use for debugging Wordpress. The function is:Usage is as follows:I hope someone else finds this function useful.If this function is used with Wordpress development, the function should be placed in the functions.php file of the child theme and can then be called anywhere in the code.PHP and Javascript Interaction.Any of these two are working:As of 2017, firebug and hence firephp has been disabled.I wrote some little modifications to the chromephp tool to allow seamless migration from firephp to firebug for debuging via the console.This article explains in clear easy stepshttps://medium.com/@kudehinbuoluwaponle/migrate-from-firephp-to-chromephp-in-5-minutes-without-breaking-existing-code-e4afd1b28c5cCreates awith the so that the div is not displayed, but the function is created in javascript. So you get the message in the console.
