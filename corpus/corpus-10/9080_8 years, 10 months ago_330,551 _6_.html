This question already has an answer here:Can we convert a hex string to a byte array using a built-in function in C# or do I have to make a custom method for this?Here\'s a nice fun LINQ example.I did some research and found out that byte.Parse is even slower than Convert.ToByte.\nThe fastest conversion I could come up with uses approximately 15 ticks per byte.// also works on .NET Micro Framework where (in SDK4.3) byte.Parse(string) only permits integer formats.I think this may work.
