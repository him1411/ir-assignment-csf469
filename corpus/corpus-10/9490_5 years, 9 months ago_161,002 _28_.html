Does IntelliJ have an Organize Imports feature similar to that in Eclipse?\nWhat I have is a Java file with multiple classes missing their imports. Example:In Eclipse I could use Organize Imports and it would automatically import both java.util.Map and javax.swing.JTable. In IntelliJ I have to individually go to each class, select it, then press Alt-Enter. There is an Optimize Imports feature but all it seems to do is sort and expand the existing imports.I\'m using IntelliJ 10.5.Ctrl + Alt + O (Code \xe2\x86\x92 Optimize Imports...) is what you\'re looking for.It says "Optimize", but, if configured to do so, it will also: You can tune the auto-import settings under "Settings \xe2\x86\x92 Editor \xe2\x86\x92 Auto Import" as described by Dave.Under "Settings -> Editor -> Auto Import" there are several options regarding automatic imports. Only unambiguous imports may be added automatically; this is one of the options.Simple & short solution worked for me.Go to File -> Settings -> Editor -> Auto Import -> Java (left panel) and make the below things:\nSelect check box for  "Add unambigious imports on the fly" and "Optimize imports on the fly"Refer this.In addition to Optimize Imports and Auto Import, which were pointed out by @dave-newton and @ryan-stewart in earlier answers, go to:There you can fine tune the grouping and order or imports, "Class count to use import with \'*\'", etc.Note:\nsince IDEA 13 you can configure the project default settings from the IDEA "start page": Configure > Project defaults > Settings > .... Then every new project will have those default settings:\nJuly 2015 - I have concluded that IntelliJ does not support automatically resolving imports with a single function. "Organize imports" simply removes unused imports, it does not resolve unimported types. Control-Space resolves a single unimported type. There does not exist a single action to resolve all types\' imports.In IntelliJ 14, the path to the settings for Auto Import has changed. The path is IntelliJ IDEA->Preferences->Editor->General->Auto Importthen follow the instructions above, clicking \n  Add unambiguous imports on the flyI can\'t imagine why this wouldn\'t be set by default.navigate to the file where you want to organize imports or just click on the whole package or even click on the project than press CTRL + ALT + OJust move your mouse over the missing view and hit keys on windows ALT + ENTERALT+ENTER was far from eclipse habit ,in IDEA for me mouse over did not work , so in setting>IDESetting>Keymap>Show intention actions and quick-fixes I changed it to mouse left click , It did not support mouse over! but mouse left click was OK and closest to my intention.Shortcut for the Mac: (ctrl + opt + o)I finally created a workaround around this frustrating issue. I\'m not completely happy with the workaround, but it\'s better than nothing. Basically, after you paste the source code and unambigous imports are fixed, just press F2 to highlight the next compiler error. If the current error is an import-missing error, press Alt+Enter, then Enter to select the Import option, then pick the correct import. Then, press F2 again.If you are missing just one import (the class name has red underline), click and hover the mouse over it, and a blue suggested import statement will appear. If you hit, Alt + Enter at this point, the import will be included in the file and the red underline should disappear. That plugin will automatically do the "organize import" action on file save: https://github.com/dubreuia/intellij-plugin-save-actions.To install: "File > Settings > Plugins > Browse repositories... > Search \'Save Actions\' > Category \'Code tools\'". Then activate the "organize import" save action.
