I want to custom-style a scrollbar with CSS.I use this WebKit CSS code, which works well for Safari and Chrome:How can I do the same thing for Firefox? (I know I can easily do it using jQuery, but I would prefer to do it with CSS if it\'s doable.) Would be grateful for somebody\'s expert advice!There\'s no Firefox equivalent to ::-webkit-scrollbar and friends.You\'ll have to stick with JavaScript.Plenty of people would like this feature, see: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=77790This report is asking for the exact same thing you\'re asking for: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=547260It was closed as a duplicate of the first report I linked to.As far as JavaScript replacements go, you can try:I thought I would share my findings in case someone is considering a JQuery plugin to do the job.I gave JQuery Custom Scrollbar a go. It\'s pretty fancy and does some smooth scrolling (with scrolling inertia) and has loads of parameters you can tweak, but it ended up being a bit too CPU intensive for me (and it adds a fair amount to the DOM).Now I\'m giving Perfect Scrollbar a go. It\'s simple and lightweight (6KB) and it\'s doing a decent job so far. It\'s not CPU intensive at all (as far as I can tell) and adds very little to your DOM. It\'s only got a couple of parameters to tweak (wheelSpeed and wheelPropagation), but it\'s all I need and it handles updates to the scrolling content nicely (such as loading images).P.S. I did have a quick look at JScrollPane, but @simone is right, it\'s a bit dated now and a PITA.May I offer an alternative?No scripting whatsoever, only standardized css styles and a little bit of creativity. Short answer - masking parts of the existing browser scrollbar, which means you retain all of it\'s functionality.For demo and a little bit more in-depth explanation, check here...jsfiddle.net/aj7bxtjz/1/It works in user-style, and it seems not to work in web pages. I have not found official direction from Mozilla on this. While it may have worked at some point, Firefox does not have official support for this.
