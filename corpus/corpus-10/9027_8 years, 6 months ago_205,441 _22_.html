I have a bash script that runs a program with parameters.  That program outputs some status (doing this, doing that...).  There is no option for this program to be quiet.  How can I prevent the script from displaying anything?I am looking for something like windows "echo off".The following sends standard output to the null device (bit bucket).and if you also want error messages to be sent there, use one of (the first may not work in all shells):and, if you want to record the messages but not see them, replace /dev/null with an actual file, such as:For completeness, under Windows cmd.exe (where "nul" is the equivalent of "/dev/null"), it is :Something likeThis will prevent standard output and error output, redirecting them both to /dev/null.Try: is short for "do nothing".$() is just your command.Like andynormancx post use this: (if you\'re working in an Unix environment)or you can use this: (if you\'re working in a Windows environment)An alternative that may fit in some situations is to assign the result of a command to a variable:Since Bash and other POSIX commandline interpreters does not consider variable assignments as a command, the present command\'s return code is respected.With Bash Scripting, how can I suppress all output from a command?\nIMHO, I believe that you can achieve simple using this redirection, as observed in the first answer, and nothing else:\nThis example from The Linux Documentation Project is worth to mention also:3.6 Sample: stderr and stdout 2 fileThis will place every output of a program to a file. This is suitable sometimes for cron entries, if you want a command to pass in absolute silence.In you script you can add the following to the lines that you know are going to give an output:Or else you can also try
