Given the following code (that doesn\'t work):Is there a way to make this work? Or do I have do one check to break out of the input loop, then another, more limited, check in the outside loop to break out all together if the user is satisfied?Edit-FYI: get_input is a short function I wrote that supports showing a prompt and default values and all that fanciness and returns stdin.readline().strip()My first instinct would be to refactor the nested loop into a function and use return to break out. PEP 3136 proposes labeled break/continue.  Guido rejected it because "code so complicated to require this feature is very rare".  The PEP does mention some workarounds, though (such as the exception technique), while Guido feels refactoring to use return will be simpler in most cases.Here\'s another approach that is short. The disadvantage is that you can only break the outer loop, but sometimes it\'s exactly what you want.First, ordinary logic is helpful.  If, for some reason, the terminating conditions can\'t be worked out, exceptions are a fall-back plan.  For this specific example, an exception may not be necessary.  On other other hand, we often have "Y", "N" and "Q" options in character-mode applications.  For the "Q" option, we want an immediate exit.  That\'s more exceptional.I tend to agree that refactoring into a function is usually the best approach for this sort of situation, but for when you really need to break out of nested loops, here\'s an interesting variant of the exception-raising approach that @S.Lott described.  It uses Python\'s with statement to make the exception raising look a bit nicer.  Define a new context manager (you only have to do this once) with:Now you can use this context manager as follows:Advantages: (1) it\'s slightly cleaner (no explicit try-except block), and (2) you get a custom-built Exception subclass for each use of nested_break;  no need to declare your own Exception subclass each time.First, you may also consider making the process of getting and validating the input a function; within that function, you can just return the value if its correct, and keep spinning in the while loop if not.  This essentially obviates the problem you solved, and can usually be applied in the more general case (breaking out of multiple loops).  If you absolutely must keep this structure in your code, and really don\'t want to deal with bookkeeping booleans...You may also use goto in the following way (using an April Fools module from here):I know, I know, "thou shalt not use goto" and all that, but it works well in strange cases like this.Introduce a new variable that you\'ll use as a \'loop breaker\'. First assign something to it(False,0, etc.), and then, inside the outer loop, before you break from it, change the value to something else(True,1,...). Once the loop exits make the \'parent\' loop check for that value. Let me demonstrate:If you have an infinite loop, this is the only way out; for other loops execution is really a lot faster. This also works if you have many nested loops. You can exit all, or just a few. Endless possibilities! Hope this helped!or something like that. You could set a variable in the inner loop, and check it in the outer loop immediately after the inner loop exits, breaking if appropriate. I kinda like the GOTO method, provided you don\'t mind using an April Fool\'s joke module - its not Pythonic, but it does make sense.This isn\'t the prettiest way to do it, but in my opinion, it\'s the best way.  I\'m pretty sure you could work out something using recursion here as well, but I dunno if that\'s a good option for you.Factor your loop logic into an iterator that yields the loop variables and returns when done -- here is a simple one that lays out images in rows/columns until we\'re out of images or out of places to put them:This has the advantage of splitting up the complicated loop logic and the processing...And why not to keep looping if two conditions are true?\nI think this is a more pythonic way:Isn\'t it?All the best.In this case, as pointed out by others as well, functional decomposition is the way to go. Code in Python 3:There is a hidden trick in the Python while ... else structure which can be used to simulate the double break without much code changes/additions.  In essence if the while condition is false, the else block is triggered. Neither exceptions, continue or break trigger the else block. For more information see answers to "Else clause on Python while statement", or Python doc on while (v2.7).The only downside is that you need to move the double breaking condition into the while condition (or add a flag variable). Variations of this exists also for the for loop, where the else block is triggered after loop completion.Another way of reducing your iteration to a single-level loop would be via the use of generators as also specified in the python referenceYou could scale it up to any number of levels for the loopThe downside is that you can no longer break only a single level. It\'s all or nothing.Another downside is that it doesn\'t work with a while loop. I originally wanted to post this answer on Python - `break` out of all loops but unfortunately that\'s closed as a duplicate of this one My reason for coming here is that i had an outer loop and an inner loop like so:As you can see, it won\'t actually go to the next x, but will go to the next y instead.what i found to solve this simply was to run through the array twice instead:I know this was a specific case of OP\'s question, but I am posting it in the hope that it will help someone think about their problem differently while keeping things simple.Similar like the one before, but more compact.\n(Booleans are just numbers)probably little trick like below will do if not prefer to refactorial into functionadded 1 break_level variable to control the while loop conditionYou can define a variable( for example break_statement ), then change it to a different value when two-break condition occurs and use it in if statement to break from second loop also.    I\'d like to remind you that functions in Python can be created right in the middle of the code and can access the surrounding variables transparently for reading and with nonlocal or global declaration for writing.So you can use a function as a "breakable control structure", defining a place you want to return to:Hopefully this helps:This will get out of the three while loops
