Whenever I run this code, I consistently get an error saying No module Named requests:The error I get:Requests is not a built in module (does not come with the default python installation), so you will have to install it: Use $ sudo pip install requests if you have  pip installedOn OSX you can also use sudo easy_install -U requests if you have easy_install installed.Use > Path\\easy_install.exe requests  if you have a windows machine, where easy_install can be found in your Python*\\Scripts folder, if it was installed. (Note Path\\easy_install.exe is an example, mine is C:\\Python32\\Scripts\\easy_install.exe)If you don\'t have easy install and are running on a windows machine, you can get it here: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#distributeIf you manually want to add a library to a windows machine, you can download the compressed library, uncompress it, and then place it into the Lib folder of your python path.For any missing library, the source is usually available at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/. You can download requests here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requestsOn mac osx and windows, after downloading the source zip, uncompress it and from the termiminal/cmd run python setup.py install from the uncompressed dir.It\'s not obvious to me which version of Python you are using.If it\'s Python 3, a solution would be pip3 install requests To install requests on Debian/Ubuntu:apt-get install python-requestsI had the same issue, so I copied the folder named "requests" from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests#downloadsrequests download to \n"/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages". \nNow when you use: import requests, it should work fine.If you are using Ubuntu, there is need to install requestsrun this command:if you face permission denied error, use sudo before command:In my case requests was already installed, but needed an upgrade. The following command did the trickFor windows just give path as cd and path to the "Scripts" of python and then execute the command easy_install.exe requests.Then try import requests...Adding Third-party Packages to the ApplicationFollow this link \nhttps://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/libraries27?hl=en#vendoringstep1 : Have a file by named a file named appengine_config.py in the root of your project, then add these lines:from google.appengine.ext import vendorvendor.add(\'lib\') Step 2: create a directory and name it "lib" under root directory of project.step 3: use pip install -t lib requestsstep 4 : deploy to app engine.On Windows Open Command LineI have had this issue a couple times in the past few months.  I haven\'t seen a good solution for fedora systems posted, so here\'s yet another solution.  I\'m using RHEL7, and I discovered the following:If you have urllib3 installed via pip, and requests installed via yum you will have issues, even if you have the correct packages installed.  The same will apply if you have urllib3 installed via yum, and requests installed via pip.  Here\'s what I did to fix the issue:(confirm that all those libraries have been removed)Just be aware that this will only work for systems that are running Fedora, Redhat, or CentOS.Sources:\n This very question (in the comments to this answer).\n This github issue.I have installed python2.7 and python3.6  Open Command Line to ~/.bash_profile  I find that #Setting PATH for Python 3.6 , So\nI change the path to PATH="/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.13/bin:${PATH}" , \n(please make sure your python2.7\'s path) ,then save.\nIt works for me.you can also use pip install on windows by first locating the pip3.exe file in the directory:\nsay for me==>  cd c:\\python34\\scripts\nthen run ==> pip3 install requests
