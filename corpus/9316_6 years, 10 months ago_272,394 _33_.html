I use in_array() to check whether a value exists in an array like below,but what about an multidimensional array (below) - how can I check that value whether it exists in the multi-array?or I shouldn\'t be using in_array() when comes to the multidimensional array?in_array() does not work on multidimensional arrays. You could write a recursive function to do that for you:Usage:This will work too.Usage:This will do it:in_array only operates on a one dimensional array, so you need to loop over each sub array and run in_array on each.As others have noted, this will only for for a 2-dimensional array.  If you have more nested arrays, a recursive version would be better.  See the other answers for examples of that.if your array like thisUse thisexample : echo in_multiarray("22", $array,"Age");If you know which column to search against, you can use array_search() and array_column():This idea is in the comments section for array_search() on the PHP manual;Great function, but it didnt work for me until i added the if($found) { break; } to the elseifYou could always serialize your multi-dimensional array and do a strpos:Various docs for things I used:Here is my proposition based on json_encode() solution with :If word not found, it still returns 0 equal to false.Hope it helps.I believe you can just use array_key_exists nowadays:This is the first function of this type that I found in the php manual for in_array. Functions in the comment sections aren\'t always the best but if it doesn\'t do the trick you can look in there too :)It works too creating first a new unidimensional Array from the original one.Shorter version, for multidimensional arrays created based on database result sets.Will return if the $os_list array contains \'XP\' in the os_version field.I was looking for a function that would let me search for  both strings and arrays (as needle) in the array (haystack), so I added to the answer by @jwueller.Here\'s my code:what about array_search? seems it quite faster than foreach according to https://gist.github.com/Ocramius/1290076 ..you can use like thishttp://php.net/manual/tr/function.array-intersect.phpPlease try:Im not sure about the need, but this might work for your requirement
