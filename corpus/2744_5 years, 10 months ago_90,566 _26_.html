I\'d like Sublime 2 editor to treat *.sbt files (to highlight syntax) as Scala language, same as *.scala, but I can\'t find where to set this up. Do you happen to know?In Sublime Text (confirmed in both v2.x and v3.x) there is a menu command:View -> Syntax -> Open all with current extension as ...I\'ve found the answer (by further examining the Sublime 2 config files structure):I was to open And edit it to add sbt (the extension of files I want to be opened as Scala code files) to the array after the fileTypes key:PS: May there be a better way, something like a right place to put my customizations (insted of modifying packages themselves), I\'d still like to know.I put my customized changes in the User package:Which also means it\'s in JSON format:This is the same place themenu item adds it (creating the file if it doesn\'t exist).There\'s an excellent plugin called ApplySyntax (previously DetectSyntax) that provides certain other niceties for file-syntax matching. allows regex expressions etc.for ST3$language = "language u wish"if exists, go to ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User/$language.sublime-settingselsecreate ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User/$language.sublime-settingsand set{\n    "extensions":\n    [\n        "yourextension"\n    ]\n}This way allows you to enable syntax for composite extensions (e.g. sql.mustache, js.php, etc ... ) There is a quick method to set the synatx:\nCtrl+Shift+P,then type in the input boxss  + \xef\xbc\x88which type you want set\xef\xbc\x89 eg:  ss html +Enterand ss means "set synatx"it\'s really quicker than check in the menu\'s checkbox
