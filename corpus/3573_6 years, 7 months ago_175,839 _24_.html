The central repository had to be set up on a new server, so I created a new remote on my local repo, and pushed to that.But now when I do git pull, it claims I am up to date. It\'s wrongâ€”it\'s telling me about the old remote branch, not the new one, which I know for a fact has new commits to fetch.How do I change my local branch to track a different remote?I can see this in the git config file but I don\'t want to mess things up.Without deleting anything, using git v1.8.0 or later:\ngit branch branch_name --set-upstream-to your_new_remote/branch_name Or you can use the -u switch:\ngit branch branch_name -u your_new_remote/branch_nameUsing git up to v1.7.12:\ngit branch --set-upstream branch_name your_new_remote/branch_nameFor me the fix was:Then:If you\'re sane about it, editing the config file\'s safe enough. If you want to be a little more paranoid, you can use the porcelain command to modify it:Of course, if you look at the config before and after, you\'ll see that it did exactly what you were going to do.But in your individual case, what I\'d do is:That is, if the new server is going to be the canonical remote, why not call it origin as if you\'d originally cloned from it?With an up to date git (2.5.5) the command is the following : This will update the remote tracked branch for your current local branchAnother option to have a lot of control over what\'s happening is to edit your configurations by hand:or the shorthandThen edit the file at will, save and your modifications will be applied.You could either delete your current branch and do:Or change change remote server to the current one in the configorBased on what I understand from the latest git documentation, the synopsis is: This usage seems to be a bit different than urschrei\'s answer, as in his the synopsis is: I\'m guessing they changed the documentation again?
