I want to get the name of the currently running program, that is the executable name of the program. In C/C++ you get it from args[0].System.AppDomain.CurrentDomain.FriendlyName - Returns the filename with extension (e.g. MyApp.exe).  System.Diagnostics.Process.GetCurrentProcess().ProcessName - Returns the filename without extension (e.g. MyApp).System.Diagnostics.Process.GetCurrentProcess().MainModule.FileName - Returns the full path and filename (e.g. C:\\Examples\\Processes\\MyApp.exe).  You could then pass this into System.IO.Path.GetFileName() or System.IO.Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension() to achieve the same results as the above.System.Diagnostics.Process.GetCurrentProcess() gets the currently running process. You can use the ProcessName property to figure out the name. Below is a sample console app.This should suffice:This is the code which worked for me:All the examples above gave me the processName with vshost or the running dll name.Try this:This returns you a System.Reflection.Assembly instance that has all the data you could ever want to know about the current application.  I think that the Location property might get what you are after specifically.will give you FileName of your app like; "MyApplication.exe"Why nobody suggested this, its simple.Couple more options:When uncertain or in doubt, run in circles, scream and shout. I can\'t claim to have tested each option, but it doesn\'t do anything stupid like returning the vhost during debugging sessions.IF you are looking for the full path information of your executable, the reliable way to do it is to use the following:This eliminates any issues with intermediary dlls, vshost, etc.If you need the Program name to set up a firewall rule, use:This will ensure that the name is correct both when debugging in VisualStudio and when running the app directly in windows.You can use Environment.GetCommandLineArgs() to obtain the arguments and Environment.CommandLine to obtain the actual command line as entered.Also, you can use Assembly.GetEntryAssembly() or Process.GetCurrentProcess().However, when debugging, you should be careful as this final example may give your debugger\'s executable name (depending on how you attach the debugger) rather than your executable, as may the other examples.Is this what you want:Try Application.ExecutablePathSuper easy, here:On .Net Core (or Mono), most of the answers won\'t apply when the binary defining the process is the runtime binary of Mono or .Net Core (dotnet) and not your actual application you\'re interested in. In that case, use this:For windows apps (forms and console) I use this:Add a reference to System.Windows.Forms in VS then:This works correctly for me whether I am running the actual executable or debugging within VS.Note that it returns the application name without the extension.John
