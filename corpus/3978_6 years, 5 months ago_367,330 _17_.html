I am trying to urlencode this string before I submit. You need to pass your parameters into urlencode() as either a mapping (dict), or a sequence of 2-tuples, like:What you\'re looking for is urllib.quote_plus:In Python 3, the urllib package has been broken into smaller components. You\'ll use urllib.parse (note the parse child module)The following is a complete solution, including how to deal with some pitfalls.Try requests instead of urllib and you don\'t need to bother with urlencode!EDIT:If you need ordered name-value pairs or multiple values for a name then set params like so:instead of using a dictionary.Python 3:urllib.parse.quote_plus(string, safe=\'\', encoding=None, errors=None)Note that the urllib.urlencode does not always do the trick. The problem is that some services care about the order of arguments, which gets lost when you create the dictionary. For such cases, urllib.quote_plus is better, as Ricky suggested.Try this:urlencode won\'t work because it only works on dictionaries. quote_plus didn\'t produce the correct output.In Python 3, this worked with mefor future references (ex: for python3)urllib.urlencode()
