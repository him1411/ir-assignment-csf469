I am developing a webapp using Spring MVC 3 and have the DispatcherServlet catching all requests to \'/\' like so (web.xml):Now this works as advertised, however how can I handle static content? Previously, before using RESTful URLs, I would have caught all *.html for example and sent that to the DispatcherServlet, but now it\'s a different ball game.I have a /static/ folder which includes /styles/, /js/, /images/ etc and I would like to exclude /static/* from the DispatcherServlet.Now I could get static resources working when I did this:But I want it to have nice URLs (the point of me using Spring MVC 3) not the landing page being www.domain.com/app/I also don\'t want a solution coupled to tomcat or any other servlet container, and because this is (relatively) low traffic I don\'t need a webserver (like apache httpd) infront.Is there a clean solution to this?Since I spent a lot of time on this issue, I thought I\'d share my solution. Since spring 3.0.4, there is a configuration parameter that is called <mvc:resources/> (more about that on the reference documentation website) which can be used to serve static resources while still using the DispatchServlet on your site\'s root.In order to use this, use a directory structure that looks like the following:The contents of the files should look like:src/springmvc/web/HelloWorldController.java:WebContent/WEB-INF/web.xml:WebContent/WEB-INF/springmvc-servlet.xml:WebContent/jsp/index.jsp:Hope this helps :-)This problem is solved in spring 3.0.4.RELEASE where you can use \n<mvc:resources mapping="..." location="..."/> \nconfiguration element in your spring dispatcher configuration file.Check Spring DocumentationIn Spring 3.0.x add the following to your servlet-config.xml (the file that is configured in web.xml as the contextConfigLocation. You need to add the mvc namespace as well but just google for that if you don\'t know how! ;)That works for meRegardsAyub MalikIf I understand your issue correctly, I think I have found a solution to your problem:I had the same issue where raw output was shown with no css styles, javascripts or jquery files found.I just added mappings to the "default" servlet. The following was added to the web.xml file:This should filter out the javascript and css file requests from the DispatcherRequest object.Again, not sure if this is what you are after, but it worked for me. I think "default" is the name of the default servlet within JBoss. Not too sure what it is for other servers.There\'s another stack overflow post that has an excellent solution.It doesn\'t seem to be Tomcat specific, is simple, and works great.  I\'ve tried a couple of the solutions in this post with spring mvc 3.1 but then had problems getting my dynamic content served.In brief, it says add a servlet mapping like this:I\'ve just been grappling with this issue in Spring MVC 3.0 and I initially went with the UrlRewriteFilter option. However I was not happy with this solution as it "didn\'t feel right" (I\'m not the only one - see the link above to the Spring Forums where the word "hack" appears a few times).So I came up with a similar solution to "Unknown (Google)" above but borrowed the idea of having all static content served from /static/ (taken from the Spring Roo version of the Pet Store app). The "default" servlet did not work for me but the Spring Webflow ResourceServlet did (also taken from Spring Roo generated app).Web.xml:The only change I made to JSPs was to add the /static/ path to URLs for CSS, JS and images. E.g. "${pageContext.request.contextPath}/static/css/screen.css".for Maven users the dependency for "org.springframework.js.resource.ResourceServlet" is:I found a way around it using tuckey\'s urlrewritefilter. Please feel free to give a better answer if you have one!In web.xml:In urlrewrite.xml:This means that any uri with a \'.\' in it (like style.css for example) won\'t be re-written.My own experience with this problem is as follows. Most Spring-related web pages and books seem to suggest that the most appropriate syntax is the following.The above syntax suggests that you can place your static resources (CSS, JavaScript, images) in a folder named "resources" in the root of your application, i.e. /webapp/resources/.However, in my experience (I am using Eclipse and the Tomcat plugin), the only approach that works is if you place your resources folder inside WEB_INF (or META-INF). So, the syntax I recommend is the following.In your JSP (or similar) , reference the resource as follows.Needless to mention, the entire question only arose because I wanted my Spring dispatcher servlet (front controller) to intercept everything, everything dynamic, that is. So I have the following in my web.xml.Finally, since I\'m using current best practices, I have the following in my front controller servlet xml (see above).And I have the following in my actual controller implementation, to ensure that I have a default method to handle all incoming requests.I hope this helps.I got the same problem and found Joris\'s answer very helpful. But additionally I need to add to the servlet config file. Without that resource mapping will not work and all handlers will stop working. Hope this will help someone. The URLRewrite is sort of a "hack" if you want to call it that.  What it comes down to is, you\'re re-inventing the wheel; as there are already existing solutions.  Another thing to remember is Http Server = Static content & App server = dynamic content (this is how they were designed).  By delegating the appropriate responsibilities to each server you maximize efficiency... but now-a-days this is probably only a concern in a performance critical environments and something like Tomcat would most likely work well in both roles most of the time; but it is still something to keep in mind none the less.I solved it this way:This works on Tomcat and ofcourse Jboss. However in the end I decided to use the solution Spring provides (as mentioned by rozky) which is far more portable.From Spring 3, all the resources needs to mapped in a different way. You need to use the tag  to specify the location of the resources.Example :By doing this way, you are directing the dispatcher servlet to look into the directory resources to look for the static content.My way of solving this problem is placing all your actions with a specific prefix like "web" or "service" and configure that all url\'s with that prefix will be intercepted by the DispatcherServlet.I just add three rules before spring default rule (/**) to tuckey\'s urlrewritefilter (urlrewrite.xml) to solve the problemI know there are a few configurations to use the static contents, but my solution is that I just create a bulk web-application folder within your tomcat. This "bulk webapp" is only serving all the static-contents without serving apps. This is pain-free and easy solution for serving static contents to your actual spring webapp.For example, I\'m using two webapp folders on my tomcat.If I want to use javascript, I simply add the URI for my javascript file.EX> /resources/path/to/js/myjavascript.jsFor static images, I\'m using the same method.EX> /resources/path/to/img/myimg.jpg Last, I put "security-constraint" on my tomcat to block the access to actual directory.\nI put "nobody" user-roll to the constraint so that the page generates "403 forbidden error" when people tried to access the static-contents path.  So far it works very well for me. I also noticed that many popular websites like Amazon, Twitter, and Facebook they are using different URI for serving static-contents. To find out this, just right click on any static content and check their URI.  I used both ways that is urlrewrite and annotation based in spring mvc 3.0.x and found that annotation based approach is most suitable that is In case of urlrewrite,have to define lots of rule and some time also get class not found exception for UrlRewriteFilter as already provided the dependency for it.\n  I found that it\'s happening due to the presence of transitive dependency, so again one step will increased and have to exclude that dependency from pom.xml using So annotation based approach will be the good deal.This did the real job in my casein web.xml:...After encountering and going through the same decision making process described here, I decided to go with the ResourceServlet proposal which works out quite nicely.Note that you get more information on how to use webflow in your maven build process here: http://static.springsource.org/spring-webflow/docs/2.0.x/reference/html/ch01s05.htmlIf you use the standard Maven central repository the artifact is (in opposite to the above referred springsource bundle):This can be achieved in at least three ways.Solutions:For complete code examples how to achieve this please reffer to my answer in another post: How to map requests to HTML file in Spring MVC?The Problem is with URLPatternChange your URL pattern on your servlet mapping from "/" to "/*" and if you want to use annotation based configuration use below codeFor java based spring configuration you can use the following Using ResourceHandlerRegistry which stores registrations of resource handlers for serving static resources.More Info @ WebMvcConfigurerAdapter which defines callback methods to customize the Java-based configuration for Spring MVC enabled via @EnableWebMvc.
