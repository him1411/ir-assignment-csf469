I am trying to make a WCF service over basicHttpBinding to be used over https. Here\'s my web.config:......\n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n        \n      \n    I am connecting using WCFStorm which is able to retrieve all the meta data properly, but when I call the actual method I get:The provided URI scheme \'https\' is invalid; expected \'http\'.\nParameter name: viaTry adding message credentials on your app.config like:Adding this as an answer, just since you can\'t do much fancy formatting in comments.\nI had the same issue, except I was creating and binding my web service client entirely in code.\nReason is the DLL was being uploaded into a system, which prohibited the use of config files. Here is the code as it needed to be updated to communicate over SSL... Are you running this on the Cassini (vs dev server) or on IIS with a cert installed? I have had issues in the past trying to hook up secure endpoints on the dev web server.Here is the binding configuration that has worked for me in the past. Instead of basicHttpBinding, it uses wsHttpBinding. I don\'t know if that is a problem for you.and the endpointAlso, make sure you change the client configuration to enable Transport security.I had the EXACT same issue as the OP.  My configuration and situation were identical.  I finally narrowed it down to being an issue in WCFStorm after creating a service reference in a test project in Visual Studio and confirming that the service was working.  In Storm you need to click on the "Config" settings option (NOT THE "Client Config").  After clicking on that, click on the "Security" tab on the dialog that pops up. Make sure "Authentication Type" is set to "None" (The default is "Windows Authentication"). Presto, it works!  I always test out my methods in WCFStorm as I\'m building them out, but have never tried using it to connect to one that has already been set up on SSL.  Hope this helps someone!Change \nfrom to in your web.config file. This change will allow you to use https instead of httpI had same exception in a custom binding scenario. Anybody using  this approach, can check this too.I was actually adding the service reference from a local WSDL  file. It got added successfully and required custom binding was added to config file.  However, the actual service was https; not http. So I  changed the  httpTransport elemet as  httpsTransport. This fixed the problemReferencesRan into the same issue, this is how my solution turned out at the end:I basically replaced every occurrence of Http with Https. You can try adding both of them if you prefer.Its a good to remember that config files can be split across secondary files to make config changes easier on different servers (dev/demo/production etc), without having to recompile code/app etc.\nFor example we use them to allow onsite engineers to make endpoint changes without actually touching the \'real\' files.First step is to move the bindings section out of the WPF App.Config into it\'s own separate file.The behaviours section is set to allow both http and https (doesn\'t seem to have an affect on the app if both are allowed)And we move the bindings section out to its own file;In the bindings.config file we switch the security based on protocolNow the on site engineers only need to change the Bindings.Config file and the Client.Config where we store the actual URL for each endpoint.This way we can change the endpoint from http to https and back again to test the app without having to change any code.Hope this helps.To re-cap the question in the OP:I am connecting [to a WCF service] using WCFStorm which is able to retrieve all the meta data properly, but when I call the actual method I get:The provided URI scheme \'https\' is invalid; expected \'http\'. Parameter name: viaThe WCFStorm tutorials addresses this issue in Working with IIS and SSL.Their solution worked for me:To fix the error, generate a client config that matches the wcf service configuration.  The easiest way to do this is with Visual Studio.Open Visual Studio and add a service reference to the service.  VS will generate an app.config file that matches the serviceEdit the app.config file so that it can be read by WCFStorm. Please see Loading Client App.config files. Ensure that the endpoint/@name and endpoint/@contract attributes match the values in wcfstorm.Load the modified app.config to WCFStorm [using the Client Config toobar button].Invoke the method.  This time the method invocation will no longer failItem (1) last bullet in effect means to remove the namespace prefix that VS prepends to the endpoint contract attribute, by default "ServiceReference1"so in the app.config that you load into WCFStorm you want for ListsService:wsHttpBinding is a problem because silverlight doesn\'t support it!If you do this programatically and not in web.config its:
