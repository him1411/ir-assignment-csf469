In Django model QuerySets, I see that there is a __gt and __lt for comparitive values, but is there a __ne/!=/<> (not equals?)I want to filter out using a not equals:Example:I wantThe != is not correct syntax. I tried __ne, <>.I ended up using:Maybe Q objects could be of help for this problem. I\'ve never used them but it seems they can be negated and combined much like normal python expressions.Update: I Just tried it out, it seems to work pretty well:Your query appears to have a double negative, you want to exclude all rows where x is not 5, so in other words you want to include all rows where x IS 5. I believe this will do the trick. To answer your specific question, there is no "not equal to" but that\'s probably because django has both "filter" and "exclude" methods available so you can always just switch the logic round to get the desired result.the field=value syntax in queries is a shorthand for field__exact=value.  That is to say that Django puts query operators on query fields in the identifiers.  Django supports the following operators:I\'m sure by combining these with the Q objects as Dave Vogt suggests and using filter() or exclude() as Jason Baker suggests you\'ll get exactly what you need for just about any possible query.It\'s easy to create a custom lookup with Django 1.7. There\'s an __ne lookup example in Django official documentation.You need to create the lookup itself first:Then you need to register it:And now you can use the __ne lookup in your queries like this:While with the Models, you can filter with =, __gt, __gte, __lt, __lte, you cannot use ne, != or <>. However, you can achieve better filtering on using the Q object.You can avoid chaining QuerySet.filter() and QuerySet.exlude(), and use this:In Django 1.9/1.10 there are three options.Chain exclude and filterUse Q() objects and the ~ operatorRegister a custom lookup functionThe register_lookup decorator was added in Django 1.8 and\nenables custom lookup as usual:You should use filter and exclude like thisThe Django issue tracker has the remarkable entry #5763,\ntitled "Queryset doesn\'t have a "not equal" filter operator".\nIt is remarkable because (as of April 2016) it was \n"opened 9 years ago" (in the Django stone age),\n"closed 4 years ago", and \n"last changed 5 months ago".Read through the discussion, it is interesting.\nBasically, some people argue __ne should be added\nwhile others say exclude() is clearer and hence __ne\nshould not be added.(I agree with the former, because the latter argument is\nroughly equivalent to saying Python should not have != because\nit has == and not already...)The last bit of code will exclude all objects where x!=5 and a is True.  Try this:Remember, the = sign in the above line is assigning False to the parameter a and the number 5 to the parameter x.  It\'s not checking for equality.  Thus, there isn\'t really any way to use the != symbol in a query call.What you are looking for are all objects that have either a=false or x=5. In Django, | serves as OR operator between querysets:
