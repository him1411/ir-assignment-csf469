I am still getting this error message, when I try to move my project tree on to git repo. I checked the permissions of my directory with this project and these are set on 777. In terminal in the directory with my_project I set:git initand then if I trygit add .orgit commit -m "first upload"so I\'ll get the errorI tried also create a new repo and there to commit it, but unfortunately still the same error message... I am a bit desperate of it already, I try to find the solution whole afternoon, but still without succes...Could anyone help me, please, what is the cause of problem?Million times thanks!TryIn your repository directory. The error message is rather explicit as to what causes it typically, so if you have no other git processes running (which is the normal case), go ahead and delete that file.In Windows, do this in the command prompt from the repo directory:Try quitting Xcode - since it\'s a git client, you have to quit Xcode to avoid problems with git on the command line.I was having the same problem. I triedand the console gave me an error message. Then, I tried and that worked.Good Luck!In my .git directory, there was no index.lock file.  So, using the Git Bash shell, I ran...The touch command created the file, and the problem went away.It just happens that I created the git repository with the root user. I deleted the git repository and created it again without sudo and it works. i have this problem too, and i find it really a permission problem. so i do this: then ererything is great, and gaa is success.and then i use gp, i get another error almost the same errorIf you are using one of #intelliJ IDEs and receiving this msg (i\'m using #webtorm), please notice that this problem can occur because of hiding one of project folders (inside settings), and this can prevent GITfrom merging.In Mac OS X do this in the command prompt from the repo directory:If after you try:rm -f ./.git/index.lockyou get:rm: cannot unlink \'index.lock\': Permission deniedTry closing all software that might be using Git. \nI had Source Tree and Visual Studio opened and after closing both the command worked. In my case the solution was to wait 5 minutes. Obviously my previous operation was still running but I just didn\'t know it. I was using tortoise git on windows.Use This:The solution that worked for me was closing sublime text because the running git process was initiated by the editor.In Windows, I only managed to be able to delete the lock file after Ending Task for all Git Windows (32bit) processes in the Task Manager.Solution (Win 10)1. End Task for all Git Windows (32bit) processes in the Task Manager2. Delete the .git/index.lock fileThe resolution for this problem is copying the three xcode/project files in the directory and then creating new directory (Whereever else) and then paste the three files/directories. Also we can just kill git process. I receive the same issue via GUI app for git, something goes wrong and git makes some work infinitely. Killing process will freeze application that works with git, just restart it and everything will be ok.In case, for whatever reason, you are doing a rebase from a folder that\'s being sync\'d by a cloud service (dropbox, drive, onedrive, etc), you should pause or turn off syncing as it will interfere with permissions during the rebase.For me it was I had changed my directory permission so I knew it could be permission related. In my case I removed unwanted (_www) users and then applied read/write permission to everyone by apply changed to all contents. This is on Mac
