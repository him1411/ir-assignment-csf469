I want to be able to debug C structures without having to explicitly type every property that they consist of.i.e. I want to be able to do something like this:Obviously the \'%@\' won\'t work, hence the question. You can try this:There are a number of functions provided by UIKit that convert the various CG structs into NSStrings. The reason it doesn\'t work is because %@ signifies an object. A CGPoint is a C struct (and so are CGRects and CGSizes).There are a few functions like:  An example:I use the following macro to help me out with NSRect:You could do something similar for CGPoint:Using it as follows:Would produce the following:You can use NSValue for this. An NSValue object is a simple container for a single C or Objective-C data item. It can hold any of the scalar types such as int, float, and char, as well as pointers, structures, and object ids.Example: OUTPUT : NSPoint: {10, 30} Hope it helps you.Since Stack Overflow\xe2\x80\x99s broken RSS just resurrected this question for me, here\xe2\x80\x99s my almost-general solution: JAValueToStringThis lets you write JA_DUMP(cgPoint) and get cgPoint = {0, 0} logged.Yes, you can use bellow few functions like:\nFirst you have to convert CGPoint struct into string, see example1) NSStringFromCGPoint,\n2) NSStringFromCGSize,\n3) NSStringFromCGRect,\n4) NSStringFromCGAffineTransform,\n5) NSStringFromUIEdgeInsets,For example:1) NSLog(@"NSStringFromCGPoint = %@", NSStringFromCGRect(cgPointValue));Like this...
