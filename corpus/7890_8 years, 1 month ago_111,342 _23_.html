What is the list of valid @SuppressWarnings warning names in Java?The bit that comes in between the ("") in @SuppressWarnings("").It depends on your IDE or compiler.Here is a list for Eclipse Galileo:List for Indigo adds:List for Juno adds:Kepler and Luna use the same token list as Juno (list).Others will be similar but vary.All values are permitted (unrecognized ones are ignored).  The list of recognized ones is compiler specific.  In The Java Tutorials unchecked and deprecation are listed as the two warnings required by The Java Language Specification, therefore, they should be valid with all compilers:Every compiler warning belongs to a category. The Java Language Specification lists two categories: deprecation and unchecked.The specific sections inside The Java Language Specification where they are defined is not consistent across versions. In the Java SE 8 Specification unchecked and deprecation are listed as compiler warnings in sections 9.6.4.5. @SuppressWarnings and 9.6.4.6 @Deprecated, respectively.For Sun\'s compiler, running javac -X gives a list of all values recognized by that version.  For 1.5.0_17, the list appears to be:The list is compiler specific. But here are the values supported in Eclipse:Sun JDK (1.6) has a shorter list of supported warnings:The latest available javac (1.6.0_13) for mac have the following supported warningsAnd this seems to be a much more complete list, where I found some warnings specific to Android-Studio that I couldn\'t find elsewhere (e.g. SynchronizeOnNonFinalField)https://jazzy.id.au/2008/10/30/list_of_suppresswarnings_arguments.htmlOh, now SO\'s guidelines contraddict SO\'s restrictions.\nOn one hand, I am supposed to copy the list rather than providing only the link.\nBut on the other hand, this would exceed the maximum allowed number of characters. So let\'s just hope the link won\'t break.JSL 1.7http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-9.html mentions:It then explains that implementations can add and document their own:Compiler vendors should document the warning names they support in conjunction with this annotation type. Vendors are encouraged to cooperate to ensure that the same names work across multiple compilers.
