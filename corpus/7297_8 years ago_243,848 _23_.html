I have two points in 3D:And I want to calculate the distance:What\'s the best way to do this with Numpy, or with Python in general?  I have:Use numpy.linalg.norm:There\'s a function for that in SciPy, it\'s called Euclideanexample:Another instance of this problem solving method.  As soon as I submitted the question I got it:I find a \'dist\' function in matplotlib.mlab, but i don\'t think it\'s handy enough. I\'m posting it here just for reference.Can be done like this, don\'t know how fast it is but its no numpy.Is a nice one line answer.  However, if speed is a concern I would recommend experimenting on your machine.  I found that using the math library\'s sqrt with the ** operator for the square is much faster on my machine than the one line, numpy solution.  I ran my tests using this simple program:On my machine, math_calc_dist runs much faster than numpy_calc_dist: 1.5 seconds versus 23.5 seconds.To get a measurable difference between fastest_calc_dist and math_calc_dist I had to up TOTAL_LOCATIONS to 6000.  Then fastest_calc_dist takes ~50 seconds while math_calc_dist takes ~60 seconds.You can also experiment with numpy.sqrt and numpy.square though both were slower than the math alternatives on my machine.My tests were run with Python 2.6.6.You can just substract the vectors and then innerproduct.Following your exampleSimple Code an easy to understand.I like np.dot (dot product): Having a and b as you defined them, you can use also:Here\'s some concise code for Euclidean distance in Python given two points represented as lists in Python.if you want to find the distance of a specific point from the First of the contractions you can use, plus you can do it with as many as dimensions as you want.
