I want to count the total number of <li> elements in <div id="selected"></div>. How is that possible using jQuery\'s .children([selector])?You can use .length with just a descendant selector, like this:If you have to use .children(), then it\'s like this:You can test both versions here.or:fastest one:You probably could also omit li in the children\'s selector.See .length.You can use JavaScript (don\'t need jQuery)or even betterIt is simply possible with childElementCount in pure javascript
