Is there a way to set chmod 755 for /opt/lampp/htdocs and all of its content including subfolders and files?Also, in the future, if I create a new folder or file inside htdocs, how can the permissions of that automatically be set to 755?This works, but only for this folder:The other answers are correct, in that chmod -R 755 will set this as permissions to all files and folders in the tree. But why on earth would you want to? It might make sense for the directories, but why set the execute bit on all the files? I suspect what you really want to do is set the directories to 755 and either leave the files alone or set them to 644. For this, you can use the find command. For example:To change all the directories to 755 (drwxr-xr-x):To change all the files to 644 (-rw-r--r--):Check the -R option chmod -R <permissionsettings> <dirname>In the future, you can save a lot of time by checking the man page first:So in this case:If you want to set permissions on all files to a+r, and all directories to a+x, and do that recursively through the complete subdirectory tree, use:The X (that is capital X, not small x!) is ignored for files (unless they are executable for someone already) but is used for directories.You can use -R with chmod for recursive traversal of all files and subfolders.You might need sudo as it depends on LAMP being installed by the current user or another one:To set to all subfolders (recursively) use -RAnd use umask to set the default to new folders/files\n    cd /folder\n    umask 755\nchmod 755 -R /opt/lampp/htdocs will recursively set the permissions. There\'s no way to set the permissions for files automatically in only this directory that are created after you set the permissions, but you could change your system-wide default file permissions with by setting umask 022.You might want to consider this answer given by nik on superuser and use "one chmod" for all files/folders like this:Here\'s another way to set directories to 775 and files to 664.It may look long, but it\'s pretty cool for three reasons:Note that I have not confirmed the performance difference (if any) between this solution and that of simply using two find commands (as in Peter Mortensen\'s solution). However, seeing a similar example in the manual is encouraging.Example from man find page:CheersUse:However, be careful with that. It can really hurt you if you change the permissions of the wrong files/folders.-R make every sub folder ,including current folderYou want to make sure that appropriate files and directories are chmod-ed/permissions for those are appropriate. For all directories you want And for all the images, JavaScript, CSS, HTML...well, you shouldn\'t execute them. So useBut for all the logic code (for instance PHP code), you should set permissions such that the user can\'t see that code:chmod -R 755 directory_name works, but how would you keep new files to 755 also? The file\'s permissions becomes the default permission.For Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion), it is:And yes, as all other say, be careful when doing this.I think Adam was asking how to change umask value for all processes that tying to operate on /opt/lampp/htdocs directory.The user file-creation mode mask (umask) is use to determine the file permission for newly created files. It can be used to control the default file permission for new files.so if you will use some kind of ftp program to upload files into /opt/lampp/htdocs you need to configure your ftp server to use umask you want.If files / directories be created for example by php, you need to modify php code if you will create new files / folders from your bash session, you can set umask value in your shell profile ~/.bashrc \nOr you can set up umask in /etc/bashrc or /etc/profile file for all users.\nadd the following to file:\numask 022And to change permissions for already created files you can use find.\nHope this helps.There are two answers of finding files and applying chmod to them. First one is find the file and apply chmod as it finds (as suggested by @WombleGoneBad).Second solution is to generate list of all files with find command and supply this list to the chmod command (as suggested by @lamgesh).Both of these versions work nice as long as the number of files returned by the find command is small. The second solution looks great to eye and more readable than the first one. If there are large number of files, the second solution returns error : Argument list too long.So my suggestion isIt\'s very simple. In Terminal go to file manager. example: sudo nemo. Go /opt/ then click Properties \xe2\x86\x92 Permission. and then Other. Finally, change to create and delete and file acess to read and write and click on button apply... And work.
