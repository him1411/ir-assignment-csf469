I need to be able to call a function, but the function name is stored in a variable, is this possible? e.g:Anyhelp would be great.Thanks!$functionName() or call_user_func($functionName)My favorite version is the inline version:You can place variables or expressions inside the brackets too!Yes, it is possible:Source: http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/php/2001/05/17/php_foundations.html?page=2In case someone else is brought here by google because they were trying to use a variable for a method within a class, the below is a code sample which will actually work. None of the above worked for my situation. The key difference is the & in the declaration of $c = & new... and &$c being passed in call_user_func.My specific case is when implementing someone\'s code having to do with colors and two member methods lighten() and darken() from the csscolor.php class. For whatever reason, I wanted to have the same code be able to call lighten or darken rather than select it out with logic. This may be the result of my stubbornness to not just use if-else or to change the code calling this method.Note that trying anything with $c->{...} didn\'t work. Upon perusing the reader-contributed content at the bottom of php.net\'s page on call_user_func, I was able to piece together the above. Also, note that $params as an array didn\'t work for me:This above attempt would give a warning about the method expecting a 2nd argument (percent).For the sake of completeness, you can also use eval():However, call_user_func() is the proper way.As already mentioned, there are a few ways to achieve this with possibly the safest method being call_user_func() or if you must you can also go down the route of $function_name(). It is possible to pass arguments using both of these methods as soIf the function you are calling belongs to an object you can still use either of theseHowever if you are going to use the $function_name() method it may be a good idea to test for the existence of the function if the name is in any way dynamicA few years late, but this is the best manner now imho:Just to add a point about dynamic function names when using namespaces.If you\'re using namespaces, the following won\'t work except if your function is in the global namespace:You have to use call_user_func() instead:Complementing the answer of @Chris K if you want to call an object\'s method, you can call it using a single variable with the help of a closure:I posted another example hereUse the call_user_func function.Following code can help to write dynamic function in PHP.\nnow the function name can be dynamically change by variable \'$current_page\'.I dont know why u have to use that, doesnt sound so good to me at all, but if there are only a small amount of functions, you could use a if/elseif construct.\nI dont know if a direct solution is possible.something like\n$foo = "bar";\n$test = "foo";\necho $$test;should return bar, you can try around but i dont think this will work for functions
