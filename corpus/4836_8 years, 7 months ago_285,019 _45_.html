In my experience, input type="text" onchange event usually occurs only after you leave (blur) the control.Is there a way to force browser to trigger onchange every time textfield content changes? If not, what is the most elegant way to track this \xe2\x80\x9cmanually\xe2\x80\x9d?Using onkey* events is not reliable, since you can right-click the field and choose Paste, and this will change the field without any keyboard input.Is setTimeout the only way?.. Ugly :-)Update:See Another answer (2015).Original 2009 Answer:So, you want the onchange event to fire on keydown, blur, and paste? That\'s magic.If you want to track changes as they type, use "onkeydown". If you need to trap paste operations with the mouse, use "onpaste" (IE, FF3) and "oninput" (FF, Opera, Chrome, Safari1).1Broken for <textarea> on Safari. Use textInput insteadThese days listen for oninput.  It feels like onchange without the need to lose focus on the element. It is HTML5.It\xe2\x80\x99s supported by everyone (even mobile), except IE8 and below. For IE add onpropertychange. I use it like this:Javascript is unpredictable and funny here.So, to track the change in textbox, we need onkeydown, oncut and onpaste. In the callback of these event, if you check the value of the textbox then you don\'t get the updated value as the value is changed after the callback. So a solution for this is to set a timeout function with a timeout of 50 mili-seconds (or may be less)  to track the change.This is a dirty hack but this is the only way, as I researched.Here is an example.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/2BfGC/12/Below code works fine for me with Jquery 1.8.3HTML : <input type="text" id="myId" />Javascript/JQuery:onkeyup happens after you type for example I press t when I lift the finger the action happens but on keydown the action happens before I digit the character tHope this is helpful for someone. So onkeyup is better for when you want to send what you just typed now.If you use ONLY Internet Explorer, you can use this:Hope that helps.I had a similar requirement (twitter style text field). Used onkeyup and onchange. onchange actually takes care of mouse paste operations during lost focus from the field.[Update] In HTML5 or later, use oninput to get real time character modification updates, as explained in other answers above.there is a quite near solution (do not fix all Paste ways) but most of them:It works for inputs as well as for textareas:Do like this:As i said, not all ways to Paste fire an event on all browsers... worst some do not fire any event at all, but Timers are horrible to be used for such.But most of Paste ways are done with keyboard and/or mouse, so normally an onkeyup or onmouseup are fired after a paste, also onkeyup is fired when typing on keyboard.Ensure yor check code does not take much time... otherwise user get a poor impresion.Yes, the trick is to fire on key and on mouse... but beware both can be fired, so take in mind such!!!Please, judge next approach using JQuery:HTML:Javascript(JQuery):You could use the keydown, keyup and keypress events as well."input" worked for me. To track each try this example and before that completely reduce cursor blink rate to zero.onblur : event generates on exitonchange : event generates on exit if any changes made in inputtextonkeydown: event generates on any key press (for key holding long times also)onkeyup  : event generates on any key releaseonkeypress: same as onkeydown (or onkeyup) but won\'t react for ctrl,backsace,alt other
