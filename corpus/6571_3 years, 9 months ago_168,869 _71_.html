I\'ve noticed with docker that I need to understand what\'s happening inside a container or what files exist in there. One example is downloading images from the docker index - you don\'t have a clue what the image contains so it\'s impossible to start the application.What would be ideal is to be able to ssh into them or equivalent. Is there a tool to do this, or is my conceptualisation of docker wrong in thinking I should be able to do this.Method 1: snapshotingYou can evaluate container filesystem this way:This way, you can evaluate filesystem of the running container in the precise time moment. Container is still running, no future changes are included.You can later delete snapshot using (filesystem of the running container is not affected!):Method 2: sshIf you need continuous access, you can install sshd to your container and run the sshd daemon:This way, you can run your app using ssh (connect and execute what you want).UPDATE - Method 3: nsenterUse nsenter, see http://blog.docker.com/2014/06/why-you-dont-need-to-run-sshd-in-docker/The short version is: with nsenter, you can get a shell into an\n  existing container, even if that container doesn\xe2\x80\x99t run SSH or any kind\n  of special-purpose daemonUPDATE - Method 4: docker execDocker version 1.3 (latest, you might need to use docker apt repo to install latest version as of Nov 2014) supports new command exec that behave similar to nsenter. This command can run new process in already running container (container must have PID 1 process running already). You can run /bin/bash to explore container state:see Docker command line documentationYou may archive your container\' filesystem into tar file:This way works even if your container is stopped and doesn\'t have any shell program like /bin/bash. I mean images like hello-world from Docker documentation.UPDATE:This command should let you explore a running docker container:once inside do:or any other bash command like:This command should let you explore a docker image:once inside do:or any other bash command like:The -it stands for interactive... and ttyThe file system of the container is in the data folder of docker, normally in /var/lib/docker. In order to start and inspect a running containers file system do the following:And now the current working directory is the root of the container.On Ubuntu 14.04 running Docker 1.3.1, I found the container root filesystem on the host machine in the following directory:Full Docker version information:I use another dirty trick that is aufs/devicemapper agnostic. I look at the command that the container is running e.g. docker ps\nand if it\'s an apache or java i just do the following:and voil\xc3\xa1 you\'re inside the container.Basically you can as root cd into /proc/<PID>/root/ folder as long as that process is run by the container. Beware symlinks will not make sense wile using that mode.For me, this one works well (thanks to the last comments for pointing out the directory /var/lib/docker/):Here, 2465790aa2c4 is the short ID of the running container (as displayed by docker ps), followed by a star.Before Container Creation :If you to explore the structure of the image that is mounted inside the container you can doThis would give you the visibility of all the layers of an image and its configuration which is present in json files.After container creation :For this there are already lot of answers above. my preferred way to do\nthis would be -The most voted answer is good except if your container isn\'t an actual Linux system.Many containers (especially the go based ones) don\'t have any standard binary (no /bin/bash, /bin/sh). In that case, you will need to access the actual containers file directly:Works like a charm:Note: You need to run it as root.For docker aufs driver:The script will find the container root dir(Test on docker 1.7.1 and 1.10.3 )For an already running container, you can do:You need to be root in order to cd into that dir. If you are not root, try \'sudo su\' before running the command.Edit: Following v1.3, see Jiri\'s answer - it is better.My preferred way to understand what is going on inside container is:expose -p 8000Start server inside itThe most upvoted answer is working for me when the container is actually started, but when it isn\'t possible to run and you for example want to copy files from the container this has saved me before:Thanks to docker cp (link) you can copy directly from the container as it was any other part of your filesystem.\nFor example, recovering all files inside a container:Note that you don\'t need to specify that you want to copy recursively.another trick is to use the atomic tool to do something like:The Docker image will be mounted to /path/to/mnt for you to inspect it.On newer versions of Docker you can run docker exec [container_name] which runs a shell inside your containerSo to get a list of all the files in a container just run docker exec [container_name] lsThis answer will help those (like myself) who want to explore the docker volume filesystem even if the container isn\'t running.List running docker containers:docker ps => CONTAINER ID "4c721f1985bd"Look at the docker volume mount points on your local physical machine (https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/):docker inspect -f {{.Mounts}} 4c721f1985bd=> [{ /tmp/container-garren /tmp   true rprivate}]This tells me that the local physical machine directory /tmp/container-garren is mapped to the /tmp docker volume destination.Knowing the local physical machine directory (/tmp/container-garren) means I can explore the filesystem whether or not the docker container is running. This was critical to helping me figure out that there was some residual data that shouldn\'t have persisted even after the container was not running.You can run a bash inside the container with this:\n\n$ docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash\nTry usingThere might be possibility that bash is not implemented. for that you can use
