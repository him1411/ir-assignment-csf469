I am trying to understand what shard and replica is in Elasticsearch, but I don\'t manage to understand it. If I download Elasticsearch and run the script, then from what I know I have started a cluster with a single node. Now this node (my PC) have 5 shards (?) and some replicas (?). What are they, do I have 5 duplicates of the index? If so why? I could need some explanation.I\'ll try to explain with a real example since the answer and replies you got don\'t seem to help you.When you download elasticsearch and start it up you create an elasticsearch node which tries to join an existing cluster if available or creates a new one. Let\'s say you created your own new cluster with a single node, the one that you just started up. We have no data, therefore we need to create an index.When you create an index (an index is automatically created when you index the first document as well) you can define how many shards it will be composed of. If you don\'t specify a number it will have the default number of shards: 5 primaries. What does it mean? It means that elasticsearch will create 5 primary shards that will contain your data:Every time you index a document elasticsearch will decide which primary shard is supposed to hold that document and will index it there. Primary shards are not a copy of the data, they are the data! Having multiple shards does help taking advantage of parallel processing on a single machine, but the whole point is that if we start another elasticsearch instance on the same cluster, the shards will be distributed in an even way over the cluster.Node 1 will then hold for example only three shards:Since the remaining two shards have been moved to the newly started node:Why does this happen? Because elasticsearch is a distributed search engine and this way you can make use of multiple nodes/machines to manage big amounts of data.Every elasticsearch index is composed of at least one primary shard since that\'s where the data is stored. Every shard comes at a cost, though, therefore if you have a single node and no foreseeable growth, just stick with a single primary shard.Another type of shard is a replica. The default is 1, meaning that every primary shard will be copied to another shard that will contain the same data. Replicas are used to increase search performance and for fail-over. A replica shard is never going to be allocated on the same node where the related primary is (it would pretty much be like putting a backup on the same disk as the original data).Back to our example, with 1 replica we\'ll have the whole index on each node, since 3 replica shards will be allocated on the first node and they will contain exactly the same data as the primaries on the second node:Same for the second node, which will contain a copy of the primary shards on the first node:With a setup like this, if a node goes down you still have the whole index. The replica shards will automatically become primaries and the cluster will work properly despite the node failure, as follows:Since you have "number_of_replicas":1, the replicas cannot be assigned anymore as they are never allocated on the same node where their primary is. That\'s why you\'ll have 5 unassigned shards, the replicas, and the cluster status will be YELLOW instead of GREEN. No data loss, but it could be better as some shards cannot be assigned.As soon as the node that had left is back up, it\'ll join the cluster again and the replicas will be assigned again. The existing shard on the second node can be loaded but they need to be synchronized with the other shards, as write operations most likely happened while the node was down. At the end of this operation, the cluster status will become GREEN.Hope this clarifies things for you.If you really don\'t like to see it yellow. you can set the number of replicas to be zero:Note that you should do this only on your local development box.An index is broken into shards in order to distribute them and scale. Replicas are copies of the shards and provide reliability if a node is lost. There is often confusion in this number because replica count == 1 means the cluster must have the main and a replicated copy of the shard available to be in the green state. In order for replicas to be created, you must have at least 2 nodes in your cluster. You may find the definitions here easier to understand:\nhttp://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/glossary/Best Regards,\nPaulAn index is broken into shards in order to distribute them and scale.Replicas are copies of the shards.A node is a running instance of elastic search which belongs to a cluster.A cluster consists of one or more nodes which share the same cluster name. Each cluster has a single master node which is chosen automatically by the cluster and which can be replaced if the current master node fails.In ElasticSearch, at the top level we index the documents into indices. Each index has number of shards which internally distributes the data and inside shards exist the Lucene segments which is the core storage of the data. So if the index has 5 shards it means data has been distributed across the shards and not same data exist into the shards.Watch out for the video which explains core of ES\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpX7J-G2PEoArticle on multiple indices or multiple shards\nElastic search, multiple indexes vs one index and types for different data sets?
