Let\'s say I have a vertical linearLayout with :By default v1 has visibily = GONE. I would like to show v1 with an expand animation and push down v2 at the same time.I tried something like this:But with this solution, I have a blink when the animation starts. I think it\'s caused by v1 displaying full size before the animation is applied.With javascript, this is one line of jQuery! Any simple way to do this with android?I see that this question became popular so I post my actual solution. The main advantage is that you don\'t have to know the expanded height to apply the animation and once the view is expanded, it adapts height if content changes. It works great for me.I was trying to do what I believe was a very similar animation and found an elegant solution. This code assumes that you are always going from 0->h or h->0 (h being the maximum height). The three constructor parameters are view = the view to be animated (in my case, a webview), targetHeight = the maximum height of the view, and down = a boolean which specifies the direction (true = expanding, false = collapsing).I stumbled over the same problem today and I guess the real solution to this question is this You will have to set this property for all topmost layouts, which are involved in the shift. If you now set the visibility of one layout to GONE, the other will take the space as the disappearing one is releasing it. There will be a default animation which is some kind of "fading out", but I think you can change this - but the last one I have not tested, for now.I took @LenaYan \'s solution that didn\'t work properly \nto me (because it was transforming the View to a 0 height view before collapsing and/or expanding) and made some changes. Now it works great, by taking the View\'s previous height and start expanding with this size. Collapsing is the same.You can simply copy and paste the code below:Usage:Easy enough!Thanks LenaYan for the initial code! An alternative is to use a scale animation with the following scaling factors for expanding:and for collapsing:Ok, I just found a VERY ugly solution :Feel free to propose a better solution !@Tom Esterez\'s answer, but updated to use view.measure() properly per Android getMeasuredHeight returns wrong values !If you don\'t want to expand or collapse all the way - here is a simple HeightAnimation - Usage:I would like to add something to the very helpful answer above. If you don\'t know the height you\'ll end up with since your views .getHeight() returns 0 you can do the following to get the height:Where DUMMY_HIGH_DIMENSIONS is the width/height (in pixels) your view is constrained to ... having this a huge number is reasonable when the view is encapsulated with a ScrollView.For Smooth animation please use Handler with run method.....And Enjoy Expand /Collapse animation}And Call using this code:Other solution is:This is a snippet that I used to resize the width of a view (LinearLayout) with animation. The code is supposed to do expand or shrink according the target size. If you want a fill_parent width, you will have to pass the parent .getMeasuredWidth as target width while setting the flag to true.Hope it helps some of you.}I think the easiest solution is to set android:animateLayoutChanges="true" to your LinearLayout and then just show/hide view by seting its visibility. Works like a charm, but you have no controll on the animation durationYes, I agreed with the above comments. And indeed, it does seem like the right (or at least the easiest?) thing to do is to specify (in XML) an initial layout height of "0px" -- and then you can  pass in another argument for "toHeight" (i.e. the "final height") to the constructor of your custom Animation sub-class, e.g. in the example above, it would look something like so:Anyways, hope that helps! :) Here is my solution. I think it is simpler. It only expands the view but can easy be extended.You are on the right track.  Make sure you have v1 set to have a layout height of zero right before the animation starts.  You want to initialize your setup to look like the first frame of the animation before starting the animation.Make sure you have v1 set to have a layout height of zero right before the animation starts.

This way, you could for example have an action like this...... which calls the method below and letting it figure out what to do after each onClick()...This is really simple with droidQuery. For starts, consider this layout:We can animate the height to the desired value - say 100dp - using the following code:Then use droidQuery to animate. The simplest way is with this:To make the animation more appealing, consider adding an easing:You can also change the duration on AnimationOptions using the duration() method, or handle what happens when the animation ends. For a complex example, try:You can use a ViewPropertyAnimator with a slight twist.  To collapse, scale the view to a height of 1 pixel, then hide it.  To expand, show it, then expand it to its height.  The pivot tells the view where to scale from, default is in the middle. The duration is optional (default = 1000). You can also set the interpolator to use, like .setInterpolator(new AccelerateDecelerateInterpolator())I created version in which you don\'t need to specify layout height, hence it\'s a lot easier and cleaner to use. The solution is to get the height in the first frame of the animation (it\'s available at that moment, at least during my tests). This way you can provide a View with an arbitrary height and bottom margin.There\'s also one little hack in the constructor - the bottom margin is set to -10000 so that the view stays hidden before the transformation (prevents flicker).Use ValueAnimator:Best solution for expand/collapse view\'s:Based on solutions by @Tom Esterez and @Seth Nelson (top 2) I simlified them. As well as original solutions it doesn\'t depend on Developer options (animation settings). The class can be called in following way
