Basically the question is how to get from this:to this:http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/group-by-functions.html#function_group-concatFrom the link above, GROUP_CONCAT: This function returns a string result with the concatenated non-NULL values from a group. It returns NULL if there are no non-NULL values.More details here.From the link above, GROUP_CONCAT: This function returns a string result with the concatenated non-NULL values from a group. It returns NULL if there are no non-NULL values.Will give you a comma-delimited string:-\nIn MySQL, you can get the concatenated values of expression combinations\n. To eliminate duplicate values, use the DISTINCT clause. To sort values in the result, use the ORDER BY clause. To sort in reverse order, add the DESC (descending) keyword to the name of the column you are sorting by in the ORDER BY clause. The default is ascending order; this may be specified explicitly using the ASC keyword. The default separator between values in a group is comma (\xe2\x80\x9c,\xe2\x80\x9d). To specify a separator explicitly, use SEPARATOR followed by the string literal value that should be inserted between group values. To eliminate the separator altogether, specify SEPARATOR \'\'.ORGreat answers.\nI also had a problem with NULLS and managed to solve it by including a COALESCE inside of the GROUP_CONCAT.  Example as follows: Hope this helps someone else
