A rather unusual situation perhaps, but I want to specify a private SSH-key to use when executing a shell (git) command from the local computer.Basically like this: Or even better (in Ruby):I have seen examples of connecting to a remote server with Net::SSH that uses a specified private key, but this is a local command. Is it possible?Something like this should work (suggested by orip):if you prefer subshells, you could try the following (though it is more fragile):Git will invoke SSH which will find its agent by environment variable; this will, in turn, have the key loaded.Alternatively, setting HOME may also do the trick, provided you are willing to setup a directory that contains only a .ssh directory as HOME; this may either contain an identity.pub, or a config file setting IdentityFile.None of these solutions worked for me. Instead, I elaborate on @Martin v. L\xc3\xb6wis  \'s mention of setting a config file for SSH.SSH will look for the user\'s ~/.ssh/config file. I have mine setup as:And I add a remote git repository:And then git commands work normally for me.NOTESReferencesOther people\'s suggestions about ~/.ssh/config are extra complicated. It can be as simple as:Starting from Git 2.3.0 we also have the simple command (no config file needed):Contents of my_git_ssh_wrapper:Then you can use the key by doing:To sum up answers and comments, the best way to set up git to use different key files and then forget about it, which also supports different users for the same host (e.g. a personal GitHub account and a work one), which works on Windows as well, is to edit ~/.ssh/config (or c:\\Users\\<your user>\\.ssh\\config) and specify multiple identities:Then, to clone a project as your personal user, just run the regular git clone command.To clone as repo as the workuser, run git clone git@github-work:company/project.git.I went with the GIT_SSH environment variable.\nHere\'s my wrapper, similar to that from Joe Block from above, but handles any amount of arguments.File ~/gitwrap.shThen, in my .bashrc, add the following:Way better idea to add that host or ip to the .ssh/config file like so:With git 2.10+ (Q3 2016: released Sept. 2d, 2016), you have the possibility to set a config for GIT_SSH_COMMAND (and not just an environment variable as described in Rober Jack Will\'s answer)See commit 3c8ede3 (26 Jun 2016) by Nguy\xe1\xbb\x85n Th\xc3\xa1i Ng\xe1\xbb\x8dc Duy (pclouds).\n(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit dc21164, 19 Jul 2016)A new configuration variable core.sshCommand has been added to\n  specify what value for GIT_SSH_COMMAND to use per repository.If this variable is set, git fetch and git push will use the specified command instead of ssh when they need to connect to a remote system.\n  The command is in the same form as the GIT_SSH_COMMAND environment variable and is overridden when the environment variable is set.It means the git clone can be:As stated here: https://superuser.com/a/912281/607049You can configure it per-repo:When you need to connect to github with a normal request (git pull origin master), setting the Host as * in ~/.ssh/config worked for me, any other Host (say, "github" or "gb") wasn\'t working.Many of these solutions looked enticing. However, I found the generic git-wrapping-script approach at the following link to be the most useful:How to Specify an ssh Key File with the git command The point being that there is no git command such as the following:Alvin\'s solution is to use a well-defined bash-wrapper script that fills this gap:Where git.sh is:I can verify that this solved a problem I was having with user/key recognition for a remote bitbucket repo with git remote update, git pull, and git clone; all of which now work fine in a cron job script that was otherwise having trouble navigating the limited-shell. I was also able to call this script from within R and still solve the exact same cron execute problem\n(e.g. system("bash git.sh -i ~/.ssh/thatuserkey.pem pull")).Not that R is the same as Ruby, but if R can do it... O:-)You could use GIT_SSH environment variable. But you will need to wrap ssh and options into a shell script.See git manual: man git in your command shell.The trick for me was to use git@hostname instead of http://hostnameIn Windows with Git Bash you can use the following to add a repository\nssh-agent bash -c \'ssh-add "key-address"; git remote add origin "rep-address"\'\nfor example: ssh-agent bash -c \'ssh-add /d/test/PrivateKey.ppk; git remote add origin git@git.test.com:test/test.git\' Which private key is in drive D, folder test of computer. Also if you want to clone a repository, you can change git remote add origin with git clone.After enter this to Git Bash, it will ask you for passphrase!Be Aware that openssh private key and putty private key are diiferent!If you have created your keys with puttygen, you must convert your private key to openssh!I use zsh and different keys are loaded to my zsh shell\'s ssh-agent automatically for other purposes (i.e. access to remote servers) on my laptop. I modified @Nick\'s answer and I\'m using it for one of my repos that needs to be refreshed often. (In this case it\'s my dotfiles which I want same and latest version across my all machines, wherever I\'m working.)for the gitlab RSAAuthentication yes doc is here
