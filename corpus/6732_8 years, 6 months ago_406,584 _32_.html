We need to display a tick symbol (✓ or ✔) within an internal web app and would ideally like to avoid using an image.Has to work starting with IE 6.0.2900 on a XP box, ideally we need it be cross-browser (IE + recent versions of FF).The following displays boxes although sets browser encoding to UTF-8 (META works nicely and not the issue). The default font is Times New Roman (might be an issue, but trying Lucida Sans Unicode doesn\'t help and I don\'t have neither Arial Unicode MS, nor Lucida Grande installed).Any help appreciated.The following works under IE 6.0 and IE 7:I would appreciate if someone could check under FF on Windows. I am pretty sure it won\'t work on a non Windows box.I think you\'re using less-well-supported Unicode values, which don\'t always have glyphs for all the code points.\nTry the following characters:Edit: There seems to be some confusion about the first symbol here, \xe2\x98\x90 / 0x2610. This is an empty (unchecked) checkbox, so if you see a box, that\'s the way it\'s supposed to look. It\'s the counterpart to \xe2\x98\x91 / 0x2611, which is the checked version.First off, you should realize that you don\'t actually need to use HTML entities \xe2\x80\x93 as long as your HTML document\'s encoding is declared properly as UTF-8, you can simply copy/paste these symbols into your file/server-side script/JavaScript/whatever.Having said that, here\'s the exhaustive list of all relevant UTF-8 characters / HTML entities related to this topic:Checking out web fonts for tick symbols? Here\'s a ready to use sample for the more common ones: A\xe2\x98\x90B\xe2\x98\x91C\xe2\x98\x92D\xe2\x9c\x93E\xe2\x9c\x94F\xe2\x9c\x97G\xe2\x9c\x98H -- just copy/paste this into your webfont provider\'s sample text box and see which fonts support what tick symbols.The client machine needs a proper font that has a glyph for this character to display it. But Times New Roman doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. Try Arial Unicode MS or Lucida Grande instead:This works for me on Windows XP in IE 5.5, IE 6.0, FF 3.0.6.I normally use the fontawesome font(http://fontawesome.io/icon/check/), you can use it in html files:     or in css:Why don\'t you use the HTML input checkbox element in read only modeI assume this will work on all browsers.I run into the same problem and none of the suggestions worked (Firefox on Windows XP). So I found a possible workaround using image data to display a little checkmark:Of course you can create your own checkmark image and use a converter to add it as data:image/gif. Hope this helps.although sets browser encoding to UTF-8(If you\'re using numeric character references of course it doesn\'t matter what encoding is being used, browsers will get the correct Unicode codepoint directly from the number.)I would appreciate if someone could check under FF on Windows. I am pretty sure it won\'t work on a non Windows box.Fails for me in Firefox 3, Opera, and Safari. Curiously, works in the other Webkit browser, Chrome. Also fails on Linux (obviously, as Wingdings isn\'t installed there; it is installed on Macs, but that doesn\'t help you if Safari\'s not having it).Also it\'s a pretty nasty hack\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x89that character is to all intents and purposes \xe2\x80\x9c\xc3\xbc\xe2\x80\x9d and will appear that way to things like search engines, or if the text is copy-and-pasted. Proper Unicode code points are the way to go unless you really have no alternative.The problem is that no font bundled with Windows supplies U+2713 CHECK MARK (\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x9c\x93\xe2\x80\x99). The only one that you\'re at all likely to find on a Windows machine is \xe2\x80\x9cArial Unicode MS\xe2\x80\x9d, which is not really to be relied upon. So in the end I think you\'ll have to either:Coming very late to the party, I found that &check; (&check;) worked in Opera.  I haven\'t tested it on any other browsers, but it might be useful for some people.Would √ (square root symbol, &#8730;) suffice?Alternatively, ensure you\'re setting the Content-Type: header before sending data to the browser. Merely specifying the <meta> content-type tag may not be enough to encourage browsers to use the correct character set.Using CSS content Property you can show tick with image or other code sign.Solution using Wingdings  which is not unicode based and doesn\'t work in Linux without Wingdings installed.you could use   ⊕ or ⊗
