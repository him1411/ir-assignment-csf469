Getting the user\'s current location within a threshold ASAP and at the same time conserve battery.First off, android has two providers; network and GPS. Sometimes network is better and sometimes the GPS is better.By "better" I mean speed vs. accuracy ratio.\nI\'m willing to sacrifice a few meters in accuracy if I can get the location almost instant and without turning on the GPS.Secondly, if you request updates for location changes nothing is sent if the current location is stable.Google has an example of determining the "best" location here: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/location/obtaining-user-location.html#BestEstimate\nBut I think it\'s no where near as good as it should/could be.I\'m kind of confused why google hasn\'t a normalized API for location, the developer shouldn\'t have to care where the location is from, you should just specify what you want and the phone should choose for you.I need to find a good way to determine the "best" location, maybe though some heuristic or maybe through some 3rd party library.This does not mean determine the best provider!\nI\'m probably gonna use all providers and picking the best of them.The app will collect the user\'s location at a fixed interval (let say every 10 minutes or so) and send it to a server.\nThe app should conserve as much battery as possible and the location should have X (50-100?) meters accuracy.The goal is to later be able to plot the user\'s path during the day on a map so I need sufficient accuracy for that.What do you think are reasonable values on desired and accepted accuracies?\nI\'ve been using 100m as accepted and 30m as desired, is this to much to ask?\nI\'d like to be able to plot the user\'s path on a map later.\nIs 100m for desired and 500m for accepted better?Also, right now I have the GPS on for a maximum of 60 seconds per location update, is this too short to get a location if you\'re indoors with an accuracy of maybe 200m?This is my current code, any feedback is appreciated (apart from the lack of error checking which is TODO):Looks like we\'re coding the same application ;-)\nHere is my current implementation. I\'m still in the beta testing phase of my GPS uploader app, so there might be many possible improvements. but it seems to work pretty well so far.Edit: here is the part that requests the periodic updates from the location providers:Things to consider:do not request GPS updates too often, it drains battery power. I currently\nuse 30 min as default for my application. add a \'minimum distance to last known location\' check. without this, your points \nwill "jump around" when GPS is not available and the location is being triangulated\nfrom the cell towers. or you can check if the new location is outside of the accuracy\nvalue from the last known location.To select the right location provider for your app, you can use Criteria objects:Read the documentation for requestLocationUpdates for more details on how the arguments are taken into account:The frequency of notification may be controlled using the minTime and\n  minDistance parameters. If minTime is greater than 0, the LocationManager\n  could potentially rest for minTime milliseconds between location updates\n  to conserve power. If minDistance is greater than 0, a location will only\n  be broadcasted if the device moves by minDistance meters. To obtain\n  notifications as frequently as possible, set both parameters to 0.Answering the first two points:GPS will always give you a more precise location, if it is enabled and if there are no thick walls around.If location did not change, then you can call getLastKnownLocation(String) and retrieve the location immediately.Using an alternative approach:You can try getting the cell id in use or all the neighboring cellsYou can refer then to cell location through several open databases (e.g., http://www.location-api.com/ or http://opencellid.org/ )The strategy would be to read the list of tower IDs when reading the location. Then, in next query (10 minutes in your app), read them again. If at least some towers are the same, then it\'s safe to use getLastKnownLocation(String). If they\'re not, then wait for onLocationChanged(). This avoids the need of a third party database for the location. You can also try this approach.This is my solution which works fairly well:Location accuracy depends mostly on the location provider used:If it\'s accuracy you are looking for, then GPS is your only option.I\'ve read a very informative article about it here.As for the GPS timeout - 60 seconds should be sufficient, and in most cases even too much. I think 30 seconds is OK and sometimes even less than 5 sec...if you only need a single location, I\'d suggest that in your onLocationChanged method, once you receive an update you\'ll unregister the listener and avoid unnecessary usage of the GPS.Android-ReactiveLocation library is another nice library to handle location in Android.Small library that wraps Google Play Service API in brilliant RxJava\n  Observables reducing boilerplate to minimum.https://github.com/mcharmas/Android-ReactiveLocationhi this is one link which will able to give the whole of the source code to integate that of the gps location which will able to track any of the person by the gps and ti will inform :like: http://code.google.com/p/mytracks/Currently i am using since this is trustable for getting location and calculating distance for my application...... i am using this for my taxi application.use the fusion API that google developer have developed with fusion of GPS Sensor,Magnetometer,Accelerometer also using Wifi or cell location to calculate or estimate the location. It is also able to give location updates also inside the building accurately.\nfor detail get to link \nhttps://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/FusedLocationProviderApiIn my experience, I\'ve found it best to go with the GPS fix unless it\'s not available.  I don\'t know much about other location providers, but I know that for GPS there are a few tricks that can be used to give a bit of a ghetto precision measure.  The altitude is often a sign, so you could check for ridiculous values.  There is the accuracy measure on Android location fixes.  Also if you can see the number of satellites used, this can also indicate the precision.An interesting way of getting a better idea of the accuracy could be to ask for a set of fixes very rapidly, like ~1/sec for 10 seconds and then sleep for a minute or two.  One talk I\'ve been to has led to believe that some android devices will do this anyway.  You would then weed out the outliers (I\'ve heard Kalman filter mentioned here) and use some kind of centering strategy to get a single fix.Obviously the depth you get to here depends on how hard your requirements are.  If you have particularly strict requirement to get THE BEST location possible, I think you\'ll find that GPS and network location are as similar as apples and oranges.  Also GPS can be wildly different from device to device.Skyhook (http://www.skyhookwireless.com/) has a location provider that is much faster than the standard one Google provides. It might be what you\'re looking for. I\'m not affiliated with them.
