I need to read a large text file of around 5-6 GB line by line using Java.How can I do this quickly? A common pattern is to useYou can read the data faster if you assume there is no character encoding. e.g. ASCII-7 but it won\'t make much difference.  It is highly likely that what you do with the data will take much longer.EDIT: A less common pattern to use which avoids the scope of line leaking.UPDATE: In Java 8 you can doNOTE: You have to place the Stream in a try-with-resource block to ensure the file is closed. If you don\'t do this, the GC might clean up/close the file before you run out of file handles (or it might not)Look at this blog:The buffer size may be specified, or\n  the default size may be used. The\n  default is large enough for most\n  purposes.Once java-8 is out (March 2014) you\'ll be able to use streams:Printing all the lines in the file:Here is a sample with full error handling and supporting charset specification for pre-Java 7.  With Java 7 you can use try-with-resources syntax, which makes the code cleaner.If you just want the default charset you can skip the InputStream and use FileReader.Here is the Groovy version, with full error handling:In Java 8, you could do:Some notes: The stream returned by Files.lines (unlike most streams) needs to be closed. For the reasons mentioned here I avoid using forEach(). The strange code (Iterable<String>) lines::iterator casts a Stream to an Iterable.What you can do is scan the entire text using Scanner and go through the text line by line.\nOf course you should import the following:Scanner basically scans all the text. The while loop is used to traverse through the entire text.The .hasNextLine() function is a boolean that returns true if there are still more lines in the text. The .nextLine() function gives you an entire line as a String which you can then use the way you want. Try System.out.println(line) to print the text.Side Note: .txt is the file type text.FileReader won\'t let you specify the encoding, use InputStreamReaderinstead if you need to specify it:If you imported this file from Windows, it might have ANSI encoding (Cp1252), so you have to specify the encoding. In Java 7:You can use Scanner classYou need to use the readLine() method in class BufferedReader.\nCreate a new object from that class and operate this method on him and save it to a string.BufferReader JavadocIn Java 8, there is also an alternative to using Files.lines(). If your input source isn\'t a file but something more abstract like a Reader or an InputStream, you can stream the lines via the BufferedReaders lines() method.For example:will call processLine() for each input line read by the BufferedReader.For Reading file with java 8The clear way to achieve this,For example:If you have dataFile.txt on your current directoryThe output like as below,\nI usually do the reading routine straightforward: You can also use apache commons io:It works for me. Hope It will help you too.You can use streams to do it more precisely,\nFiles.lines(Paths.get("input.txt")).forEach(s -> stringBuffer.append(s);
