I just installed node and npm through the package on nodejs.org and whenever I try to search or install something with npm it throws the following error, unless I sudo the command.  I have a feeling this is a permissions issue?  I am already the admin.This looks like a permissions issue in your home directory. To reclaim ownership of the .npm directory execute:Permissions you used when installing Node will be required when doing things like writing in your npm directory (npm link, npm install -g, etc.).You probably ran node installation with root permissions, that\'s why the global package installation is asking you to be root.Don\'t hack with permissions, install node the right way.On a development machine, you should not install and run node with root permissions, otherwise things like npm link, npm install -g will need the same permissions.NVM (Node Version Manager) allows you to install Node without root permissions and also allows you to install many versions of Node to play easily with them.. Perfect for development.Now npm link, npm install -g will no longer require you to be root.Don\'t hack with permissions, install npm packages globally the right way.If you are on OSX or Linux, you can create a user dedicated directory for your global package and setup npm and node to know how to find globally installed packages.Check out this great article for step by step instructions on installing npm modules globally without sudo.See also: npm\'s documentation on Fixing npm permissions.Also you will need the write permission in node_modules directory:  I encountered this when installing Recess (https://github.com/twitter/recess) to compile my CSS for Bootstrap 3.When installing recess:You need to unlock permissions in your home directory, like Noah\nsays:You also need write permissions to the node_modules directory, like Xilo\nsays, so if it still isn\'t working, try:If you are still seeing errors, you may also need to correct /usr/local permissions:Please note that as indicated in this post /usr/local/ isn\'t actually a system dir if you are on a Mac, so, this answer is actually perfectly "safe" for Mac users. However, if you are on Linux, see Christopher Will\'s answer below for a multi-user friendly, system dir safe (but more complex) solution. Changing the owner on "system-global" folders is a hack. On a fresh install, I would configure NPM to use an already writable location for "user-global" programs:Then make sure you add that folder to your path:See @ErikAndreas\' answer to NPM modules won\'t install globally without sudo\n and longer step-by-step guide by @sindresorhus with also sets $MANPATH.Other answers are suggesting to change ownerships or permissions of system directories to a specific user. I highly disadvise from doing so, this can become very awkward and might mess up the entire system! Here is a more generic and safer approach that supports multi-user as well.Create a new group for node-users and add the required users to this group. Then set the ownership of node-dependant files/directories to this group.Now you can easily install your modules as userSome modules (grunt, bower, yo etc.) will still need to be installed as root. This is because they create symlinks in /user/bin/.Edit3 years later I\'d recommend to use Node Version  Manager. It safes you a lot of time and trouble.As if we need more answers here, but anyway..Sindre Sorus has a guide Install npm packages globally without sudo on OS X and Linux outlining how to cleanly install without messing with permissions: Here is a way to install packages globally for a given user.Create a directory for your global packagesReference this directory for future usage in your .bashrc/.zshrc:Indicate to npm where to store your globally installed package. In your $HOME/.npmrc file add:Ensure node will find them. Add the following to your .bashrc/.zshrc:Ensure you\'ll find installed binaries and man pages. Add the following to your .bashrc/.zshrc:Check out npm-g_nosudo for doing the above steps automagicallyCheckout the source of this guide for the latest updates.When you run npm install -g somepackage, you may get an EACCES error asking you to run the command again as root/Administrator. It\'s a permissions issue.It\'s easy to fix, open your terminal (Applications > Utilities > Terminal)** I strongly recommend you to not use the package management with sudo (sudo npm -g install something), because you can get some issues later **Reference: http://foohack.com/2010/08/intro-to-npm/The official documentation on how to fix npm install permissions with an EACCES error is located at https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions. I encountered this problem after a fresh install of node using the .pkg installer on OSX. There are some great answers here, but I didn\'t see a link to npmjs.com yet.Option 1: Change the permission to npm\'s default directoryFind the path to npm\'s directory:For many systems, this will be /usr/local.WARNING: If the displayed path is just /usr, switch to Option 2.Change the owner of npm\'s directories to the name of the current user (your username!):This changes the permissions of the sub-folders used by npm and some other tools (lib/node_modules, bin, and share).Option 2: Change npm\'s default directory to another directoryThere are times when you do not want to change ownership of the default directory that npm uses (i.e. /usr) as this could cause some problems, for example if you are sharing the system with other users.Instead, you can configure npm to use a different directory altogether. In our case, this will be a hidden directory in our home folder.Make a directory for global installations:Configure npm to use the new directory path:Open or create a ~/.profile file and add this line:Back on the command line, update your system variables:For Mac (adopted from Christoper Will\'s answer)Mac OS X 10.9.4  System Preference > Users & Groups > (unlock) > press + :   New Account > "Group"\n   Account Name : nodegrp  After creating the group, tick the user to be included in this groupsudo chgrp -R nodegrp /usr/local/lib/node_modules/\n      sudo chgrp nodegrp /usr/bin/node\n      sudo chgrp nodegrp /usr/bin/npm\n      sudo chown -R $(whoami):nodegrp ~/.npmFor me, execute onlydoesn\'t work. Then, I execute tooAnd all works fine!Watch OUT!!! Watch OUT!!! Watch OUT!!! chown or chmod is NOT the solution, because of security-risk.Instead do this:First check, where npm point to, if you call:If /usr is returned, you can do the following:This create a npm-Direktory in your Home-Directory and point npm to it.To got this changes permanent, you have to add the export-command to your .bashrc:I had a similar problem at NPM modules won't install globally without sudo, the issue was that when i installed node i did it with sudo via chris/lea ppa repo.My solution was to uninstall node and then install it this way:Download latest stable node sources from nodejs.org #in my case node-v0.10.20.tar.gztar -zxf node-v0.10.20.tar.gz #uncompress sourcescd node-v0.10.20 #enter uncompressed foldersudo chown $USER -R /usr/local./configure --prefix=/usr/local && make && make installPD: If you don\'t want to change ownership of the /usr/local folder, you can install it somewhere you already own. The problem of this approach is that you will have to bind the installation folder with the bash command line so that we can use the node command later onmkdir ~/opt./configure --prefix=~/opt && make && make installecho \'export PATH=~/opt/bin:${PATH}\' >> ~/.bashrc #or ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile or ~/.zshenv depending on the current Operative SystemWith either of those approaches, you will be able to do the following without using sudonpm install -g module_to_installIn my case,it\'s because of the permission of ~/tmp.So I do:And it\'s OK!TL;DRalways use sudo -i or sudo -H when running npm install to install global packages.--When you use npm it downloads packages to your user home directory.  When you run as sudo, npm installs files to the same directory, but now they are owned by root.So this is what happens to absolutely every single person who has ever used npm:When you use the -i or -H option with sudo, your home directory will be root\'s home directory.  Any global installs will cache packages to /root/.npm instead of root-owned files at /home/me/.npm.Just always use sudo -i or sudo -H when running npm install to install global packages and your npm permissions problems will melt away.For good.http://hood.ie/blog/why-you-shouldnt-use-sudo-with-npm.html--\nq.v. the accepted answer for fixing an already fucked npm.This is how I solved the issue on Windows 8.1:On Mac OS X, when installing with Homebrew\'s brew install npm, the installation path is /usr/local/share/npm/ with both bin/ and lib/node_modules/ subfolders.Running this command to change to owner to your currently logged in user should fix it all up, and allow you to install global NPM packages without sudo.osx homebrewJohn Papa points to the history and reasoning behind this issue and gives a solid fix:John Papa\'s steps are to: Hope this helps the curious!If something like below pops up during npm install or Want to install packages globally on a Mac use Sudonpm ERR! code EACCES\n  npm ERR! errno -13\n  npm ERR! syscall accessProblem:\nYou do not have permission to write to the directories that npm uses to store global packages and commands.Solution:\nAllow permission for npm.Open a terminal:command + spacebar then type \'terminal\'Enter this command: sudo chown -R $(whoami) $(npm config get\n  prefix)/{lib/node_modules,bin,share}This solution allows permission to ONLY the directories needed, keeping the other directories nice and safe.Actually, I was also having the same problem. I was running Ubuntu. Mine problem arises because I\'d lost my public key of the Ubuntu. Even updating my system was not happening. It was giving GPG error. In that case, you can regain your key by using this command:After that npm works fine!If changing permissions for directory /usr/local/lib/npm_modules\nnot helps, u should add your user to group (in most cases this is staff group), that has rwx rights for /usr/bin directory.\nBecause npm tries to make symlink with /usr/bin/__package__.P.S. Don\'t forget to relogin after changing user groupThis is the solution I utilized and worked.  I tried utilizing whoami never worked.sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local/lib/node_modulesthensudo chown -R $USER /usr/local/bin/npmthensudo chown -R $USER /usr/local/bin/nodeAnother great fix here to configure NPM properly, run the following commands :@Yves M.\'s answer was very similar to my solution.  Here are the commands I used, which were slightly different from his.Then query for the latest version:Then install the newest version:exampleWhat to me seems like the best option is the one suggested in the npm documentation, which is to first check where global node_modules are installed by default by running npm config get prefix. If you get, like I do on Trusty, /usr, you might want to change it to a folder that you can safely own without messing things up the way I did.To do that, choose or create a new folder in your system. You may want to have it in your home directory or, like me, under /usr/local for consistency because I\'m also a Mac user (I prefer not to need to look into different places depending on the machine I happen to be in front of). Another good reason to do that is the fact that the /usr/local folder is probably already in your PATH (unless you like to mess around with your PATH) but chances are your newly-created folder isn\'t and you\'d need to add it to the PATH yourself on your .bash-profile or .bashrc file.Long story short, I changed the default location of the global modules with npm config set prefix \'/usr/local\', created the folder /usr/local/lib/node_modules (it will be used by npm) and changed permissions for the folders used by npm with the command: Now you can globally install any module safely. Hope this helps!install npm package using sudo user mode like thisI found that if you only sudo -s "it just starts up a shell with root permissions as a one step" and it really works for me. I don\'t know if it\'s a good practice or not.I hope it helps.Reference: https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/14423/revisionsBest solution would be this which is provided by npm documentation.For Ubuntu suggested solution is Option#2Brief steps:\nMake a directory for global installations:\nmkdir ~/.npm-global Configure npm to use the new directory path:\nnpm config set prefix \'~/.npm-global\'\nnpm config get prefix can help you to verify if prefix was updated or not. The result would be <Your Home Directory>/.npm-globalOpen or create a ~/.profile file and add this line:\nexport PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH Back on the command line, update your system variables:\nsource ~/.profileInstead of steps 2-4 you can also use the corresponding ENV variable\n(e.g. if you don\'t want to modify ~/.profile):  NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX=~/.npm-globalFor Mac suggested solution is Option#3On Mac OS you can avoid this problem altogether by using the Homebrew package manager  brew install nodeI set my user account as the owner of the /usr/local directory, so that can just issue normal commands in there.sudo chown -R $USER /usr/localReference: http://howtonode.org/introduction-to-npm
