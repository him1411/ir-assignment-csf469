Is it possible to remove the # symbol from angular.js URLs?I still want to be able to use the browser\'s back button, etc, when I change the view and will update the URL with params, but I don\'t want the # symbol.The tutorial routeProvider is declared as follows:Can I edit this to have the same functionality without the #?Yes, you should configure $locationProvider and set html5Mode to true:Be sure to check browser support for the html5 history API:To remove the Hash tag for a pretty URL and also for your code to work after minification you need to \nstructure your code like the example below:I write out a rule in web.config after $locationProvider.html5Mode(true) is set in app.js. Hope, helps someone out.In my index.html I added this to <head>Don\'t forget to install url rewriter for iis on server.Also if you use Web Api and IIS, this match url will not work out, as it will change your api calls. So add third input(third line of condition) and give out a pattern that will exclude calls from www.yourdomain.com/apiIf you are in .NET stack with MVC with AngularJS, this is what you have to do to remove the \'#\'  from url: Set up your base href in your _Layout page: <head> <base href="/"> </head>Then, add following in your angular app config : $locationProvider.html5Mode(true)Above will remove \'#\' from url but page refresh won\'t work e.g. if you are in "yoursite.com/about" page refreash will give you a 404. This is because MVC does not know about angular routing and by MVC pattern it will look for a MVC page for \'about\' which does not exists in MVC routing path. Workaround for this is to send all MVC page request to a single MVC view and you can do that by adding a route that catches all url: You can tweak the html5mode but that is only functional for links included in html anchors of your page and how the url looks like in the browser address bar. Attempting to request a subpage without the hashtag (with or without html5mode) from anywhere outside the page will result in a 404 error. For example, the following CURL request will result in a page not found error, irrespective of html5mode:although the following will return the root/home page:The reason for this is that anything after the hashtag is stripped off before the request arrives at the server. So a request for http://foo.bar/#/portfolio arrives at the server as a request for http://foo.bar. The server will respond with a 200 OK response (presumably) for http://foo.bar and the agent/client will process the rest. So in cases that you want to share a url with others, you have no option but to include the hashtag. Follow 2 steps- \n1. First set the $locationProvider.html5Mode(true) in your app config file. For eg -\n angular.module(\'test\', [\'ui.router\']) .config(function($stateProvider, $urlRouterProvider, $locationProvider) { $locationProvider.html5Mode(true); $urlRouterProvider.otherwise(\'/\'); });   2.Second set the <base> inside your main page.\nFor eg -> \n <base href="/">  The $location service will automatically fallback to the hash-part method for browsers that do not support the HTML5 History API.My solution is create .htaccess and use #Sorian code.. without .htaccess I failed to remove #As has been mentioned in above answers the steps are-Add  to index.html\nEnable html5mode $location.html5Mode(true) in app.js.With this the application will work good. But only in the scenarios when you navigate from the index.html to other pages. For example my base page is- www.javainuse.com. If I click on link java it will correctly navigate to www.javainuse.com/java.However if i directly go to www.javainuse.com/java will get page no found error.To resolve this we have to use url rewriting. Dot net requires URL rewriting for IIS.If you are using tomcat then URL rewriting will have to be done using Tuckey. Can get more information on URL rewriting hereAccording to the documentation. You can use:NB: If your browser does not support to HTML 5. Dont worry :D it have\n  fallback to hashbang mode. So, you don\'t need to check with if(window.history && window.history.pushState){ ... } manuallyFor example: If you click: <a href="/other">Some URL</a> In HTML5 Browser:\nangular will automatically redirect to example.com/otherIn Not HTML5 Browser:\nangular will automatically redirect to example.com/#!/otherStep 1: Inject the $locationProvider service into the app config\'s constructorStep 2: Add code line $locationProvider.html5Mode(true) to the app config\'s constructor.Step 3: in the container (landing, master, or layout) page, add  html tag such as <base href="/"> inside the  tag.Step 4: remove all \'#" for routing config from all anchor tags. For examples, href="#home" becomes href="home"; href="#about" becomes herf="about"; href="#contact" becomes href="contact"This answer assumes that you are using nginx as reverse proxy and you already did set $locationProvider.html5mode to true.->For the people who might still be struggling with all cool stuff above.Surely, @maxim grach solution works fine, but for the solution for how to respond to requests that doesn\'t want the hashtag to be included in the first place what can be done is check if php is sending 404 and then rewrite the url. Following is the code for nginx,In the php location, detect 404 php error and redirect to another location, Then rewrite url in redirect location and proxy_pass the data, offcourse, put your website url at the place of my blog\'s url. (Request : Question this only after you tried it)And see the magic.And it definitely works, atleast for me.Just add $locationProvider Inand then add $locationProvider.hashPrefix(\'\');\nafter That\'s it.
