In the Python multiprocessing library, is there a variant of pool.map which support multiple arguments?The answer to this is version- and situation-dependent. The most general answer for recent versions of Python (since 3.3) was first described below by J.F. Sebastian.1 It uses the Pool.starmap method, which accepts a sequence of argument tuples. It then automatically unpacks the arguments from each tuple and passes them to the given function:In simpler cases, with a fixed second argument, you can also use partial, but only in Python 2.7 and above:If using Python 2.6, you\'ll need to write a helper function to unpack the arguments explicitly.1. Much of this was inspired by his answer, which should probably have been accepted instead. But since this one is stuck at the top, it seemed best to improve it for future readers.is there a variant of pool.map which support multiple arguments?Python 3.3 includes pool.starmap() method:For older versions:Notice how itertools.izip() and itertools.repeat() are used here.Due to the bug mentioned by @unutbu you can\'t use functools.partial() or similar capabilities on Python 2.6, so the simple wrapper function func_star() should be defined explicitly. See also the workaround suggested by uptimebox.I think the below will be betteroutputUsing Python 3.3+ with pool.starmap():Result:You can also zip() more arguments if you like: zip(a,b,c,d,e)In case you want to have a constant value passed as an argument you have to use import itertools and then zip(itertools.repeat(constant), a) for example.Having learnt about itertools in J.F. Sebastian answer I decided to take it a step further and write a parmap package that takes care about parallelization, offering map and starmap functions on python-2.7 and python-3.2 (and later also) that can take any number of positional arguments.InstallationHow to parallelize:I have uploaded parmap to PyPI and to a github repository.As an example, the question can be answered as follows:There\'s a fork of multiprocessing called pathos (note: use the version on github) that doesn\'t need starmap -- the map functions mirror the API for python\'s map, thus map can take multiple arguments. With pathos, you can also generally do multiprocessing in the interpreter, instead of being stuck in the __main__ block. Pathos is due for a release, after some mild updating -- mostly conversion to python 3.x.You can use the following two functions so as to avoid writing a wrapper for each new function:Use the function function with the lists of arguments arg_0, arg_1 and arg_2 as follows:Another simple alternative is to wrap your function parameters in a tuple and then wrap the parameters that should be passed in tuples as well. This is perhaps not ideal when dealing with large pieces of data. I believe it would make copies for each tuple.Gives the output in some random order:Another way is to pass a list of lists to a one-argument routine:One can than construct a list lists of arguments with one\'s favorite method.A better way is using decorator instead of writing wrapper function by hand. Especially when you have a lot of functions to map, decorator will save your time by avoiding  writing wrapper for every function. Usually a decorated function is not picklable, however we may use functools to get around it. More disscusions can be found here.Here the exampleThen you may map it with zipped argumentsOf course, you may always use Pool.starmap in Python 3 (>=3.3) as mentioned in other answers.From python 3.4.4, you can use multiprocessing.get_context() to obtain a context object to use multiple start methods:Or you just simply replace by:A better solution for python2:2 3 41 2 30 1 2out[]:[3, 5, 7]In the official documentation states that it supports only one iterable argument. I like to use apply_async in such cases. In your case I would do:
