I have read articles about the differences between SOAP and REST as a web service communication protocol, but I think that the biggest advantages for REST over SOAP are: REST is more dynamic, no need for creating and updating UDDI.REST is not restricted to XML format. REST web services can send\nplain text, JSON, and also XML.But SOAP is more standardized (Ex; security).So, am I correct in these points?Unfortunately, there are a lot of misinformation and misconceptions around REST. Not only your question and the answer by @cmd reflect those, but most of the questions and answers related to the subject on Stack Overflow.SOAP and REST can\'t be compared directly, since the first is a protocol (or at least tries to be) and the second is an architectural style. This is probably one of the sources of confusion around it, since people tend to call REST any HTTP API that isn\'t SOAP.Pushing things a little and trying to establish a comparison, the main difference between SOAP and REST is the degree of coupling between client and server implementations. A SOAP client works like a custom desktop application, tightly coupled to the server. There\'s a rigid contract between client and server, and everything is expected to break if either side changes anything. You need constant updates following any change, but it\'s easier to ascertain if the contract is being followed.A REST client is more like a browser. It\'s a generic client that knows how to use a protocol and standardized methods, and an application has to fit inside that. You don\'t violate the protocol standards by creating extra methods, you leverage on the standard methods and create the actions with them on your media type. If done right, there\'s less coupling, and changes can be dealt with more gracefully. A client is supposed to enter a REST service with zero knowledge of the API, except for the entry point and the media type. In SOAP, the client needs previous knowledge on everything it will be using, or it won\'t even begin the interaction. Additionally, a REST client can be extended by code-on-demand supplied by the server itself, the classical example being JavaScript code used to drive the interaction with another service on the client-side.I think these are the crucial points to understand what REST is about, and how it differs from SOAP:REST is protocol independent. It\'s not coupled to HTTP. Pretty much like you can follow an ftp link on a website, a REST application can use any protocol for which there is a standardized URI scheme.REST is not a mapping of CRUD to HTTP methods. Read this answer for a detailed explanation on that.REST is as standardized as the parts you\'re using. Security and authentication in HTTP are standardized, so that\'s what you use when doing REST over HTTP.REST is not REST without hypermedia and HATEOAS. This means that a client only knows the entry point URI and the resources are supposed to return links the client should follow. Those fancy documentation generators that give URI patterns for everything you can do in a REST API miss the point completely. They are not only documenting something that\'s supposed to be following the standard, but when you do that, you\'re coupling the client to one particular moment in the evolution of the API, and any changes on the API have to be documented and applied, or it will break.REST is the architectural style of the web itself. When you enter Stack Overflow, you know what a User, a Question and an Answer are, you know the media types, and the website provides you with the links to them. A REST API has to do the same. If we designed the web the way people think REST should be done, instead of having a home page with links to Questions and Answers, we\'d have a static documentation explaining that in order to view a question, you have to take the URI stackoverflow.com/questions/<id>, replace id with the Question.id and paste that on your browser. That\'s nonsense, but that\'s what many people think REST is.This last point can\'t be emphasized enough. If your clients are building URIs from templates in documentation and not getting links in the resource representations, that\'s not REST. Roy Fielding, the author of REST, made it clear on this blog post: REST APIs must be hypertext-driven. With the above in mind, you\'ll realize that while REST might not be restricted to XML, to do it correctly with any other format you\'ll have to design and standardize some format for your links. Hyperlinks are standard in XML, but not in JSON. There are draft standards for JSON, like HAL.Finally, REST isn\'t for everyone, and a proof of that is how most people solve their problems very well with the HTTP APIs they mistakenly called REST and never venture beyond that. REST is hard to do sometimes, especially in the beginning, but it pays over time with easier evolution on the server side, and client\'s resilience to changes. If you need something done quickly and easily, don\'t bother about getting REST right. It\'s probably not what you\'re looking for. If you need something that will have to stay online for years or even decades, then REST is for you.REST vs SOAP is not the right question to ask.REST, unlike SOAP is not a protocol.REST is an architectural style and a design for network-based software architectures.REST concepts are referred to as resources. A representation of a resource must be stateless. It is represented via some media type. Some examples of media types include XML, JSON, and RDF. Resources are manipulated by components. Components request and manipulate resources via a standard uniform interface. In the case of HTTP, this interface consists of standard HTTP ops e.g. GET, PUT, POST, DELETE.@Abdulaziz\'s question does illuminate the fact that REST and HTTP are often used in tandem. This is primarily due to the simplicity of HTTP and its very natural mapping to RESTful principles.Client-Server CommunicationClient-server architectures have a very distinct separation of concerns. All applications built in the RESTful style must also be client-server in principle.StatelessEach client request to the server requires that its state be fully represented. The server must be able to completely understand the client request without using any server context or server session state. It follows that all state must be kept on the client.CacheableCache constraints may be used, thus enabling response data to be marked as cacheable or not-cacheable. Any data marked as cacheable may be reused as the response to the same subsequent request.Uniform InterfaceAll components must interact through a single uniform interface. Because all component interaction occurs via this interface, interaction with different services is very simple. The interface is the same! This also means that implementation changes can be made in isolation. Such changes, will not affect fundamental component interaction because the uniform interface is always unchanged. One disadvantage is that you are stuck with the interface. If an optimization could be provided to a specific service by changing the interface, you are out of luck as REST prohibits this. On the bright side, however, REST is optimized for the web, hence incredible popularity of REST over HTTP!The above concepts represent defining characteristics of REST and differentiate the REST architecture from other architectures like web services. It is useful to note that a REST service is a web service, but a web service is not necessarily a REST service.See this blog post on REST Design Principals for more details on REST and the above stated bullets.EDIT: update content based on commentsSOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) and REST (Representation State Transfer) both are beautiful in their own way. So I am not comparing them, instead, I am trying to depict the picture, when I preferred to use REST and when SOAP.What is payload? When data is sent over the Internet, each unit transmitted includes both header information and the actual data being sent. The header identifies the source and destination of the packet, while the actual data is referred to as the payload. In general, payload is the data that is carried on behalf of an application and the data received by the destination system.Now for example I have to send a Telegram and we all know that the cost of the telegram will depend on number of words.So tell me among below mentioned these two messages, which one is cheaper to send?or I know your answer will be second one although both representing the same message second one is cheaper in terms of cost.So I am trying to say that, sending data over the network in Json format is cheaper than sending it in Xml format in terms of payload.Here is the first benefit or advantages of REST over SOAP. SOAP only support XML, but REST supports different format like text, JSON, XML etc. And we already know, if we use Json then definitely we will be in better place in terms of payload.Now, SOAP supports only XML, but it also has its own advantages. Really! How?SOAP relies on XML in three ways \nEnvelope \xe2\x80\x93 that defines what is in the message and how to process it.A set of encoding rules for data types, and finally the layout of the procedure calls and responses gathered. This envelope is sent via a transport (HTTP/HTTPS), and an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is executed and the envelope is returned with information in a XML formatted document.Here important point is that one of the advantages of SOAP is the use of the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneric\xe2\x80\x9d transport but REST uses HTTP/HTTPS. SOAP can use almost any transport to send the request but REST cannot. So here we got an advantage of using SOAP.As I already mentioned in above paragraph \xe2\x80\x9cREST uses HTTP/HTTPS\xe2\x80\x9d, so go bit deeper on these words.When we are talking about REST over HTTP, all security measures applied HTTP are inherited and this is known as transport level security and it secures messages only while it is inside the wire but once you delivered it on the other side you don\xe2\x80\x99t really know how many stages it will have to go through before reaching the real point where the data will be processed. And of course all those stages could use something different than HTTP.So Rest is not safer completely, right?But SOAP supports SSL just like REST additionally it also supports WS-Security which adds some enterprise security features. WS-Security offers protection from the creation of the message to it\xe2\x80\x99s consumption. So for transport level security whatever loophole we found that can be prevented using WS-Security.Apart from that, as REST is limited by it\'s HTTP protocol so it\xe2\x80\x99s transaction support is neither ACID compliant nor can provide two phase commit across distributed transnational resources.But SOAP has comprehensive support for both ACID based transaction management for short-lived transactions and compensation based transaction management for long-running transactions. It also supports two-phase commit across distributed resources.I am not drawing any conclusion, but I will definitely prefer SOAP based web service while security, transaction etc are the main concerns. Here is the "The Java EE 6 Tutorial" where they have said A RESTful design may be appropriate when the following conditions are met. Have a look.Hope you enjoyed reading my answer.SOAP vs REST Web ServicesThere are many differences between SOAP and REST web services. The important 10 differences between SOAP and REST are given below:REST(REpresentational State Transfer)\nREST is an architectural style. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t define so many standards like SOAP. REST is for are exposing a public API over the internet to handle CRUD operations on data. REST is focused on accessing named resources through a single consistent interface. SOAP(Simple Object Access Protocol)\nSOAP brings it\xe2\x80\x99s own protocol and focuses on exposing pieces of application logic (not data) as services. SOAP exposes operations. SOAP is focused on accessing named operations, each implement some business logic through different interfaces. Though SOAP is commonly referred to as web services this is a misnomer. SOAP has very little if anything to do with the Web. REST provides true Web services based on URIs and HTTP.  Why Rest? Why SOAP? source1\nsource2The decision between the two will be your first choice in designing a web service, so it is important to understand the pros and cons of the two. It is also important, in the sometimes heated debate between the two philosophies, to separate reality from rhetoric.REST fundamentalsSOAP fundamentalsSOAP vs REST?One of the major benefits of SOAP is that you have a WSDL service description. You can pretty much discover the service automatically and generate a useable client proxy from that service description (generate the service calls, the necessary data types for the methods and so forth). Note that with version 2.0, WSDL supports all HTTP verbs and can be used to document RESTful services as well, but there is a less verbose alternative in WADL (Web Application Description Language) for that purpose.With RESTful services, message security is provided by the transport protocol (HTTPS), and is point-to-point only. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a standard messaging system and expects clients to deal with communication failures by retrying. SOAP has successful/retry logic built in and provides end-to-end reliability even through SOAP intermediaries.One of the major benefits of RESTful API is that it is flexible for data representation, for example you could serialize your data in either XML or JSON format. RESTful APIs are cleaner or easier to understand because they add an element of using standardised URIs and gives importance to HTTP verb used (i.e. GET, POST, PUT and DELETE).RESTful services are also lightweight, that is they don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of extra xml markup. To invoke RESTful API all you need is a browser or HTTP stack and pretty much every device or machine connected to a network has that.Advantages of RESTAdvantages of SOAPWhere to use REST areas where REST works really well for are:Where to use SOAPareas where SOAP works as a great solutionare:Difference between Rest and SoapSOAPRESTFor more Details please see hereYou may like to have a look at this simple analogy to make things clearer.\nIMHO you can\'t compare SOAP and REST where those are two different things. SOAP is a protocol and REST is a software architectural pattern. There is a lot of misconception in the internet for SOAP vs REST. SOAP defines XML based message format that web service-enabled applications use to communicate each other over the internet. In order to do that the applications need  prior knowledge of the message contract, datatypes, etc.. REST represents the state(as resources) of a server from an URL.It is stateless and clients should not have prior knowledge to interact with server beyond the understanding of hypermedia. Well, I am seeing a lot of new web services are implemented using a REST style architecture these days rather than a SOAP one. Lets step back a second and explain what REST is.What is a REST Web ServiceThe acronym REST stands for Representational State Transfer, this basically means that each unique URL is a representation of some object. You can get the contents of that object using an HTTP GET, to delete it, you then might use a POST, PUT, or DELETE to modify the object (in practice most of the services use a POST for this).Who\'s using REST?All of Yahoo\'s web services use REST, including Flickr, del.icio.us API uses it, pubsub, bloglines, technorati, and both eBay, and Amazon have web services for both REST and SOAP.Who\'s using SOAP?Google seams to be consistent in implementing their web services to use SOAP, with the exception of Blogger, which uses XML-RPC. You will find SOAP web services in lots of enterprise software as well.REST vs SOAPAs you may have noticed the companies I mentioned that are using REST api\'s haven\'t been around for very long, and their apis came out this year mostly. So REST is definitely the trendy way to create a web service, if creating web services could ever be trendy (lets face it you use soap to wash, and you rest when your tired). The main advantages of REST web services are:SOAP also has some advantages:For consuming web services, its sometimes a toss up between which is easier. For instance Google\'s AdWords web service is really hard to consume (in CF anyways), it uses SOAP headers, and a number of other things that make it kind of difficult. On the converse, Amazon\'s REST web service can sometimes be tricky to parse because it can be highly nested, and the result schema can vary quite a bit based on what you search for.Which ever architecture you choose make sure its easy for developers to access it, and well documented.Hoping this will help you :)Addition for: ++ A mistake that\xe2\x80\x99s often made when approaching REST is to think of it as \xe2\x80\x9cweb services with URLs\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to think of REST as another remote procedure call (RPC) mechanism, like SOAP, but invoked through plain HTTP URLs and without SOAP\xe2\x80\x99s hefty XML namespaces.++ On the contrary, REST has little to do with RPC. Whereas RPC is service oriented and focused on actions and verbs, REST is resource oriented, emphasizing the things and nouns that comprise an application.
