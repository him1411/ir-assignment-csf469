I updated Eclipse with the new SDK tools (rev. 23), but now when Eclipse starts I receive the error:This Android SDK requires Android Developer Toolkit version 23.0.0 or above. Current version is 22.6.3.v201404151837-1123206. Please update ADT to the latest version.No updates were found with "Check for updates". If I try "Install new software", I can see version 23, but I can\'t upgrade due to the following error:After download of the last ADT from the web site, it seems there\'s another problem.With SDK Tools rev. 23 proguard is not installed, the folder SDK dir/tools/proguard is missing, and other tools are missing. This version contains several bugs.Google has released ADT v23.0.2. This solved many problems of previous ADT version 23.Step-by-step:Note: When I installed the new version of ADT, I didn\'t include the new version of "Android Native Development Tools" package. Instead, I installed the rest of packages first, and then installed "Android Native Development Tools". For a reason, if I try to install all the new packages including "Android Native Development Tools", the installation fails.If there is no "Remediation page", the only way to remove the ADT plugin from Eclipse is to go to menu Help \xe2\x86\x92 About Eclipse \xe2\x86\x92 Installation Details and uninstall from there. But there is a risk of uninstalling Eclipse itself.Google response:This is a packaging bug. The entire proguard file is missing. We\'ll have an update asap, but until then just copy it over from a previous version of the tools:and copy over the following files:So at the end if you started from a new ADT copy by hand the files :)Edit: with the latest ADT release, the bundle should now work with auto-update, so install these new versions:Don\'t try to upgrade from previous version because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work at all.\nIf you have got problems with zipalign, it\'s now under build-tools and no more under tools/ so you can do a symbolic link or just copy it into the expected folder.None of the other answers worked for me using the ADT bundle published on developer.android.com. I ended up downloading the latest version of Eclipse (not the ADT bundle) and then installing the ADT plugin via menu Help \xe2\x86\x92 Install new software \xe2\x86\x92 entering https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse (mentioned by @RED_). I also had to update my workspace to point to my previous workspace, and most things seemed to be restored.On a side note: This seems like a good time to migrate to Android Studio...NOTE: Use this approach with caution because this might break your Eclipse installation (see comments).This might help you if you installed the ADT plugin manually. But if you are using the version of Eclipse from the Eclipse ADT Bundle the below steps could break your Eclipse installation, and you may not be able to use Eclipse again!Go toMenu Help \xe2\x86\x92 About Eclipse SDK \xe2\x86\x92 Installation Details.Now you will see all 22.0 versions and then click Uninstall button at bottom.After uninstallation goto:Menu Help \xe2\x86\x92 Install New Software \xe2\x86\x92 enter http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/Then install all the things, and now it is ready.I was updating my build server today and came across the same issue. It has been reported here:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=72419The fix is in progress and the work around according to the project manager is:Please wait for an updated version within a day or two. Until then, your workaround is to do download one ofhttp://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r22.6.2-linux.tgzhttp://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r22.6.2-windows.ziphttp://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r22.6.2-macosx.zipand copy over the following files:[edit]\nzipalign was missing for me too, check to see if you need to copy this as wellIt works for me :)If for some reason you installed an ADT preview and need to revert back to the current stable, you can\'t use the dialog to install "new" software since what you want is actually an older one. Instead do this:is what they are saying about this:OK, guys, sorry about all this trouble, and we apologize for the messed up releases. Here\'s the summary:You can do one of two options:Install Eclipse from eclipse.org and install ADT by pointing to the update site: https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipseDownload bundles from here:Starting with ADT bundle 23.0.2, you should be able to update to future versions of ADT.Source: https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=72912I have done following to resolve an issue.Go to http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/installing-adt.html and download the latest ADT ZIP file (at the bottom of page).Go to Eclipse \xe2\x86\x92 menu Help \xe2\x86\x92 About Eclipse \xe2\x86\x92 Installation detailsDelete Android DDM, Android Development Tools, Hierarchy Viewer, Native Development Tools, TraceView, etc., 22.X version.Menu Help* \xe2\x86\x92 Install New Software \xe2\x86\x92 Add \xe2\x86\x92 Archive \xe2\x86\x92 *Select the downloaded ZIP file in step 1.Select all the latest version of all 23 which I have deleted in step 3 and accept the license agreement.Restart Eclipse, and it fixes my issue.Only helped:If you install a new Eclipse version it will work.\nHere\'s what I did:There is a lot of confusion going around in this thread. There are two solutions depending on how you installed ADT.If you installed the ADT plugin manually then I believe you can use the "Delete ADT" -> "Install New Software" approach.If you are using the ADT Bundle then do not follow that solution! You will break Eclipse. Here is an update from a Google member - read #18: https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=72912You must download a new version of the ADT-Bundle (yep, it\'s frustrating!).DO NOT DO THISWarning: Please see the comments below this answer. These steps have had a negative impact for many people.I hope it helps!After trying the approaches in other answers without success, I just installed a new bundle from http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html?pkg=adt and that worked fine.Do the following:With these steps, you should\'t have to reconfigure everything, and you won\'t need to spend time troubleshooting this BUG on this upgrade from Google Developers.Good luck! ;-)You need to uninstall the old version and install 23uninstall:\nHelp > about Eclipse SDK > Installation Details \nselect Android related packages to uninstallAnd then install V23.There is no way to update an existing ADT bundle that you might have downloaded.You can do one of two options:Install Eclipse from eclipse.org and install ADT by pointing to the update site: https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipseDownload bundles from:Linux 64 bit VM: http://dl.google.com/android/adt/adt-bundle-linux-x86_64-20140702.zipLinux 32 bit VM: http://dl.google.com/android/adt/adt-bundle-linux-x86-20140702.zipMac: http://dl.google.com/android/adt/adt-bundle-mac-x86_64-20140702.zipWindows 32 bit: http://dl.google.com/android/adt/adt-bundle-windows-x86-20140702.zipWindows 64 bit: http://dl.google.com/android/adt/adt-bundle-windows-x86_64-20140702.zipStarting with ADT bundle 23.0.2, you should be able to update to future versions of ADT.I was getting the same "conflicting dependency" error on Mac OS X 10.9.3 and simply upgrading was not an option.  What finally worked was downloading the latest Eclipse ADT bundle zip file from developer.android.com, extracting it and moving only "eclipse" folder to the place where my old eclipse folder was. (extracting the Eclipse ADT bundle zip file will give you "eclipse" and "sdk" folders).If you decide to go the same route, first make sure you know what your Workspace path is. This can be found in Preferences.  Then rename your old "eclipse" directory (not Eclipse.app) to something like eclipse-22.6.3, then move extracted "eclipse" folder into its place. Run new Eclipse.app inside, and when it asks you about Workspace, just enter the same path as you noted above.  Or it can also be set later in Preferences.Maybe worth adding is that to re-enable Android SDK Manager and Android Virtual Device Manager choose Window -> Customize Perspective -> Command Groups Availability and select Android SDK and AVD Manager. This will add these 2 items to the "Window" menu item for the current perspective (Java).I didn\'t move the extracted "sdk" folder, because I already had sdk folder in the same directory as eclipse, which I have already updated to the latest Android tools. But if it makes you feel safer, you can also rename your old sdk folder (for backup purposes) and move the freshly extracted one into its place.I faced the same problem and solved it. You need to uninstall the Android plugin entirely from within Eclipse (from the "about" section..), including trace view..Then added the ADT Plugin again (https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/) and install it.The problem is solved!I guess it\'s a bug with the SDK manager or ADT Plugin update mechanism...How to update from 22.xx.x to 23.0.2 (my solution).  This will beat the dependency issues.I was suffering from this issue for days, and I have tried every single solution on this link, but no luck. I finally figured out a solution that actually works!Please note that this solution works in Windows 7 (64 bit). It should probably work for other Windows operating systems.Here we go:download the latest ADT bundle fromhttp://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#downloadunzip it and open "eclipse" folder --> "plugins" folderNow go to your old eclipse and open "eclipse" folder --> "plugins" folder, and copy everything inside.Now paste them into the "plugins" folder of the (NEW ECLIPSE), but DO NOT overwrite anything.While inside of the "plugins" folder of your new Eclipse, do the search. Type in 22. (notice 22 with a dot) and hit enter.The search result will show up all the files or folders with .....22.6...... For example,Highlight all of these files/folders and hit delete key.Make sure to update your old API/SDK to the latest version and load this sdk directory to work with your new eclipse.orYou can watch this video, which shows you how to move all your SDK/API to your new SDK folder.Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPZpJdnbbN0I have not tried to update from any other ADT versions, but I think it should work for any old ADT versions too.Don\'t forget to backup stuff before attempting.What I have just found is that you need to update your ADT plugin in your Eclipse (whether stand alone or ADT Bundle) before updating your build tool.If your Eclipse installation points to the most recent Build Tool and your Eclipse is having ADT 22.x, it will show those errors.What worked for me: (on Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit) You may not have an older copy of Eclipse and Build tools, in that case you can uninstall latest build tool from SDK Manager and install the older copy.\nOnce everything starts working fine, do the above steps.I am trying to upload older copies of such bundles somewhere on the Internet, will update the links here, once I am done uploading.I found these instructions in a comment.Download the newest version of ADT and use your existing workspace.  This is actually the least pain-full upgrade you\'ll ever do.  It didn\'t mess with the .android folder so I still had my original debug key.  Only things missing were a couple of add ons I hardly ever use and they are easily installed into the new version.  Note don\'t install into your existing adt folder create a new folder so you can still fall back if the new install doesn\'t work.On ADT-bundled Eclipse I had to first uninstall the ADT and then do a fresh install.To remove the ADT plugin from Eclipse:For me it helped to delete Android 4.4W which is also API 20 and might be a cause for the conflict. So only install Android 4.4W or Android L until they fix it.And (again this might only be for me) it only works in Android Studio not in Eclipse ...I had to delete ADT and install it again.However be warned, this caused me and one other person to have an annotations.jar missing errors in the Java Build path for certain projects, probably because it was trying to look for an old SDK, so upgrading projects is the next step I have to take.The errors relate to libraries mostly, Google Play Services, Facebook SDK, ActionBarCompat.For this step, you uninstall ADT, then put the URL back in to download them. The url is: https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipseI found a solution for the problem with "conflicting dependency". I don\'t have the same page of Daniel D\xc3\xadaz\'s response, but a page show "conflicting dependency", and I can\'t make anything.The problem is that I\'m not the owner of the file. Eclipse was installed in other session (on OS X). I have the right to read and write the Eclipse file, but I\'m not the owner. Make a "chown" command on all Eclipse files to solve the problem. After, I have the same result as Daniel Diaz. I hope this helps someone.WARNINGThere is now an update for ADT 23.0.1, but the Windows and Linux scripts are messed up, so wait with the upgrade!You could check for example tools/proguard/bin/*.sh in http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r23.0.1-windows.zip.I did this to solve the same issue (in OS X):Hope it helps.If Eclipse gives an error after uninstalling the ADT plugin from your Eclipse installation, try to edit file config.ini in the Eclipse folder \xe2\x86\x92 configuration. Find:And change it to:I hope it works for you too.I simply went to my Android resources folder on my C:/ drive (C:/Android), deleted the \'eclipse\' folder and all its contents. I downloaded Android Developer Tools once more and just moved over the \'eclipse\' folder.I started up and everything was fine; I had updated to version 23.Hopefully this helps, possibly not suitable for everyone as some of you have Eclipse modifications but for someone who, like me, wanted a quick fix and get back to developing this seemed to be the easiest path.I am using Eclipse v4.3 (Kepler), and this is how I solved my problem.Goto menu Help \xe2\x86\x92 Install new software \xe2\x86\x92 click Add.In the popup, give any name (I named it as Eclipse ADT Plugin), and in the link\'s place, use https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/Once you click OK, you will be displayed with new packages that will be installed and old packages that will be deleted. Don\'t worry about these packages. Click OK.New packages will be installed, and this should solve your problem.
