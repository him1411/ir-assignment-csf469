This question already has an answer here:I know that Git tracks changes I make to my application, and it holds on to them until I commit the changes, but here\'s where I\'m hung up:When I want to revert to a previous commit I use: And Git returns:How do I then revert the files on my hard drive back to that previous commit?My next steps were:But none of the files have changed on my hard drive...What am I doing right/wrong?First, it\'s always worth noting that git reset --hard is a potentially dangerous command, since it throws away all your uncommitted changes. For safety, you should always check that the output of git status is clean (that is, empty) before using it.Initially you say the following:So I know that Git tracks changes I make to my application, and it holds on to them until I commit the changes, but here\'s where I\'m hung up:In case this reveals a mistaken assumption, I should say that this isn\'t correct. Git only records the state of the files when you stage them (with git add) or when you create a commit. Once you\'ve created a commit which has your project files in a particular state, they\'re very safe, but until then Git\'s not really "tracking changes" to your files. (for example, even if you do git add to stage a new version of the file, that overwrites the previously staged version of that file in the staging area.)In your question you then go on to ask the following:When I want to revert to a previous commit I use: git reset --hard HEAD And git returns: HEAD is now at 820f417 microHow do I then revert the files on my hard drive back to that previous commit?If you do git reset --hard <SOME-COMMIT> then Git will:HEAD points to your current branch (or current commit), so all that git reset --hard HEAD will do is to throw away any uncommitted changes you have.So, suppose the good commit that you want to go back to is f414f31. (You can find that via git log or any history browser.) You then have a few different options depending on exactly what you want to do:Create a new commit that represents exactly the same state of the project as f414f31, but just adds that on to the history, so you don\'t lose any history. You can do that using the steps suggested in this answer - something like:WARNING: git clean -f will remove untracked files, meaning they\'re gone for good since they aren\'t stored in the repository. Make sure you really want to remove all untracked files before doing this.Try this and see git clean -f.  git reset --hard will not remove untracked files, where as git-clean will remove any files from the tracked root directory that are not under Git tracking.Alternatively, as @Paul Betts said, you should do git clean -xdf (beware though - that removes all ignored files too).
