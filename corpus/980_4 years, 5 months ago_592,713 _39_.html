This question already has an answer here:I\'m working on implementing a wigdget transparency option for my app widget although I\'m having some trouble getting the hex color values right. Being completely new to hex color transparency I searched around a bit although I couldn\'t find a specific answer to my question. I want to set transparency by hex color so let\'s say my hex color id "#33b5e5" and I want it to be 50% transparent. Then I\'ll use "#8033b5e5" because 80 is 50%. I found a useful chart here: http://www.dtp-aus.com/hexadeci.htm . With this data I managed to come up with this:Now the issues start appearing when I get higher than 100 in hex. Hex color codes can only be 8 symbols long right? For example #11233b5e5 (80%) crashes.What can I do to enable me to use the higher numbers aswell?Here\'s a correct table of percentages to hex values. E.g. for 50% white you\'d use #80FFFFFF.(source)A colleague asked me to calculate the alpha transparency . The problem is a simple cross multiplication http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-multiplicationpercentage = (value in decimal ) / 255 * 100What is the % transparency of B4 ?  B4 in hex is 180.So 180 / 255 * 100 = 70,5 % decimal = percentage / 100 * 255What is the hex of 80% ? 80/100*255 = 204 . The hex value of 204 is CCI prefer to teach how to find the solution rather than handing  tableGive a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and\n  you feed him for a lifetimeColor hexadecimal notation is like following: #AARRGGBB You should first look at how hexadecimal works. You can write at most FF. That chart is not showing percents. "#90" is not "90%".\nThat chart shows the hexadecimal to decimal conversion. The hex number 90 (typically represented as 0x90) is equivalent to the decimal number 144.Hexadecimal numbers are base-16, so each digit is a value between 0 and F. The maximum value for a two byte hex value (such as the transparency of a color) is 0xFF, or 255 in decimal. Thus 100% is 0xFF.This might be very late answer.. But this chart kills it. All percentage values are mapped to the hexadecimal values.http://online.sfsu.edu/chrism/hexval.htmlI built this small helper method for an android app, may come of use:try this on google search (or click here)255 * .2 to hexit will generate 0x33 as a result.However, google does not round off values so you can only use 1-digit multipliers. if you want to use say .85, you have to get the rounded-off value of 255 * .85 first, then type (rounded-value here) to hex in google search.Using python to calculate this, for example(written in python 3), 50% transparency ::)I realize this is an old question, but I came across it when doing something similar. Using SASS, you have a very elegant way to convert RGBA to hex ARGB: ie-hex-str. I\'ve used it here in a mixin. outputs:I always keep coming here to check for int/hex alpha value. So, end up creating a simple method in my java utils class. This method will convert the percentage to hex value and append to the color code string value.So, Utils.setColorAlpha(30, "#000000") will give you #4c000000
