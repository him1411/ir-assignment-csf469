I have the following use case: I would like to be able to push to git@git.company.com:gitolite-admin using the private key of user gitolite-admin, while I want to push to git@git.company.com:some_repo using \'my own\' private key. AFAIK, I can\'t solve this using ~/.ssh/config, because the user name and server name are identical in both cases. As I mostly use my own private key, I have that defined in ~/.ssh/config for git@git.company.com. Does anyone know of a way to override the key that is used for a single git invocation?(Aside: gitolite distinguishes who is doing the pushing based on the key, so it\'s not a problem, in terms of access, ownership and auditing, that the user@server string is identical for different users.)Even if the user and host are the same, they can still be distinguished in ~/.ssh/config.  For example, if your configuration looks like this:Then you just use gitolite-as-alice and gitolite-as-bob instead of the hostname in your URL:You want to include the option IdentitiesOnly yes to prevent the use of default ids. Otherwise, if you also have id files matching the default names, they will get tried first because unlike other config options (which abide by "first in wins") the IdentityFile option appends to the list of identities to try. See: https://serverfault.com/questions/450796/how-could-i-stop-ssh-offering-a-wrong-key/450807#450807An alternative approach to the one offered above by Mark Longair is to use an alias that will run any git command, on any remote, with an alternative SSH key. The idea is basically to switch your SSH identity when running the git commands.Advantages relative to the host alias approach in the other answer:I use a few small scripts and a git alias admin. That way I can do, for example:To push to the default remote using the alternative ("admin") SSH key. Again, you could use any command (not just push) with this alias. You could even do git admin clone ... to clone a repository that you would only have access to using your "admin" key.Step 1: Create the alternative SSH keys, optionally set a passphrase in case you\'re doing this on someone else\'s machine.Step 2: Create a script called \xe2\x80\x9cssh-as.sh\xe2\x80\x9d that runs stuff that uses SSH, but uses a given SSH key rather than the default:Step 3: Create a script called \xe2\x80\x9cgit-as.sh\xe2\x80\x9d that runs git commands using the given SSH key.Step 4: Add an alias (using something appropriate for \xe2\x80\x9cPATH_TO_SCRIPTS_DIR\xe2\x80\x9d below):More details at: http://noamlewis.wordpress.com/2013/01/24/git-admin-an-alias-for-running-git-commands-as-a-privileged-ssh-identity/Another alternative is to use ssh-ident, to manage your ssh identities.It automatically loads and uses different keys based on your current working directory, ssh options, and so on... which means you can easily have a work/ directory and private/ directory that transparently end up using different keys and identities with ssh.I am using Git Bash on Win7. The following worked for me.Create a config file at ~/.ssh/config or c:/users/[your_user_name]/.ssh/config. In the file enter:I guess the host has to be a URL and not just a "name" or ref for your host. For example,The path can also be written in /c/users/[user_name]/.... formatThe solution provided by Giordano Scalzo is great too.\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/9149518/1738546One Unix based systems (Linux, BSD, Mac OS X), the default identity is stored in the directory $HOME/.ssh, in 2 files:\n\nprivate key: $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa\npublic key:  $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\nWhen you use ssh without option -i, it uses the default private key to authenticate with remote system.If you have another private key you want to use, for example $HOME/.ssh/deploy_key, you have to use ssh -i ~/.ssh/deploy_key ...It is annoying. You can add the following lines in to your $HOME/.bash_profile :\n\nssh-add ~/.ssh/deploy_key\nssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa\nSo each time you use ssh or git or scp (basically ssh too), you don\'t have to use option -i anymore. You can add as many keys as you like in the file $HOME/.bash_profile.If using Git\'s version of ssh on windows, the identity file line in the ssh config looks likewhere /c is for c:To check, in git\'s bash doYou can utilize git environment variable GIT_SSH_COMMAND. Run this in your terminal under your git repository:Replace ~/.ssh/your_private_key with the actual command you wanna use. And you can change the following git command to others like git pull, git fetch, etc.
