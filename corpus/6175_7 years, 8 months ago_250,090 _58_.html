I have created a custom UITableViewCell. The table view is showing data fine. What I am stuck in is when user touches cell of tableview, then I want to show the background color of the cell other than the default [blue color] values for highlighting the selection of cell.\nI use this code but nothing happens:I think you were on the right track, but according to the class definition for selectedBackgroundView:The default is nil for cells in plain-style tables (UITableViewStylePlain) and non-nil for section-group tables UITableViewStyleGrouped).Therefore, if you\'re using a plain-style table, then you\'ll need to alloc-init a new UIView having your desired background colour and then assign it to selectedBackgroundView.Alternatively, you could use:if all you wanted was a gray background when the cell is selected.  Hope this helps.No need for custom cells. If you only want to change the selected color of the cell, you can do this:Objective-C:Swift:Swift 3:Edit: Updated for ARCEdit: Adds Swift 3 If you have a grouped table with just one cell per section, just add this extra line to the code: \nbgColorView.layer.cornerRadius = 10;Don\'t forget to import QuartzCore.The following works for me in iOS 8.I have to set the selection style to UITableViewCellSelectionStyleDefault for custom background color to work. If any other style, the custom background color will be ignored. There seems to be a change in behaviours as previous answers needs to set style to none instead.The full code for the cell as follows:Create a custom cell for your table cell and in the custom cell class.m put the code below, it will work fine. You need to place the desired color image in selectionBackground UIImage.Swift 3: for me it worked when you put it in the cellForRowAtIndexPath: methodTable View Cell selection background color can be set via the Storyboard:We need to set the selected background view in this method.If you want to add a custom highlighted color to your cell (and your cell contains buttons,labels, images,etc..) I followed the next steps:For example if you want a selected yellow color:1) Create a view that fits all the cell with 20% opacity (with yellow color) called for example backgroundselectedView2) In the cell controller write this:If you are using a custom TableViewCell, you can also override awakeFromNib:One more tip to Christian\'s way to show rounded corner background for grouped table.If I use cornerRadius = 10 for cell, it shows four corner\'s rounded selection background. It\'s not the same with table view\'s default UI.So, I think about easy way to resolve it with cornerRadius.\nAs you can see from the below codes, check about cell\'s location (top, bottom, middle or topbottom) and add one more sub layers to hide top corner or bottom corner. This just shows exactly same look with default table view\'s selection background.I tested this code with iPad splitter view. You can change patchLayer\'s frame position as you needed.Please let me know if there is more easier way to achieve same result.I want to note that the XIB editor offers you the following standard options:Section: blue/gray/none(the right-hand column with options, 4th tab, first group "Table View Cell", 4th subgroup, the 1st of 3 items reads "Selection")Probably what you want to do may be achieved by selecting the right standard option.As per custom color for a selected cell in UITableView, great solution as per Maciej Swic\'s answerJust to add to that, you declare Swic\'s answer in the Cell configuration usually under:- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPathAnd for an added effect, instead of the system colors, you may use RGB values for a custom color look. In my code this is how I achieved it:Let me know if that works for you as well. You can mess with the cornerRadius number for the effects on the corners of the selected cell.I\'ve got a slightly different approach than everyone else that reflects the selection on touch rather than after being selected.  I have a subclassed UITableViewCell.  All you have to do is set the background color in the touch events, which simulates selection on touch, and then set the background color in the setSelected function.  Setting the background color in the selSelected function allows for deselecting the cell.  Make sure to pass the touch event to the super, otherwise the cell won\'t actually act as if its selected.To add the background for all cells (using Maciej\'s answer): for Swift 3.0:Here is the important parts of the code needed for a grouped table. When any of the cells in a section are selected the first row changes color. Without initially setting the cellselectionstyle to none there is an annonying double reload when the user clicks row0 where the cell changes to bgColorView then fades and reloads bgColorView again. Good Luck and let me know if there is a simpler way to do this.To override UITableViewCell\'s setSelected also works.for those that just want to get rid of the default selected grey background put this line of code in your cellForRowAtIndexPath func:I use below approach and works fine for me,   In case of custom cell class. Just override:cell.selectionColor = UIColor.FormaCar.blueIt\'s easy when the table view style is plain, but in group style, it\'s a little trouble, I solve it by:   noted the kGroupTableViewCellWidth, I define it as 300, it\'s the width of group table view cell width in iPhoneMake sure you have used the above line to use the selection effectI\'m using iOS 9.3 and setting the color through the Storyboard or setting cell.selectionStyle didn\'t work for me, but the code below worked:I found this solution here.Try Following code.//Swift Version:Use [cell setClipsToBounds:YES]; for Grouped style cell
