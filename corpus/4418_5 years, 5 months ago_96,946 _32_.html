I\'m using Linux and I created keys as instructed in the github tutorial, registered them with github, and tried using ssh-agent explicitly \xe2\x80\x94 yet git continues to ask me for my passphrase every time I try to do a pull or a push.What could be the cause?Once you have started the SSH agent with:You have to add your private key to it:This will ask you your passphrase just once, and then you should be allowed to push, provided that you uploaded the public key to Github.To save key permanently:This will persist it after you close and re-open it by storing it in user\'s keychain.This has been happening to me after restarts since upgrading from OS X El Capitan (10.11) to macOS Sierra (10.12). The ssh-add solution worked temporarily but would not persist across another restart.The permanent solution was to edit (or create) ~/.ssh/config and enable the UseKeychain option.Related: macOS keeps asking my ssh passphrase since I updated to SierraIf you\'ve tried ssh-add and you\'re still prompted to enter your passphrase then try using ssh-add -K. This adds your passphrase to your keychain.Update: if you\'re using macOS Sierra then you likely need to do another step as the above might no longer work. Add the following to your ~/.ssh/config:I would try this. What they say is:\n\nI had a similar issue, but the other answers didn\'t fix my problem.  I thought I\'d go ahead and post this just in case someone else has a screwy setup like me.It turns out I had multiple keys and Git was using the wrong one first.  It would prompt me for my passphrase, and I would enter it, then Git would use a different key that would work (that I didn\'t need to enter the passphrase on).  I just deleted the key that it was using to prompt me for a passphrase and now it works!It sounds like you may be having trouble with SSH-Agent itself. I would try troubleshooting that.  1) Did you do ssh-add to add your key to SSH?2) Are you closing the terminal window between uses, because if you close the window you will have to enter the password again when you reopen it.Try adding this to your ~/.ssh/config:Host *\n   AddKeysToAgent yes\n   UseKeychain yes\n   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsaWhat worked for me on Windows was (I had cloned code from a repo 1st):at which time it asked me one last time for my passphraseCredits: the solution was taken from\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/12195/how-to-avoid-being-asked-passphrase-each-time-i-push-to-bitbucketIf the above solutions are not working for me, one thing to check is that you actually have the public key too (typically id_rsa.pub). It is unusual not to, but that was the cause for me. To create your public key from your private key:I try different solutions but nothing help. But this steps (My GitBash SSH environment always asks for my passphrase, what can I do?) from Bitbucket.com seams works well :The idea is:you create ~/.bashrc fileadd follow script:re-run Bash
