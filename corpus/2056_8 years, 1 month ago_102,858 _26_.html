How can you switch your current windows from horizontal split to vertical split and vice versa in Vim?I did that a moment ago by accident but I cannot find the key again.Vim mailing list says (re-formatted for better readability):To change two vertically split\n  windows to horizonally splitCtrl-w t Ctrl-w KHorizontally to vertically:Ctrl-w t Ctrl-w HExplanations:Ctrl-w t     makes the first (topleft) window current\n  Ctrl-w K     moves the current window to full-width at the very top\n  Ctrl-w H     moves the current window to full-height at far leftNote that the t is lowercase, and the K and H are uppercase.Also, with only two windows, it seems like you can drop the Ctrl-w t part because if you\'re already in one of only two windows, what\'s the point of making it current?^w followed by capital H,J,K or L will move the current window to the far left,bottom,top or right respectively like normal cursor navigation.The lower case equivalents move focus instead of moving the window.In VIM, take a look at the following to see different alternatives for what you might have done::help opening-windowFor instance:Ctrl-W s\nCtrl-W o\nCtrl-W v\nCtrl-W o\nCtrl-W s\n...When you have two or more windows open horizontally or vertically and want to switch them all to the other orientation, you can use the following:(switch to horizontal)(switch to vertical)It\'s effectively going to each window individually and using ^WK or ^WH.The following ex commands will (re-)split any number of windows:If there are hidden buffers, issuing these commands will also make the hidden buffers visible.Following Mark Rushakoff\'s tip above, here is my mapping:Edit: use Ctrl-w r to swap two windows if they are not in the good order.Inspired by Steve answer, I wrote simple function that toggles between vertical and horizontal splits for all windows in current tab. You can bind it to mapping like in the last line below.
