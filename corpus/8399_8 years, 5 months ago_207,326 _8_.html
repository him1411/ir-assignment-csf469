Date.getTime() returns milliseconds since Jan 1, 1970. Unixtime is seconds since Jan 1, 1970. I don\'t usually code in java, but I\'m working on some bug fixes. I have:Is there a better way to get unixtime in java?UPDATEBased on John M\'s suggestion, I ended up with:Avoid the Date object creation w/ System.currentTimeMillis().  A divide by 1000 gets you to Unix epoch.As mentioned in a comment, you typically want a primitive long (lower-case-l long) not a boxed object long (capital-L Long) for the unixTime variable\'s type.Java 8 added a new API for working with dates and times. \nWith Java 8 you can useInstant.now() returns an Instant that represents the current system time. With getEpochSecond() you get the epoch seconds (unix time) from the Instant.
