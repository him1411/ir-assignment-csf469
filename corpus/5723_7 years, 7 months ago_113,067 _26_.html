Could someone explain these two terms in an understandable way?Greedy will consume as much as possible. From http://www.regular-expressions.info/repeat.html we see the example of trying to match HTML tags with <.+>. Suppose you have the following:You may think that <.+> (. means any non newline character and + means one or more) would only match the <em> and the </em>, when in reality it will be very greedy, and go from the first < to the last >. This means it will match <em>Hello World</em> instead of what you wanted.Making it lazy (<.+?>) will prevent this. By adding the ? after the +, we tell it to repeat as few times as possible, so the first > it comes across, is where we want to stop the matching.I\'d encourage you to download RegExr, a great tool that will help you explore Regular Expressions - I use it all the time.Greedy means match longest possible string.Lazy means match shortest possible string.For example, the greedy h.+l matches \'hell\' in \'hello\' but the lazy h.+?l matches \'hel\'.Greedy means your expression will match as large a group as possible, lazy means it will match the smallest group possible.  For this string:and this expression:A greedy match will match the whole string, and a lazy match will match just the first abc.Add a ? to a quantifier to make it ungreedy i.e lazy. Example:\ntest string : stackoverflow\ngreedy reg expression : s.*o output: stackoverflow\nlazy reg expression : s.*?o output: stackoverflowTaken From www.regular-expressions.infoGreediness: Greedy quantifiers first tries to repeat the token as many times\nas possible, and gradually gives up matches as the engine backtracks to find \nan overall match.Laziness: Lazy quantifier first repeats the token as few times as required, and\ngradually expands the match as the engine backtracks through the regex to\nfind an overall match.From Regular expressionThe standard quantifiers in regular\n  expressions are greedy, meaning they\n  match as much as they can, only giving\n  back as necessary to match the\n  remainder of the regex. By using a lazy quantifier, the\n  expression tries the minimal match\n  first.As far as I know, most regex engine is greedy by default. Add a question mark at the end of quantifier will enable lazy match.As @Andre S mentioned in comment.Refer to the example below for what is greedy and what is lazy.I\'m greeedy and I want 100000000 dollars. This is the most I can get.I\'m too lazy to get so much money, only 100 dollars is enough for metry to understand the following behavior:
