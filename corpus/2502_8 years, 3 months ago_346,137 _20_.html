How can I convert the str representation of a dict, such as the following string, into a dict?I prefer not to use eval. What else can I use?The main reason for this, is one of my coworkers classes he wrote, converts all input into strings. I\'m not in the mood to go and modify his classes, to deal with this issue.Starting in Python 2.6 you can use the built-in ast.literal_eval:This is safer than using eval.  As its own docs say:For example:http://docs.python.org/2/library/json.htmlJSON can solve this problem though its decoder wants double quotes around keys and values.  If you don\'t mind a replace hack...NOTE that if you have single quotes as a part of your keys or values this will fail due to improper character replacement. This solution is only recommended if you have a strong aversion to the eval solution.More about json single quote: jQuery single quote in JSON responseusing json.loadsIf the string can always be trusted, you could use eval (or use literal_eval as suggested; it\'s safe no matter what the string is.) Otherwise you need a parser. A JSON parser (such as simplejson) would work if he only ever stores content that fits with the JSON scheme.Use Json. the ast library consumes a lot of memory and and slower. I have a process that needs to read a text file of 156Mb. Ast with 5 minutes delay for the conversion dictionary Json and 1 minutes using 60% less memory!To OP\'s example:We can use Yaml to deal with this kind of non-standard json in string:If you can\'t use Python 2.6, you can use a simple safeeval implmenentation like http://code.activestate.com/recipes/364469/It piggybacks on the Python compiler so you don\'t have to do all the gross work yourself.You can try this.  no any libs are used:NOTE: As it has hardcoded split("\'") will work only for strings where data  is "single quoted".
