I was wondering how to get the current URL within a template.Say my URL wasHow do I return this to the template?You can fetch the URL in your template like this:or by {{ request.path }} if you don\'t need the extra parameters.Some precisions and corrections should be brought to hypete\'s and Igancio\'s answers, I\'ll just summarize the whole idea here, for future reference.If you need the request variable in the template, you must add the \'django.core.context_processors.request\' to the TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS settings, it\'s not by default (Django 1.4).You must also not forget the other context processors used by your applications. So, to add the request to the other default processors, you could add this in your settings, to avoid hard-coding the default processor list (that may very well change in later versions):Then, provided you send the request contents in your response, for example as this:In django template \nSimply get current url from {{request.path}}\nFor getting full url  with parameters {{request.get_full_path}}Note:\nYou must add request in django TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORSI suppose send to template full request is little bit redundant. I do it this wayThis is an old question but it can be summed up as easily as this if you\'re using django-registration.  In your Log In and Log Out link (lets say in your page header) add the next parameter to the link which will go to login or logout.  Your link should look like this. That\'s simply it, nothing else needs to be done, upon logout they will immediately be redirected to the page they are at, for log in, they will fill out the form and it will then redirect to the page that they were on.  Even if they incorrectly try to log in it still works. The other answers were incorrect, at least in my case. request.path does not provide the full url, only the relative url, e.g. /paper/53. I did not find any proper solution, so I ended up hardcoding the constant part of the url in the View before concatenating it with request.path.
