I know this is a very rudimentary question, but to my surprise, I could not find any document about Android SDK Build-tools.\nBesides Android SDK Tools and Android SDK Platform-tools, there are a bunch of Android SDK Build-tools as shown in the appended screenshot. Could anyone point to a source explaining all of them and help clarifying how a certain version of Android SDK Build-tools is picked for use?Edited (2014-02-27):I still do not fully understand all the tools.  The following is my limited understanding based on Google\'s latest documents:I still do not understand the rationale of taking Android SDK Build-tools out of Android SDK Platform-tools which has a single instance and is easy to manage the update. The only possible reason that I can think of is that some apps have to rely on older build components to build them.  Google\'s document mentions this, but does not explain why. Looking at the release notes, you will notice that updates of Android SDK Build-tools are primarily for fixing bugs or/add support for new platforms. The only reason that I can think of for some apps to use older versions of Android SDK Build-tools is that they rely on certain bugs of Android SDK Build-tools. These apps would not function normally without being built with these bugs.  I wish Google could explain this better by giving one or two examples showing why these bugs in the tools are critical for certain apps.About the version of Android SDK Build-tools, the answer isBy default, the Android SDK uses the most recent downloaded version of\n  the Build Tools.SourceIn Eclipse, you can choose a specific version by using the sdk.buildtools property in the project.properties file.There seems to be no official page explaining all the build tools. Here is what the Android team says about this.The [build] tools, such as aidl, aapt, dexdump, and dx, are\n  typically called by the Android build tools or Android Development\n  Tools (ADT), so you rarely need to invoke these tools directly. As a\n  general rule, you should rely on the build tools or the ADT plugin to\n  call them as needed.SourceAnyway, here is a synthesis of the differences between tools, platform-tools and build-tools:Android SDK build tools are used to debug, build, run and test an Android application.Android Build Tools can be used to develop and work from command line or IDE (i.e Eclipse or Android Studio).Also used to connect Android devices and root them.(fastboot, adb and more..)Always use the latest.(Recommended)More Info on Android Build tools and commandsI\'ll leave the discussion of the difference between Build Tools, Platform Tools, and Tools to others. From a practical standpoint, you only need to know the answer to your second question:Answer: Use the most recent version.For those using Android Studio with Gradle, the buildToolsVersion has to be set in the build.gradle (Module: app) file.Open the Android SDK Manager. The last item will show the most recent version. Make sure it is installed and then write that number as the buildToolsVersion in build.gradle (Module: app).The right answer is Decoupled the build-specific components of the Android SDK from the platform-tools component, so that the build tools can be updated independently of the integrated development environment (IDE) components.link (expand Revision 17)You can find details about these in this Android - Command Line Toolstl;dr:SDK Tools:Build Tools:Platform Tools:Android SDK Build Tools are exactly what the name says they are; tools for building Android Applications.It is very important to use the latest build tools version (selected automatically by your IDE via the Android SDK) but the reason the old versions are left there is to support backward compatibility, that is If your projects depend on older versions of the Build Tools.
