I have two inline-block div elements, that are the same, positioned next to eachother. However there seems to be a mysterious space of 4 pixels between the two divs despite the margin being set to 0. There are no parent divs effecting them - What is going on?CSSThis is what i want it to look like:In this instance, your div elements have been changed from block level elements to inline elements. A typical characteristic of inline elements is that they respect the whitespace in the markup. This explains why a gap of space is generated between the elements. (example)There are a few solutions that can be used to solve this.Example 1 - Comment the whitespace out: (example)Example 2 - Remove the line breaks: (example)Example 3 - Close part of the tag on the next line (example)Example 4 - Close the entire tag on the next line: (example)Since the whitespace between the inline elements is determined by the font-size, you could simply reset the font-size to 0, and thus remove the space between the elements.Just set font-size: 0 on the parent elements, and then declare a new font-size for the children elements. This works, as demonstrated here (example)This method works pretty well, as it doesn\'t require a change in the markup; however, it doesn\'t work if the child element\'s font-size is declared using em units. I would therefore recommend removing the whitespace from the markup, or alternatively floating the elements and thus avoiding the space generated by inline elements.In some cases, you can also set the display of the parent element to flex. (example)This effectively removes the spaces between the elements in supported browsers. Don\'t forget to add appropriate vendor prefixes for additional support.It is incredibly unreliable to use negative margins to remove the space between inline elements. Please don\'t use negative margins if there are other, more optimal, solutions.Inline-block allows for white-space in your HTML, This usually equates to .25em (or 4px).You can either comment out the white-space or, a more commons solution, is to set the parent\'s font-size to 0 and the reset it back to the required size on the inline-block elements.inline-block automatically allows for white-space like everyone is saying. The easiest fix is to just add float: left; to the container declaration like this. Also you can\'t use two id\'s on one page. Use classes instead.simply add a border: 2px solid #e60000; to your 2nd div tag CSS.Definitely it worksFound a solution not involving Flex, because Flex doesn\'t work in older Browsers. \nExample:
