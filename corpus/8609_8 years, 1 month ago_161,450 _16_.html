What is the best way to strip all non alphanumeric characters from a string, using Python?The solutions presented in the PHP variant of this question will probably work with some minor adjustments, but don\'t seem very \'pythonic\' to me.For the record, I don\'t just want to strip periods and commas  (and other punctuation), but also quotes, brackets, etc.I just timed some functions out of curiosity.  In these tests I\'m removing non-alphanumeric characters from the string string.printable (part of the built-in string module).Regular expressions to the rescue:Use the str.translate() method.Presuming you will be doing this often:(1) Once, create a string containing all the characters you wish to delete:(2) Whenever you want to scrunch a string:The setup cost probably compares favourably with re.compile; the marginal cost is way lower:Note: Using string.printable as benchmark data gives the pattern \'[\\W_]+\' an unfair advantage; all the non-alphanumeric characters are in one bunch ... in typical data there would be more than one substitution to do:Here\'s what happens if you give re.sub a bit more work to do:You could try:How about:This works by using list comprehension to produce a list of the characters in InputString if they are present in the combined ascii_letters and digits strings.  It then joins the list together into a string.As a spin off from some other answers here, I offer a really simple and flexible way to define a set of characters that you want to limit a string\'s content to.  In this case, I\'m allowing alphanumerics PLUS dash and underscore. Just add or remove characters from my PERMITTED_CHARS as suits your use case.
