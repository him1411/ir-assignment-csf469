I also want to save the font size in my .emacs file.The value is in 1/10pt, so 100 will give you 10pt, etc. From Emacswiki, GNU Emacs 23 has a built-in key combination:C-xC-+ and C-xC-- to increase or\n  decrease the buffer text sizePress Shift and the first mouse button.  You can change the font size in the following way:  This website has more detail. M-x customize-face RET default will allow you to set the face default face, on which all other faces base on. There you can set the font-size.Here is what is in my .emacs. actually, color-theme will set the basics, then my custom face setting will override some stuff. the custom-set-faces is written by emacs\'s customize-face mechanism:This is another simple solution. Works in 24 as wellShort cuts:I\'ve got the following in my .emacs:You can subsitute any font of your choosing for "Monospace-11". The set of available options is highly system-dependent. Using M-x set-default-font and looking at the tab-completions will give you some ideas. On my system, with Emacs 23 and anti-aliasing enabled, can choose system fonts by name, e.g., Monospace, Sans Serif, etc.Firefox and other programs allow you to increase and decrease the font size with C-+ and C--. I set up my .emacs so that I have that same ability by adding these lines of code:zoom.cfg and global-zoom.cfg provide font size change bindings (from EmacsWiki)Open emacs in X11, goto menu Options, select "set default font ...", change the font size. Select "save options" in the same menu. Done.It all depends what you mean by change the font size.\nThis EmacsWiki section provides the best and most complete information. It distinguishes the various cases (text scaling, frame font, buffer/frame, etc.): Changing Font Size.Here\'s an option for resizing the font heights interactively, one point at a time:This is preferable when you want to resize text in all buffers. I don\'t like solutions using text-scale-increase and text-scale-decrease as line numbers in the gutter can get cut off afterwards.I you\'re happy with console emacs (emacs -nw), modern vterm implementations (like gnome-terminal) tend to have better font support. Plus if you get used to that, you can then use tmux, and so working with your full environment on remote servers becomes possible, even without X.In AquaMacs CMD + and CMD - adjust the font size for the current buffer.In NTEmacs 23.1, the Options menu has a "Set default font..." option.I use hydra package to control font increase/decrease contiguously by pressing f2 + + + +/f2 - - - -, which means that press f2 once, and then using +/- to control only,  and restore default font size by f2 0. Because i have keypad, so I also bind keypad to the font setting.And modern editor mouse control functionality supported by below key bindings, press control + mouse wheel to increase/decrease font.Aquamacs:From the Emacs Wiki Globally Change the Default Font, it says you can use either of these:Where FONT is something like "Monaco-16", e.g.:There was an extra closing parenthesis in the first suggestion on the wiki, which caused an error on startup.  I finally noticed the extra closing parenthesis, and I subsequently corrected the suggestion on the wiki.  Then both of the suggestions worked for me.
