I can\'t really think of any reason why python needs the del keyword (and most languages seem to not have a similar keyword).  For instance, rather than deleting a variable, one could just assign None to it.  And when deleting from a dictionary, a del method could be added.Is there any reason to keep del in python, or is it a vestige of Python\'s pre-garbage collection days?Firstly, you can del other things besides local variablesBoth of which should be clearly useful. Secondly, using del on a local variable makes the intent clearer.  Compare:toI know in the case of del foo that the intent is to remove the variable from scope. It\'s not clear that foo = None is doing that. If somebody just assigned foo = None I might think it was dead code. But I instantly know what somebody who codes del foo was trying to do.There\'s this part of what del does (from the Python Language Reference):Deletion of a name removes the binding of that name from the local or global namespaceAssigning None to a name does not remove the binding of the name from the namespace.(I suppose there could be some debate about whether removing a name binding is actually useful, but that\'s another question.)One place I\'ve found del useful is cleaning up extraneous variables in for loops:Now you can be sure that x will be undefined if you use it outside the for loop. Just another thinking.When debugging http applications in framework like Django, the call stack full of useless and messed up variables previously used, especially when it\'s a very long list, could be very painful for developers. so, at this point, namespace controlling could be useful.There is a specific example of when you should use del (there may be others, but I know about this one off hand) when you are using sys.exc_info() to inspect an exception.  This function returns a tuple, the type of exception that was raised, the message, and a traceback.  The first two values are usually sufficient to diagnose an error and act on it, but the third contains the entire call stack between where the exception was raised and where the the exception is caught.  In particular, if you do something likethe traceback, tb ends up in the locals of the call stack, creating a circular reference that cannot be garbage collected.  Thus, it is important to do:to break the circular reference.  In many cases where you would want to call sys.exc_info(), like with metaclass magic, the traceback is useful, so you have to make sure that you clean it up before you can possibly leave the exception handler.  If you don\'t need the traceback, you should delete it immediately, or just do:To avoid it all together.  Force closing a file after using numpy.load:A niche usage perhaps but I found it useful when using numpy.load to read a file. Every once in a while I would update the file and need to copy a file with the same name to the directory.I used del to release the file and allow me to copy in the new file.Note I want to avoid the with context manager as I was playing around with plots on the command line and didn\'t want to be pressing tab a lot!See this question.To add a few points to above answers:\ndel xDefinition of x indicates r -> o (a reference r pointing to an object o) but del x changes r rather than o. It is an operation on the reference (pointer) to object rather than the object associated with x. Distinguishing between r and o is key here.Deleting variable names with del is probably something used rarely, but it is something that could not trivially be achieved without a keyword. If you can create a variable name by writing a=1, it is nice that you can theoretically undo this by deleting a.It can make debugging easier in some cases as trying to access a deleted variable will raise an NameError.Python lets you write something like:If you choose to dynamically add attributes to a class instance, you certainly want to be able to undo it by writingUsing "del" explicitly is also better practice than assigning a variable to None. If you attempt to del a variable that doesn\'t exist, you\'ll get a runtime error but if you attempt to set a variable that doesn\'t exist to None, Python will silently set a new variable to None, leaving the variable you wanted deleted where it was. So del will help you catch your mistakes earlierI think one of the reasons that del has its own syntax is that replacing it with a function might be hard in certain cases given it operates on the binding or variable and not the value it references. Thus if a function version of del were to be created a context would need to be passed in. del foo would need to become globals().remove(\'foo\') or locals().remove(\'foo\') which gets messy and less readable. Still I say getting rid of del would be good given its seemingly rare use. But removing language features/flaws can be painful. Maybe python 4 will remove it :)When is del useful in python?You can use it to remove a single element of an array instead of the slice syntax x[i:i+1]=[]. This may be useful if for example you are in os.walk and wish to delete an element in the directory. I would not consider a keyword useful for this though, since one could just make a [].remove(index) method (the .remove method is actually search-and-remove-first-instance-of-value).As an example of what del can be used for, I find it useful i situations like this:These two functions can be in different packages/modules and the programmer doesn\'t need to know what default value argument c in f actually have. So by using kwargs in combination with del you can say "I want the default value on c" by setting it to None (or in this case also leave it).You could do the same thing with something like:However I find the previous example more DRY and elegant.del is often seen in __init__.py files. Any global variable that is defined in an __init__.py file is automatically "exported" (it will be included in a from module import *). One way to avoid this is to define __all__, but this can get messy and not everyone uses it. For example, if you had code in __init__.py likeThen your module would export the sys name. You should instead writeOnce I had to use:because using only:didn\'t release the serial port fast enough to immediately open it again.\nFrom that lesson I learned that del really meant: "GC this NOW! and wait until it\'s done" and that is really useful in a lot of situations. Of course, you may have a system.gc.del_this_and_wait_balbalbalba(obj).del is the equivalent of "unset" in many languages\nand as a cross reference point moving from another language to python..\npeople tend to look for commands that do the same thing that they used to do in their first language...\nalso\nsetting a var to "" or none doesn\'t really remove the var from scope..it just empties its value\nthe name of the var itself would still be stored in memory...why?!?\nin a memory intensive script..keeping trash behind its just a no no\nand anyways...every language out there has some form of an "unset/delete" var function..why not python?Every object in python has an identifier, Type, reference count associated with it, when we use del  the reference count is reduced, when the reference count becomes zero it is a potential candidate for getting garbage collected. This differentiates the del when compared to setting an identifier to None. In later case it simply means the object is just left out wild( until we are out of scope in which case the count is reduced) and simply now the identifier point to some other object(memory location).
