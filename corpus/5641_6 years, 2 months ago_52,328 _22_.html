What is the purpose of gist and how is it different from regular code sharing/maintaining using github?  GitHub is the entire site. Gists are a particular service offered on that site, namely code snippets akin to pastebin. However, everything is driven by git revision control, so gists also have complete revision histories. My Personal View of Gist and GitHub:Gist: Gist is a simple way to share snippets and pastes with others.It is used when you need to display a sample piece of code or technique among our co-workers or friends in our class.And GitHub GitHub on the other way provides a platform to share a entire project as a repo among a team or to the whole world.Both Will log version details.You can access Gist by visiting the following url gist.github.com.\nAlternatively you can access it from within your Github account (after logging in) as shown in the picture below: Github: A hosting service that houses a web-based git repository. It includes all the fucntionality of git with additional features\n  added in. Gist: Is an additional feature added to github to allow the sharing of code snippets, notes, to do lists and more. You can save\n  your Gists as secret or public. Secret Gists are hidden from search\n  engines but visible to anyone you share the url with.For example. If you wanted to write a private to-do list. You could write one using Github Markdown as follows:NB: It is important to preserve the whitespace as shown above between the dash and brackets.\nIt is also important that you save the file with the extension .md because we want the markdown to format properly.\nRemember to save this Gist as secret if you do not want others to see it. The end result looks like the image below. The checkboxes are clickable because we saved this Gist with the extension .mdMy personal understanding or to say my personal usage of Gist and Github is:A big project work. If you wanna build website, develop mobile or web application or do your assignment with your teammates of course use github.more like a memo. for example you can write the implementation of a small feature and share it to your blog or write down what you think about the project and share it with your teammates.\nJust like what the above answers said, gist is used for more like code snippet thing. So normally if you work on a project you use github.
