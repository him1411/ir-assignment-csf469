How do I restart an Android Activity?  I tried the following, but the Activity simply quits.I did my theme switcher like this:Basically, I\'m calling finish() first, and I\'m using the exact same intent this activity was started with. That seems to do the trick?UPDATE: As pointed out by Ralf below, Activity.recreate() is the way to go in API 11 and beyond. This is preferable if you\'re in an API11+ environment. You can still check the current version and call the code snippet above if you\'re in API 10 or below. (Please don\'t forget to upvote Ralf\'s answer!)Since API level 11 (Honeycomb), you can call the recreate() method of the activity (thanks to this answer).The recreate() method acts just like a configuration change, so your onSaveInstanceState() and onRestoreInstanceState() methods are also called, if applicable.Before SDK 11, a way to do this is like so:Just to combine Ralf and Ben\'s answers (including changes made in comments):This solution worked for me.First finish the activity and then start it again.Sample code:Call this methodThanks,I used this code so I still could support older Android versions and use recreate() on newer Android versions.Code:Sample:Even though this has been answered multiple times.If restarting an activity from a fragment, I would do it like so:So you might be thinking this is a little overkill?\nBut the Handler posting allows you to call this in a lifecycle method. I\'ve used this in onRestart/onResume methods when checking if the state has changed between the user coming back to the app. (installed something). Without the Handler if you call it in an odd place it will just kill the activity and not restart it.Feel free to ask any questions.Cheers,\nChrisWell this is not listed but a combo of some that is already posted:This is by far the easiest way to restart the current activity:Actually the following code is valid for API levels 5 and up, so if your target API is lower than this, you\'ll end up with something very similar to EboMike\'s code.There is one hacky way that should work on any activity, including the main one.When orientation changes, Android generally will recreate your activity (unless you override it). This method is useful for 180 degree rotations, when Android doesn\'t recreate your activity. try to use this ..In conjunction with strange SurfaceView lifecycle behaviour with the Camera. I have found that recreate() does not behave well with the lifecycle of SurfaceViews. surfaceDestroyed isn\'t ever called during the recreation cycle. It is called after onResume (strange), at which point my SurfaceView is destroyed.The original way of recreating an activity works fine.I can\'t figure out exactly why this is, but it is just an observation that can hopefully guide others in the future because it fixed my problems i was having with SurfaceViewsIf you remove the last line, you\'ll create new act Activity, but your old instance will still be alive.Do you need to restart the Activity like when the orientation is changed (i.e. your state is saved and passed to onCreate(Bundle))?If you don\'t, one possible workaround would be to use one extra, dummy Activity, which would be started from the first Activity, and which job is to start new instance of it. Or just delay the call to act.finish(), after the new one is started.If you need to save most of the state, you are getting in pretty deep waters, because it\'s non-trivial to pass all the properties of your state, especially without leaking your old Context/Activity, by passing it to the new instance.Please, specify what are you trying to do.The solution for your question is:You need to cast to activity context to start new activity and as well as to finish the current activity.Hope this helpful..and works for me.If you are calling from some fragment so do below code.Call the method onCreate. For example onCreate(null);
