What\'s all this fuss about Python and CPython (Jython,IronPython), I don\'t get it:python.org mentions that CPython is:The "traditional" implementation of Python (nicknamed CPython)yet another Stack Overflow question mentions that:CPython is the default byte-code interpreter of Python, which is written in C.Honestly I don\'t get what both of those explanations practically mean but what I thought was that, if I use CPython does that mean when I run a sample python code, it compiles it to C language and then executes it as if it were C codeSo what exactly is CPython and how does it differ when compared with python and should I probably use CPython over Python and if so what are its advantages?CPython is the original Python implementation. It is the implementation you download from Python.org. People call it CPython to distinguish it from other, later, Python implementations, and to distinguish the implementation of the language engine from the Python programming language itself.The latter part is where your confusion comes from; you need to keep Python-the-language separate from whatever runs the Python code.CPython happens to be implemented in C. That is just an implementation detail really. CPython compiles your python code into bytecode (transparently) and interprets that bytecode in a evaluation loop.CPython is also the first to implement new features; Python-the-language development uses CPython as the base, other implementations follow.Jython, IronPython and PyPy are the current \'other\' implementations of the Python programming language; these are implemented in Java, C# and RPython (a subset of Python), respectively. Jython compiles your Python code to Java bytecode, so your Python code can run on the JVM. IronPython lets you run Python on the Microsoft CLR. And PyPy, being implemented in (a subset of) Python, lets you run Python code faster than CPython, which rightly should blow your mind. :-)So CPython does not translate your Python code to C by itself. It instead runs a interpreter loop. There is a project that does translate Python-ish code to C, and that is called Cython. Cython adds a few extensions to the Python language, and lets you compile your code to C extensions, code that plugs into the CPython interpreter.You need to distinguish between a language and an implementation. Python is a language, According to Wikipedia, "A programming language is a notation for writing programs, which are specifications of a computation or algorithm". This means that it\'s simply the rules and syntax for writing code. Separately we have a programming language implementation which in most cases, is the actual interpreter or compiler. Python is a language.\nCPython is the implementation of Python in C. Jython is the implementation in Java, and so on. To sum up: You are already using CPython (if you downloaded from here).This article thoroughly explains the difference between different implementations of Python. Like the article puts it: The first thing to realize is that \xe2\x80\x98Python\xe2\x80\x99 is an interface. There\xe2\x80\x99s a\n  specification of what Python should do and how it should behave (as\n  with any interface). And there are multiple implementations (as with\n  any interface).The second thing to realize is that \xe2\x80\x98interpreted\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98compiled\xe2\x80\x99 are\n  properties of an implementation, not an interface.Python is a language: a set of rules that can be used to write programs. There are several implementaions of this language. No matter what implementation you take, they do pretty much the same thing: take the text of your program and interpret it, executing its instructions. None of them compile your code into C or any other language.CPython is the original implementation, written in C. (The "C" part in "CPython" refers to the language that was used to write Python interpreter itself.)Jython is the same language (Python), but implemented using Java. IronPython interpreter was written in C#.There\'s also PyPy - a Python interpreter written in Python. Make your pick :)Even I had the same problem understanding how are CPython, JPython, IronPython, PyPy are different from each other.So, I am willing to clear three things before I begin to explain:CPython is the implementation, which was\n  written in C language. It ends up producing bytecode (stack-machine\n  based instruction set) which is Python specific and then executes it.\n  The reason to convert Python code to a bytecode is because it\'s easier to\n  implement an interpreter if it looks like machine instructions. But,\n  it isn\'t necessary to produce some bytecode prior to execution of the\n  Python code (but CPython does produce).If you want to look at CPython\'s bytecode then you can. Here\'s how you can:Now, let\'s have a look at the above code. Lines 1 to 6 are a function definition. In line 8, we import the \'dis\' module which can be used to view the intermediate Python bytecode (or you can say, disassembler for Python bytecode) that is generated by CPython (interpreter).NOTE: I got the link to this code from #python IRC channel: https://gist.github.com/nedbat/e89fa710db0edfb9057dc8d18d979f9cAnd then, there is Jython, which is written in Java and ends up producing Java byte code. The Java byte code runs on Java Runtime Environment, which is an implementation of Java Virtual Machine (JVM). If this is confusing then I suspect that you have no clue how Java works. In layman terms, Java (the language, not the compiler) code is taken by the Java compiler and outputs a file (which is Java byte code) that can be run only using a JRE. This is done so that, once the Java code is compiled then it can be ported to other machines in Java byte code format, which can be only run by JRE. If this is still confusing then you may want to have a look at this web page.Here, you may ask if the CPython\'s bytecode is portable like Jython, I suspect not. The bytecode produced in CPython implementation was specific to that interpreter for making it easy for further execution of code (I also suspect that, such intermediate bytecode production, just for the ease the of processing is done in many other interpreters). So, in Jython, when you compile your Python code, you end up with Java byte code, which can be run on a JVM.Similarly, IronPython (written in C# language) compiles down your Python code to Common Language Runtime (CLR), which is a similar technology as compared to JVM, developed by Microsoft.implementation means what language was used to implement Python and not how python Code would be implemented. The advantage of using CPython is the availability of C Run-time as well as easy integration with C/C++. So CPython was originally implemented using C. There were other forks to the original implementation which enabled Python to lever-edge Java (JYthon) or .NET Runtime (IronPython).Based on which Implementation you use, library availability might vary, for example Ctypes is not available in Jython, so any library which uses ctypes would not work in Jython. Similarly, if you want to use a Java Class, you cannot directly do so from CPython. You either need a glue (JEPP) or need to use Jython (The Java Implementation of Python)You should know that CPython doesn\'t really support multithreading because of the Global Interpreter Lock. It also has no Optimisation mechanisms for recursion, and has many other limitations that other implementations and libraries try to fill.You should take a look at this page on the python wiki.Look at the code snippets on this page, it\'ll give you a good idea of what an interpreter is.So what is CPythonCPython is the original Python implementation. It is the implementation you download from Python.org. People call it CPython to distinguish it from other, later, Python implementations, and to distinguish the implementation of the language engine from the Python programming language itself.CPython happens to be implemented in C.
