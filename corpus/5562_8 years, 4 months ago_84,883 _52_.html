In my particular case:or does it even matter, what\'s the difference?Additional Resource:JavaScript-Garden typeof vs instanceofAnd the last one is a little bit tricky:Both are similar in functionality because they both return type information, however I personally prefer instanceof because it\'s comparing actual types rather than strings.  Type comparison is less prone to human error, and it\'s technically faster since it\'s comparing pointers in memory rather than doing whole string comparisons.A good reason to use typeof is if the variable may be undefined.A good reason to use instanceof is if the variable may be null.So really in my opinion it would depend on what type of possible data you are checking.To make things clear, you need to know two facts:  This means that instanceof is applicable only to objects.  This is the reason why it not used to check primitive types. In most cases you aren\'t using constructors to create strings or numbers. You can. But almost never do.  Also it can\'t check, exactly which constructor was used to create the object, but will return true, even if object is derived from class which being checked. In most cases this is the desired behavior, but sometimes it\'s not. So you need to keep that mind.  Another problem is that different scopes have different execution environments. This means that they have different built-ins (different global object, different constructors, etc.). This may result in unexpected results. For example, [] instanceof window.frames[0].Array will return false, because Array.prototype !== window.frames[0].Array and arrays inherit from the former.\nAlso, it cannot be used on undefined value, because it don\'t have a prototype.  I\'ve discovered some really interesting (read as "horrible") behavior in Safari 5 and Internet Explorer 9. I was using this with great success in Chrome and Firefox.Then I test in IE9, and it doesn\'t work at all. Big surprise. But in Safari, it\'s intermittent! So I start debugging, and I find that Internet Explorer is always returning false. But the weirdest thing is that Safari seems to be doing some kind of optimization in its JavaScript VM where it is true the first time, but false every time you hit reload!My brain almost exploded.So now I\'ve settled on this:And now everything works great. Note that you can call "a string".toString() and it just returns a copy of the string, i.e.So I\'ll be using both from now on.instanceof also works when callback is a subtype of Function, I thinkOther Significant practical differences:instanceof in Javascript can be flaky - I believe major frameworks try to avoid its use. Different windows is one of the ways in which it can break - I believe class hierarchies can confuse it as well.There are better ways for testing whether an object is a certain built-in type (which is usually what you want). Create utility functions and use them:And so on.instanceof will not work for primitives eg "foo" instanceof String will return false whereas typeof "foo" == "string" will return true.On the other hand typeof will probably not do what you want when it comes to custom objects (or classes, whatever you want to call them). For example:It just so happens that functions are both \'function\' primitives and instances of \'Function\', which is a bit of an oddity given that it doesn\'t work like that for other primitive types eg.butI would recommend using prototype\'s callback.isFunction().They\'ve figured out the difference and you can count on their reason.I guess other JS frameworks have such things, too.instanceOf wouldn\'t work on functions defined in other windows, I believe.\nTheir Function is different than your window.Function.When checking for a function, one must always use typeof.Here\'s the difference:This is why one must never use instanceof to check for a function.Performancetypeof is faster than instanceof in situations where both are applicable.Depending on your engine, the performance difference in favor of typeof could be around 20%. (Your mileage may vary)Here is a benchmark testing for Array: ResultSignificant practical difference:Don\'t ask me why.Use instanceof because if you change the name of the class you will get a compiler error.  Coming from a strict OO upbringing I\'d go for Strings are prone to either my awful spelling or other typos. Plus I feel it reads better.Despite instanceof may be a little bit faster then typeof, I prefer second one because of such a possible magic:One more case is that You only can collate with instanceof - it returns true or false. With typeof you can get type of provided somethingwith performance in mind, you\'d better use typeof\nwith a typical hardware, if you create a script with a loop of 10 million iterations\nthe instruction: typeof str == \'string\' will take 9ms\nwhile \'string\' instanceof String will take 19ms
