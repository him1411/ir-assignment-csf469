I want to add a blank space after some content, however the content: " "; doesn\'t seem to work.This is my code:... which doesn\'t work, however this does:What am I doing wrong?It\'s worth noting that your code does insert a spaceHowever, it\'s immediately removed.From Anonymous inline boxes,White space content that would subsequently be collapsed away\n  according to the \'white-space\' property does not generate any\n  anonymous inline boxes.And from The \'white-space\' processing model,If a space (U+0020) at the end of a line has \'white-space\' set to\n  \'normal\', \'nowrap\', or \'pre-line\', it is also removed.So if you don\'t want the space to be removed, set white-space to pre or pre-wrap.Do not use non-breaking spaces (U+00a0). They are supposed to prevent line breaks between words. They are not supposed to be used as non-collapsible space, that wouldn\'t be semantic.Turns out it needs to be specified via escaped unicode. This question is related and contains the answer.The solution:I needed this instead of using padding because I used inline-block containers to display a series of individual events in a workflow timeline. The last event in the timeline needed no arrow after it.Ended up with something like:Used fontawesome for the gt (chevron) character. For whatever reason "content: none;" was producing alignment issues on the last tile.
