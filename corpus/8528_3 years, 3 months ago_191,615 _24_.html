I started taking a look of the new Swift on Xcode 6, and I tried some demo projects and tutorials. Now I am stuck at:Instantiating and then presenting a viewController from a specific storyboardHow to achieve this on Swift?It all is a matter of the new syntax, functionality hasn\'t changed:If you\'re having problems with init(coder:), please refer to EridB\'s answer.For people using @akashivskyy\'s answer to instantiate UIViewController and are having the exception:fatal error: use of unimplemented initializer \'init(coder:)\' for classQuick tip:Manually implement required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) at your destination UIViewController that you are trying to instantiateIf you need more description please refer to my answer hereThis link has both the implementations:Swift:Objective CThis link has code for initiating viewcontroller in the same storyboardakashivskyy\'s answer works just fine! But, in case you have some trouble returning from the presented view controller, this alternative can be helpful. It worked for me!Swift:Obj-C:If you want to present it modally, you should have something like bellow:This worked fine for me when i put it in AppDelegate If you have a Viewcontroller not using any storyboard/Xib, you can push to this particular VC like below call :I know it\'s an old thread, but I think the current solution (using hardcoded string identifier for given view controller) is very prone to errors.I\'ve created a build time script (which you can access here), which will create a compiler safe way for accessing and instantiating view controllers from all storyboard within the given project.For example, view controller named vc1 in Main.storyboard will be instantiated like so:Swift 3\n
