In many C++ IDE\'s and compilers, when it generates the main function for you, it looks like this:int main(int argc, char *argv[])When I code C++ without an IDE, just with a command line compiler, I type:int main()without any parameters.  What does this mean, and is it vital to my program?argv and argc are how command line arguments are passed to main() in C and C++.argc will be the number of strings pointed to by argv.  This will (in practice) be 1 plus the number of arguments, as virtually all implementations will prepend the name of the program to the array.The variables are named argc (argument count) and argv (argument vector) by convention, but they can be given any valid identifier: int main(int num_args, char** arg_strings) is equally valid.They can also be omitted entirely, yielding int main(), if you do not intend to process command line arguments.Try the following program:Running it with ./test a1 b2 c3 will outputargc is the number of arguments being passed into your program from the command line and argv is the array of arguments.You can loop through the arguments knowing the number of them like:Suppose you run your program thus (using sh syntax):\nIf you declared your main as int main(int argc, char *argv[]), then (in most environments), your main() will be called as if like:However, if you declared your main as int main(), it will be called something likeand you don\'t get the arguments passed.Two additional things to note:The parameters to main represent the command line parameters provided to the program when it was started.  The argc parameter represents the number of command line arguments, and char *argv[] is an array of strings (character pointers) representing the individual arguments provided on the command line.The first parameter is the number of arguments provided and the second parameter is a list of strings representing those arguments.The main function can have two parameters, argc and argv. argc is an integer parameter, and it is the number of arguments passed to the program. The program name is always the first argument, so there will be at least one argument to a program and the minimum value of argc will be one. But if a program has itself two arguments the value of argc will be three. Parameter argv points to a string array and is called the "argument vector". It is a one dimensional string array of function arguments.Both ofare legal definitions of the entry point for a C or C++ program. Stroustrup: C++ Style and Technique FAQ details some of the variations that are possible or legal for your main function.
