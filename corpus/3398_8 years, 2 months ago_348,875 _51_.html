I am running a server, and I want to display my own IP address.What is the syntax for getting the computer\'s own (if possible, external) IP address?Someone wrote the following code.However, I generally distrust the author, and I don\'t understand this code. Is there a better way to do so?Nope, that is pretty much the best way to do it.  As a machine could have several IP addresses you need to iterate the collection of them to find the proper one.Edit: The only thing I would change would be to change this:to this:There is no need to ToString an enumeration for comparison.The only way to know your public IP is to ask someone else to tell you; this code may help you:Cleaner and an all in one solution :DIf you can\'t rely on getting your IP address from a DNS server (which has happened to me), you can use the following approach:The System.Net.NetworkInformation namespace contains a NetworkInterface class, which has a static GetAllNetworkInterfaces method.This method will return all "network interfaces" on your machine, and there are generally quite a few, even if you only have a wireless adapter and/or an ethernet adapter hardware installed on your machine.  All of these network interfaces have valid IP addresses for your local machine, although you probably only want one.If you\'re looking for one IP address, then you\'ll need to filter the list down until you can identify the right address.  You will probably need to do some experimentation, but I had success with the following approach:For each NetworkInterface, you can get an IPInterfaceProperties object using the GetIPProperties method, and from an IPInterfaceProperties object you can access the UnicastAddresses property for a list of UnicastIPAddressInformation objects.At this point I take the address of the first (if any) unicast address that matches all of these filters.Just tested this on my machine and it works.If you want to avoid using DNSDon\'t rely on InterNetwork all the time because you can have more than one device which also uses IP4 which would screw up the results in getting your IP.\nNow, if you would like you may just copy this and please review it or update it to how you see fit.First I get the address of the router (gateway)\nIf it comes back that I am connected to a gateway (which mean not connected directly into the modem wireless or not) then we have our gateway address as IPAddress else we a null pointer IPAddress reference.Then we need to get the computer\'s list of IPAddresses. This is where things are not that hard because routers (all routers) use 4 bytes (...). The first three are the most important because any computer connected to it will have the IP4 address matching the first three bytes. Ex: 192.168.0.1 is standard for router default IP unless changed by the adminstrator of it. \'192.168.0\' or whatever they may be is what we need to match up. And that is all I did in IsAddressOfGateway function. \nThe reason for the length matching is because not all addresses (which are for the computer only) have the length of 4 bytes. If you type in netstat in the cmd, you will find this to be true. So there you have it. Yes, it takes a little more work to really get what you are looking for. Process of elimination.\nAnd for God\'s sake, do not find the address by pinging it which takes time because first you are sending the address to be pinged and then it has to send the result back. No, work directly with .Net classes which deal with your system environment and you will get the answers you are looking for when it has to solely do with your computer.Now if you are directly connected to your modem, the process is almost the same because the modem is your gateway but the submask is not the same because your getting the information directly from your DNS Server via modem and not masked by the router serving up the Internet to you although you still can use the same code because the last byte of the IP assigned to the modem is 1. So if IP sent from the modem which does change is 111.111.111.1\' then you will get 111.111.111.(some byte value). Keep in mind the we need to find the gateway information because there are more devices which deal with internet connectivity than your router and modem.Now you see why you DON\'T change your router\'s first two bytes 192 and 168. These are strictly distinguished for routers only and not internet use or we would have a serious issue with IP Protocol and double pinging resulting in crashing your computer. Image that your assigned router IP is 192.168.44.103 and you click on a site with that IP as well. OMG! Your computer would not know what to ping. Crash right there. To avoid this issue, only routers are assigned these and not for internet usage. So leave the first two bytes of the router alone.I just thought that I would add my own, one-liner (even though there are many other useful answers already).string ipAddress = new WebClient().DownloadString("http://icanhazip.com");For getting the current public IP address, all you need to do is create an ASPX page with the following line on the page load event:If you are running in intranet you\'ll be able to get local machine IP address and if not you\'ll get external ip address with this:\nWeb:Desktop:Look here for details.You have to remember your computer can have more than one IP (actually it always does) - so which one are you after.Try this:Maybe by external IP you can consider (if you are in a Web server context) using thisI was asking the same question as you and I found it in this stackoverflow article.It worked for me.Simple single line of code that returns the first internal IPV4 address or null if there are none. Added as a comment above, but may be useful to someone (some solutions above will return multiple addresses that need further filtering).It\'s also easy to return loopback instead of null I guess with:To find IP address list I have used this solutionBut I personally like below solution to get local valid IP address The LINQ solution:Here is how i solved it. i know if you have several physical interfaces this might not select the exact eth you want.The question doesn\'t say ASP.NET MVC but I\'m just leaving this here anyway:Get all IP addresses as strings using LINQ:TO FILTER OUT PRIVATE ONES...First, define an extension method IsPrivate():... And then use it to filter out private IPs:It works for me... and should be faster in most case (if not all) than querying a DNS server. Thanks to Dr. Wily\'s Apprentice (here).Just as reference this is the full class code where I defined it:And this is to get all local IPs in csv format in VB.NETTo get the remote ip address the quickest way possible. You must have to use a downloader, or create a server on your computer.The downsides to using this simple code: (which is recommended) is that it will take 3-5 seconds to get your Remote IP Address because the WebClient when initialized always takes 3-5 seconds to check for your proxy settings.Here is how I fixed it.. (first time still takes 3-5 seconds) but after that it will always get your Remote IP Address in 0-2 seconds depending on your connection.
