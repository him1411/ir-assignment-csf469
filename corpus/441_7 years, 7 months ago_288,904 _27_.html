I\'d like to search for an upper case word, for example COPYRIGHT in a file. I tried performing a search like:but it doesn\'t work.  I know that in Perl, if I give the i flag into a regex it will turn the regex into a case-insensitive regex. It seems that Vim  has its own way to indicate a case-insensitive regex.You need to use the \\c escape sequence. So:/\\ccopyrightTo do the inverse (case sensitive matching), use \\C instead.As well as the suggestions for \\c and ignorecase, I find the smartcase very useful.  If you search for something containing uppercase characters, it will do a case sensitive search; if you search for something purely lowercase, it will do a case insensitive search.  You can use \\c and \\C to override this:See:You can set the ic option in Vim before the search:To go back to case-sensitive searches use:ic is shorthand for ignorecaseYou can issue the commandand after that your searches will be case-insensitive.To switch between case sensitive and insensitive search I use this mapping in my .vimrcnmap <F9> :set ignorecase! ignorecase?put this command in your vimrc filealways do case insensitive searchAs others suggested:But the cool stuff You can toggle such modes with:As @huyz mention sometimes desired behavior is using case-insensitive searches but case-sensitive substitutions. My solution for that:With that always when you hit / or ? it will add \\c for case-insensitive search.Vim have 2 modes1.edit modeSearch will work for normal mode /\\c for case sensitive/\\csearchI prefer to use \\c at the end of the search string:You can set ignorecase by default, run this in shell
