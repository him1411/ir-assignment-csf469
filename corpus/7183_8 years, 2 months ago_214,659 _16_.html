Possible Duplicate:\n  Tool to read and display Java .class versions I\'m trying to debug a "Bad version number in .class file\' error in java, is there a way for me to check which version the .class files are?I\'m using JRE1.5.0_6, but my JDK is version 1.6.0_13.I\'m compiling with compatibility mode set to 1.5 in eclipse which I thought would work...You\'re looking for this on the command line (for a class called MyClass):On Unix/Linux:On Windows:You want the major version from the results. Here are some example values:Btw, the reason that you\'re having trouble is that the java compiler recognizes two version flags. There is -source 1.5, which assumes java 1.5 level source code, and -target 1.5, which will emit java 1.5 compatible class files. You\'ll probably want to use both of these switches, but you definitely need -target 1.5; try double checking that eclipse is doing the right thing.Free JarCheck tool hereYou can try jclasslib:https://github.com/ingokegel/jclasslibIt\'s nice that it can associate itself with *.class extension.Does the -verbose flag to your java command yield any useful info?  If not, maybe java -X reveals something specific to your version that might help?
