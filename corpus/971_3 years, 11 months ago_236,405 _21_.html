I saw some tutorial where the command was:What does the --save option mean?Not able to find the answer on Google.By default, NPM simply installs a package under node_modules. When you\'re trying to install dependencies for your app/module, you would need to first install them, and then add them (along with the appropriate version number) to the dependencies section of your package.json.The --save option instructs NPM to include the package inside of the dependencies section of your package.json automatically, thus saving you an additional step.In addition, there are the complementary options --save-dev and --save-optional which save the package under devDependencies and optionalDependencies, respectively. This is useful when installing development-only packages, like grunt or your testing library.It\'s documented in the documentation for npm installUpdate npm 5:As of npm 5.0.0, installed modules will be added as a dependency (--save) by default.It won\'t do anything if you don\'t have a package.json file.  Start by running npm init to create one.  Then calls to npm install --save or npm install --save-dev or npm install --save-optional will update the package.json to list your dependencies.To add package in dependencies:orTo add package in devDependenciesorpackage.json\nYou can also see them as -S or -D, -P which are equivalent of saving package to app dependency or to app dev or prod dependency. See more NPM shortcuts below:As of npm 5, it is more favorable to use --save-prod (or -P) than --save but doing the same thing, as is stated in npm install. So far, --save still works if provided.npm install package_x --saveThe given package (package_x) will be saved in package.json inside dependencies.\nif you add npm install <> --save-devthen it will be saved inside "devDependencies".
