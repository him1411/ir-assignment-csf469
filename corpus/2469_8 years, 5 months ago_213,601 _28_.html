I\'d like to reverse the order of lines in a text file (or stdin), preserving the contents of each line.So, i.e., starting with:I\'d like to end up with Is there a standard UNIX commandline utility for this?BSD tail:Reference: FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and OS X manual pages.Also worth mentioning: tac (the, ahem, reverse of cat). Part of coreutils.There\'s the well-known sed tricks:(Explanation: prepend non-initial line to hold buffer, swap line and hold buffer, print out line at end)Alternatively (with faster execution) from the awk one-liners:If you can\'t remember that,On a system with GNU utilities, the other answers are simpler, but not all the world is GNU/Linux...If you happen to be in vim useTry tac, which works on Linux, and if that doesn\'t work use tail -r, which works on BSD and OSX.Try the following command:Just Bash :) (4.0+)The simplest method is using the tac command. tac is cat\'s inverse.\nExample:I really like the "tail -r" answer, but my favorite gawk answer is....example:EDIT\nthe following generates a randomly sorted list of numbers from 1 to 10:where dots are replaced with actual command which reverses the listtacpython: using [::-1] on sys.stdinBest solution:For cross OS (i.e. OSX, Linux) solution that may use tac inside a shell script use homebrew as others have mentioned above, then just alias tac like so:I had the same question, but I also wanted the first line (header) to stay on top. So I needed to use the power of awkPS also works in cygwin or gitbashor
