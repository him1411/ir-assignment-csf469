I am using ARC successfully in my project. However, I have encountered a few files (e.g., in unit tests and mock objects) where the rules of ARC are a little more fragile right now. I recall hearing that there was a way to disable ARC on a per-file basis, though I have been unable to find this option.Is this possible? How do I disable ARC on a per-file basis?It is possible to disable ARC for individual files by adding the -fno-objc-arc compiler flag for those files. You add compiler flags in Targets -> Build Phases -> Compile Sources. You have to double click on the right column of the row under Compiler Flags. You can also add it to multiple files by holding the cmd button to select the files and then pressing enter to bring up the flag edit box. (Note that editing multiple files will overwrite any flags that it may already have.)I created a sample project that has an example: https://github.com/jaminguy/NoArcSee this answer for more info:\nDisable Automatic Reference Counting for Some FilesDisable ARC on MULTIPLE files:;)For Xcode 4.3 the easier way might be: Edit/Refactor/Convert to objective-C ARC, then check off the files you don\'t want to be converted. I find this way the same as using the compiler flag above. Note: if you want to disable ARC for many files, you have to:It is very simple way to make individual file non-arc.Follow below steps :Disable ARC on individual file:Select desired files at Target/Build Phases/Compile Sources in XcodeSelect .m file which you want make it NON-ARC\nPRESS ENTER\nType -fno-objc-arcNon ARC file to ARC project flag : -fno-objc-arcARC file to non ARC project flag : -fobjc-arcJust use the -fno-objc-arc flag in Build Phases>Compile SourcesIt is possible to disable ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) for particular file in Xcode.Select Target -> Build Phases -> Compile Sources -> Select File (double click) -> Add "-fno-objc-arc" to pop-up window.I had encountered this situation in using "Reachibility" files.This is shown in below figure :use -fno-objc-arc for each file in build phasesThe four Mandatory Step as explained in this videoPlease Just follow the screenshot and enter -fno-objc-arc .If you\'re using Unity, you don\'t need to change this in Xcode, you can apply a compile flag in the metadata for the specific file(s), right inside Unity. Just select them in the Project panel, and apply from the Inspector panel. This is essential if you plan on using Cloud Build.Add flag \xe2\x80\x9c-fno-objc-arc\xe2\x80\x9d.Simple follow steps :\nApp>Targets>Build Phases>Compile Sources> add flag after class \xe2\x80\x9c-fno-objc-arc\xe2\x80\x9dI think all the other answers are explaining how to disable MRC(Manual Reference Count) and enabling ARC(Automatic Reference Count).\nTo Use MRC(Manual Reference Count) i.e. Disabling ARC(Automatic Reference Count) on MULTIPLE files:To disable ARC for individual files go to build phases under project settings then click on compile sources.Select the .m file of the class you want to disable ARC for and set the compiler flags to -fno-objc-arcsource:\nDisable ARC For Individual ClassJust use the -fno-objc-arc flag in Build Phases>Compile Sources infront of files to whom you dont want ARC to be apply.GO to App -> then Targets -> Build Phases -> Compile SourceNow, Select the file in which you want to disable ARCpaste this snippet "-fno-objc-arc" After pasting press ENTERin each file where you want to disable ARC.Following Step to to enable disable ARCSelect Xcode project\nGo to targets\nSelect the Build phases section\nInside the build phases section select the compile sources.\nSelect the file which you do not want to disable ARC and add -fno-objc-arc
