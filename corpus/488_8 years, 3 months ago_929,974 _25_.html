In Python, how do you get the last element of a list?some_list[-1] is the shortest and most Pythonic.In fact, you can do much more with this syntax. The some_list[-n] syntax gets the nth-to-last element. So some_list[-1] gets the last element, some_list[-2] gets the second to last, etc, all the way down to some_list[-len(some_list)], which gives you the first element.You can also set list elements in this way. For instance:If your str() or list() objects might end up being empty as so: astr = \'\' or alist = [], then you might want to use alist[-1:] instead of alist[-1] for object "sameness".The significance of this is:Where the distinction being made is that returning an empty list object or empty str object is more "last element"-like then an exception object.You can also do:It depends on what you want to do with your list because the pop() method will delete the last element.The simplest way to display last element in python isthere are many other method to achieve such a goal but these are short and sweet to use.some_list = [1, 2, 3]Method 1:Method 2:Method 3:list[-1] will retrieve the last element of the list without changing the list.\nlist.pop() will retrieve the last element of the list, but it will mutate/change the original list. Usually, mutating the original list is not recommended.Alternatively, if, for some reason, you\'re looking for something less pythonic, you could use list[len(list)-1], assuming the list is not empty.Ok, but what about common in almost every language way items[len(items) - 1]? This is IMO the easiest way to get last element, because it does not require anything pythonic knowledge.In Python, how do you get the last element of a list?Indexes and slices can take negative integers as arguments:A slice of a list returns a new list - so we can slice from -1 to the end if we want the element in a list:We can also mutate our original list by removing and returning the last element:But now the original list is modified. -1 is actually the default argument, so list.pop can be used without an index argument:You can also use the code below, if you do not want to get IndexError when the list is empty.after the for loop you\'ll get last item in current_pope variable.
