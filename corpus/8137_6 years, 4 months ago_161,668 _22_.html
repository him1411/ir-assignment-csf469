I have a long document of commands. Using notepad++ or regex, I want to delete all lines containing "help" including keyboard_help etc.How can this be done?This is also possible with Notepad++Check "Bookmark line" (if there is no "Mark" tab update to the current version).Enter your search term and click "Mark All"Now go to the Menu "Search -> Bookmark -> Remove Bookmarked lines"Done.Another way to do this in Notepad++ is all in the Find/Replace dialog and with regex:Ctrl + h to bring up the find replace dialog.In the Find what: text box include your regex: .*help.*\\r?\\n (where the \\r is optional in case the file doesn\'t have Windows line endings).Leave the Replace with: text box empty.Make sure the Regular expression radio button in the Search Mode area is selected. Then click Replace All and voila! All lines containing your search term help have been removed.Easy task with grep:Append > newFileName to redirect output to a new file.To clarify it, the normal behavior will be printing the lines on screen. To pipe it to a file, the > can be used. Thus, in this command:As you may noticed, you will not be deleting things in your file. grep will read it and another file will be saved, modified accordingly.You can do this using sed: sed \'/help/ d\' < inputFile > outputFileIf you\'re on Windows try findstr, no 3rd party tools needed:It supports regex\'s too! Just read the tool\'s help findstr /?P.S. If you want to work with big, HUGE files (like 400mb log files) a text editor is not very memory efficient, so, as someone already pointed, command-line tools are the way to go. But there\'s no grep on windows, so...Just ran this on a 1GB log file and it literally took 3 seconds.
