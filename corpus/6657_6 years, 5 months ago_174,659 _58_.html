In Android I have some activities, let\'s say A, B, C.In A I use this code to open B:In B I use this code to open C:When the user taps a button in C I want to go back to A and clear the back stack (close both B and C). So when the user use the back button B and C will not show up, I\'ve been trying the following:But B and C are still showing up if I use the back button when I\'m back in activity A. How can I avoid this?Try adding FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK as described in the docs for FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP:This launch mode can also be used to\n  good effect in conjunction with\n  FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK: if used to\n  start the root activity of a task, it\n  will bring any currently running\n  instance of that task to the\n  foreground, and then clear it to its\n  root state. This is especially useful,\n  for example, when launching an\n  activity from the notification\n  manager.So your code to launch A would be:What about adding in manifests file for related activity :to the activity definition of B and C ? They will not be added to the backstack. Not sure if that is what you want.This bothers me for a long time .Finally I worked it out by doing this:In fragment,use:In Activity,use(add one more intent flag Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK compared to fragment):This means that when Activity A is launched, all tasks on top of it are cleared so that A is top. A new back stack is created with A at the root, and using singleTop ensures you only ever launch A once (since A is now on top due to ..._CLEAR_TOP).Starting in API 16 (Jelly Bean), you can just call finishAffinity().Now you can also call ActivityCompat.finishAffinity(Activity activity) with the compatibility library.Be sure to set taskAffinity in the manifest to a package name unique to that group of activities.See for more info:\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/app/ActivityCompat.html#finishAffinity%28android.app.Activity%29Try usingand notFor future research, try this code.As per Wakka in Removing an activity from the history stack...Add android:noHistory="true" attribute to your <activity> in the AndroidManifest.xml like this:If your application has minimum sdk version 16 then you can use \n finishAffinity()Finish this activity as well as all activities immediately below it in the current task that have the same affinity.  This is work for me\nIn Top Payment screen remove all back-stack activits,http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#finishAffinity%28%29Use finishAffinity(); in task C when starting task A to clear backstack activities.I found the answers here a little misleading because the code in the original question seems to work fine for me?With A being the root activity, starting it from B or C only with FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP does remove B and C from the back stack.It sounds to me like you need to start Activity C from Activity B by using startActivityForResult(). When you click a button in Activity C, call setResult(RESULT_OK) and finish() so Activity C is ended. In Activity B, you could have the onActivityResult() respond by also calling finish() on itself, and you\'d then be taken back to Activity A.logout.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK);\n                            logout.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);You can use this example to call your Activity A from Activity CIntent loout = new Intent(context, LoginActivity.class);\nloout.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK | Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK);\ncontext.startActivity(loout);I tried all solutions and none worked individually for me.\nMy Solution is :Declare Activity A as SingleTop by using [android:launchMode="singleTop"] in Android manifest.Now add the following flags while launching A from anywhere. It will clear the stack.Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP will not work in this case. Please use (Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK | Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK)For more detail please check out this documentation.use this code for starting new activity and close or destroy all other acivity stack or back satack...In addition to FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP, you may try adding Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP as well:intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP);\nintent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP);The given code works correctly. I have tried in the Application Life Cycle sample.I haven\'t got B and C in the back stack after starting activity A with flag, FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOPi called activity_name.this.finish() after starting new intent and it worked for me.But it won\'t work for me... I am not suggesting this solution for use but if setting flag won\'t work for you than you can try this..But still i recommend don\'t use itAdd NO History Flag in the intent.In activity B, start the activity C as below >>>>>>In manifestandEither add this to your Activity B and Activity Cor Override onBackPressed function to avoid back pressing with a return.Use setFlags() method for clear back side opened all activity close and start yourActvity This is a really old answer and i didn\'t really found a proper solution to it, to the sole purpose of clearing the backStack, i decided to create my own backstack, which is not even a stack tbh, but it doesn\'t have to be, since we want to clear everything in it anyways;Theres an overhead of handlind the backstack everytime, but it gave me the control i needed;First Declare a public static List of Activities (or fragments, whatever you need);And inside all other activity\'s onCreate method:And finally, when you want to clear the backstack, simply call:
