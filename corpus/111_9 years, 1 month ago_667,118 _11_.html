I would like to grep for a string, but also show the preceding five lines and the following five lines as well as the matched line. How would I be able to do this?For BSD or GNU grep you can use -B num to set how many lines before the match and -A num for the number of lines after the match.If you want the same number of lines before and after you can use -C num.This will show 3 lines before and 3 lines after.-A and -B will work, as will -C n (for n lines of context), or just -n (for n lines of context).ack works with similar arguments as grep, and accepts -C. But it\'s usually better for searching through code.That will grep "myfile" for "astring", and show 5 lines before and after each matchI normally useMany of the tools like grep also have really great man files too. I find myself referring to grep\'s man page a lot because there is so much you can do with it.Many GNU tools also have an info page that may have more useful information in addition to the man page.Search for "17655" in "/some/file.txt" showing 10 lines context before and after (using Awk), output preceded with line number followed by a colon. Use this on Solaris when \'grep\' does not support the "-[ACB]" options.
