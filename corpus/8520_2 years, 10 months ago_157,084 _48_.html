I am using Android v21 support library. I have created a button with custom background color. The Material design effects like ripple, reveal are gone (except the elevation on click) when I use the back ground color.\nThe following is a normal button  and the effects are working just fine.When  you use android:background, you are replacing much of the styling and look and feel of a button with a blank color.Update: As of the version 23.0.0 release of AppCompat, there is a new Widget.AppCompat.Button.Colored style which uses your theme\'s colorButtonNormal for the disabled color and colorAccent for the enabled color.This allows you apply it to your button directly viaIf you need a custom colorButtonNormal or colorAccent, you can use a ThemeOverlay as explained in this pro-tip and android:theme on the button.Previous AnswerYou can use a drawable in your v21 directory for your background such as:This will ensure your background color is ?attr/colorPrimary and has the default ripple animation using the default ?attr/colorControlHighlight (which you can also set in your theme if you\'d like).Note: you\'ll have to create a custom selector for less than v21:Assuming you have some colors you\'d like for the default, pressed, and focused state. Personally, I took a screenshot of a ripple midway through being selected and pulled the primary/focused state out of that.There is another simple solution to provide custom background for "Flat" buttons while keeping their "Material" effects.i.e. :Can be used for Flat buttons, it works on API >=11, and you will get ripple effect on >=21 devices, keeping regular buttons on pre-21 till AppCompat is updated to support ripple there as well.You can also use selectableItemBackgroundBorderless for >=21 buttons only.Here is a simple and backward compatible way to deliver ripple effect to raised buttons with the custom background.Your layout should look like thisI ran into this problem today actually playing with the v22 library. Assuming that you\'re using styles you can set the colorButtonNormal property and the buttons will use that color by default. Outside of that you could still make a style for the button then use that per button if you needed an assortment of colors (haven\'t tested, just speculating).Remember to add android: before the item names in your v21 style. With AppCompat (22.1.1+) you can add a style like this:And use it by just applying the style:Programmatically changing the color, I found that the only way to update the color (on API 15 or 16) was to use the \'background tint list\' instead.  And it doesn\'t remove the nice radial animation on API 21 devices:Because button.setBackground(...) and button.getBackground().mutate().setColorFilter(...) do not change the button color on API 15 and 16 like they do on API 21.The @ianhanniballake\'s answer is absolutely correct and simple. But it took me few days to understand. For someone who don\'t understand his answer, here is more detail implementation===Or===I used the backgroundTint and foreground:v22.1 of appcompat-v7 introduced some new possibilities. Now it\'s possible to assign a specific theme only to one view.Deprecated use of app:theme for styling Toolbar. You can now use\n  android:theme for toolbars on all API level 7 and higher devices and\n  android:theme support for all widgets on API level 11 and higher\n  devices.So instead of setting the desired color in a global theme, we create a new one and assign it only to the ButtonExample:And use this style as theme of your ButtonUse backgroundTint instead of backgroundIf you\'re ok with using a third party library, check out traex/RippleEffect. It allows you to add a Ripple effect to ANY view with just a few lines of code. You just need to wrap, in your xml layout file, the element you want to have a ripple effect with a com.andexert.library.RippleView container. As an added bonus it requires Min SDK 9 so you can have design consistency across OS versions.Here\'s an example taken from the libraries\' GitHub repo:You can change the ripple colour by adding this attribute the the RippleView element: app:rv_color="@color/my_fancy_ripple_colorUse and the color will acept on pre-lolipopI came to this post looking for a way to have a background color of my ListView Item, yet keep the ripple.I simply added my color as a background and the selectableItemBackground as a foreground:and it works like a charm. I guess the same technique could be used for buttons as well. Good luck :)If you are interested in ImageButton you can try this simple thing :I tried this:instead of changing background property.\nThis does not remove the material effect.
