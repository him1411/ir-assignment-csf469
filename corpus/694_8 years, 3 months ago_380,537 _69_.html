I want to get fling gesture detection working in my Android application.What I have is a GridLayout that contains 9 ImageViews. The source can be found here: Romain Guys\'s Grid Layout.That file I take is from Romain Guy\'s Photostream application and has only been slightly adapted.For the simple click situation I need only set the onClickListener for each ImageView I add to be the main activity which implements View.OnClickListener. It seems infinitely more complicated to implement something that recognizes a fling. I presume this is because it may span views?If my activity implements\nOnGestureListener I don\'t know how to\nset that as the gesture listener for\nthe Grid or the Image views that I\nadd.If my activity implements\nOnTouchListener then I have no\nonFling method to override (it has\ntwo events as parameters allowing me\nto determine if the fling was\nnoteworthy).If I make a custom View, like GestureImageView that extends ImageView I don\'t know how to tell the activity that a fling has occurred from the view. In any case, I tried this and the methods weren\'t called when I touched the screen.I really just need a concrete example of this working across views. What, when and how should I attach this listener? I need to be able to detect single clicks also.Is it possible to lay a transparent view over the top of my screen to capture flings?If I choose not to inflate my child image views from XML can I pass the GestureDetector as a constructor parameter to a new subclass of ImageView that I create?This is the very simple activity that I\'m trying to get the fling detection to work for: SelectFilterActivity (Adapted from photostream).I\'ve been looking at these sources:Detect Gestures - TutorialSDK docsCalculator CodeNothing has worked for me so far and I was hoping for some pointers.Thanks to Code Shogun, whose code I adapted to my situation.Let your activity implementOnClickListener as usual:Attach your gesture listener to all the views you add to the main layout;Watch in awe as your overridden methods are hit, both the onClick(View v) of the activity and the onFling of the gesture listener.The post \'fling\' dance is optional but encouraged. One of the answers above mentions handling different pixel density but suggests computing the swipe parameters by hand. It is worth noting that you can actually obtain scaled, reasonable values from the system using ViewConfiguration class:I noticed that using these values causes the "feel" of fling to be more consistent between the application and rest of system.I do it a little different, and wrote an extra detector class that implements the View.onTouchListener onCreateis simply add it to the lowest layout like this:where id.lowestLayout is the id.xxx for the view lowest in the layout hierarchy and lowestLayout is declared as a RelativeLayoutAnd then there is the actual activity swipe detector class:Works really good for me!I slightly modified and repaired solution from Thomas FankhauserWhole system consists from two files, SwipeInterface and ActivitySwipeDetectorSwipeInterface.javaDetectorit is used like this:And in implementing Activity you need to implement methods from SwipeInterface, and you can find out on which View the Swipe Event was called.The swipe gesture detector code above is very useful! You may however wish to make this solution density agnostic by using the following relative values (REL_SWIPE) rather than the absolute values (SWIPE_) My version of solution proposed by Thomas Fankhauser and Marek Sebera (does not handle vertical swipes):SwipeInterface.javaActivitySwipeDetector.javaThis question is kind of old and in July 2011 Google released the Compatibility Package, revision 3) which includes the ViewPager that works with Android 1.6 upwards. The GestureListener answers posted for this question don\'t feel very elegant on Android. If you\'re looking for the code used in switching between photos in the Android Gallery or switching views in the new Play Market app then it\'s definitely ViewPager.Here\'s some links for more info:There\'s a built-in interface that you can use directly for all gestures:\nHere is an explanation for a basic level user:\n\nThere is 2 imports be careful in choosing that both are diferent\n\nThis is a combined answer of the two answers at top, if anyone wants a working implementation.Also as a minor enhancement.The main reason for the try/catch block is that e1 could be null for the initial movement.  in addition to the try/catch, include a test for null and return.\nsimilar to the followingThere is a lot of excellent information here. Unfortunately a lot of this fling-processing code is scattered around on various sites in various states of completion, even though one would think this is essential to many applications.I\'ve taken the time to create a fling listener that verifies that the appropriate conditions are met. I\'ve added a page fling listener that adds more checks to ensure that flings meet the threshold for page flings. Both of these listeners allow you to easily restrict flings to the horizontal or vertical axis. You can see how it\'s used in a view for sliding images. I acknowledge that the people here have done most of the research---I\'ve just put it together into a usable library.These last few days represent my first stab at coding on Android; expect much more to come.There\'s some proposition over the web (and this page) to use ViewConfiguration.getScaledTouchSlop() to have a device-scaled value for SWIPE_MIN_DISTANCE.getScaledTouchSlop is intended for the "scrolling treshold" distance, not swipe. The scrolling treshold distance has to be smaller than a "swing between page" treshold distance. For example, this function return 12 pixels on my Samsung GS2, and the examples quoted in this page are arount 100 pixels.With API Level 8 (Android 2.2, Froyo), you\'ve got "getScaledPagingTouchSlop()", intended for page swipe.\nOn my device, it returns 24 (pixels). So if you\'re on API Level < 8, I think "2 * getScaledTouchSlop()" should be the "standard" swipe treshold.\nBut users of my application with small screens told me that it was too few... As on my application, you can scroll vertically, and change page horizontally. With the proposed value, they sometimes change page instead of scrolling.You can use the droidQuery library to handle flings, clicks, long clicks, and custom events. The implementation is built on my previous answer below, but droidQuery provides a slick, simple syntax:This answer uses a combination of components from the other answers here. It consists of the SwipeDetector class, which has an inner interface for listening for events. I also provide a  RelativeLayout to show how to override a View\'s onTouch method to allow both swipe events and other detected events (such as clicks or long clicks).SwipeDetectorSwipe Interceptor ViewI know its too late to answer but Still I am posting Swipe Detection for ListView that How to use Swipe Touch Listener in ListView Item.Refrence: Exterminator13(one of answer in this page)Make one ActivitySwipeDetector.classCall it from your activity class like this:And Don\'t forget to implement SwipeInterface which will give you two @override methods:To all: don\'t forget about case MotionEvent.ACTION_CANCEL:it calls in 30% swipes without ACTION_UPand its equal to ACTION_UP in this caseGestures are those subtle motions to trigger interactions between the touch screen and the user. It lasts for the time between the first touch on the screen to the point when the last finger leaves the surface. Android provides us with a class called GestureDetector using which we can detect common gestures like tapping down and up, swiping vertically and horizontally (fling), long and short press, double taps, etc. and attach listeners to them. Make our Activity class implement GestureDetector.OnDoubleTapListener (for double tap gesture detection) and GestureDetector.OnGestureListener interfaces and implement all the abstract methods.For more info. you may visit https://developer.android.com/training/gestures/detector.html . Courtesy For Demo Test.GestureDetectorDemoIf you dont like to create a separate class or make code complex,\nYou can just create a GestureDetector variable inside OnTouchListener and make your code more easiernamVyuVar can be any name of the View on which you need to set the listnerI nedded a more generic Class , I took Tomas\'s class and added an Interface that send events to your Activity or Fragment.\nit will register the listener on the constructor so be sure you implement the interface or an ClassCastException will be thorwn. the interface returns one of the four final int defined\nin the class and will return the view on which it was activated upon.
