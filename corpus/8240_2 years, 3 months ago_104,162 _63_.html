has anyone with the iOS 9 beta 1 had this issue?  I use standard NSURLConnection to connect to a webservice and as soon as a call is made to the webservice i get the below error.  This is currently working in iOS 8.3Possible beta bug? any ideas or thoughts would be great ! I know its very early in iOS 9 developmentHere is the full error:CFNetwork SSLHandshake failed (-9824)\n  NSURLSession/NSURLConnection HTTP load failed (kCFStreamErrorDomainSSL, -9824)iOS 9 and OSX 10.11 require TLSv1.2 SSL for all hosts you plan to request data from unless you specify exception domains in your app\'s Info.plist file.The syntax for the Info.plist configuration looks like this:If your application (a third-party web browser, for instance) needs to connect to arbitrary hosts, you can configure it like this:If you\'re having to do this, it\'s probably best to update your servers to use TLSv1.2 and SSL, if they\'re not already doing so. This should be considered a temporary workaround.As of today, the prerelease documentation makes no mention of any of these configuration options in any specific way. Once it does, I\'ll update the answer to link to the relevant documentation.**IMPORTANT NOTE FOR iOS 10 BETA: **In iOS 10, the TLS string MUST be of the form "TLSv1.0". It can\'t just be "1.0". Yes, this is incredibly stupid and app-breaking.

It went away when I upgraded or downgraded cordova iOS.The server I was connecting to was using TLSv1.2 SSL so I knew that was not the problem.In your project  .plist file in add this permission :The syntax for the Info.plist configurationUpdated Answer (post-WWDC 2016):iOS apps will require secure HTTPS connections by the end of\n  2016. Trying  turn ATS off may get your app rejected in the future.App Transport Security, or ATS, is a feature that Apple introduced in iOS 9. When ATS is enabled, it forces an app to connect to web services over an HTTPS connection rather than non secure HTTP.However, developers can still switch ATS off and allow their apps to send data over an HTTP connection as mentioned in above answers. At the end of 2016, Apple will make ATS mandatory for all developers who hope to submit their apps to the App Store. linkWhy makes it too complicated- Just set iOS Development Target - 8.0And Cmd+Shift+KThe device I tested at had wrong time set. So when I tried accessing a page with a certificate that would run out soon it would deny access because the device though the certificate had expired. To fix, set proper time on the device!info.plist as below or just copy & past that work for me up to iOS 9.2
