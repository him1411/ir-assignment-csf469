I am trying to understand the advantages of multiprocessing over threading. I know that multiprocessing gets around the Global Interpreter Lock, but what other advantages are there, and can threading not do the same thing?The threading module uses threads, the multiprocessing module uses processes. The difference is that threads run in the same memory space, while processes have separate memory. This makes it a bit harder to share objects between processes with multiprocessing. Since threads use the same memory, precautions have to be taken or two threads will write to the same memory at the same time. This is what the global interpreter lock is for.Spawning processes is a bit slower than spawning threads. Once they are running, there is not much difference.Here are some pros/cons I came up with.Threading\'s job is to enable applications to be responsive. Suppose you have a database connection and you need to respond to user input. Without threading, if the database connection is busy the application will not be able to respond to the user. By splitting off the database connection into a separate thread you can make the application more responsive. Also because both threads are in the same process, they can access the same data structures - good performance, plus a flexible software design.Note that due to the GIL the app isn\'t actually doing two things at once, but what we\'ve done is put the resource lock on the database into a separate thread so that CPU time can be switched between it and the user interaction. CPU time gets rationed out between the threads.Multiprocessing is for times when you really do want more than one thing to be done at any given time. Suppose your application needs to connect to 6 databases and perform a complex matrix transformation on each dataset. Putting each job in a separate thread might help a little because when one connection is idle another one could get some CPU time, but the processing would not be done in parallel because the GIL means that you\'re only ever using the resources of one CPU. By putting each job in a Multiprocessing process, each can run on it\'s own CPU and run at full efficiency.The key advantage is isolation. A crashing process won\'t bring down other processes, whereas a crashing thread will probably wreak havoc with other threads.Another thing not mentioned is that it depends on what OS you are using where speed is concerned. In Windows processes are costly so threads would be better in windows but in unix processes are faster than their windows variants so using processes in unix is much safer plus quick to spawn.Other answers have focused more on the multithreading vs multiprocessing aspect, but in python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) has to be taken into account. When more number (say k) of threads are created, generally they will not increase the performance by  k  times, as it will still be running as a single threaded application. GIL is a global lock which locks everything out and allows only single thread execution  utilizing only a single core. The performance does increase in places where a C extensions like numpy, Network, I/O are being used, where a lot of background work is done and GIL is released.  So when threading is used, there is only a single operating system level threads while python creates pseudo-threads which are completely managed by threading itself but are essentially running as a single process. Preemption takes between these pseudo threads. If the CPU runs at maximum capacity, you may want to switch to multiprocessing.\nNow in case of self-contained instances of execution, you can instead opt for pool. But in case of overlapping data, where you may want processes communicating you should use multiprocessing.Process.Process may have multiple Thread this threads may share memory. If you considering the Multiple Process vs Multiple threads, Threads besides in the process. process is running on the CPU. so  threads are residing under the processes. Process are individual entities which run independently. If you want to share data or state between the process, you may use the common place where store data(Ex. Cache(redis, memcache), Files, Database)
