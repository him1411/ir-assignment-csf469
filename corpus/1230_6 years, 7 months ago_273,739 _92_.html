I thought there was a way to test your applications in development over Wi-Fi. Is this accurate?I\'d love to be able to untether my phone and develop wirelessly.See forum post Any way to view Android screen remotely without root? - Post #9.No root required!To find the IP address of the device: run adb shell and then netcfg. You\'ll see it there.\nTo find the IP address while using OSX run the command adb shell ip route.WARNING: leaving the option enabled is dangerous, anyone in your network can connect to your device in debug, even if you are in data network. Do it only when connected to a trusted Wi-Fi and remember to disconnect it when done!@Sergei suggested that line 2 should be modified, commenting: "-d option needed to connect to the USB device when the other connection persists (for example, emulator connected or other Wi-Fi device)".This information may prove valuable to future readers, but I rolled-back to the original version that had received 178 upvotes.On some device you can do the same thing even if you do not have an USB cable:Using Android Studio there is a plugin allowing you to connect USB Debugging without the need of using any ADB command from a terminal.The adb utility does have the ability to connect to a device over TCP/IP. However, adbd is not normally listening for TCP connections.If you want to get it running, you need an engineering device (in other words, you need root). Then follow the directions in this post:How can I connect to Android with ADB over TCP?Since this only works on eng devices, it\'s not officially supported. Use at your own risk, expect bugs, etc.If you want to enable wireless adb on the device without connecting with a USB cable at all (root required):Since you already have the terminal opened, you can find the IP address of the device:Then in your debugging environment run command:This will make the device to be listed as any other emulators you might have. Note that the TCP will stay opened until you reset the device.\nYou might also want to install a Wi-Fi Keep Alive app if you often experience disconnects.Remember to close the TCP when connecting to public networks if you want to feel safe. You can do the following or simply restart the device:(No root required) There is one best, easy and with UI method for Android StudioIntelliJ and Android Studio plugin created to quickly connect your Android device over WiFi to install, run and debug your applications without a USB connected. Press one button and forget about your USB cable.just install plugin Android WiFi ADBDownload and install Android WiFi ADB directly fromIntellij / Android Studio: Preferences/Settings->Plugins->Browse Repositories.Remember! for first time to initialize the device you must have to connect using usbAlternatively, you can download the plugin from the JetBrains plugin site and install it manually in: Preferences/Settings->Plugins->Install plugin from disk.You can connect and manage your devices easily....... for more information read here  https://github.com/pedrovgs/AndroidWiFiADBI found my answer here:Make sure adb is running in USB mode on host.Connect to the device over USB.Restart host adb in tcpip mode.Find out the IP address of the Android device: Settings -> About tablet -> Status -> IP address. Remember the IP address, of the form #.#.#.#.\nsometimes its not possible to find the IP-address of the android device, as in my case. so u can get it using adb as the following:\n$ adb shell netcfg \nand the should be in the last line of the result.Connect adb host to device:Remove USB cable from device, and confirm you can still access device:You\'re now good to go!If the adb connection is ever lost:Or if that doesn\'t work, reset your adb host:and then start over from the beginning.For all , this , there exists a better method (EASIEST METHOD) :1 ) A plugin for Android studio exits , called Android wifi ADB 2) Go to file -> settings -> Plugins -> Browse Repositories 3) Look for  Android WiFi ADB  , click on INSTALL , and then restart on prompt4) You will see a new icon , which is your new plugin .Now to make this work : 5) Go to your phone\'s developer option and enable DEBUGGING (must)6) Also enable , ALLOW DEBUG OVER TCP/NETWORK7) Attach your phone via USB , and make sure , both phone and your pc/laptop are connected to the same network (either hotspot or wifi)8) CLICK ON THE NEW ICON (ie your ANDROID Wifi ABD) 9) Your phone get\'s detected and get\'s connected over wifi/hotspot , and hence now you may disconnect the usb . This is a one time process , hence you may not need to keep phone connected over usb .This will save your phone from irregular charges and also , a remedy for short length usb cables . I wrote a shell script which can let you debug an Android device via Wi-Fi.Here is the code:For Windows:Step 1. Make a batch file with the below commands and call the file w.bat.Step 2. Copy the below contents in w.bat, and save it in any of the folders which are in %path% of your Windows system//<-- Till here -->Step 3. Connect your phone and PC with a cableStep 4. Ensure the phone is in Wi-Fi modeStep 5. Remove the cable when the batch file tells you toStep 6. Type w.bat on the Windows prompt (start -> run -> type CMD, press Enter) (black screen is Windows DOS prompt), if you copied it in one of the path folders then you can run from anywhere, else run from the folder where you created this file.The output of the batch file will be something like this:Note 1: Find this in the output, (ignore all ->unable to connect<- errors)If you see this in the result, just remove the cable from PC and go to Eclipse and run to install the app on the device; that should be it.Note 2: DISCONNECT OR TO SWITCH WIRELESS MODE OFF: Type the below command. It should say restarting in USB mode - at this stage PC and computer should NOT be connected with a cable:Note 3: Steps to find the IP address of the phone (taken from StackÂ Overflow)Find IP address of MY PHONE:Note 4: My Phone Wi-Fi connection IP address range typically is as the mentioned IP addresses below,192.168.1.1192.168.1.2192.168.1.3192.168.1.4192.168.1.5192.168.1.6Note 5: if you get any other sequence of IP addresses which keep getting reassigned to your phone, you can just change the IP address in the w.bat file.Note 6: This is a brute-force method, which eliminates all manual labor to keep finding IP address and connecting to Eclipse / Wi-Fi.SUCCESS Note 7: So in short, the regular activity would be something like this:The best way is using ADBConnect (Eclipse plugin) and ADB Wireless (app for Android device).For Ubuntu / Linux:One imp point probably missed here - once you do a adb remount - the TCP connection is lost hence you have to do a adb connect IP:port once over againConnect the device via USB and make sure debugging is working. these steps are taken if you already have installed adb and set it\'s path in environment varialbeRadu Simionescu\'s answer worked for me. Thank you. For those who are unable to see the ip address of their android device, go to \nSettings > Wireless > Wi-Fi\nand then long press the wifi which you are connected to. Then select Modify network config check on Show Advance Options and the scroll to IP address section.After installing adb in your system, do run\nkilladd adb and adb start-server\nto refresh adb. Sometimes we could get issues like hereI use adb shell ip -f inet addr show wlan0 to find the device ip after adb tcpip 5555.Newer version deprecated adb netcfg. Thus this is the correct way to find the ip of the device when the interface name is wlan0 (default interface name).That is too much simple...Step 1:Step 2:Step 3:Device IP address: Setting -> About phone -> Status -> IP address
