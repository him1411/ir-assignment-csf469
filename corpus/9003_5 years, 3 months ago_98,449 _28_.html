I\'m the owner of an organization on github and just created a repo and tried pushing but I\'m running into an issue where it\'s asking me for my username even though I can SSH just fine:What am I doing wrong? This has never happened to me before but I recently also upgraded to git 1.7.10.3.Don\'t use HTTP use SSH insteadchange to you can do it in .git/config fileI had this same issue and wondered why it didn\'t happen with a bitbucket repo that was cloned with https. Looking into it a bit I found that the config for the BB repo had a URL that included my username.  So I manually edited the config for my GH repo like so and voila, no more username prompt. I\'m on Windows.Edit your_repo_dir/.git/config (remember: .git folder is hidden)Change:to:Save the file. Do a git pull to test it.The proper way to do this is probably by using git bash commands to edit the setting, but editing the file directly didn\'t seem to be a problem.Here is an official answer to this:If Git prompts you for a username and password every time you try to interact with GitHub, you\'re probably using the HTTPS clone URL for your repository.Using an HTTPS remote URL has some advantages: it\'s easier to set up than SSH, and usually works through strict firewalls and proxies. However, it also prompts you to enter your GitHub credentials every time you pull or push a repository.You can configure Git to store your password for you. If you\'d like to set that up, read all about setting up password caching.an additional note: if you have already added a remote ($git remote add origin ... ) and need to change that particular remote then do a remote remove first ($ git remote rm origin), before re-adding the new and improved repo URL (where "origin" was the name for the remote repo).so to use the original example :I\'ve just had an email from a github.com admin stating the following: "We normally advise people to use the HTTPS URL unless they have a specific reason to be using the SSH protocol. HTTPS is secure and easier to set up, so we default to that when a new repository is created."The password prompt does indeed accept the normal github.com login details.  A tutorial on how to set up password caching can be found at https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#password-caching .  I followed the steps in the tutorial, and it worked for me.Because you are using HTTPS way.HTTPS requires that you type your account access every time you try to push or pull,but there is one way too, called SSH, and it lets you to tell git, that I give you permission with my account for this pc, and never ask me again about any user access. To use it, you have to generate SSH key and add it into your Github\'s account just one time.To do that, you can follow these steps How To Generate SSH key for GithubImproving upon @Ianl\'s answer,If you want to disable the prompts for both the username and password then you can set the URL as follows -Note that the URL has both the username and password. Also the .git/config file should show your current settings.If you\'re using HTTPS, check to make sure that your URL is correct. For example:If you\'ve enabled two factor authentication, then you\'ll need to generate a personal access token and use that instead of your regular password.
