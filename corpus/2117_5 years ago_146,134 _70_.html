The new iPhone 5 display has a new aspect ratio and a new resolution (640 x 1136 pixels).What is required to develop new or transition already existing applications to the new screen size?What should we keep in mind to make applications "universal" for both the older displays and the new widescreen aspect ratio?If you have an app built for iPhone 4S or earlier, it\'ll run letterboxed on iPhone 5.To adapt your app to the new taller screen, the first thing you do is to change the launch image to: Default-568h@2x.png. Its size should be 1136x640 (HxW). Yep, having the default image in the new screen size is the key to let your app take the whole of new iPhone 5\'s screen. (Note that the naming convention works only for the default image. Naming another image "Image-568h@2x.png" will not cause it to be loaded in place of "Image@2x.png". If you need to load different images for different screen sizes, you\'ll have to do it programmatically.)If you\'re very very lucky, that might be it... but in all likelihood, you\'ll have to take a few more steps.In the extreme case (when none of the above suffices), design the two Xibs and load the appropriate one in the view controller. To detect screen size:The only really required thing to do is to add a launch image named "Default-568h@2x.png" to the app resources, and in general case (if you\'re lucky enough) the app will work correctly.  In case the app does not handle touch events, then make sure that the key window has the proper size. The workaround is to set the proper frame:There are other issues not related to screen size when migrating to iOS 6. Read iOS 6.0 Release Notes for details.Sometimes (for pre-storyboard apps), if the layout is going to be sufficiently different, it\'s worth specifying a different xib according to device (see this question - you\'ll need to modify the code to deal with iPhone 5) in the viewController init, as no amount of twiddling with autoresizing masks will work if you need different graphics.This is useful for apps which are targeting older iOS versions.Here you can find a nice tutorial (for MonoTouch, but you can use the information for Non-MonoTouch-projects, too):\nhttp://redth.info/get-your-monotouch-apps-ready-for-iphone-5-ios-6-today/Create a new image for your splash/default screen (640 x 1136 pixel) with the name "Default-568h@2x.png"  In the iOS Simulator, go to the Hardware -> Device menu, and select "iPhone (Retina 4-inch)"Create other images, e.g. background imagesIt\'s easy for migrating iPhone5 and iPhone4 through XIBs.........I solve this problem here. Just add ~568h@2x suffix to images and ~568h to xib\'s. No needs more runtime checks or code changes.I had added the new default launch image and (in checking out several other SE answers...) made sure my storyboards all auto-sized themselves and subviews but the retina 4 inch still letterboxed.Then I noticed that my info plist had a line item for "Launch image" set to "Default.png", which I thusly removed and magically letterboxing no longer appeared.  Hopefully that saves someone else the same craziness I endured.I guess, it is not going to work in all cases, but in my particular project it avoided me from duplication of NIB-files:Somewhere in common.h you can make these defines based off of screen height:In your base controller:In a constants.h file you can add these define statements:To determine if your app can support iPhone 5 Retina use this:\n(This could be more robust to return the type of display, 4S Retina, etc., but as it is written below, it just returns if the iPhone supports iOS5 Retina as a YES or NO)In a common ".h" file add:In a common ".m" file add:First of all create two xibs and attach all delegates,main class to the xib and then u can put in this condition mentioned below in your appdelegate.m file in  you can use it any where in the program depending upon your requirements even in your ViewController classes. What matters the most is that you have created two xib files separate for iphone 4(320*480) and iphone 5(320*568)Try the below method in a singleton class: You can use the Auto Layout feature and create the design using iPhone 5 screen resolution and it will work for the both 4" and 3.5" devices, but in this case you should have a enough knowledge of layout manager.Checking bounds with 568 will fail in landscape mode. iPhone 5 launches only in portrait mode but if you want to support rotations then the iPhone 5 "check" will need to handle this scenario as well.Here\'s a macro which handles orientation state:The use of the \'preferredMode\' call is from another posting I read a few hours ago so I did not come up with this idea.First show this image. In that image you show warning for Retina 4 support so click on this warning and click on add so your Retina 4 splash screen automatically add in your project.and after you use this code :I never faced such an issue with any device as I\'ve had one codebase for all, without any hardcoded values. What I do is to have the maximum sized image as resource instead of one for each device. For example, I would have one for retina display and show it as aspect fit so it will be views as is on every device. \nComing to deciding the frame of button, for instance, at run time. For this I use the % value of the patent view, example , if I want the width to be half of parent view take 50 % of parent and same applies for height and center. With this I don\'t even need the xibs.You can use this define to calculate if you are using the iPhone 5 based on screen size:then use a simple if statement :Peter, you should really take a look at Canappi, it does all that for you, all you have to do is specify the layout as such:From there Canappi will generate the correct objective-c code that detects the device the app is running on and will use:Canappi works like Interface Builder and Story Board combined, except that it is in a textual form. If you already have XIB files, you can convert them so you don\'t have to recreate the entire UI from scratch.You can manually check the screen size to determine which device you\'re on:You could add this code:This is a real universal code, you can create 3 different story board:Set your project Universal mode, and set your main story iPhone with the iPhone5 storyboard and the ipad main with iPad target storyboard, now add new storyboard target for iphone and modify the resolution for iphone 4s or less now implement your AppDelegate.miPhone4/4s (is the same for 3/3Gs) one for iPhone5 and make the project universal, with a new Storyboard target for iPad, now in to AppDelegate.m under the didFinishLaunching add this code:So you have created a Universal app for iPhone 3/3Gs/4/4s/5 All gen of iPod, and All type of iPadRemember to integrate all IMG with myImage.png and myImage@2x.pngAccording to me the best way of dealing with such problems and avoiding couple of condition required for checking the the height of device, is using the relative frame for views or any UI element which you are adding to you view for example: if you are adding some UI element which you want should at the bottom of view or just above tab bar then you should take the y origin with respect to your view\'s height or with respect to tab bar (if present) and we have auto resizing property as well. I hope this will work for youRather than using a set of conditionals you can resize your view automatically using the screen size. In my case I want a view that fills the space between some input fields at the top and some buttons at the bottom, so fixed top left corner and variable bottom right based on screen size. My app fills the image view with the photo taken by the camera so I want all the space I can get.If you need to convert an already existing app to universal, you need to select corresponding xib file->show Utilities-> Show Size inspector.In Size inspector you can see Autosizing, by using this tool you can convert to existing iOS App.Using xCode 5, select "Migrate to Asset Catalog" on Project>General.Then use "Show in finder" to find your launch image, you can dummy-edit it to be 640x1136, then drag it into the asset catalog as shown in the image below.Make sure that both iOS7 and iOS6  R4 section has an image that is 640x1136. Next time you launch the app, the black bars will disappear, and your app will use 4 inch screenPoint worth notice - in new Xcode you have to add this image file Default-568h@2x.png to assetsUse the Auto Layout feature for views. It will adjust automatically to all resolutions.Create two xibs for a controller having controller name with suffix either ~iphone or ~ipad. At compile time, Xcode will take the right xib based on the device. Use size classes, if you want to create a single xib for both iPhone and iPad, if the view is simple enough to port to iPhone and iPad.There is a slight problem when testing on both iOS device and iOS Simulator. It appears that simulator (XCode 6.0.1) gives switched values for width and height in [[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds].size depending on a device orientation.So this might be a problem when determinating the right physical screen size. This code helps also to distinct all 2014. iPhone model generations:It can also be easily changed to make the distinction between e.g. iPhone6 from iPhone6+.I would suggest to use Autoresizing Mask in your applications according to your UI interface, it saves a lot of trouble and is better than making different UI for iPhone 4 and 5 screens.
