What is the default access modifier for classes, methods, members, constructors, delegates and interfaces?The default access for everything in C# is "the most restricted access you could declare for that member".So for example:is equivalent toThe one sort of exception to this is making one part of a property (usually the setter) more restricted than the declared accessibility of the property itself:This is what the C# 3.0 specification has to say (section 3.5.1):Depending on the context in which a\n  member declaration takes place, only\n  certain types of declared\n  accessibility are permitted.\n  Furthermore, when a member declaration\n  does not include any access modifiers,\n  the context in which the declaration\n  takes place determines the default\n  declared accessibility.(Note that nested types would come under the "class members" or "struct members" parts - and therefore default to private visibility.)Short answer: minimum possible access (cf Jon Skeet\'s answer).Long answer:Non-nested types, enumeration and delegate accessibilities (may only have internal or public accessibility)Nested type and member accessiblities\xc2\xb9 All === public, protected, internal, private, protected internal\xc2\xb2 structs cannot inherit from structs or classes (although they can, interfaces), hence protected is not a valid modifierThe accessibility of a nested type depends on its accessibility domain, which is determined by both the declared accessibility of the member and the accessibility domain of the immediately containing type. However, the accessibility domain of a nested type cannot exceed that of the containing type.Note: CIL also has the provision for protected and internal (as opposed to the existing protected "or" internal), but to my knowledge this is not currently available for use in C#.See:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ba0a1yw2.aspx\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173121.aspx\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cx03xt0t.aspx\n(Man I love Microsoft URIs...)Have a look at Access Modifiers (C# Programming Guide)Class and Struct Accessibility\n  Internal is the default if no access\n  modifier is specified.Class and Struct Member Accessibility\n  Class members\n  (including nested classes and structs)\n  can be declared with any of the five\n  types of access. Struct members cannot\n  be declared as protected because\n  structs do not support inheritance.The accessibility of a member can\n  never be greater than the\n  accessibility of its containing typeUser-defined operators must always be\n  declared as public. For more\n  information, see operator (C#\n  Reference).Destructors cannot have accessibility\n  modifiers.Other Types\n  Interfaces declared directly with a namespace can be\n  declared as public or internal and\n  like classes and structs, interfaces\n  default to internal access.Enumeration members are always public,\n  and no access modifiers can be\n  applied.By default, delegates have internal\n  access.Internal is the default modifierI would like to add some documentation link.
