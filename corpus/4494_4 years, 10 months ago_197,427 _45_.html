I have the following DataFrame (df):I add more column(s) by assignment:How can I move the column mean to the front, i.e. set it as first column leaving the order of the other columns untouched?One easy way would be to reassign the dataframe with a list of the columns, rearranged as needed. This is what you have now: Rearrange cols in any way you want. This is how I moved the last element to the first position: Then reorder the dataframe like this: You could also do something like this:You can get the list of columns with:The output will produce:...which is then easy to rearrange manually before dropping it into the first functionJust assign the column names in the order you want them, to <dataframe>.columns like below:Now, \'mean\' column comes out in the front:How about:http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/dsintro.html#column-selection-addition-deletionIn your case,will do exactly what you what.In my case (general form):You need to create a new list of your columns in the desired order, then use df = df[cols] to rearrange the columns in this new order.You can also use a more general approach.  In this example, the last column (indicated by -1) is inserted as the first column.You can also use this approach for reordering columns in a desired order if they are present in the DataFrame.Simply do,This function takes two arguments, the first is the dataset, the second are the columns in the data set that you want to bring to the front. So in my case I have a data set called Frame with variables A1, A2, B1, B2, Total and Date. If I want to bring Total to the front then all I have to do is: If I want to bring Total and Date to the front then I do:EDIT:Another useful way to use this is, if you have an unfamiliar table and you\'re looking with variables with a particular term in them, like VAR1, VAR2,... you may execute something like: I ran into a similar question myself, and just wanted to add what I settled on. I liked the reindex_axis( ) method for changing column order. This worked:df = df.reindex_axis([\'mean\'] + list(df.columns[:-1]), axis=1)You could do the following (borrowing parts from Aman\'s answer):This question has been answered before:How about using "T"?Just type the column name you want to change, and set the index for the new location.For your case, this would be like:I tried the insert() function as suggested by Wes McKinney.df.insert(0, \'mean\', df.mean(1))This got the result that Timmie wanted, in one line, without the need to move that last column.I believe @Aman\'s answer is the best if you know the location of the other column.If you don\'t know the location of mean, but only have its name, you  cannot resort directly to cols = cols[-1:] + cols[:-1]. Following is the next-best thing I could come up with:DataFrame.sort_index(axis=1) is quite clean.Check doc here.\nAnd then concat @clocker: Your solution was very helpful for me, as I wanted to bring two columns in front from a dataframe where I do not know exactly the names of all columns, because they are generated from a pivot statement before.\nSo, if you are in the same situation: To bring columns in front that you know the name of and then let them follow by "all the other columns", I came up with the following general solution;The simplest way would be to change the order of the column names like thisdf = df[[\'mean\', Col1,Col2,Col3]]set():A simple approach is using set(), in particular when you have a long list of columns and do not want to handle them manually:
