I\'m making a new project that uses bower from twitter. I created a component.json to maintain all my dependency like jquery. Then I run bower install that installs everything in a folder named components. But I need to install the components in a different folder, e.g. public/components.I have tried editing my components.json into:or:as shown in https://github.com/twitter/bower/pull/94 but it doesn\'t work.Create a Bower configuration file .bowerrc in the project root (as opposed to your home directory) with the content:Run bower install again.In addition to editing .bowerrc to setup your default install path, you can also setup custom install paths for different file types.There is a node package called bower-installer that provides a single command for managing alternate install paths.run npm install -g bower-installerSet up your bower.jsonRun the following command: bower-installerThis will install components/jquery-ui/themes/start/jquery-ui.css to ./src/css, etcI had the same issue on my windows 10. This is what fixed my problemYou should see bower_components folder in your public folder nowAs noted above by other contributors, using a .bowerrc file with the JSON { "directory": "some/path" }is necessary -- HOWEVER, you may run into an issue on Windows while creating that file. If Windows gives you a message imploring you to add a "file name", simply use a text editor / IDE such as Notepad++.Add the JSON to an unnamed file, save it as .bowerrc -- you\'re good to go!Probably an easy assumption, but I hope this save others the unnecessary headache :)Try putting the components.json file in the public directory of your application, rather than the root directory, then re-run bower install ...try this in your app home directory:Hi i am same problem and resolve this ways.windows user and vs cant\'create .bowerrc file.in cmd go any folder install any packages which is contains .bowerrc file forexamplethis plugin contains .bowerrc file. copy that and go to your project and paste this file.and in visual studio - solution explorer - show all files and include project \nseen .bowerrc filei resolve this ways :)Delete components folder from your root.Create a (.bowerrc) file in the root ( this is a hidden file if linux)In this file (.bowerrc) write the following code{\n"directory": "public/components"\n}Run command: bower installYou should see components folder in your public folder now
