I\'d like to load an image from a URL in my application, so I first tried with Objective-C and it worked, however, with Swift, I\'ve a compilation error: \'imageWithData\' is unavailable: use object construction \'UIImage(data:)\'My function: In Objective-C: Can someone please explain me why the imageWithData: doesn\'t work with Swift, and how can I solve the problem. Xcode 8 \xe2\x80\xa2 Swift 3Synchronously: Asynchronously: Create a method with a completion handler to get the image data from your urlCreate a method to download the image (start the task)Usage:Extension:Usage: (Swift 3 update)\nSwift changed a little since the first answers. The simplest way:EDIT:If you want to make the code run async, you can easily achieve this with GCD:If you just want to load image (Asynchronously!) - just add this small extension to your swift code:And use it this way:Swift 2.2 || Xcode 7.3I got Amazing results!! with AlamofireImage swift libraryIt provides multiple features like:and very easy to implement for your appStep.1 Install podsAlamofire 3.3.xpod \'Alamofire\'AlamofireImage 2.4.xpod \'AlamofireImage\'Step.2 import and Usethat\'s it!! it will take care everythingGreat thanks to Alamofire guys, for making iDevelopers life easy ;)Xcode 8 \xe2\x80\xa2 Swift 3Leo Dabus\'s answer is awesome! I just wanted to provide an all-in-one function solution:I wrapped the code of the best answers to the question into a single, reusable class extending UIImageView, so you can directly use asynchronous loading UIImageViews in your storyboard (or create them from code).Here is my class:and here is how to use it:FYI : For swift-2.0 Xcode7.0 beta2You\xe2\x80\x99ll want to do:In Swift, they\xe2\x80\x99ve replaced most Objective C factory methods with regular constructors.See:https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/InteractingWithObjective-CAPIs.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014216-CH4-XID_26Swift 2 with error Handle and custom request headerSimply add extension to UIImageView: And then, use the new imageFromUrl(urlString: String) to download imageUsage:Swift 2.0 : 1)OR 2) Add this method to VC or Extension.Usage :A method for getting the image that is safe and works with Swift 2.0 and X-Code 7.1:You would then call this method like so: If you are updating the view with the image, you will have to use this after the "if success {":The reason this last part is needed if you are using the image in the UI is because network calls take time. If you try to update the UI using the image without calling dispatch_async like above, the computer will look for the image while the image is still being fetched, find that there is no image (yet), and move on as if there was no image found. Putting your code inside of a dispatch_async completion closure says to the computer, "Go, get this image and when you are done, then complete this code." That way, you will have the image when the code is called and things will work well.  If you are looking for a very very simple implementation. (This worked for me in Swift 2)I implemented within a tableview with a custom cell that has only a imageSwift 3This method will download an image from a website asynchronously and cache it:In use:The only things there is missing is a !swift 3 with error handlingUse this code in SwiftSwift 2.x answer that downloads image to file (as opposed to Leo Dabus\'s answer, which stores the image in memory). Based on Leo Dabus\'s answer and Rob\'s answer from Get the data from NSURLSession DownloadTaskWithRequest from completion handler:For Swift-3 and above:
