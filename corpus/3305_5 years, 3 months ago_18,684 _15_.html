I have created a JS class to populate SG/Folder list view data, when items are modified. (As per Jaime\'s approach)\nEverything works great when I operate on items in the publication they\'re created in.Ex: I open a component or page and the custom locked by column immediately updates and shows my user name.However, when I go to a child publication and repeat that process, I get the window asking if I want to localize or edit the parent item. If I select to edit the parent window, the code doesn\'t work. I haven\'t quite figured it out yet with initial debugging. Chrome seems to swallow the error, Firefox gives me a cryptic:Timestamp: 6/22/2012 3:42:54 PMError: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004002\n   (NS_NOINTERFACE) [nsIWebProgress.DOMWindow]"  nsresult: "0x80004002 (NS_NOINTERFACE)" \n   location: "JS frame :: chrome://browser/content/tabbrowser.xml ::  :: line 545" \n   data: no]Does anyone have any initial ideas? I\'ll try to post some code later on...Code from PageEx.js:Code from utils.js:[Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004002\n  (NS_NOINTERFACE) [nsIWebProgress.DOMWindow]"This means that there was no window assigned to the nsIWebProgress object.  So it has nowhere to display data.nsresult: "0x80004002 (NS_NOINTERFACE)" location: "JS frame ::\n  chrome://browser/content/tabbrowser.xml :: :: line 545" data: no]This is telling you what file is associated with that error.  and what line it faulted on.But the real key is the NS_NOINTERFACE error.  Which means the interface has not been registered.You are using Type.enableInterface().  Is that a custom method you are declaring somewhere else ?   I don\'t see it.   You might want to change that to .registerInterface()See this link Type Class  and  Type.registerInterface()
