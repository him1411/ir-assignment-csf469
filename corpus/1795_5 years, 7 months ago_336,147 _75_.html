Is it possible to have one controller use another?For example:This HTML document simply prints a message delivered by the MessageCtrl controller in the messageCtrl.js file.The controller file contains the following code:Which simply prints the current date;If I were to add another controller, DateCtrl which handed the date in a specific format back to MessageCtrl, how would one go about doing this?  The DI framework seems to be concerned with XmlHttpRequests and accessing services.There are multiple ways how to communicate between controllers.The best one is probably sharing a service:Another way is emitting an event on scope:In both cases, you can communicate with any directive as well.See this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/simpulton/XqDxG/Also watch the following video: Communicating Between ControllersHtml:javascript:Here is a one-page example of two controllers sharing service data: Also here: https://gist.github.com/3595424If you want to call one controller into another there are four methods available1. $rootScope.$emit() and $rootScope.$broadcast()Controller and its scope can get destroyed,\nbut the $rootScope remains across the application, that\'s why we are taking $rootScope because $rootScope is parent of all scopes .If you are performing communication from parent to child and even child wants to communicate with its siblings, you can use $broadcastIf you are performing communication from child to parent ,no siblings invovled then you can use $rootScope.$emitHTMLAngularjs CodeIn above code console of $emit \'childEmit\' will not call inside child siblings  and It will call inside only parent, where $broadcast get called inside siblings and parent as well.This is the place where performance come into a action.$emit is preferrable, if you are using child to parent communication because it skips some dirty checks.2. If Second controller is child, you can use Child Parent communicationIts one of the best method, If you want to do child parent communication where child wants to communicate with immediate parent then it would not need any kind $broadcast or $emit but if you want to do communication from parent to child then you have to use either service or $broadcastFor example HTML:-    AngularjsWhenever you are using child to parent communication, Angularjs will search for a variable inside child, If it is not present inside then it will choose to see the values inside parent controller.3.Use ServicesAngularJS supports the concepts of "Seperation of Concerns" using services architecture. Services are javascript functions and are responsible to do a specific tasks only.This makes them an individual entity which is maintainable and testable.Services used to inject using Dependency Injection mecahnism of Angularjs.Angularjs code:It will give output Hello Child World and Hello Parent World . According to Angular docs of services Singletons \xe2\x80\x93 Each component dependent on a service gets a reference to the single instance generated by the service factory.4.Kind of hack - with the help of angular.element()This method gets scope() from the element by its Id / unique class.angular.element() method returns element and scope() gives $scope variable of another variable using $scope variable of one controller inside another is not a good practice.HTML:-Angularjs:-In above code controllers are showing their own value on Html and when you will click on text you will get values in console accordingly.If you click on parent controllers span, browser will console value of child and viceversa. If you are looking to emit & broadcast events to share data or call functions across controllers, please look at this link: and check the answer by zbynour (answer with max votes). I am quoting his answer !!!If scope of firstCtrl is parent of the secondCtrl scope, your code should work by replacing $emit by $broadcast in firstCtrl:In case there is no parent-child relation between your scopes you can inject $rootScope into the controller and broadcast the event to all child scopes (i.e. also secondCtrl).Finally, when you need to dispatch the event from child controller to scopes upwards you can use $scope.$emit. If scope of firstCtrl is parent of the secondCtrl scope:Two more fiddles: (Non service approach)1) For Parent- Child controller - Using $scope of parent controller to emit/broadcast events.\n     http://jsfiddle.net/laan_sachin/jnj6y/2) Using $rootScope across non-related controllers.\n     http://jsfiddle.net/VxafF/Actually using emit and broadcast is inefficient because the event bubbles up and down the scope hierarchy which can easily degrade into performance bottlement for a complex application.I would suggest using a service. Here is how I recently implemented it in one of my projects - https://gist.github.com/3384419.Basic idea - register a pub-sub/event bus as a service. Then inject that event bus where ever you need to subscribe or publish events/topics.I also know of this way.But I don\'t use it too much, because I don\'t like to use jQuery selectors in angular code.I don\'t know if this is out of standards but if you have all of your controllers on the same file, then you can do something like this:As you can see indicatorsCtrl is calling the updateChart funcions of the other both controllers when calling updateCharts.There is a method not dependent on services, $broadcast or $emit. It\'s not suitable in all cases, but if you have 2 related controllers that can be abstracted into directives, then you can use the require option in the directive definition. This is most likely how ngModel and ngForm communicate. You can use this to communicate between directive controllers that are either nested, or on the same element.For a parent/child situation, the use would be as follows:And the main points to get it working: On the parent directive, with the methods to be called, you should define them on this (not on $scope):On the child directive definition, you can use the require option so the parent controller is passed to the link function (so you can then call functions on it from the scope of the child directive.The above can be seen at http://plnkr.co/edit/poeq460VmQER8Gl9w8Oz?p=previewA sibling directive is used similarly, but both directives on the same element:Used by creating a method on directive1:And in directive2 this can be called by using the require option which results in the siblingController being passed to the link function:This can be seen at http://plnkr.co/edit/MUD2snf9zvadfnDXq85w?p=preview .The uses of this?Parent: Any case where child elements need to "register" themselves with a parent. Much like the relationship between ngModel and ngForm. These can add certain behaviour that can affects models. You might have something purely DOM based as well, where a parent element needs to manage the positions of certain children, say to manage or react to scrolling.Sibling: allowing a directive to have its behaviour modified. ngModel is the classic case, to add parsers / validation to ngModel use on inputs.Following is a publish-subscribe approach that is irrespective of Angular JS.Search Param ControllerSearch Choices ControllerEvent ManagerGlobalYou can inject \'$controller\' service in your parent controller(MessageCtrl) and then instantiate/inject the child controller(DateCtrl) using:\n$scope.childController = $controller(\'childController\', { $scope: $scope.$new() });Now you can access data from your child controller by calling its methods as it is a service.\nLet me know if any issue.In angular 1.5 this can be accomplished by doing the following:This is the parent component. In this I have created a function that pushes another object into my productForms array - note - this is just my example, this function can be anything really. Now we can create another component that will make use of require:Here the child component is creating a reference to the parents component function addNewForm which can then be bound to the HTML and called like any other function.
