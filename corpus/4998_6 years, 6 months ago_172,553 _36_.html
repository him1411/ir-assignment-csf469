I have an html input.The input has padding: 5px 10px; I want it to be 100% of the parent div\'s width(which is fluid).However using width: 100%; causes the input to be 100% + 20px how can I get around this?ExampleRead the other answers here, or read this answer: Content of div is longer then div itself when width is set to 100%?box-sizing: border-box is a\n  quick, easy way to fix it:This will work in all modern\n  browsers, and IE8+.Here\'s a demo: http://jsfiddle.net/thirtydot/QkmSk/301/If you need this to work in IE7, you can read an old revision of this answer.This is why we have box-sizing in CSS.I\xe2\x80\x99ve edited your example, and now it works in Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and Opera.

You can put the input in a div with position: relative and a fixed height, then on the input have position: absolute; left: 0; right: 0;, and any padding you like.Here is the recommendation from codeontrack.com, which has good solution examples:Instead of setting the width of the div to 100%, set it to auto, and be sure, that the <div> is set to display: block (default for <div>).Move the input box\' padding to a wrapper element.See example here: http://jsfiddle.net/L7wYD/1/Just understand the difference between width:auto; and width:100%;\nWidth:auto; will (AUTO)MATICALLY calculate the width in order to fit the exact given with of the wrapping div including the padding.\nWidth 100% expands the width and adds the padding.What about wrapping it in a container.
