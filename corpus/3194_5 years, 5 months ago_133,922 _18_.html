I am currently writing some client side JavaScript code and wondering how to comment my functions.I come from a C# background, where there is an officially recommended commenting style documented by Microsoft which I follow, which allows the compiler and other tools to auto-generate documentation.Similarly, PHP\'s PHPDoc style is ubiquitous and on its way to becoming an official standard recommended by PHP-FIG.Does JavaScript similarly have a universally accepted tool-chain, standard, or set of best practices that I can apply when commenting my functions?You can use jsdoc style which will let you generate documentation later like soEDIT: If you are using AngularJS, then you can refer http://google.github.io/styleguide/angularjs-google-style.htmlWell, there are many ways to add a comments in javascript; Here is my recommendation / best practices.using // is better than /* */ because then you can use the latter to take out an entire block containing other comments. However, if you want to use an automatic documentation generation tool, you must use comments similar to javaDoc style.This is an example that would work with YUI DOC (best one) http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuidoc/#startOther params Examples: - http://usejsdoc.org/tags-param.htmlHoping this will help you :)The standard I\'m used to is JSDoc:\nhttps://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdocIt\'s styled similar to javadoc if you\'re familiar with that.Please note - the above answers suggesting JSDoc style give you a big advantage - you can generate documents from them.  That\'s extremely valuable, especially as your project scales up.  If you\'re not interested in JSDoc, or you\'re looking for general advice on comments, please read on.If you already have a documentation method that works for you, stick with it.  If you like large comment blocks at the beginning of functions that explain everything in advance, great.  If you like to insert targeted comments on specific lines, stick with that instead.Another thing to consider is culture - if this is a work project, be sure that code documentation is in line with what\'s produced by your team.  Just as important, be sure your code is in line with team standards, too.Final thought - be consistent.  A set of rules for how you document, even if it\'s just for you, will make your comments easier to read, write, and understand later.  You\'ll know where to look for them and what they will tell you.
