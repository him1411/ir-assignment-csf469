I\'m new to Python and am just trying to understand how its packages work.  Presumably "eggs" are some sort of packaging mechanism, but what would be a quick overview of what role they play and maybe some information on why they\'re useful and how to create them?Same concept as a .jar file in Java, it is a .zip file with some metadata files renamed .egg, for distributing code as bundles.Specifically: The Internal Structure of Python EggsA "Python egg" is a logical structure embodying the release of a\n  specific version of a Python project, comprising its code, resources,\n  and metadata. There are multiple formats that can be used to\n  physically encode a Python egg, and others can be developed. However,\n  a key principle of Python eggs is that they should be discoverable and\n  importable. That is, it should be possible for a Python application to\n  easily and efficiently find out what eggs are present on a system, and\n  to ensure that the desired eggs\' contents are importable.The .egg format is well-suited to distribution and the easy\n  uninstallation or upgrades of code, since the project is essentially\n  self-contained within a single directory or file, unmingled with any\n  other projects\' code or resources.  It also makes it possible to have\n  multiple versions of a project simultaneously installed, such that\n  individual programs can select the versions they wish to use.Note: Egg packaging has been superseded by Wheel packaging.The .egg file is a distribution format for Python packages. It\xe2\x80\x99s just an alternative to a source code distribution or Windows exe. But note that for pure Python, the .egg file is completely cross-platform.The .egg file itself is essentially a .zip file. If you change the extension to \xe2\x80\x9czip\xe2\x80\x9d, you can see that it will have folders inside the archive.Also, if you have an .egg file, you can install it as a package using easy_installExample:\nTo create an .egg file for a directory say mymath which itself may have several python scripts, do the following step:Then, from the terminal do:This will generate lot of outputs, but when it\xe2\x80\x99s completed you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that you have three new folders: build, dist, and mymath.egg-info. The only folder that we care about is the dist folder where you\'ll find your .egg file, mymath-0.1-py3.5.egg with your default python (installation) version number(mine here: 3.5)Source: Python library blog
