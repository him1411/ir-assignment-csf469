I have a log file being written by another process which I want to watch for changes. Each time a change occurs I\'d like to read the new data in to do some processing on it.What\'s the best way to do this? I was hoping there\'d be some sort of hook from the PyWin32 library. I\'ve found the win32file.FindNextChangeNotification function but have no idea how to ask it to watch a specific file.If anyone\'s done anything like this I\'d be really grateful to hear how...[Edit] I should have mentioned that I was after a solution that doesn\'t require polling.[Edit] Curses! It seems this doesn\'t work over a mapped network drive. I\'m guessing windows doesn\'t \'hear\' any updates to the file the way it does on a local disk.Have you already looked at the documentation available on http://timgolden.me.uk/python/win32_how_do_i/watch_directory_for_changes.html? If you only need it to work under Windows the 2nd example seems to be exactly what you want (if you exchange the path of the directory with the one of the file you want to watch). Otherwise, polling will probably be the only really platform-independent option.Note: I haven\'t tried any of these solutions.Did you try using Watchdog?Python API library and shell utilities to monitor file system events.Get started quickly with a simple example in Quickstart...If polling is good enough for you, I\'d just watch if the "modified time" file stat changes.  To read it:(Also note that the Windows native change event solution does not work in all circumstances, e.g. on network drives.)If you want a multiplatform solution, then check QFileSystemWatcher.\nHere an example code (not sanitized):It should not work on windows (maybe with cygwin ?), but for unix user, you should use the "fcntl" system call. Here is an example in Python. It\'s mostly the same code if you need to write it in C (same function names)Check out pyinotify.inotify replaces dnotify (from an earlier answer) in newer linuxes and allows file-level rather than directory-level monitoring.Well after a bit of hacking of Tim Golden\'s script, I have the following which seems to work quite well:It could probably do with a load more error checking, but for simply watching a log file and doing some processing on it before spitting it out to the screen, this works well.Thanks everyone for your input - great stuff!Check my answer to a similar question. You could try the same loop in Python. This page suggests:Also see the question tail() a file with Python.Well, since you are using Python, you can just open a file and keep reading lines from it.If the line read is not empty, you process it.You may be missing that it is ok to keep calling readline at the EOF. It will just keep returning an empty string in this case. And when something is appended to the log file, the reading will continue from where it stopped, as you need.If you are looking for a solution that uses events, or a particular library, please specify this in your question. Otherwise, I think this solution is just fine.Simplest solution for me is using watchdog\'s tool watchmedoFrom https://pypi.python.org/pypi/watchdog I now have a process that looks up the sql files in a directory and executes them if necessary. Here is a simplified version of Kender\'s code that appears to do the same trick and does not import the entire file:This is another modification of Tim Goldan\'s script that runs on linux and adds a simple watcher for file modification by using a dict (file=>time).usage: whateverName.py path_to_dir_to_watchAs you can see in Tim Golden\'s article, pointed by Horst Gutmann, WIN32 is relatively complex and watches directories, not a single file.I\'d like to suggest you look into IronPython, which is a .NET python implementation.\nWith IronPython you can use all the .NET functionality - includingWhich handles single files with a simple Event interface.This is an example of checking a file for changes. One that may not be the best way of doing it, but it sure is a short way.Handy tool for restarting application when changes have been made to the source. I made this when playing with pygame so I can see effects take place immediately after file save.When used in pygame make sure the stuff in the \'while\' loop is placed in your game loop aka update or whatever. Otherwise your application will get stuck in an infinite loop and you will not see your game updating.In case you wanted the restart code which I found on the web. Here it is. (Not relevant to the question, though it could come in handy)Have fun making electrons do what you want them to do.Here\'s an example geared toward watching input files that write no more than one line per second but usually a lot less.  The goal is to append the last line (most recent write) to the specified output file.  I\'ve copied this from one of my projects and just deleted all the irrelevant lines.  You\'ll have to fill in or change the missing symbols. Of course, the encompassing QMainWindow class is not strictly required, ie. you can use QFileSystemWatcher alone. I don\'t know any Windows specific function. You could try getting the MD5 hash of the file every second/minute/hour (depends on how fast you need it) and compare it to the last hash. When it differs you know the file has been changed and you read out the newest lines.I\'d try something like this.The loop checks if there is a new line(s) since last time file was read - if there is, it\'s read and passed to the functionThatAnalisesTheLine function. If not, script waits 1 second and retries the process.
