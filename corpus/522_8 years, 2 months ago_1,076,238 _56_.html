I\'ve a <button> on the page, when this button is pressed a hidden <div> is shown using jQuery.How do I scroll to the top of the page using a JavaScript/jQuery command in that function? It is desirable even if the scroll bar instantly jumps to the top. I\'m not looking for a smooth scrolling.If you don\'t need the change to animate then you don\'t need to use any special plugins - I\'d just use the native JavaScript window.scrollTo method -- passing in 0,0 will scroll the page to the top left instantly.Parameters    If you do want smooth scrolling, try something like this:That will take any <a> tag whose href="#top" and make it smooth scroll to the top.Try this to scroll on topYou don\'t need jQuery to do this. A standard HTML  tag will suffice...All of these suggestions work great for various situations. For those who find this page through a search, one can also give this a try. JQuery, no plug-in, scroll to element.in htmlWith window.scrollTo(0, 0); is very fast\nso i tried the Mark Ursino example, but in Chrome nothing happens\nand i found thistested all 3 browsers and it works\ni\'m using blueprint css\nthis is when a client clicks "Book now" button and doesn\'t have the rental period selected, slowly moves to the top where the calendars are and opens a dialog div pointing to the 2  fields, after 3sec it fadesA lot of users recommend selecting both the html and body tags for cross-browser compatibility, like so:This can trip you up though if you\'re counting on your callback running only once. It will in fact run twice because you\'ve selected two elements.If that is a problem for you, you can do something like this:The reason this works is in Chrome $(\'html\').scrollTop() returns 0, but not in other browsers such as Firefox.If you don\'t want to wait for the animation to complete in the case that the scrollbar is already at the top, try this:smooth scroll, pure javascript:The old #top can do the trick Works fine in FF, IE and ChromeReally strange: This question is active for five years now and there is still no vanilla JavaScript answer to animate the scrolling\xe2\x80\xa6 So here you go:If you like, you can wrap this in a function and call that via the onclick attribute. Check this jsfiddleNote: This is a very basic solution and maybe not the most performant one. A very elaborated example can be found here: https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll$(document).scrollTop(0); also works.Try thisNon-jQuery solution / pure JavaScript:Why don\'t you use JQuery inbuilt function scrollTop :Short and simple!Try this code:div => Dom Element where you want to move scroll.time => milliseconds, define the speed of the scroll.You dont need JQuery. Simply you can call the scripton click of the "Go to top" buttonSample demo: output.jsbin.com/fakumo#PS: Don\'t use this approach, when you are using modern libraries like angularjs. That might broke the URL hashbang.You can try using JS as in this Fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/5bNmH/1/Add the "Go to top" button in your page footer:If you don\'t want smooth scrolling, you can cheat and stop the smooth scrolling animation pretty much as soon as you start it... like so:I\'ve no idea whether it\'s recommended/allowed, but it works :)When would you use this? I\'m not sure, but perhaps when you want to use one click to animate one thing with Jquery, but do another without animation? ie open a slide-in admin login panel at the top of the page, and instantly jump to the top to see it.You could simply use a target from your link, such as #someid, where #someid is the div\'s id.Or, you could use any number of scrolling plugins that make this more elegant.http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ScrollTo is an example.Try thisIf you\'d like to scroll to any element with an ID, try this:Active all Browser. Good luckIf you want to do smooth scrolling, please try this:Another solution is JavaScript window.scrollTo method :Parameters :When top scroll is top less than limit bottom and bottom to top scroll Header is Sticky. Below See Fiddle Example.https://jsfiddle.net/memdumusaib/d52xcLm3/For scrolling to the element and element being at the top of the pageYou don\'t need to use any javascript to do this. Just use "#" as the link in a href html code.Funnily enough, most of these did not work for me AT ALL, so I used jQuery-ScrollTo.js with this:And it worked. $(document).scrollTop() was returning 0, and this one actually worked instead.
