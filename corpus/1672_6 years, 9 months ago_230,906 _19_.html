This question already has an answer here:With real examples and their use, can someone please help me understand:The difference between Func and Action is simply whether you want the delegate to return a value (use Func) or not (use Action).Func is probably most commonly used in LINQ - for example in projections:or filtering:or key selection:Action is more commonly used for things like List<T>.ForEach: execute the given action for each item in the list. I use this less often than Func, although I do sometimes use the parameterless version for things like Control.BeginInvoke and Dispatcher.BeginInvoke.Predicate is just a special cased Func<T, bool> really, introduced before all of the Func and most of the Action delegates came along. I suspect that if we\'d already had Func and Action in their various guises, Predicate wouldn\'t have been introduced... although it does impart a certain meaning to the use of the delegate, whereas Func and Action are used for widely disparate purposes.Predicate is mostly used in List<T> for methods like FindAll and RemoveAll.Action is a delegate (pointer) to a method, that takes zero, one or more input parameters, but does not return anything.Func is a delegate (pointer) to a method, that takes zero, one or more input parameters, and returns a value (or reference).Predicate is a special kind of Func often used for comparisons.Though widely used with Linq, Action and Func are concepts logically independent of Linq. C++ already contained the basic concept in form of typed function pointers.Here is a small example for Action and Func without using Linq:Func - When you want a delegate for a function that may or may not take parameters and returns a value. The most common example would be Select from LINQ:Action - When you want a delegate for a function that may or may not take parameters and does not return a value. I use these often for anonymous event handlers:Predicate -  When you want a specialized version of a Func that takes evaluates a value against a set of criteria and returns a boolean result (true for a match, false otherwise). Again, these are used in LINQ quite frequently for things like Where:I just double checked and it turns out that LINQ doesn\'t use Predicates. Not sure why they made that decision...but theoretically it is still a situation where a Predicate would fit.
