I\'m writing a chat program for a local network. I would like be able to identify computers and get the user-set computer name with Python.Use socket and its gethostname() functionality. This will get the hostname of the computer where the Python interpreter is running:Both of these are pretty portable:Any solutions using the HOST or HOSTNAME environment variables are not portable.  Even if it works on your system when you run it, it may not work when run in special environments such as cron.You will probably load the os module anyway, so another suggestion would be:os.getenv(\'HOSTNAME\') and os.environ[\'HOSTNAME\'] don\'t always work. In cron jobs and WSDL, HTTP HOSTNAME isn\'t set. Use this instead:It always (even on Windows) returns a fully qualified host name, even if you defined a short alias in /etc/hosts.If you defined an alias in /etc/hosts then socket.gethostname() will return the alias. platform.uname()[1] does the same thing.I ran into a case where the above didn\'t work. This is what I\'m using now:It first calls gethostname to see if it returns something that looks like a host name, if not it uses my original solution.What about :Actually you may want to have a look to all the result in platform.uname()If I\'m correct, you\'re looking for the socket.gethostname function:socket.gethostname() could doOn some systems, the hostname is set in the environment. If that is the case for you, the os module can pull it out of the environment via os.getenv. For example, if HOSTNAME is the environment variable containing what you want, the following will get it:Update: As noted in the comments, this doesn\'t always work, as not everyone\'s environment is set up this way. I believe that at the time I initially answered this I was using this solution as it was the first thing I\'d found in a web search and it worked for me at the time. Due to the lack of portability I probably wouldn\'t use this now. However, I am leaving this answer for reference purposes. FWIW, it does eliminate the need for other imports if your environment has the system name and you are already importing the os module. Test it - if it doesn\'t work in all the environments in which you expect your program to operate, use one of the other solutions provided.I needed the name of the PC to use in my PyLog conf file, and the socket library is not available, but os library is.For Windows I used: Where defaultValue is a string to prevent None being returned
