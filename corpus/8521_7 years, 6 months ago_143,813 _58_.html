As far as I understood the "static initialization block" is used to set values of static field if it cannot be done in one line. But I do not understand why we need a special block for that. For example we declare a field as static (without a value assignment). And then write several lines of the code which generate and assign a value to the above declared static field.Why do we need this lines in a special block like: static {...}? The non-static block:Gets called every time an instance of the class is constructed. The static block only gets called once, when the class itself is initialized, no matter how many objects of that type you create.Example:This prints:If they weren\'t in a static initialization block, where would they be? How would you declare a variable which was only meant to be local for the purposes of initialization, and distinguish it from a field? For example, how would you want to write:If first and second weren\'t in a block, they\'d look like fields. If they were in a block without static in front of it, that would count as an instance initialization block instead of a static initialization block, so it would be executed once per constructed instance rather than once in total.Now in this particular case, you could use a static method instead:... but that doesn\'t work when there are multiple variables you wish to assign within the same block, or none (e.g. if you just want to log something - or maybe initialize a native library).Here\'s an example:The code in the "static" section(s) will be executed at class load time, before any instances of the class are constructed (and before any static methods are called from elsewhere). That way you can make sure that the class resources are all ready to use.It\'s also possible to have non-static initializer blocks.  Those act like extensions to the set of constructor methods defined for the class. They look just like static initializer blocks, except the keyword "static" is left off.It\'s also useful when you actually don\'t want to assign the value to anything, such as loading some class only once during runtime.E.g.Hey, there\'s another benefit, you can use it to handle exceptions. Imagine that getStuff() here throws an Exception which really belongs in a catch block:then a static initializer is useful here. You can handle the exception there.Another example is to do stuff afterwards which can\'t be done during assigning:To come back to the JDBC driver example, any decent JDBC driver itself also makes use of the static initializer to register itself in the DriverManager. Also see this and this answer.There are a few actual reasons that it is required to exist:People tend to use static {} blocks as a convenient way to initialize things that the class depends on within the runtime as well - such as ensuring that particular class is loaded (e.g., JDBC drivers).  That can be done in other ways; however, the two things that I mention above can only be done with a construct like the static {} block.I would say static block is just syntactic sugar. There is nothing you could do with static block and not with anything else.To re-use some examples posted here.This piece of code could be re-written without using static initialiser.Method #1: With staticMethod #2: Without staticYou can execute bits of code once for a class before an object is constructed in the static blocks.E.g.It is a common misconception to think that a static block has only access to static fields. For this I would like to show below piece of code that I quite often use in real-life projects (copied partially from another answer in a slightly different context):Here the initializer is used to maintain an index (ALIAS_MAP), to map a bunch of aliases back to the original enum type. It is intended as an extension to the built-in valueOf method provided by the Enum itself.As you can see, the static initializer accesses even the private field aliases. What is even more surprising is that the static block already has access to the Enum value instances (e.g. ENGLISH). This is because the order of initialization and execution in the case of Enum types:For more info on this see the book "Effective Java".If your static variables need to be set at runtime then a static {...} block is very helpful.  For example, if you need to set the static member to a value which is stored in a config file or database.Also useful when you want to add values to a static Map member as you can\'t add these values in the initial member declaration.So you have a static field (it\'s also called "class variable" because it belongs to the class rather than to an instance of the class; in other words it\'s associated with the class rather than with any object) and you want to initialize it. So if you do NOT want to create an instance of this class and you want to manipulate this static field, you can do it in three ways:1- Just initialize it when you declare the variable:2- Have a static initializing block:3- Have a class method (static method) that accesses the class variable and initializes it:\nthis is the alternative to the above static block; you can write a private static method:Now why would you use static initializing block instead of static methods?It\'s really up to what you need in your program. But you have to know that static initializing block is called once and the only advantage of the class method is that they can be reused later if you need to reinitialize the class variable.let\'s say you have a complex array in your program. You initialize it (using for loop for example) and then the values in this array will change throughout the program but then at some point you want to reinitialize it (go back to the initial value). In this case you can call the private static method. In case you do not need in your program to reinitialize the values, you can just use the static block and no need for a static method since you\'re not gonna use it later in the program.Note: the static blocks are called in the order they appear in the code. Example 1:Example 2:As supplementary, like @Pointy saidThe code in the "static" section(s) will be executed at class load\n  time, before any instances of the class are constructed (and before\n  any static methods are called from elsewhere).It\'s supposed to add System.loadLibrary("I_am_native_library") into static block.It will guarantee no native method be called before the related library is loaded into memory.According to loadLibrary from oracle:If this method is called more than once with the same library name,\n  the second and subsequent calls are ignored.So quite unexpectedly, putting System.loadLibrary is not used to avoid library be loaded multi-times.You first need to understand that your application classes themselves are instantiated to java.class.Class objects during runtime. This is when your static blocks are ran. So you can actually do this:and it would print "myInt is 1" to console. Note that I haven\'t instantiated any class.static block is used for any technology to initialize  static data member in dynamic way,or we can say for the dynamic initialization of static data member static block is being used..Because for non static data member initialization we have constructor but we do not have any place where we can dynamically initialize static data memberNow my static int x will initialize dynamically ..Bcoz when compiler will go to Solution.x it will load Solution Class and static block load at class loading time..So we can able to dynamically initialize that static data member..   }
