I am looking to use Java to get the MD5 checksum of a file.  I was really surprised but I haven\'t been able to find anything that shows how to get the MD5 checksum of a file.How is it done?There\'s an input stream decorator, java.security.DigestInputStream, so that you can compute the digest while using the input stream as you normally would, instead of having to make an extra pass over the data.Use DigestUtils from Apache Commons Codec library:There\'s an example at Real\'s Java-How-to using the MessageDigest class.Check that page for examples using CRC32 and SHA-1 as well.The com.google.common.hash API offers:Read the User Guide (IO Explained, Hashing Explained). For your use-case Files.hash() computes and returns the digest value for a file.For example a sha-1 digest calculation (change SHA-1 to MD5 to get MD5 digest)Note that crc32 is much faster than md5, so use crc32 if you do not need a cryptographically secure checksum. Note also that md5 should not be used to store passwords and the like since it is to easy to brute force, for passwords use bcrypt,  scrypt or sha-256 instead. For long term protection with hashes a  Merkle signature scheme adds to the security and The Post Quantum Cryptography Study Group sponsored by the European Commission has recommended use of this cryptography for long term protection against quantum computers (ref).Note that crc32 has a higher collision rate than the others. Guava now provides a new, consistent hashing API that is much more user-friendly than the various hashing APIs provided in the JDK. See Hashing Explained. For a file, you can get the MD5 sum, CRC32 (with version 14.0+) or many other hashes easily:Using nio2 (Java 7+) and no external libraries:To compare the result with an expected checksum:Ok. I had to add. One line implementation for those who already have Spring and Apache Commons dependency or are planning to add it:For and Apache commons only option (credit @duleshi):Hope this helps someone.A simple approach with no third party libraries using Java 7If you need to print this byte array. Use as belowIf you need hex string out of this digest. Use as belowwhere DatatypeConverter is javax.xml.bind.DatatypeConverterI recently had to do this for just a dynamic string, MessageDigest can represent the hash in numerous ways. To get the signature of the file like you would get with the md5sum command I had to do something like the this: This obviously doesn\'t answer your question about how to do it specifically for a file, the above answer deals with that quiet nicely. I just spent a lot of time getting the sum to look like most application\'s display it, and thought you might run into the same trouble. Or you may get more info \nhttp://www.asjava.com/core-java/java-md5-example/ We were using code that resembles the code above in a previous post usingHowever, watch out for using BigInteger.toString() here, as it will truncate leading zeros...\n(for an example, try s = "27", checksum should be "02e74f10e0327ad868d138f2b4fdd6f0") I second the suggestion to use Apache Commons Codec, I replaced our own code with that.Standard Java Runtime Environment way:The result is equal of linux md5sum utility.Very fast & clean Java-method that doesn\'t rely on external libraries:(Simply replace MD5 with SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384 or SHA-512 if you want those)Another implementation: Fast MD5 Implementation in JavaIf you\'re using ANT to build, this is dead-simple.  Add the following to your build.xml:Where jarFile is the JAR you want to generate the MD5 against, and toDir is the directory you want to place the MD5 file.More info here.Google guava provides a new API. Find the one below :Here is a simple function that wraps around Sunil\'s code so that it takes a File as a parameter. The function does not need any external libraries, but it does require Java 7.Example output:
