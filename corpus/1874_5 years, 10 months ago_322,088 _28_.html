How can I get the context in a fragment?I need to use my database whose constructor takes in the context, but getApplicationContext() and FragmentClass.this don\'t work so what can I do?Database constructorYou can use getActivity(), which returns the activity associated with a fragment.\nThe activity is a context (since Activity extends Context).To do as the answer above, you can override the onAttach method of fragment:Always use the getActivity() method to get the context of your attached activity, but always remember one thing: Fragments are slightly unstable and getActivity returns null some times, so for that, always check the isAdded() method of fragment before getting context by getActivity().The easiest and most precise way to get the context of the fragment that I found is to get it directly from the ViewGroup when you call onCreateView method at least here you are sure not to get null for getActivity():to get the context inside the Fragment will be possible using getActivity() :I think a better aproach must be getting the Activity from the onAttach() method:Another alternative approach is:You can get the context using:getContext() came in API 23. Replace it with getActivity() everywhere in the code.See if it fixes the error. Try to use methods which are in between the target and minimun API level, else this error will come in place.Since API level 23 there is getContext() but if you want to support older versions you can use getActivity().getApplicationContext() while I still recommend using the support version of Fragment which is android.support.v4.app.Fragment.You could also get the context from the inflater parameter, when overriding onCreateView.getActivity() is a child of Context so that should work for youIdeally, you should not need to use globals. The fragment has different notifications, one of them being onActivityCreated. You can get the instance of the activity in this lifecycle event of the fragment.Then: you can dereference the fragment to get activity, context or applicationcontext as you desire:this.getActivity() will give you the handle to the activity\nthis.getContext() will give you a handle to the context\nthis.getActivity().getApplicationContext() will give you the handle to the application context. You should preferably use the application context when passing it on to the db.The simple way is to use getActivity(). But I think the major confusion of using the getActivity() method to get the context here is a null pointer exception. For this, first check with the isAdded() method which will determine whether it\'s added or not, and then we can use the getActivity() to get the context of Activity.getContext() method helps to use the Context of the class in a fragment activity.Use fragments from Support Library -    and then overrideThis way you can be sure that context will always be a non-null value.You can call getActivity() or,You have different options:If you don\'t need to support old versions then go with getContext().
