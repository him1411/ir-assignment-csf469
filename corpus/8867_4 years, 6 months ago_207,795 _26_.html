I am trying to toggle the class of an element using ng-classisAutoScroll():Basically, if $scope.autoScroll is true, I want ng-class to be icon-autoscroll and if its false, I want it to be icon-autoscroll-disabledWhat I have now isn\'t working and is producing this error in the consoleError: Lexer Error: Unexpected next character  at columns 18-18 [?] in expression [{(isAutoScroll()) ? \'icon-autoscroll\' : \'icon-autoscroll-disabled\'}].How do I correctly do this?EDITsolution 1: (outdated)EDIT 2solution 2:I wanted to update the solution as Solution 3, provided by Stewie, should be the one used. It is the most standard when it comes to ternary operator (and to me easiest to read). The solution would betranslates to:if (autoScroll == true) ? //use class \'icon-autoscroll\' : //else use \'icon-autoscroll-disabled\'How to use conditional in ng-class: Solution 1:Solution 2:Solution 3 (angular v.1.1.4+ introduced support for ternary operator):PlunkerAs alternate solution, based on javascript logic operator \'&&\' which returns the last evaluation, you can also do this like so:It\'s only slightly shorter syntax, but for me easier to read.Add more than one class based on the condition:Apply: class1 + class2 + class3 when isNew=false,\n\nApply: class1+ class4 when isNew=trueThe analogue toggleClass jQuery.I made this work in this way: // in your controller
