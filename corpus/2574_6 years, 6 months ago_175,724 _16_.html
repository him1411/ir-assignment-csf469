Say I have uncommitted changes in my working directory. How can I make a patch from those without having to create a commit?git diff for unstaged changes.  git diff --cached for staged changes.If you haven\'t yet commited the changes, then:But sometimes it happens that part of the stuff you\'re doing are new files that are untracked and won\'t be in your git diff output. So, one way to do a patch is to stage everything for a new commit (but don\'t do the commit), and then:Add the \'binary\' option if you want to add binary files to the patch (e.g. mp3 files):You can later apply the patch:git diff and git apply will work for text files, but won\'t work for binary files.You can easily create a full binary patch, but you will have to create a temporary commit.  Once you\'ve made your temporary commit(s), you can create the patch with:After you\'ve made the patch, run this command:This will roll back your temporary commit(s).  The final result leaves your working copy (intentionally) dirty with the same changes you originally had.On the receiving side, you can use the same trick to apply the changes to the working copy, without having the commit history.  Simply apply the patch(es), and git reset --mixed <SHA of commit *before* the patches>.Note that you might have to be well-synced for this whole option to work.  I\'ve seen some errors when applying patches when the person making them hadn\'t pulled down as many changes as I had.  There are probably ways to get it to work, but I haven\'t looked far into it.Here\'s how to create the same patches in Tortoise Git (not that I recommend using that tool):And how to apply them:To create a patch with both modified & new files (staged) you can run:If you want to do binary, give a --binary option when you run git diff.
