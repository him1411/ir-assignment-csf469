I\'m working on an android application, and I have a drawable that I\'m loading up from a source image.  On this image, I\'d like to convert all of the white pixels to a different color, say blue, and then cache the resultant Drawable object so I can use it later.So for example say I have a 20x20 PNG file that has a white circle in the middle, and that everything outside the circle is transparent.  What\'s the best way to turn that white circle blue and cache the results?  Does the answer change if I want to use that source image to create several new Drawables (say blue, red, green, orange, etc)?I\'m guessing that I\'ll want to use a ColorMatrix in some way, but I\'m not sure how.I think you can actually just use Drawable.setColorFilter( 0xffff0000, Mode.MULTIPLY ).  This would set white pixels to red but I don\'t think it would affect the transparent pixels.See Drawable#setColorFilterGive this code a try:If you have a drawable that\'s a solid color and you want to change it to a differnet solid color, you can use a ColorMatrixColorFilter. Transparency is preserved.I know this question was ask way before Lollipop but I would like to add a nice way to do this on Android 5.+. You make an xml drawable that references the original one and set tint on it like such:Check out my blog post on this for more information.The new support v4 bring tint back to api 4.you can do it like thisYou should do this for all APIs:I was able to do this with the following code, which is taken from an activity (the layout is a very simple one, just containing an ImageView, and is not posted here).OMG! lot of really good answers and I also use ImageView for Icons (in list view or settings screen). But i think there is much simpler way to do that because ofUse \'tint\' to change the color overlay on your selected icon.in xml I did it like thisandroid:tint="@color/accent"\n                      android:src="@drawable/ic_event" works fine since it comes from appCompat!\nCheers!In your Activity you can tint your PNG image resources with a single colour:Now when you use the R.drawable.* it should be coloured with the desired tint. If you need additional colours then you should be able to .mutate() the drawable. There are so many solution but nobody suggested if the color resource xml file already have color then we can pick directly from there also as below:Check out this sample code "ColorMatrixSample.java" The relevant API is available here:This works with everything with background:Textview, Button...Thanks to @sabadow  This code snippet worked for me: Short example to change drawable color according to isWorking field.My shape xml:My method to change:Example of usage:It\'s very very simple when you use a library to do that for you.\nTry this one: https://github.com/jrvansuita/IconHandlerYou can call like this:
