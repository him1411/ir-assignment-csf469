I want my body to stop scrolling when using the mousewheel while the Modal (from http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) on my website is opened.I\'ve tried to call the piece of javascript below when the modal is opened but without successPlease note our website dropped support for IE6, IE7+ needs to be compatible though.Bootstrap\'s modal automatically adds the class modal-open to the body when a modal dialog is shown and removes it when the dialog is hidden. You can therefore add the following to your CSS:You could argue that the above code belongs to the Bootstrap CSS code base, but this is an easy fix to add it to your site.Update 8th feb, 2013\nThis has now stopped working in Twitter Boostrap v. 2.3.0 -- they no longer add the modal-open class to the body.A workaround would be to add the class to the body when the modal is about to be shown, and remove it when the modal is closed:Update 11th march, 2013\nLooks like the modal-open class will return in Bootstrap 3.0, explicitly for the purpose of preventing the scroll: Reintroduces .modal-open on the body (so we can nuke the scroll there)See this: https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/pull/6342 - look at the Modal section.The accepted answer doesn\'t work on mobile (iOS 7 w/ Safari 7, at least) and I don\'t want MOAR JavaScript running on my site when CSS will do.This CSS will prevent the background page from scrolling under the modal:However, it also has a slight side-affect of essentially scrolling to the top. position:absolute resolves this but, re-introduces the ability to scroll on mobile.If you know your viewport (my plugin for adding viewport to the <body>) you can just add a css toggle for the position.I also add this to prevent the underlying page from jumping left/right when showing/hiding modals.this answer is a x-post.You could try setting body size to window size with overflow: hidden when modal is openSimply hide the body overflow and it makes body not scrolling. When you hide the modal, revert it to automatic. Here is the code:Warning: The option below is not relevant to Bootstrap v3.0.x, as scrolling in those versions has been explicitly confined to the modal itself.  If you disable wheel events you may inadvertently prevent some users from viewing the content in modals that have heights greater than the viewport height.The scroll event is not cancelable.  However it is possible to cancel the mousewheel and wheel events.  The big caveat is that not all legacy browsers support them, Mozilla only recently adding support for the latter in Gecko 17.0.  I don\'t know the full spread, but IE6+ and Chrome do support them.Here\'s how to leverage them:You need to go beyond @charlietfl\'s answer and account for scrollbars, otherwise you may see a document reflow.Inspired by: http://jdsharp.us/jQuery/minute/calculate-scrollbar-width.phpI\'m not sure about this code, but it\'s worth a shot.In jQuery:As I said before, I\'m not 100% sure but try anyway.Couldn\'t make it work on Chrome just by changing CSS, because I didn\'t want the page to scroll back to the top. This worked fine:Try this one:it worked for me. (supports IE8)You could use the following logic, I tested it and it works(even in IE) The best solution is the css-only body{overflow:hidden} solution used by most of these answers.  Some answers provide a fix that also prevent the "jump" caused by the disappearing scrollbar; however, none were too elegant.  So, I wrote these two functions, and they seem to work pretty well.Check out this jsFiddle to see it in use.Based on this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/dh834zgw/1/the following snippet (using jquery) will disable the window scroll:And in your css:Now when you remove the modal, don\'t forget to remove the noscroll class on the html tag:Adding the class \'is-modal-open\' or modifying style of body tag with javascript is okay and it will work as supposed to. But the problem we gonna face is when the body becomes overflow:hidden, it will jump to the top, ( scrollTop will become 0 ). This will become a usability issue later. As a solution for this problem, instead of changing body tag overflow:hidden change it on html tagSadly none of the answers above fixed my issues.In my situation, the web page originally has a scroll bar. Whenever I click the modal, the scroll bar won\'t disappear and the header will move to right a bit.Then I tried to add .modal-open{overflow:auto;} (which most people recommended). It indeed fixed the issues: the scroll bar appears after I open the modal. However, another side effect comes out which is that "background below the header will move to the left a bit, together with another long bar behind the modal"Luckily, after I add {padding-right: 0 !important;}, everything is fixed perfectly. Both the header and body background didn\'t move and the modal still keeps the scrollbar.Hope this can help those who are still stuck with this issue. Good luck!Most of the pieces are here, but I don\'t see any answer that puts it all together.The problem is threefold.(1) prevent the scroll of the underlying page(2) and remove the scroll bar(3) clean up when the modal is dismissedIf the modal is not full-screen then apply the .modal bindings to a full screen overlay.My solution for Bootstrap 3:because for me the only overflow: hidden on the body.modal-open class did not prevent the page from shifting to the left due to the original margin-right: 15px.If modal are 100% height/width "mouseenter/leave" will work to easily enable/disable scrolling. This really worked out for me:I had a sidebar that was generated by checkbox hack.\nBut the main idea is to save the document scrollTop and not to change it during scrolling the window.I just didn\'t like the page jumping when body becomes \'overflow: hidden\'.worked for meThis worked for me:For those wondering how to get the scroll event for the bootstrap 3 modal:This is the best solution for me: Css:And Js:I am using this vanilla js function to add "modal-open" class to the body. (Based on smhmic\'s answer)Hiding the overflow and fixing the position does the trick however with my fluid design it would fix it past the browsers width, so a width:100% fixed that.Try this code:I just done it this way ...But when the scroller dissapeared it moved everything right 20px, so i added straight after it.Works for me.I\'m not 100% sure this will work with Bootstrap but worth a try - it worked with Remodal.js which can be found on github: http://vodkabears.github.io/remodal/ and it would make sense for the methods to be pretty similar.To stop the page jumping to the top and also prevent the right shift of content add a class to the body when the modal is fired and set these CSS rules:It\'s the position:static and the height:auto that combine to stop the jumping of content to the right. The overflow-y:hidden; stops the page from being scrollable behind the modal.You should add overflow: hidden in HTML for a better cross-platform performance.I would use
