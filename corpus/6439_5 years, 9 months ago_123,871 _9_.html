I\'m using Sparkleshare, which uses Git to sync files between my laptop and my backup server.Now I want to be able to browse in the files and dirs that I\'ve uploaded to my server, but I dont know how?I understand that Git uses some sort of special file hierarchy and that I just cant list my files, right?But how would I have to do to list them and browse my files?This command:lists all of the already committed files being tracked by your git repo. Try this command:This lists all of the files in the repository, including those that are only staged but not yet committed.http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-ls-files.html
