What do these python file extensions mean?What are the differences between them and how are they generated from a *.py file?Also for some further discussion on .pyc vs .pyo, take a look at: http://www.network-theory.co.uk/docs/pytut/CompiledPythonfiles.html (I\'ve copied the important part below).py - Regular scripts\n.py3 - (rarely used) Python3 script. Python3 scripts usually end with ".py" not ".py3", but I have seen that a few times\n.pyc - compiled script (Bytecode)\n.pyo - optimized pyc file (As of Python3.5, Python will only use pyc rather than pyo and pyc)\n.pyw - Python script for Windows. It is executed with pythonw.exe\n.pyx - Cython src to be converted to C/C++\n.pyd - Python script made as a Windows DLL\n.pxd - Cython script which is equivalent to a C/C++ header\n.pxi - MyPy stub\n.pyi - Stub file (PEP 484)\n.pyz - Python script archive (PEP 441); this is a script containing compressed Python scripts (ZIP) in binary form after the standard Python script header\n.pywz - Python script archive for MS-Windows (PEP 441); this is a script containing compressed Python scripts (ZIP) in binary form after the standard Python script header\n.py[cod] - wildcard notation in ".gitignore" that means the file may be ".pyc", ".pyo", or ".pyd".A larger list of additional Python file-extensions (mostly rare and unofficial) can be found at http://dcjtech.info/topic/python-file-extensions/
