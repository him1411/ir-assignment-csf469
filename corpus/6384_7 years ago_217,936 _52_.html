I applied a custom font to a TextView, but it doesn\'t seems to change the typeface.Here is my code:Can anyone please get me out of this issue?On Mobiletuts+ there is very good tutorial on Text formatting for Android. Quick Tip: Customize Android FontsEDIT: Tested it myself now. Here is the solution. You can use a subfolder called fonts but it must go in the assets folder not the res folder. Soassets/fontsAlso make sure that the font ending I mean the ending of the font file itself is all lower case. In other words it should not be myFont.TTF but myfont.ttf this way must be in lower caseAfter trying most of the solutions described in this thread, I accidentally found Calligraphy (https://github.com/chrisjenx/Calligraphy) - a library by Christopher Jenkins that lets you easily add custom fonts to your app. The advantages of his lib comparing to approaches suggested here are:I know there are good answers already, but here\'s a fully working implementation.Here\'s the custom text view:Here\'s the custom attributes. This should go to your res/attrs.xml file:And here\'s how you use it. I\'ll use a relative layout to wrap it and show the customAttr declaration, but it could obviously be whatever layout you already have.I\'ve successfully used this before. The only difference between our implementations is that I wasn\'t using a subfolder in assets. Not sure if that will change anything, though.Provided that you placed the font in the right place and there is no error in the font file itself, your code should work like that, RATTLESNAKE.However, it would be a lot easier if you could just define a font in your layout xml, like this:With the accompanying res/values/styles.xml:I created a couple of tools specifically for this purpose. Refer to this project from GitHub, or take a look at this blog post which explains the whole thing.For Custom Fonts in android create a folder within assets folder name it "fonts" place your desired fonts.ttf or .otf file in it.If you extends UIBaseFragment: else if extends Activity:The best way to do it From Android O preview release is this way:  \n It works only if you have android studio-2.4 or above Next we must create a font family:Enclose each font file, style, and weight attribute in the font tag element. The following XML illustrates adding font-related attributes in the font resource XML:\n\n\n    \n    \nAdding fonts to a TextView:As from the documentation Working With FontsAll the steps are correct.You can use PixlUI at https://github.com/neopixl/PixlUIimport their .jar and use it in XMLSince I was not satisfied with all the presented solutions on SO, I\'ve come up with mine. It\'s based on a little trick with tags (i.e. you can\'t use tags in your code), I put the font path there. So when defining views, you can do either this:or this:Now you can either explicitly access / setup the view as:or just setup everything via:And what is the magic class you ask? Mostly glued from another SO posts, with helper methods for both activity and fragments:Make sure to paste the above code into onCreate() after your call to the super and the call to setContentView(). This small detail kept my hung up for awhile.I had the same problem, the TTF did not show up. I changed the font file, and with the same code it\'s working. If you want to load the font from the network or easily style it, you can use:https://github.com/shellum/fontViewExample:Unfortunately there is no good solution for this.I\'ve seen the many articles about using a custom TextView but what they forget it that it\'s not only textviews that can implement fonts & there are textviews hidden away in other views inaccessible to the developer; I\'m not even going to get started on Spannable.You could use an external font utility like:Calligraphy Font ToolBUT This loops over every view in the application on it\'s creation and even this utility misses some views (ViewPager renders normal font) then you have the problem that is when Google updates their build tools this will occasionally crash because it needs to target deprecated properties. It\'s also a little slow as it uses Java\'s Reflection.It\'s really up to Google to fix this. We need better font support in Android. If you look at the solution from iOS they literally have 100\'s of fonts built in to select from. Want a custom font? Simply drop a TFF in and it\'s usable..For now were now limited to the offering that Google offers us which is extremely limited but fortunately mobile optimized.You can use easy & simple EasyFonts third party library to set variety of custom fonts to your TextView. By using this library you should not have to worry about downloading and adding fonts into the assets/fonts folder. Also about Typeface object creation.Instead ofSimply:This library also provides following font face.I am author of this library.
