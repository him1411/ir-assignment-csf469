I want a two-column div layout, where each one can have variable width e.g.I want the \'view\' div to expand to the whole width available after \'tree\' div has filled needed space.\nCurrently my \'view\' div is resized to content it contains\nIt will also be good if both divs take up whole heightNot duplicate disclaimer:Expand div to max width when float:left is set\nbecause there the left one has a fixed width.Help with div - make div fit the remaining width\nbecause I need two columns both aligned to leftThe solution to this is actually very easy, but not at all obvious.  You have to trigger something called a "block formatting context" (BFC), which interacts with floats in a specific way.Just take that second div, remove the float, and give it overflow:hidden instead.  Any overflow value other than visible makes the block it\'s set on become a BFC.  BFCs don\'t allow descendant floats to escape them, nor do they allow sibling/ancestor floats to intrude into them.  The net effect here is that the floated div will do it\'s thing, then the second div will be an ordinary block, taking up all available width except that occupied by the float.This should work across all current browsers, though you may have to trigger hasLayout in IE6 and 7.  I can\'t recall.Demos:I just discovered the magic of flex boxes (display: flex). Try this:Flex boxes give me the control I\'ve wished css had for 15 years. Its finally here! More info: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/This would be a good example of something that\'s trivial to do with tables and hard (if not impossible, at least in a cross-browser sense) to do with CSS.If both the columns were fixed width, this would be easy.If one of the columns was fixed width, this would be slightly harder but entirely doable.With both columns variable width, IMHO you need to just use a two-column table.Check this solution outHere, this might help...Use calc.\nexample``I don\'t understand why people are willing to work so hard to find a pure-CSS solution for simple columnar layouts that are SO EASY using the old TABLE tag.All Browsers still have the table layout logic... Call me a dinosaur perhaps, but I say let it help you.Much less risky in terms of cross-browser compatibility too.Note: Add flex vendor prefixes if required by your supported browsers.Thanks for the plug of Simpl.css!remember to wrap all your columns in ColumnWrapper like so.I am about to release version 1.0 of Simpl.css so help spread the word!A slightly different implementation, Two div panels(content+extra), side by side, content panel expands if extra panel is not present.jsfiddle:  http://jsfiddle.net/qLTMf/1722/Pat - You are right. That\'s why this solution would satisfy both "dinosaurs" and contemporaries. :)You can try CSS Grid Layout.Im not sure if this is the answer you are expecting but, why don\'t you set the width of Tree to \'auto\' and width of \'View\' to 100% ?How about using calc function if you are using latest browsers (IE >= 9, FF >= 19, chrome >= 26, safari >= 6) and width of another section on same row is fixed?Instead of 20px you can write the fixed width of another section on same row. This way the width will be calculated and applied i.e. remaining width. P.S. No support for Opera! :(Have a look at the available CSS layout frameworks. I would recommend Simpl or, the slightly more complex, Blueprint framework.If you are using Simpl (which involves importing just one simpl.css file), you can do this:, for a 50-50 layout, or :, for a 25-75 one.It\'s that simple.I wrote a javascript function that I call from jQuery $(document).ready(). This will parse all children of the parent div and only update the right most child.htmljavascriptyou can use W3.CSS library that contains \'rest\' class like this:don\'t forget to link the css library of W3 in header of html page:https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryit.asp?filename=tryw3css_grid_rest&stacked=hIf both of the widths are variable length why don\'t you calculate the width with some scripting or server side?<div style="width: <=% getTreeWidth() %>">Tree</div>
