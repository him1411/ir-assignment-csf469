I\'m trying to force the "portrait" mode for my application because my application is absolutely not designed for the "landscape" mode.After reading some forums, I added these lines in my manifest file:But it doesn\'t work on my device (HTC Desire). It switches from "portrait" lo "landscape", ignoring the lines from the manifest file.After more forums reading, I tried to add this in my manifest file:and this function in my activity class:But again, no luck.Don\'t apply the orientation to the application element, instead you should apply the attribute to the activity element, and you must also set configChanges as noted below.Example:This is applied in the manifest file at, for example, /platforms/android/AndroidManifest.xml. Note thatis added in the manifest file - where the activity is defined.I think android:screenOrientation="portrait" can be used for individual activities. So use that attribute in <activity> tag like :If  you are having a lot activity like mine, in your application  Or if you dont want to enter the code for each activity tag in manifest you can do this .   in your Application Base class you will get a lifecycle callback so basically what happens in for each activity when creating the on create in Application Class get triggered  here is the code ..i hope this helps.   I had this line in my AndroidManifest.xmlWhich I changed to (just added android:screenOrientation="portrait")This fixed things for me.Something to complement: I have updated an app recently, the previous was working in both landscape and portrait mode, and I want the updated version should work in portrait mode, so I added to the corresponding activity, and it just crashed when I tested the update. Then I addedtoo, and it works.I think you want to add android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden" to your activity? Otherwise the activity is restarted on config-change. The onConfigurationChanged would not be called then, only the onCreateAccording to Android\'s documentation, you should also often include screenSize as a possible configuration change.If your application targets API level 13 or higher (as declared by the\n  minSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion attributes), then you should also\n  declare the "screenSize" configuration, because it also changes when a\n  device switches between portrait and landscape orientations.Also, if you all include value keyboardHidden in your examples, shouldn\'t you then also consider locale, mcc, fontScale, keyboard and others?..Short answer: Don\'t do it.Redesign your app so that it can run in both portrait and landscape mode. There is no such thing as a UI that can\'t be designed to work in both portrait and landscape; only lazy or unimaginative developers.The reason why is rather simple. You want your app to be usable by as wide an audience as possible on as many different devices as possible. By forcing a particular screen orientation, you prevent your app from running (usably) on devices that don\'t support that orientation and you frustrate and alienate potential customers who prefer a different orientation.Example: You design your app to force portrait mode. A customer downloads the app on a 2-in-1 device which they use predominantly in landscape mode. \nConsequence 1: Your app is unusable, or your customer is forced to undock their device, rotate it, and use it in an orientation that is not familiar or comfortable for them.\nConsequence 2: The customer gets frustrated by your app\'s non-intuitive design and finds an alternative or ditches the app entirely.I\'m fighting with this with an app right now and as a consumer and a developer, I hate it. As useful as the app is, as fantastic as the features are that it offers, I absolutely hate the app because it forces me to use an orientation that is counter to every other way that I use my device.You don\'t want your customers to hate your app.I know this doesn\'t directly answer the question, so I want to explain it in a little more detail for those who are curious.There is a tendency for developers to be really good at writing code and really terrible at design. This question, though it sounds like a code question and the asker certainly feels like it\'s a code question, is really a design question. The question really is "How should I design my UI?" The asker chose to design the UI to function and look good only in portrait mode. I suspect it was to save development time or because the app\'s workflow is particularly conducive to a portrait layout. But those reasons neglect all the real important factors that motivate proper design.Customer engagement - you want your customers to feel pulled into your app, not pushed out of it. The app should transition smoothly from whatever your customer was doing prior to opening your app. (This is the reason most platforms have consistent design principles, so most apps look more or less alike though they don\'t have to.)Customer response - you want your customers to react positively to your app. They should enjoy using it. Even if it\'s a payroll app for work, it should be a pleasure for them to open it and clock in. The app should save your customers time and reduce frustration over alternatives. (Apps that annoy users build resentment against your app which grows into resentment against your brand.)Customer conversion - you want your customers to be able to quickly and easily move from browsing to interacting. This is the ultimate goal of any app, to convert impressions into revenue. (Apps that don\'t generate revenue are a waste of your time to build.)A poorly designed UI reduces customer engagement and response which ultimately results in lower revenue. In a mobile-centric world (and particularly on the subject of portrait/landscape display modes), this explains why responsive web design is such a big deal. Walmart Canada introduced responsive design on their website in November 2013 and saw a 20% increase in customer conversion. O\'Neill Clothing implemented responsive web design and revenue from customers using iOS devices increased 101.25%, and 591.42% from customers using Android devices.Don\'t force your app into a single display mode. Make it responsive and make it pretty.
