I have a website hosted on a PC I have no access to. I have an upload form allowing people to upload mp3 files up to 30MB big. My server side script is done in PHPEvery time I try and upload a file, I receive an error claiming that the file exceeds the maximum size allowed, so I need to increase the size. My research on the web suggested changing the .htaccess file which I do not have access to, so that won\'t work. Others suggested that I should add a custom php.ini file to my root which did not work. Any other suggestions?You need to set the value of upload_max_filesize and post_max_size in your php.ini :After modifying php.ini file(s), you need to restart your HTTP server to use new configuration.If you can\'t change your php.ini, you\'re out of luck.  You cannot change these values at run-time; uploads of file larger than the value specified in php.ini will have failed by the time execution reaches your call to ini_set.See the Description of core php.ini directives.You can change it via an .htaccess file..htaccess files are stored in the same directory as your .php files are. They modify  configuration for that folder and all sub-folders. You simply use them by creating an .htaccess file in the directory of your choice (or modify it if present).The following should enable you to increase your upload limit (if the server provider allows PHP config changes via .htaccess).I had the same problem and i created a .user.ini file and put it in the directory in which the upload script was located. Than inside that file i set these these two values:and it worked great for me!You can also use ini_set function (only for PHP version below 5.3):Like @acme said, in php 5.3 and above this settings are PHP_INI_PERDIR directives so they can\'t be set using ini_set. You can use user.ini instead.To locate the ini file, first runThen open the file and changereplacing the 2M with the size you want, for instance 100M.I\'ve got a blog post about with a little more info too http://www.seanbehan.com/how-to-increase-or-change-the-file-upload-size-in-the-php-ini-file-for-wordpressI have the same problem in the past .. and i fixed it through .htaccess fileWhen you make change on php configration through .htaccess you should put configrations in \nIfModule tag, other that the Internal server error will rise This is example, it work fine for meAnd this is php referance if you want to understand more.\nhttp://php.net/manual/en/configuration.changes.phpI resolved this issue by creating a file called .user.ini in the directory where the PHP file scripts reside (this means any PHP script in this directory gets the new file size limit)The contents of .user.ini were:Non of those solutions work for me!! (already set to 32M by default).The problem is in most case max_allowed_packetI am working on localhost and using MAMP.Here is solutions;1. If you don\'t have my.iniAddTo2.  If you have my.iniUnderAddDONE!Well, I would like to add my 2 cents here.I\'m using shared webhosting and I tackled this problem many times, tried to resolve it on my own but to no avail. \nFinally I managed to resolve it through checking various web sources and contacting my hosting service provider. My questions were "How can I change php value memory_limit in shared webhosting?", "How can I change php value upload_max_filesize in shared webhosting?", "How can I change php value max_input_vars in shared webhosting?", "How can I change php value max_execution_time in shared webhosting?", "How can I change php value max_input_time in shared webhosting?" and many more by configuring or changing php.ini or .htaccess file. I tried to change them but problems arose. Finally I contacted my hosting provider, and it turns out that I set my php to native, they changed it to php 5.6, here is their answer: "Your PHP was set to \'native\' mode which means you can\'t override\n  those values. I\'ve changed you to just \'5.6\' so you should be good to\n  go."After that I connected my website through ftp Filezilla, also don\'t forget to make both your ftp service to show hidden files, and your local computer to do so, because .htaccess file was hidden in my local laptop and in my website. It was available in public_html folder, I just downloaded it and added the following codes to the end of the file and then uploaded it back to the server: Everything is working properly for the time being, if any of you overcome with some problems please write here and warn me so that I can change the above-shown codes. By the way, I also upload some pictures which shows the change. One more thing I almost forgot to mention ZipArchive installation on your shared webhosting service, I managed that requirement to tick by just going to php settings through my cpanel, click on php selector extensions and then tick zip section, that\'s all.Thanks.PS: I\'m open to good practices, and if you see any bad practice here please let me know, I\'ll try to change them. Thanks.I had the same problem. I have tried three ways that were usually suggested: none if which solved my problem. I am using godaddy and came across a suggested solution which was:Voila! Now you have a different max upload file size :)Three things you need to check.upload_max_filesize, memory_limit and post_max_size in the php.ini configuration file exactly.All of these three settings limit the maximum size of data that can be submitted and handled by PHP.Typically post_max_size and memory_limit need to be larger than upload_max_filesize.So three variables total you need to check to be absolutely sure.Perhaps this should be a comment to @seanb123 and @Fredrick Gauss commenting on his comment, but for me in Drupal 8.1 the file I needed to modify was located here:I modded probably four other php.ini files, including the one my system called the "Loaded Configuration File" (php -i | grep -i "loaded configuration file") and the one found on the info.php page but none of them helped. I found the correct path on a site from 2012 where it said the path was deprecated even BACK THEN. Granted, for PHP7 it\'s a little different than he said back then: /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini but the concept was the same.Maybe this will help some otherwise helpless schmuck like myself.That being said, the answer to the OP in my case would be that someone with admin privileges on the box would have to do it.The site that helped me: http://www.evilbox.ro/linux/remove-ispconfig-maximum-upload-size-of-2m-for-wordpress/This is also addressed here: Import file size limit in PHPMyAdminmany times i have noticed that site wit shared hosting do not allow to change settings in php.ini files.  one also can not even crate .htaaccess file at all. in such situation one can try following things
