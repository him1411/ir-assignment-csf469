I\'m using Sass (.scss) for my current project. Following example:HTMLSCSSThis works great. Can I handle multiple classes while using nested styles.In the sample above I\'m talking about this:CSSIn this case all div.container would normally be red but div.container.desc would be blue.How can I nest this inside container with Sass?You can use the parent selector reference &, it will be replaced by the parent selector after compilation:For your example:The & will completely resolve, so if your parent selector is nested itself, the nesting will be resolved before replacing the &.  This notation is most often used to write pseudo-elements and -classes:However, you can place the & at virtually any position you like*, so the following is possible too:However be aware, that this somehow breaks your nesting structure and thus may increase the effort of finding a specific rule in your stylesheet.*: No other characters than whitespaces are allowed in front of the &. So you cannot do a direct concatenation of selector+& - #id& would throw an error.
