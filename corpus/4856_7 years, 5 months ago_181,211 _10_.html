I have set a background image in my app, but the background image is small and I want it to be repeated and fill in the whole screen. What should I do?Ok, here\'s what I\'ve got in my app. It includes a hack to prevent ListViews from going black while scrolling.drawable/app_background.xml:values/styles.xml:AndroidManifest.xml:There is a property in the drawable xml to do it.\nandroid:tileMode="repeat"See this site:\nhttp://androidforbeginners.blogspot.com/2010/06/how-to-tile-background-image-in-android.htmlHere is a pure-java implementation of background image repeating:In this case, our background image would have to be stored in res/drawable/bg_image.png.Expanding on plowman\'s answer, here is the non-deprecated version of changing the background image with java.
