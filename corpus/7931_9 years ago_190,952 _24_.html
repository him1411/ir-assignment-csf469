Do you know if there is a built-in function to build a dictionary from an arbitrary object? I\'d like to do something like this:NOTE: It should not include methods. Only fields.Note that best practice in Python 2.7 is to use new-style classes (not needed with Python 3), i.e.Also, there\'s a difference between an \'object\' and a \'class\'. To build a dictionary from an arbitrary object, it\'s sufficient to use __dict__. Usually, you\'ll declare your methods at class level and your attributes at instance level, so __dict__ should be fine. For example:Alternatively, depending on what you want to do, it might be nice to inherit from dict. Then your class is already a dictionary, and if you want you can override getattr and/or setattr to call through and set the dict. For example:The dir builtin will give you all the object\'s attributes, including special methods like __str__, __dict__ and a whole bunch of others which you probably don\'t want. But you can do something like:So can extend this to only return data attributes and not methods, by defining your props function like this:Instead of x.__dict__, it\'s actually more pythonic to use vars(x).I\'ve settled with a combination of both answers:To build a dictionary from an arbitrary object, it\'s sufficient to use __dict__.This misses attributes that the object inherits from its class. For example,hasattr(a, \'x\') is true, but \'x\' does not appear in a.__dict__I thought I\'d take some time to show you how you can translate an object to dict via dict(obj).The key section of this code is the __iter__ function. As the comments explain, the first thing we do is grab the Class items and prevent anything that starts with \'__\'.Once you\'ve created that dict, then you can use the update dict function and pass in the instance __dict__.These will give you a complete class+instance dictionary of members. Now all that\'s left is to iterate over them and yield the returns.Also, if you plan on using this a lot, you can create an @iterable class decorator.Late answer but provided for completeness and the benefit of googlers:This will not show methods defined in the class, but it will still show fields including those assigned to lambdas or those which start with a double underscore.If you want to list part of your attributes, override __dict__:This helps a lot if your instance get some large block data and you want to push d to Redis like message queue. I think the easiest way is to create a getitem attribute for the class. If you need to write to the object, you can create a custom setattr . Here is an example for getitem:dict generates the objects attributes into a dictionary and the dictionary object can be used to get the item you need.
