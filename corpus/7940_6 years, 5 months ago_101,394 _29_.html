How can I diff a file, say pom.xml, from the master branch to an arbitrary older version in Git?You can do:... to compare your current pom.xml to the one from master 20 revisions ago through the first parent.  You can replace master~20, of course, with the object name (SHA1sum) of a commit or any of the many other ways of specifying a revision.Note that this is actually comparing the old pom.xml to the version in your working tree, not the version committed in master.  If you want that, then you can do the following instead:For example:If you want to see the difference between the last commit of a single file you can do:This will give you the diff of the file in git, is not comparing your local file.To see what was changed in a file in the last commit:You can change the number (~1) to the n-th commit which you want to diff with.git diff -w HEAD origin/master path/to/fileGeneric Syntax : for all files named "FileName.xml" anywhere in your repo.Notice the space between "--" and "**"Answer for your question:as always with git, you can use a tag/sha1/"HEAD^" to id a commit.Tested with git 1.9.1 on Ubuntu.If neither commit is your HEAD then bash\'s brace expansion proves really useful, especially if your filenames are long, the example above:Would becomeMore on Brace expansion with bash.For people interested in doing the same from GitHub, see comparing commits across time.For comparing to 5 commit to the current one, both on master, just simply do:Also you can refer to commit hash number, for example if the hash number is x110bd64, you can do something like this to  see the difference:If you need to diff on a single file in a stash for example you can doIf you are looking for the diff on a specific commit and you want to use the github UI instead of the command line (say you want to link it to other folks), you can do:For example:https://github.com/grails/grails-core/commit/02942c5b4d832b856fbc04c186f1d02416895a7e/grails-test-suite-uber/build.gradleNote the Previous and Next links at the top right that allow you to navigate through all the files in the commit. This only works for a specific commit though, not for comparing between any two arbitrary versions.Works if you are not in master branch too.
