I want to turn on only the camera flash light (not with camera preview) programmatically in Android. I googled for it but the help i found referred me to this page Does anyone have any links or sample code?For this you should do like :Check whether flash light is\navailable or not ?If yes then Turn Off/OnIf no then you can do whatever according to your app.\nneedsFor Checking availability of flash in device: You can use the followingwhich will return true if a flash is available, false if not.See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager.html for more information.For turning on/off flashlight :I googled out and got this about android.permission.FLASHLIGHT. Android manifests\' permission looks promising:Then make use of Camera and set Camera.Parameters. The main parameter used here is FLASH_MODE_TORCH. eg.Code Snippet to turn on camera flash light.

Note that only rooted HTC devices support this feature.Issues :There are also some problems while turning On/Off flashlight. eg. for the devices not having FLASH_MODE_TORCH or even if it has, then flashlight doesnot turn ON etc.Typically Samsung creates alot of problems. You can refer about problems in the given below list: Use camera flashlight in AndroidTurn ON/OFF Camera LED/flash light in Samsung Galaxy Ace 2.2.1 & Galaxy TabFrom my experience, if your application is designed to work in both portrait and landscape orientation, you need to declare the variable cam as static. Otherwise, onDestroy(), which is called on switching orientation, destroys it but doesn\'t release Camera so it\'s not possible to reopen it again.to manifest I had to put this linefrom http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Camera.htmlsuggested lines above wasn\'t working for me.I Got AutoFlash light with below simple Three Steps.In your Camera Code do this way.Build + Run \xe2\x80\x94> Now Go to Dim light area and Snap photo, you should get auto flash light if device supports.Android Lollipop introduced camera2 API and deprecated the previous camera API. However, using the deprecated API to turn on the flash still works and is much simpler than using the new API.It seems that the new API is intended for use in dedicated full featured camera apps and that its architects didn\'t really consider simpler use cases such as turning on the flashlight. To do that now, one has to get a CameraManager, create a CaptureSession with a dummy Surface, and finally create and start a CaptureRequest. Exception handling, resource cleanup and long callbacks included!To see how to turn the flashlight on Lollipop and newer, take a look at the FlashlightController in the AOSP project (try to find the newest as older use APIs that have been modified). Don\'t forget to set the needed permissions.Android Marshmallow finally introduced a simple way to turn on the flash with setTorchMode.In API 23 or Higher (Android M, 6.0)Turn On codeTurn OFF code And PermissionsComplete Code for android Flashlight AppManifestXMLMainActivity.javaThere\'s different ways to access Camera Flash in different Android versions. Few APIs stopped working in Lollipop and then it got changed again in Marshmallow. To overcome this, I have created a simple library that I have been using in few of my projects and it\'s giving good results. It\'s still incomplete, but you can try to check the code and find the missing pieces. Here\'s the link - NoobCameraFlash.If you just want to integrate in your code, you can use gradle for that. Here\'s the instructions (Taken directly from the Readme) - Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file. Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:Step 2. Add the dependencyInitialize the NoobCameraManager singleton.You can optionally set the Log Level for debug logging. Logging uses LumberJack library. The default LogLevel is LogLevel.NoneAfter that you just need to call the singleton to turn on or off the camera flash.You can take care of the runtime permission to access Camera yourself or can allow the library to do it for youIt\'s easy to toggle Flash tooI have implemented this function in my application through fragments using SurfaceView. The link to this stackoverflow question and its answer can be found hereHope this helps :)In Marshmallow and above, CameraManager\'s `setTorchMode()\' seems to be the answer. This works for me:When I updated my SDK version the camera flash quit working with a null pointer exception.\nI found that I had to set the targetSDKVersion to 22 in the build.gradle When I tried 23 the app crashed.You can also use the following code to turn off the flash.
