I\'ve been attempting move a directory structure from one location to another in Subversion, but I get an Item \'*\' is out of date commit error.  I have the latest version checked out (so far as I can tell). svn st -u turns up no differences other than the mv commands.I sometimes get this with TortoiseSVN on windows. The solution for me is to svn update the directory, even though there are no revisions to download or update. It does something to the metadata, which magically fixes it.After trying all the obvious things, and some of the other suggestions here, with no luck whatsoever, a Google search led to this link (link not working anymore) - Subversion says: Your file or directory is probably out-of-dateIn a nutshell, the trick is to go to the .svn directory (in the directory that contains the offending file), and delete the "all-wcprops" file.Worked for me when nothing else did.I believe this problem is coming from the .svn file. It\'s either incorrect in the old parent, the new parent or the old one. I would try reverting back to your starting point. Use an export to get a clean copy of the folder. Move the clean copy to the new location, and use an add and delete to do the move. That\'s manually doing what SVN does, but it might work.I\'ve found that this works for me:Tried to update the local copy, and revert the item in question, and still got the \'out of date\' error. This worked for some reason:I just had the same problem in several folders and this is what I did to commit:1) In "Team Synchronize" perspective, right click on the folder > Override and Update\n2) Delete the folder again\n3) Commit and be happyThank you. That just resolved it for me.\nsvn update --force /path to filename/ If your recent file in the local directory is the same, there are no prompts. If the file is different, it prompts for tf, mf etc... chosing mf (mine full) insures nothing is overwritten and I could commit when done.Jay\nCompuMatterI manage to solve it by hitting a update buttonLike @Alexander-Klyubin suggests, do the move in the repository. It\'s also going to be much faster, especially if you have a large amount of data to move, because you won\'t have to transfer all that data over the network again.should work just fineRemove your file or your path using\nbefore execute the command do a bk of your changesafter :Are you sure you\'ve checked out the head and not a lower revision?  Also, have you done an update to make sure you\'ve got the latest version?There\'s a discussion about this on http://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2007-01/0170.shtml.There is at least one other cause of the message "out of date" error. In my case the problem was .svn/dir-props which was created by running "svn propset svn:ignore -F .gitignore ." for the first time. Deleting .svn/dir-props seems like a bad idea and can cause other errors, so it may be best to use "svn propdel" to clean up the errant "svn propset".If you\'re using the github svn bridge, it is likely because something changed on github\'s side of things.  The solution is simple, you just have to run svn switch, which lets it properly find itself, then update and everything will work.  Just run the following from the root of your checkoutorThe basis for this solution comes from Lee Preimesberger\'s blogPerform the move directly in the repository.Are you moving it using svn mv, or just mv? I think using just mv may cause this issue.I moved the dir to my local machine for safe-keeping, then svn deleted the stupid directory, then committed. When I tried to add the folder from my local machine it STILL threw the error (SVN move did the same thing when I tried to rename the folder). So I reverted, then I did a mkdir DIRNAME, added, and committed. Then I added the contents in and committed, and it worked.I randomly recieved this error after deleting a few directories each containing some files. I deleted the directories through Netbeans and realised that it didn\'t actually delete them. It seemed to just delete everything inside the directories and removed the reference to the directory within Netbeans. They did still exist on the filesystem though. Make sure they\'re deleted from the filesystem and try the commit again.If once solved a similar issue by simply checking out a new working copy and replacing the .svn directory throwing the commit errors with this newly checked out one. The reason in my case was that after a repository corruption and restore from a backup the working copy was pointing towards a revision that didn\'t exist in the restored repository. Also got "item out of date" errors. Updating the working copy before commit didn\'t solve this but replacing the .svn as described above did.I did this and it worked for me: \n1. Take a back-up of your file. You can simply copy your code to a text file.\n2. Right Click the file you want to commit >> Team >> Show History.\n3. In "Show History" Panel you will see all the revisions of that file. Right click on latest revision of the file >> Get Revision: It will override your local changes.\n4. Now, merge your code with the latest file with the back-up file (step#1). \n5. Synchronise and Commit the newly merged file. Upgrade your server and client to Subversion 1.9.If the out of date error randomly occurs when it normally should not, when you run commit, it may indicate that you are using an outdated and unsupported Subversion 1.7 or older client or server.You should upgrade the server and clients in order to solve the problem. See the relevant Subversion 1.9 Release Notes entry: "Out of date" errors when committing over HTTPv1.Error is because you didn\'t updated that particular file, first update then only you can commit the file.This happened when I updated a branch of an earlier release with files from the trunk.  I used Windows Explorer to copy folders from my trunk checkout folder, and pasted them into my Eclipse view of the release branch checkout folder.  Now Windows Explorer was configured not to show "hidden" files starting with ".", so I was oblivious to all the incorrect .svn files being pasted into my release branch checkout folder.  Doh!My solution was to blow away the damaged Eclipse project, check it out again, and then copy the new files in more carefully.  I also changed Windows to show "hidden" files.i got this error when trying to commit some files, only it was a file/folder that didn\'t exist in my working copy.  I REALLY didn\'t want to go through the hassle of moving the files and rechecking out, in the end, i ended up editing the .svn/entries file and removed the offending directory reference.In my case only deleting of the local version and re checkout of fresh copy was a solution.I just got this error. What I recommend is you first check on your server if the original file is there. Sometimes the changes aren\'t made in your local folder.\nIf this is your situation, just delete your folder and checkout again.To solve, I needed to revert the file with problem, and update my working copy, and later I modified the file again and after these steps the error didn\'t happened anymore.Just do svn up into command line or if you are in windows select the svn update option.I just got this while I was trying to commit from a trunk directory. Doing svn update from the trunk directory did not solve the error; however, doing svn update from the parent directory (where the .svn directory belongs) did solve the error.My guess about what happened (a use case among other, there may be multiple reasons for this \xe2\x80\x9csvn: E160024: resource out of date; try updating\xe2\x80\x9d): along to trunk, there was a branches directory. I pulled a branches/branch-1 into master from GitHub. Doing svn update from the parent directory (that is, the root of my working copy) instead of trunk seems to have done something in branches in addition to trunk. When I tried to commit again, there was no error.However, as I said above, this is one case among probably many others.Side note: unlike what someone suggested, I don\'t believe it\'s a good idea to play manually in the .svn directory.Tried all but change in .svn directly. Nothing helped so here\'s my solution.In Eclipse > Window > Show View > History I\'ve seen that file is not at the newest Revision, although I made multiple svn "Override & Update" / "Revert" / delete file and checkout.So I went Package Explorer > Right click on file > Replace with > Latest from Repository.Another look in the History View showed that file was now on latest Revision.is more isyly make this:1)i copy my modify code in a notepad.\n2) next , update the file.\n3) copy the code of notepad  in a file updated.\n4) commit in svn.
