Please explain in an easy to understand language or a link to some article.extends is for extending a class.implements is for implementing an interfaceThe difference between an interface and a regular class is that in an interface you can not implement any of the declared methods.  Only the class that "implements" the interface can implement the methods.  The C++ equivalent of an interface would be an abstract class (not EXACTLY the same but pretty much).Also java doesn\'t support multiple inheritance for classes. This is solved by using multiple interfaces.now extending a classin this caseI suggest you do some more research on dynamic binding, polymorphism and in general inheritance in Object-oriented programmingI notice you have some C++ questions in your profile.  If you understand the concept of multiple-inheritance from C++ (referring to classes that inherit characteristics from more than one other class), Java does not allow this, but it does have keyword interface, which is sort of like a pure virtual class in C++.  As mentioned by lots of people, you extend a class (and you can only extend from one), and you implement an interface -- but your class can implement as many interfaces as you like.Ie, these keywords and the rules governing their use delineate the possibilities for multiple-inheritance in Java (you can only have one super class, but you can implement multiple interfaces).extends is for when you\'re inheriting from a base class (i.e. extending its functionality).implements is for when you\'re implementing an interface.Here is a good place to start: Interfaces and Inheritance.A class can only "implement" an interface. A class only "extends" a class. Likewise, an interface can extend another interface.A class can only extend one other class. A class can implement several interfaces. If instead you are more interested in knowing when to use abstract classes and interfaces, refer to this thread: Interface vs Abstract Class (general OO)Generally implements used for implementing an interface and extends used for extension of base class behaviour or abstract class. extends: A derived class can extend a base class. You may redefine the behaviour of an established relation. Derived class "is a" base class typeimplements: You are implementing a contract. The class implementing the interface "has a" capability. With java 8 release, interface can have default methods in interface, which provides implementation in interface itself.Refer to this question for when to use each of them:Interface vs Abstract Class (general OO)Example to understand things.output:Important points to understand:By going through these examples, you can understand thatUnrelated classes can have capabilities through interface but related classes override behaviour through extension of base classes.An interface is a description of the actions that an object can do... for example when you flip a light switch, the light goes on, you don\'t care how, just that it does. In Object Oriented Programming, an Interface is a description of all functions that an object must have in order to be an "X". Again, as an example, anything that "ACTS LIKE" a light, should have a turn_on() method and a turn_off() method. The purpose of interfaces is to allow the computer to enforce these properties and to know that an object of TYPE T (whatever the interface is ) must have functions called X,Y,Z, etc.An interface is a programming structure/syntax that allows the computer to enforce certain properties on an object (class). For example, say we have a car class and a scooter class and a truck class. Each of these three classes should have a start_engine() action. How the "engine is started" for each vehicle is left to each particular class, but the fact that they must have a start_engine action is the domain of the interface.A extends B:A and B are both classes or both interfacesA implements BA is a class and B is an interfaceThe remaining case where A is an interface and B is a class is not legal in Java.Implements is used for Interfaces and extends is used to extend a class.To make it more clearer in easier terms,an interface is like it sound - an interface - a model, that you need to apply,follow, along with your ideas to it.Extend is used for classes,here,you are extending something that already exists by adding more functionality to it.A few more notes:an interface can extend another interface.And when you need to choose between implementing an interface or extending a class for a particular scenario, go for implementing an interface. Because a class can implement multiple interfaces but extend only one class.Extends : This is used to get attributes of a parent class into base class and may contain already defined methods that can be overridden in the child class.Implements : This is used to implement an interface (parent class with functions signatures only but not their definitions) by defining it in the child class.When a subclass extends a class, it allows the subclass to inherit (reuse) and override code defined in the supertype.\nWhen a class implements an interface, it allows an object created from the class to be used in any context that expects a value of the interface.The real catch here is that while we are implementing anything it simply means we are using those methods as it is. There is no scope for change in their values and return types. But when we are extending anything then it becomes an extension of your class. You can change it, use it, reuse use it and it does not necessarily need to return the same values as it does in superclass. Both keywords are used when creating your own new class in the Java language.Difference:   implements means you are using the elements of a Java Interface in your class.  extends means that you are creating a subclass of the base class you are extending. You can only extend one class in your child class, but you can implement as many interfaces as you would like. Refer to oracle documentation page on interface for more details. This can help to clarify what an interface is, and the conventions around using them.In the most simple terms extends is used to inherit from a class and implements is used to apply an interface in your classextends:implements:if you still have confusion read this: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/subclasses.html\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/usinginterface.htmlWe use SubClass extends SuperClass only when the subclass wants to use some functionality (methods or instance variables) that is already declared in the SuperClass, or if I want to slightly modify the functionality of the SuperClass (Method overriding). But say, for example I have an Animal class(SuperClass) and a Dog class (SubClass) and there are few methods that I have defined in the Animal class eg. doEat(); , doSleep(); ... and many more.Now, my Dog class can simply extend the Animal class, if i want my dog to use any of the methods declared in the Animal class I can invoke those methods by simply creating a Dog object. So this way I can guarantee that I have a dog that can eat and sleep and do whatever else I want the dog to do.Now, imagine, one day some Cat lover comes into our workspace and she tries to extend the Animal class(cats also eat and sleep). She makes a Cat object and starts invoking the methods.But, say, someone tries to make an object of the Animal class. You can tell how a cat sleeps, you can tell how a dog eats, you can tell how an elephant drinks.\nBut it does not make any sense in making an object of the Animal class. Because it is a template and we do not want any general way of eating.So instead, I will prefer to make an abstract class that no one can instantiate but can be used as a template for other classes. So to conclude, Interface is nothing but an abstract class(a pure abstract class) which contains no method implementations but only the definitions(the templates). So whoever implements the interface just knows that they have the templates of doEat(); and doSleep(); but they have to define their own doEat(); and doSleep(); methods according to their need.You extend only when you want to reuse some part of the SuperClass(but keep in mind, you can always override the methods of your SuperClass according to your need) and you implement when you want the templates and you want to define them on your own(according to your need).I will share with you a piece of code: You try it with different sets of inputs and look at the results.Defined Interfaces :As shown in the figure given below, a class extends another class, an interface extends another interface but a class implements an interface.\nFor more details
