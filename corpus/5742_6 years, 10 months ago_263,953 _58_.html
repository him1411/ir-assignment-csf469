I have a DetailsView with a TextBox\nand I want the input data be saved always with the FIRST LETTER IN CAPITAL.Example:How can I achieve this maximizing performance?NOTE:\nBased on the answers and the comments under the answers, many people think this is asking about capitalizing all words in the string. E.g. => Red House It isn\'t, but if that is what you seek, look for one of the answers that uses TitleInfo\'s ToTitleCase method. (NOTE: Those answers are incorrect for the question actually asked.)\nSee TextInfo.ToTitleCase doc for caveats (doesn\'t touch all-caps words - they are considered acronyms; may lowercase letters in middle of words that "shouldn\'t" be lowered, e.g. "McDonald" => "Mcdonald"; not guaranteed to handle all culture-specific subtleties re capitalization rules.)NOTE:\nThe question is ambiguous as to whether letters after the first should be forced to lower case.  The accepted answer assumes that only the first letter should be altered. If you want to force all letters in the string except the first to be lower case, look for an answer containing ToLower, and not containing ToTitleCase.EDIT:\nThis version is shorter. For a faster solution take a look at Equiso\'s answerEDIT 2:\nProbably the fastest solution is Darren\'s (There\'s even a benchmark) although I would change it\'s string.IsNullOrEmpty(s) validation to throw an exception since the original requirement expects for a first letter to exist so it can be uppercased. Note that this code works for a generic string and not particularly on valid values from the Textbox.Old answer:\nThis makes every first letter to upper caseThe right way is to use Culture :You can use "ToTitleCase method"this extention method solve every titlecase problem.easy to usagethe Extention methodFor the first letter, with error checking:And here\'s the same as a handy extensionI took the fastest method from http://www.dotnetperls.com/uppercase-first-letter and converted to extension method:NOTE: The reason using ToCharArray is faster than the alternative char.ToUpper(s[0]) + s.Substring(1), is that only one string is allocated, whereas the Substring approach allocates a string for the substring, then a second string to compose the final result.EDIT: Here is what this approach looks like, combined with the initial test from CarlosMu\xc3\xb1oz accepted answer:If performance/memory usage is an issue then, this one only creates one (1) StringBuilder and one (1) new String of the same size as the Original string.I found something here http://www.dotnetperls.com/uppercase-first-letter :maybe this helps!!This will do it although it will also make sure that there are no errant capitals that are not at the beginning of the word.Try this:Since I happened to be working on this also, and was looking around for any ideas, this is the solution I came to. It uses LINQ, and will be able to capitalize the first letter of a string, even if the first occurrence isn\'t a letter. Here\'s the extension method I ended up making.I\'m sure there\'s a way to optimize or clean this up a little bit.Here\'s a way to do it as an extension method:Can then be called like:And here\'s some unit tests for it:Using regular expressions :)If you only care about first letter being capitalized and  it does not matter the rest of the string you can just select the first character, make it upper case and concatenate it with the rest of the string without the original first character.We need to convert the first character ToString() because we are reading it as a Char array, and Char type does not have ToUpper() method.Easiest way to Capitalize firs letter is:1- Using Sytem.Globalization;`Use the following code:There seems to be a lot of complexity here when all you need is:Noteworthy points:Its an extension method.If the input is null, empty or whitespace the input is returned as is.String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace was introduced with .NET Framework 4. This won\'t work with older frameworks.FluentSharp has the lowerCaseFirstLetter method which does thishttps://github.com/o2platform/FluentSharp/blob/700dc35759db8e2164771a71f73a801aa9379074/FluentSharp.CoreLib/ExtensionMethods/System/String_ExtensionMethods.cs#L575It\'s fastest way:Without changing original string:the following function is correct for all ways:I found that hereThis capitalizes this first letter and every letter following a space and lower cases any other letter.As BobBeechey suggests in his response to this question, the following code will work for this:With this method you can upper the first char of every word.Example\n"HeLlo wOrld"  =>  "Hello World"Seems like none of the solutions given here will deal with a white space before the string.Just adding this as a thought:It should handle this won\'t work on other answers (that sentence has a space in the beginning), and if you don\'t like the space trimming, just pass a false as second parameter (or change the default to false, and pass true if you want to deal with space)Fastest method.Tests show next results (string with 10000000 symbols as input):\nTest resultsI use this to correct names. It basically works on the concept of changing a character to uppercase if it follows a specific pattern, in this case I\'ve gone for space, dash of "Mc".send a string to this function. it will first check string is empty or null, if not string will be all lower chars. then return first char of string upper rest of them lower.TextInfo ti = CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.TextInfo;\nConsole.WriteLine(ti.ToTitleCase(inputString));
