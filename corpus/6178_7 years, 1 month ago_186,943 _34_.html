How do I set a default value in Doctrine 2?Database default values are not "portably" supported. The only way to use database default values is through the columnDefinition mapping attribute where you specify the SQL snippet (DEFAULT cause inclusive) for the column the field is mapped to.You can use:PHP-level default values are preferred as these are also properly available on newly created and persisted objects (Doctrine will not go back to the database after persisting a new object to get the default values).Note that this uses SQL DEFAULT, which is not supported for some fields like BLOB and TEXT.Set up a constructor in your entity and set the default value there.Use: and not: For instance:One more reason why read the documentation for Symfony will never go out of trend. There is a simple solution for my specific case and is to set the field type option empty_data to a default value.Again, this solution is only for the scenario where an empty input in a form sets the DB field to null.None of the previous answers helped me with my specific scenario but I found a solution.I had a form field that needed to behave as follow:I then tried all the recommendations given in here. Let me list them:Symfony form fields override default values set on the Entity class. \nMeaning, your schema for your DB can have a default value defined but if you leave a non-required field empty when submitting your form, the form->handleRequest() inside your form->isValid() method will override those default values on your Entity class and set them to the input field values. If the input field values are blank, then it will set the Entity property to null.http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/forms.html#handling-form-submissionsSet the default value on your controller after form->handleRequest() inside your form->isValid() method:Not a beautiful solution but it works. I could probably make a validation group but there may be people that see this issue as a data transformation rather than data validation, I leave it to you to decide.I also tried to override the Entity setter this way:This, even though it looks cleaner, it doesn\'t work. The reason being that the evil form->handleRequest() method does not use the Model\'s setter methods to update the data (dig into form->setData() for more details).The workaround I used was a LifeCycleCallback. Still waiting to see if there is any more "native" method, for instance @Column(type="string", default="hello default value").You can do it using xml as well:Works for me on a mysql database also:Here is how I solved it for myself. Below is an Entity example with default value for MySQL. However, this also requires the setup of a constructor in your entity, and for you to set the default value there.None of this worked for me. I found some documentation on doctrine\'s site that says to set the value directly to set a default value.http://doctrine-orm.readthedocs.io/projects/doctrine-orm/en/latest/reference/faq.htmlThis inserted the value I wanted.Adding to @romanb brilliant answer.This adds a little overhead in migration, because you obviously cannot create a field with not null constraint and with no default value.With this answer, I encourage you to think why do you need the default value in the database in the first place? And usually it is to allow creating objects with not null constraint.If you use yaml definition for your entity,\nthe following works for me on a postgresql database:I struggled with the same problem. I wanted to have the default value from the database into the entities (automatically). Guess what, I did it :)While setting the value in the constructor would work, using the Doctrine Lifecycle events might be a better solution.By leveraging the prePersist Lifecycle Event, you could set your default value on your entity only on initial persist.
