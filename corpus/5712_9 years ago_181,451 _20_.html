I need an easy way to take a tar file and convert it into a string (and vice versa). Is there a way to do this in Ruby? My best attempt was this:I thought that would be enough to convert it to a string, but then when I try to write it back out like this...It isn\'t the same file. Doing ls -l shows the files are of different sizes, although they are pretty close (and opening the file reveals most of the contents intact). Is there a small mistake I\'m making or an entirely different (but workable) way to accomplish this?First, you should open the file as a binary file. Then you can read the entire file in, in one command.That will get you the entire file in a string.After that, you probably want to file.close. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t do that, file won\xe2\x80\x99t be closed until it is garbage-collected, so it would be a slight waste of system resources while it is open.If you need binary mode, you\'ll need to do it the hard way:If not, shorter and sweeter is:To avoid leaving the file open, it is best to pass a block to File.open.  This way, the file will be closed after the block executes.on os x these are the same for me... could this maybe be extra "\\r" in windows?in any case you may be better of with:how about some open/close safety.Ruby have binary readingor if less than  Ruby 1.9.2You can probably encode the tar file in Base64. Base 64 will give you a pure ASCII representation of the file that you can store in a plain text file. Then you can retrieve the tar file by decoding the text back.You do something like:Have look at the Base64 Rubydocs to get a better idea.If you can encode the tar file by Base64 (and storing it in a plain text file) you can use or to print each (text) line in the cmd.
