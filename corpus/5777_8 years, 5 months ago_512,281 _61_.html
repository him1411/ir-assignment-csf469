I have a simple web service call, generated by a .NET (C#) 2.0 windows app, via the web service proxy generated by Visual Studio, for a web service also written in C# (2.0). This has worked for several years, and continues to do so at the dozen or so places where it is running.A new installation at a new site is running into a problem. When attempting to invoke the web service, it fails with the message saying:Could not establish a trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure\n  channelThe URL of the web service uses SSL (https://) -- but this has been working for a long time (and continues to do so) from many other locations. Where do I look? Could this be a security issue between Windows and .NET that is unique to this install? If so, where do I set up trust relationships? I\'m lost!Thoughts (based on pain in the past):The following snippets will fix the case where there is something wrong with the SSL certificate on the server you are calling.  For example, it may be self-signed or the host name between the certificate and the server may not match.This is dangerous if you are calling a server outside of your direct control, since you can no longer be as sure that you are talking to the server you think you\'re connected to.  However, if you are dealing with internal servers and getting a "correct" certificate is not practical, use the following to tell the web service to ignore the certificate problems and bravely soldier on.The first two use lambda expressions, the third uses regular code.  The first accepts any certificate.  The last two at least check that the host name in the certificate is the one you expect.\n... hope you find it helpfulThe very simple "catch all" solution is this:The solution from sebastian-castaldi is a bit more detailed.I personally like the following solution the most:... then before you do request getting the error, do the followingFound this after consulting Luke\'s SolutionIf you are using Windows 2003, you can try this:Open Microsoft Management Console\n  (Start --> Run --> mmc.exe);Choose File --> Add/Remove Snap-in;In the Standalone tab, choose Add;Choose the Certificates snap-in, and\n  click Add;In the wizard, choose the Computer\n  Account, and then choose Local\n  Computer. Press Finish to end the\n  wizard;Close the Add/Remove Snap-in dialog;Navigate to Certificates (Local\n  Computer) and choose a store to\n  import:If you have the Root CA certificate\n  for the company that issued the\n  certificate, choose Trusted Root\n  Certification Authorities;If you have the certificate for the\n  server itself, choose Other PeopleRight-click the store and choose All\n  Tasks --> ImportFollow the wizard and provide the\n  certificate file you have;After that, simply restart IIS and try\n  calling the web service again.Reference: http://www.outsystems.com/NetworkForums/ViewTopic.aspx?Topic=Web-Services:-Could-not-establish-trust-relationship-for-the-SSL/TLS-...If you do not wan\'t to blindly trust everybody and make a trust exception only for certain hosts the following solution is more appropriate.Then just call Ssl.EnableTrustedHosts when your app starts.Microsoft\'s SSL Diagnostics Tool may be able to help identify the issue.UPDATE the link has been fixed now.Luke wrote a pretty good article about this ..\npretty straight forward .. give this a try Luke\'s Solution Reason (quote from his article (minus cursing))\n".. \n The problem with the code above is that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work if your certificate is not valid. Why would I be posting to a web page with and invalid SSL certificate? Because I\xe2\x80\x99m cheap and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like paying Verisign or one of the other **-*s for a cert to my test box so I self signed it. When I sent the request I got a lovely exception thrown at me:System.Net.WebException \nThe underlying connection was closed. Could not establish trust relationship with remote server.I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about you, but to me that exception looked like something that would be caused by a silly mistake in my code that was causing the POST to fail. So I kept searching, and tweaking and doing all kinds of weird things. Only after I googled the ***n thing I found out that the default behavior after encountering an invalid SSL cert is to throw this very exception.\n.."I just encountered this issue. My resolution was to update the system time by manually syncing to the time servers. To do this you can:In my case this was syncing incorrectly so I had to click it several times before it updated correctly. If it continues to update incorrectly you can even try using a different time server from the server drop-down.I had a similar problem in .NET app in Internet Explorer.I solved the problem adding the certificate (VeriSign Class 3 certificate in my case) to trusted editors certificates.Go to Internet Options-> Content -> Publishers and import itYou can get the certificate if you export it from:Internet Options-> Content -> Certificates -> Intermediate Certification Authorities -> VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority - G5I had this error running against a webserver with url like:but there was no certificate for it, so I got a DNS calledJust putting hint to this solution here since this came up top in google.In my case I was trying to test SSL in my Visual Studio environment using IIS 7.This is what I ended up doing to get it to work:Under my site in the \'Bindings...\' section on the right in IIS, I had    to add the \'https\' binding to port 443 and select "IIS Express  Developement Certificate".Under my site in the \'Advanced Settings...\' section on the right I had to change    the \'Enabled Protocols\' from "http" to "https".Under the \'SSL Settings\' icon I selected \'Accept\' for client    certificates.Then I had to recycle the app pool.I also had to import the local host certificate into my personal store using mmc.exe.My web.config file was already configured correctly, so after I got all the above sorted out, I was able to continue my testing.For those who are having this issue through a VS client side once successfully added a service reference and trying to execute the first call got this exception:\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe underlying connection was closed: Could not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel\xe2\x80\x9d\nIf you are using (like my case) an endpoint URL with the IP address and got this exception, then you should probably need to re-add the service reference doing this steps:Try again :).\nThanksIf not work bad sertificate, when ServerCertificateValidationCallback return true;\nMy ServerCertificateValidationCallback code:My code which the prevented execute ServerCertificateValidationCallback:OnValidateCertificateError function:I disabled CertificateValidation code and ServerCertificateValidationCallback  running very well
