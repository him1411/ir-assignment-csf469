I am trying to add a new APP ID to prepare for App Store submission and got the following error under the bundle ID I provided.An App ID with Identifier \'com.domainName.AppName\' is not available. Please enter a different string.What does this mean? I am trying to add a brand new App ID, of course it does not exist.\nWhat am I missing? I do not remember experience the problem last time I create an App ID.As of Xcode 8, iOS Team Provision Profile Managed by Xcode are now updated by Xcode automatically and correctly. They are not even listed at the Developer Portal, but generated on-the-flight. However, the solution proposed below will still work. I\'ve switched to using the automatic provisioning profiles.Remove INVALID iOS Team Provision Profile Managed by Xcode from Developer Portal and manually create iOS Developer Provision Profile. Download it via Xcode and you should be good to go.I started to experience this after Xcode 7.3 (7D175).What I did before the issue:Tapping "Fix Issue" (the only way, I know to make provision profiles managed by Xcode valid), given the error An App ID with Identifier \'<app id>\' is not available.I have:Now, I am able to Build & Run app to my devices.TL;DR Xcode is very particular about the name you give your App ID in the member center.  Having the correct bundle identifier is not enough.  You must use the specific format shown below for Xcode to "see" your App ID.Update: According to @isaacselement in the comments below, this issue has been resolved in Xcode 7.3.1.@romrom\'s solution of deleting the App ID and having Xcode create a new one was a clue.  Unfortunately it was a nonstarter for me since my App ID was used by a Store app and therefore could not be deleted.However, I discovered through some experimentation that I could solve the problem by manually editing the exiting App ID.  It turns out that Xcode is really picky about the name of the ID, and not just the bundle ID.  For a typical bundle ID such as com.mycompany.appname, the App ID name must be in this format:a name in any other format won\'t be seen by Xcode.How to check if you\'re affected / How to FixP.S. There are some related problems if you\'re using Xcode 7.3 in which it won\'t automatically create proper distribution profiles for you, even if you fix the name as I mentioned above.  The solution is to downgrade to 7.2.1 or 7.3 Beta or use a tool like fastlane/sigh.I had the same issue and solved by following steps below:Go to Xcode Preferences > Accounts > Choose your Apple ID accountTap on View DetailsTap on Download all and then DoneHowever it was working fine earlier but I don\'t know the reason why it stopped suddenly. I have gone through the steps above and found it working properly.Solution for Xcode 7.3.Go to Find certificate for your App ID, it should be invalid, Edit, Select your iOS Distribution certificate, Generate. Go to: You may have no app with that same ID, but someone else may. The IDs must be unique globally, and not only within your own apps.Version 7.3 (7D175)The Application ID Name should be same as application bundle identifier, if you application bundle identifier is com.abc.xyz than the application ID name for this  bundle ID should be XC com abc xyz A name in any other format won\'t be seen by Xcode.TARGETS->General->IdentityAt first, modify the value of \'Bundle Identifier\', so that it is different from the previous value.Then team chose \'None\'. Xcode6~Xcode7.3.1Same issue happened with me, it might be that Xcode automatically selected another team name, its solved by choosing my correct team name.\nGood luck !I got solution for this kind of problem by selecting this option at the time of build export.Regularly I select second option for build export process but after installing Xcode 7.3 when I try to export build at that time I receive above error. After some sort of forum discussion, I conclude that I need to select last option now to export build. I hope this information become helpful to other members of forum as well.If you\'ve updated your profiles, and none of the other good answers are working for you, try selecting "Use local signing assets" when it asks you to "select a Development Team to use for provisioning:".  I\'d made sure everything else was in order, but it still wasn\'t working.  Using local signing assets worked perfectly.Edit: It looks like Xcode 7.3.1 fixes this issue.\n"- Fixed an issue that could prevent the export of an ad-hoc build from an archive"I received the same error after a reinstall of the OS on my developer mac and upgrading to xcode 7.3. The Download all -button was my savior.\nI faced the same problem when i upgraded my Xcode to 7.3 and it showed me the same error in every project.\nThe simplest solution that i found was to just the remove the apple account from Xcode and add it again.\n        To remove just go to Xcode > Preferences > Select the account and click on - sign.\nand to add click on + sign and add the apple ID corresponding to your app.After you add the account your problem would be solved..\nIf in case this still doesn\'t work . Then perform a next step of regenerating the profile (just click edit and then generate ) and then downloading your provisioning profile again and run it. I bet that would work .Hope this helps.\nAll the bestI realize this couldn\'t have been the cause of the original problem, because Xcode 6 wasn\'t available then, but I\'ll leave the answer anyway in case it helps someone.Xcode 6 now registers your bundle ID for you automatically, so you don\'t have to.  It\'ll be somewhere in the list on a line starting with "Xcode iOS App ID".When I experienced the "An app with identifier XXX is not available" error in trying to switch on iCloud support in Xcode\'s Capabilities tab, I found that I had to:Give my app an explicit custom bundle id,Register my app manually at the Member Center, explicitly requesting iCloud support entitlements there.After that, switching on iCloud support in Xcode worked. So, I suggest trying the same thing. Sometimes, things work better when you do them at the Member Center.Update to Xcode 7.3.1, they have fixed this bug. I just had this problem. This is my configuration:I\'ve got an iPhone Developer Certificate in a developer account (Apple Store) and an Enterprise account. These 2 certificates have the same name in my keychain: iPhone Developer : firstName lastNameI assume Xcode doesn\'t know which one to take and pick the wrong one.I fix it by selecting the good one in Xcode > Build Settings > Code Signing.\nIt was previously set to iOS Developer.I had same problem and the quick fix is:Clean and run. That\'s it.Purge or Fix all of the invalid and expired provisioning profiles.  Even though they appeared to be unrelated.We encountered this when we attempted to recompile an app that was previously working fine.  Nothing worked until we cleaned up the provisioning profiles.Then click on "Download All" under the "Provisioning Profiles" area of the Apple Id account for the appropriate team.Possibly related to XCode 7.3If you encountered this error while making an ad hoc deployment, this is now fixed in the XCode 7.3.1 release (May 3th, 2016) : https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12Changelog 7.3.1 :For me, the problem happened because I first created a new AppID and then created a new app with the bundle identifier of the AppID in iTunes Connect, and then tried to connect my development app with the AppID from within Xcode.In this case, Xcode assumed that the AppID has already been registered by someone.To resolve the issue, you first change the bundle identifier in your app (in iTunes Connect\'s MyApp section) to some temporary values (or if you don\'t have any, create a dummy AppID such as com.yourcompany.testapp), delete the AppID in Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles page, and try connecting it from within Xcode, not from within Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles, by pushing the fixing issue button in Xcode.I had the same issue on submission process and solved by Selecting Appstore provision instead of AdHoc. Simple!!Hope this helps. All the best :)This may only apply to the latest version of Xcode (7.3 D175), recently release:Press the Try Again ButtonAfter several hours of fiddling with Xcode build settings and starting the Certificate/App ID/Provisioning Profile dance from scratch, I ended up at the same place, same error message, App ID not available.In frustration, I pressed the Try Again button thinking it was futile. But it worked.I had this same issue in Xcode 7.3. To solve it I performed the following:For me the solution was to change the bundle identifier by replacing the period separator to dashes. I changed com.mycompany.appname to com-mycompany-appname.I had Distribution Provisioning for my Apple ID for the App Store only and still gave me that error: An App ID with Identifier \'\' is not available. Please enter a different stringI recently updated to Xcode 7.3 and probably that caused the issue. So what I did was creating iOS Development Provisioning by selecting all devices that I want to test in iOS Dev. Center (Member Center). Then Opened Xcode -> Preferences and under my account downloaded the newly created Development Provisioning for that App ID. When did that, the error disappeared. This seems to be a bit of a generic message. I\'m sure many of the answers are correct. For me it was a mismatch between the entitlements and settings for the app in the member portal. My solution was this:This is for those who bump into the odd case I did, you CANNOT use the keyword test in the bundle id. We were needing to test sharing data through the app group feature and the companion app wasn\'t developed yet so we simply changed the bundle identifier to test.APP_NAME instead of company.APP_NAME. We set up everything in iTunes Connect and nothing worked right. We then swapped the name to beta.APP_NAME and Xcode was able to manage the app id correctly again. Normally to fix this issue, verify your provisioning profiles and App Id\'s have the correct settings, and if your still having trouble to to Xcode -> Preferences -> Accounts -> View Details -> Download All and you should be good. Hope that helps. com.domainName.AppNamethis is the bundle identifier. based on this identifier only once can send push notifications and inapt purchases. so app made this as an unique id for app. So try with a new name as "com.domainName.YourName"I had a similar issue. I check all settings in Xcode all were proper. When I tried to upload app using Archive it was giving an error Then after I tried to upload app via "Application Loader" and got success!If not the AppId\'s business,just try to change the Team in TARGETS/identity to your company\'s team.
