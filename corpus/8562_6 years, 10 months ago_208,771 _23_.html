How is the conditional operator (? :) used in Ruby?For example, is this correct?It is the ternary operator, and it works like in C (the parenthesis are not required). It\'s an expression that works like:However, in Ruby, if is also an expression so: if a then b else c end === a ? b : c, except for precedence issues. Both are expressions.Examples:Note that in the first case parenthesis are required (otherwise Ruby is confused because it thinks it is puts if 1 with some extra junk after it), but they are not required in the last case as said issue does not arise.You can use the "long-if" form for readability on multiple lines:Your use of ERB suggests that you are in Rails.  If so, then consider truncate, a built-in helper which will do the job for you:@pst gave a great answer, but I\'d like to mention that in Ruby the ternary operator is written on one line to be syntactically correct, unlike Perl and C where we can write it on multiple lines:Normally Ruby will raise an error if you attempt to split it across multiple lines, but you can use the \\ line-continuation symbol at the end of a line and Ruby will be happy:This is a simple example, but it can be very useful when dealing with longer lines as it keeps the code nicely laid out.It\'s also possible to use the ternary without the line-continuation characters by putting the operators last on the line, but I don\'t like or recommend it:I think that leads to really hard to read code as the conditional test and/or results get longer.I\'ve read comments saying not to use the ternary operator because it\'s confusing, but that is a bad reason to not use something. By the same logic we shouldn\'t use regular expressions, range operators (\'..\' and the seemingly unknown "flip-flop" variation). They\'re powerful when used correctly, so we should learn to use them correctly.Why have you put brackets around true?Consider the OP\'s example:Wrapping the conditional test helps make it more readable because it visually separates the test:Of course, the whole example could be made a lot more readable by using some judicious additions of whitespace. This is untested but you\'ll get the idea:Or, more written more idiomatically:It\'d be easy to argument that readability suffers badly from question.question too.A simple example where the operator checks if player\'s id is 1 and sets enemy id depending on the resultAnd I found a post about to the topic which seems pretty helpful.One small variation of this is to use the convert to boolean !! operator like this
