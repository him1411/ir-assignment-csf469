In Perl I can repeat a character multiple times using the syntax:Is there a simple way to accomplish this in Javascript? I can obviously use a function, but I was wondering if there was any built in approach, or some other clever technique.(Note that an array of length 11 gets you only 10 "a"s, since Array.join puts the argument between the array elements.)Simon also points out that according to this jsperf, it appears that it\'s faster in Safari and Chrome (but not Firefox) to repeat a character multiple times by simply appending using a for loop (although a bit less concise).In a new ES6 harmony, you will have native way for doing this with repeat. Also ES6 right now only experimental, this feature is already available in Edge, FF, Chrome and SafariAnd surely if repeat function is not available you can use old-good Array(n + 1).join("abc")Convenient if you repeat yourself a lot:The most performance-wice way is https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/repeatShort version is below.Polyfill from Mozilla:An alternative is: If you need to repeat multiple chars, multiply your conditional:NOTE: You do not have to overshoot by 1 as with word = Array(11).join(\'a\')If you\'re not opposed to including a library in your project, lodash has a repeat function.https://lodash.com/docs#repeatIn ES2015/ES6 you can use "*".repeat(n) So just add this to your projects, and your are good to go.The following function will perform a lot faster than the option suggested in the accepted answer:You\'d use it like this :To compare the performance of this function with that of the option proposed in the accepted answer, see this Fiddle and this Fiddle for benchmarks.In modern browsers, you can now do this using String.prototype.repeat method:Read more about this method on MDN.This option is even faster. Unfortunately, it doesn\'t work in any version of Internet explorer. The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully supports the method:Another interesting way to quickly repeat n character is to use idea from quick exponentiation algorithm:For repeat a value in my projects i use repeatFor example:but be careful because this method has been added to the ECMAScript 6 specification.Although the most voted answer is a bit more compact, with this approach you don\'t have to add an extra array item.Here is what I use:I\'m going to expand on @bonbon\'s answer. His method is an easy way to "append N chars to an existing string", just in case anyone needs to do that. For example since "a google" is a 1 followed by 100 zeros.NOTE: You do have to add the length of the original string to the conditional.You can also try this simple function I found at the node.js core source code:Lodash offers a similar functionality as the Javascript repeat() function which is not available in all browers. It is called _.repeat and available since version 3.0.0:Can be used as a one-liner too:In CoffeeScript:Here is an ES6 version
