Are there any existing user authentication libraries for node.js? In particular I\'m looking for something that can do password authentication for a user (using a custom backend auth DB), and associate that user with a session.Before I wrote an auth library, I figured I would see if folks knew of existing libraries. Couldn\'t find anything obvious via a google search.-ShreyasIf you are looking for an authentication framework for Connect or Express, Passport is worth investigating: https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport(Disclosure: I\'m the developer of Passport)I developed Passport after investigating both connect-auth and everyauth.  While they are both great modules, they didn\'t suit my needs.  I wanted something that was more light-weight and unobtrusive.Passport is broken down into separate modules, so you can choose to use only what you need (OAuth, only if necessary).  Passport also does not mount any routes in your application, giving you the flexibility to decide when and where you want authentication, and hooks to control what happens when authentication succeeds or fails.For example, here is the two-step process to setup form-based (username and password) authentication:Additional strategies are available for authentication via Facebook, Twitter, etc.  Custom strategies can be plugged-in, if necessary.I guess the reason that you haven\'t found many good libraries is that using a library for authentication is mostly over engineered.What you are looking for is just a session-binder :) A session with:thats it.I\'m using also connect but I do not use connect-auth for two reasons:IMHO breaks connect-auth the very powerful and easy to read onion-ring architecture of connect. A no-go - my opinion :). \nYou can find a very good and short article about how connect works and the onion ring idea here.If you - as written - just want to use a basic or http login with database or file. Connect-auth is way too big. It\'s more for stuff like OAuth 1.0,  OAuth 2.0 & Co(It\'s complete. Just execute it for testing but if you want to use it in production, make sure to use https)\n(And to be REST-Principle-Compliant you should use a POST-Request instead of a GET-Request b/c you change a state :)I wrote this statement over a year ago and have currently no active node projects. So there are may be API-Changes in Express. Please add a comment if I should change anything.Looks like the connect-auth plugin to the connect middleware is exactly what I need: http://wiki.github.com/ciaranj/connect-auth/creating-a-form-based-strategyI\'m using express [ http://expressjs.com ] so the connect plugin fits in very nicely since express is subclassed (ok - prototyped) from connectI was basically looking for the same thing. Specifically, I wanted the following:What I ended up doing was creating my own middleware function check_auth that I pass as an argument to each route I want authenticated. check_auth merely checks the session and if the user is not logged in, then redirects them to the login page, like so:Then for each route, I ensure this function is passed as middleware. For example:Finally, we need to actually handle the login process. This is straightforward:At any rate, this approach was mostly designed to be flexible and simple. I\'m sure there are numerous ways to improve it. If you have any, I\'d very much like your feedback.EDIT: This is a simplified example. In a production system, you\'d never want to store & compare passwords in plain text. As a commenter points out, there are libs that can help manage password security.Also have a look at everyauth if you want third party/social network login integration.Here is some code for basic authentication from one of my projects. I use it against CouchDB with and additional auth data cache, but I stripped that code.Wrap an authentication method around you request handling, and provide a second callback for unsuccessfull authentication. The success callback will get the username as an additional parameter. Don\'t forget to correctly handle requests with wrong or missing credentials in the failure callback:A few years have passed and I\'d like to introduce my authentication solution for Express. It\'s called Lockit. You can find the project on GitHub and a short intro at my blog.So what are the differences to the existing solutions?Take a look at the examples.A different take on authentication is Passwordless, a token-based authentication module for express that circumvents the inherent problem of passwords [1]. It\'s fast to implement, doesn\'t require too many forms, and offers better security for the average user (full disclosure: I\'m the author).[1]: Passwords are ObsoleteThere is a project called Drywall that implements a user login system with Passport and also has a user management admin panel. If you\'re looking for a fully-featured user authentication and management system similar to something like what Django has but for Node.js, this is it. I found it to be a really good starting point for building a node app that required a user authentication and management system. See Jared Hanson\'s answer for information on how Passport works.Here are two popular Github libraries for node js authentication:https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport ( suggestible )https://nodejsmodules.org/pkg/everyauthQuick simple example using mongo, for an API that provides user auth for ie Angular clientin app.jsfor your route something like this:Then in your routes that require auth you can just check for the user session:Here is a new authentication library that uses timestamped tokens.  The tokens can be emailed or texted to users without the need to store them in a database.  It can be used for passwordless authentication or for two-factor authentication.https://github.com/vote539/easy-no-passwordDisclosure: I am the developer of this library.
