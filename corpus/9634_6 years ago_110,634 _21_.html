I am new to Maven. I am trying to package my project. But, it automatically runs the tests. The tests insert some content in the database. This is not what I want, I need to avoid running tests while package the application. Anybody knows how run the package with out test?Run maven with -Dmaven.test.skip=trueJust provide the command mentioned below which will ignore executing the test cases,you can add this plugin configuration to your pom if you do not want to set command line arg:Note that -Dmaven.test.skip prevents Maven building the test-jar artifact. If you\'d like to skip tests but create artifacts as per a normal build use:You can pass the maven.test.skip flag as a JVM argument, to skip running tests when the package phase (and the previous ones in the default lifecycle) is run:You can also pass the skipTests flag alone to the mvn executable. If you want to include this information in your POM, you can create a new profile where you can configure the maven-surefire-plugin to skip tests.If you are trying this in Windows Powershell, you will get this error:The reason for this is, in Powershell the "-" has special meaning and it is causing problem with maven.The solution is to prepend it with a backtick (`), like so..Reference: http://kuniganotas.wordpress.com/2011/08/12/invalid-task-test-skiptrue-you-must-specify-a-valid-lifecycle-phase/is also a way to add in pom fileYou only have to provide No longer need the \'=true\' there.Answering an old and accepted question here. You can add this in your pom.xml if you want to avoid passing command line argument all the time:Tests should always[1] run before package. If you need to turn off the tests, you\'re doing something wrong. In other words, you\'re trying to solve the wrong problem. Figure out what your problem really is, and ask that question. It sounds like it\'s database-related.[1] You might skip tests when you need to quickly generate an artifact for local, development use, but in general, creating an artifact should always follow a successful test run.You are, obviously, doing it the wrong way. Testing is an important part of pre-packaging. You shouldn\'t ignore or skip it, but rather do it the right way. Try changing the database to which it inserts the data(like test_db). It may take a while to set it up. And to make sure this database can be used forever, you should delete all the data by the end of tests. JUnit4 has annotations which make it easy for you. Use @Before, @After @Test annotations for the right methods. You need to spend sometime on it, but it will be worth it!mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true worked for me since the -Dskip did not work anymore.
