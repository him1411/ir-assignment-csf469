I am writing a shell script to run under the KornShell (ksh) on AIX. I would like to use the mkdir command to create a directory. But the directory may already exist, in which case I do not want to do anything. So I want to either test to see that the directory does not exist, or suppress the "File exists" error that mkdir throws when it tries to create an existing directory. Any thoughts on how best to do this?Try mkdir -p:Note that this will also create any intermediate directories that don\'t exist; for instance,will create directories foo, foo/bar, and foo/bar/baz if they don\'t exist.If you want an error when parent directories don\'t exist, and want to create the directory if it doesn\'t exist, then you can test for the existence of the directory first:This should work:or:which will create the directory if it doesn\'t exist, but warn you if the name of the directory you\'re trying to create is already in use by something other than a directory.Use the -p flag.  Defining complex directory trees with one commandThe old tried and truewill do what you want with none of the race conditions many of the other solutions have.Sometimes the simplest (and ugliest) solutions are the best.If you don\'t want to show any error message:If you want to show your own error message:Or if you want to check for existence first:-e is the exist test for korn shell.You can also try googling a korn shell manual.mkdir foo works even if the directory exists.\nTo make it work only if the directory named "foo" does not exist, try using the -p flag.Example :-This will create the directory named "foo" only if it does not exist. :)mkdir does not support -p switch anymore on Windows 8+ systems.You can use this:The following code will raise all errors except the \'dir already exists\' error. It will also fail if a file named "dirName" already exists:Furthermore, it will create directories recursively, i.e., will create both \'dir1\' and \'dir2\'
