I am using git from the command line, and trying to add a line break to the commit message (using git commit -m "") without going into vim.Is this possible?Certainly, how it\'s done depends on your shell. In bash, you can use single quotes around the message, and just leave the quote open, which will make bash prompt for another line, until you close the quote. Like this:Alternatively, you can use a "here document":Using git from the command line with bash you can do the following:Simply type and press Enter when you want a new line, the ">" symbol means that you have pressed Enter and there is a new line. Other answers work also. If you just want, say, a head line and a content line, you can use:You should be able to useFrom the Bash manual:Words of the form $\'string\' are treated specially. The word expands to\n  string, with backslash-escaped characters replaced as specified by the\n  ANSI C standard.This includes support for newlines as shown above, plus hex and Unicode codes and others. Go to the linked section to see a list of the backslash-escaped characters.Adding line breaks to your git commitTry the following to create a multi-line commit message:Then verify what you\'ve done:You should end up with something like this:The screen shot is from an example I set up using Powershell with Poshgit.Doing something like:doesn\'t work, but something like:works, but its not very pretty. You setup a git-commitlb command in your PATH which does something like this:and use it like this:Word of warning, I have a feeling that the general convention is to have a summary line as the first line, and then two line breaks, and then an extended message in the commit message, so doing something like this would break that convention. You could of course do:I use zsh on a Mac and I can post multi-line commit messages within double quotes ("). Basically I keep typing and pressing return for new lines, but the message isn\'t sent to git until I close the quotes and return.I hope this isn\'t leading too far away from the posted question but wouldn\'t setting the default editor and then usingbe much more comfortable?From git documentation-m <msg>\n  --message=<msg>\n  Use the given <msg> as the commit message. If multiple -m options are given, their values are concatenated as separate paragraphs.So, if you are looking for grouping multiple commit messages this should do the work.You could use git commit -m "$(echo)" or git commit -m $\'\\n\'Personally, I find it easiest to modify commit messages after the fact in vi (or whatever your git editor of choice is) rather than on the command line, by doing git commit --amend right after git commit.If you are using bash, hit C-x C-e (Ctrl+x Ctrl+e) and it will open the current command in your preferred editor.You can change the preferred editor by tweaking VISUAL and EDITOR.That\'s what I have in my .bashrc:
