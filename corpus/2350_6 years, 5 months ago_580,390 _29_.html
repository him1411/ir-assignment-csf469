Actually I want to read the contents that come after the search query, when it is done. The problem is that the URL only accepts POST methods, and it does not take any action with GET method...I have to read all contents with the help of domdocument or file_get_contents(). Is there any method that will let me send parameters with POST method and then read the contents via PHP?CURL-less method with PHP5:See the PHP manual for more information on the method and how to add headers, for example:I did try this one and it is working fine... as I rquired..I use the following function to post data using curl:I recommend you to use the open-source package guzzle that is fully unit tested and uses the latest coding practices.Installing GuzzleGo to the command line in your project folder and type in the following command (assuming you already have the package manager composer installed). If you need help how to install Composer, you should have a look here.Using Guzzle to send a POST requestThe usage of Guzzle is very straight forward as it uses a light-weight object-oriented API:There\'s another CURL method if you are going that way.This is pretty straightforward once you get your head around the way the PHP curl extension works, combining various flags with setopt() calls. In this example I\'ve got a variable $xml which holds the XML I have prepared to send - I\'m going to post the contents of that to example\'s test method.First we initialised the connection, then we set some options using setopt(). These tell PHP that we are making a post request, and that we are sending some data with it, supplying the data. The CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER flag tells curl to give us the output as the return value of curl_exec rather than outputting it. Then we make the call and close the connection - the result is in $response.If you by any chance are using Wordpress to develop your app (it\'s actually a convenient way to get authorization, info pages etc even for very simple stuff), you can use the following snippet:It uses different ways of making the actual HTTP request, depending on what is available on the web server. For more details, see the HTTP API documentation.If you don\'t want to develop a custom theme or plugin to start the Wordpress engine, you can just do the following in an isolated PHP file in the wordpress root:It won\'t show any theme or output any HTML, just hack away with the Wordpress APIs!I was looking for a similar problem and found a better approach of doing this. So here it goes.You can simply put the following line on the redirection page (say page1.php).I need this to redirect POST requests for REST API calls. This solution is able to redirect with post data as well as custom header values.Here is the reference link.There is one more which you can useClick here for detailsI\'d like to add some thoughts about the curl-based answer of Fred Tanrikut. I know most of them are already written in the answers above, but I think it is a good idea to show an answer that includes all of them together. Here is the class I wrote to make HTTP-GET/POST/PUT/DELETE requests based on curl, concerning just about the response body:You can also make some cool service tests by using this simple class.Try PEAR\'s HTTP_Request2 package to easily send POST requests. Alternatively, you can use PHP\'s curl functions or use a PHP stream context.HTTP_Request2 also makes it possible to mock out the server, so you can unit-test your code easily
