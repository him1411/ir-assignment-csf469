I have seen a few different styles of writing docstrings in Python, is there an official or "agreed-upon" style?Python docstrings can be written following several formats as the other posts showed. However the default Sphinx docstring format was not mentioned and is based on reStructuredText (reST). You can get some information about the main formats in that tuto.Note that the reST is recommended by the PEP 287There follows the main used formats for docstrings.Historically a javadoc like style was prevalent, so it was taken as a base for Epydoc (with the called Epytext format) to generate documentation.Example:Nowadays, the probably more prevalent format is the reStructuredText (reST) format that is used by Sphinx to generate documentation.\nNote: it is used by default in JetBrains PyCharm (type triple quotes after defining a method and hit enter). It is also used by default as output format in Pyment.Example:Google has their own format that is often used. It also can be interpreted by Sphinx. Example:Even more examplesNote that Numpy recommend to follow their own numpydoc based on Google format and usable by Sphinx.It is possible to use a tool like Pyment to automatically generate docstrings to a Python project not yet documented, or to convert existing docstrings (can be mixing several formats) from a format to an other one.Note: The examples are taken from the Pyment documentationThe Google style guide contains an excellent Python style guide. It includes conventions for readable docstring syntax that offers better guidance than PEP-257. For example:I like to extend this to also include type information in the arguments, as described in this Sphinx documentation tutorial. For example:Docstring conventions are in PEP-257 with much more detail than PEP-8.However, docstrings seem to be far more personal than other areas of code. Different projects will have their own standard. I tend to always include docstrings, because they tend to demonstrate how to use the function and what it does very quickly. I prefer to keep things consistent, regardless of the length of the string. I like how to code looks when indentation and spacing are consistent. That means, I use:Over:And tend to leave off commenting on the first line in longer docstrings:Meaning I find docstrings that start like this to be messy.As apparantly no one mentioned it: you can also use the Numpy Docstring Standard. It is widely used in the scientific community.The Napolean sphinx extension to parse Google-style docstrings (recommended in the answer of @Nathan) also supports Numpy-style docstring, and makes a short comparison of both.And last a basic example to give an idea how it looks like:PEP-8 is the official python coding standard. It contains a section on docstrings, which refers to PEP-257 -- a complete specification for docstrings.Python\'s official styles are listed in PEP-8.I suggest using Vladimir Keleshev\'s pep257 Python program to check your docstrings against PEP-257 and the Numpy Docstring Standard for describing parameters, returns, etc.pep257 will report divergence you make from the standard and is called like pylint and pep8.It\'s Python; anything goes. Consider how to publish your documentation. Docstrings are invisible except to readers of your source code.People really like to browse and search documentation on the web. To achieve that, use the documentation tool Sphinx. It\'s the de-facto standard for documenting Python projects. The product is beautiful - take a look at https://python-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ . The website Read the Docs will host your docs for free.
