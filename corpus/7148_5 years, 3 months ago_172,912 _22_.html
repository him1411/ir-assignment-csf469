I\'m running Ubuntu 11.10. Any ideas? I\'ve tried rebooting my system to no avail.That\'s it! There is no command for deleting your virtual environment. Simply deactivate it and rid your application of its artifacts by recursively removing it.Just to echo what @skytreader had previously commented, rmvirtualenv is a command provided by virtualenvwrapper, not virtualenv. Maybe you didn\'t have virtualenvwrapper installed?See VirtualEnvWrapper Command Reference for more details.rmvirtualenvRemove an environment, in the WORKON_HOME.Syntax:You must use deactivate before removing the current environment.Reference: http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.htmlYou can remove all the dependencies by recursively uninstalling all of them and then delete the venv.Edit including Isaac Turner commentarySimply remove the virtual environment from the system.There\'s no special command for itif you are windows user, then it\'s in C:\\Users\\your_user_name\\Envs. You can delete it from there. Also try in command prompt rmvirtualenv environment name. I tried with command prompt so it said deleted but it was still existed. So i manually delete it. so, I have done a bit of google, but none of the answers were satisfactory.But accidentally , while scrolling through man pages of pip(utility to install python supported packages -  virtualenv is one of them) , it was documented to use of "uninstall" keyword with pip, below is exact output straight from my terminalThe directory \'/home/indresh/.cache/pip/http\' or its parent directory is not owned by the current user and the cache has been disabled. Please check the permissions and owner of that directory. If executing pip with sudo, you may want sudo\'s -H flag.
