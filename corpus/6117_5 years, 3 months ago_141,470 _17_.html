I want to delete the file filename if it exists.  Is it proper to sayIs there a better way? A one-line way? A more pythonic way would be:Although this takes even more lines and looks very ugly, it avoids the unnecessary call to os.path.exists() and follows the python convention of overusing exceptions.It may be worthwhile to write a function to do this for you:I prefer to suppress an exception rather than checking for the file\'s existence, to avoid a TOCTTOU bug.  Matt\'s answer is a good example of this, but we can simplify it slightly under Python 3, using contextlib.suppress():If filename is a pathlib.Path object instead of a string, we can call its .unlink() method instead of using os.remove().  In my experience, Path objects are more useful than strings for filesystem manipulation.Since everything in this answer is exclusive to Python 3, it provides yet another reason to upgrade.os.path.exists returns True for folders as well as files. Consider using os.path.isfile to check for whether the file exists instead.In the spirit of Andy Jones\' answer, how about an authentic ternary operation:Another way to know if the file (or files) exists, and to remove it, is using the module glob.Glob finds all the files that could select the pattern with a *nix wildcard, and loops the list.Something like this? Takes advantage of short-circuit evaluation. If the file does not exist, the whole conditional cannot be true, so python will not bother evaluation the second part. is a one-liner.Many of you may disagree - possibly for reasons like considering the proposed use of ternaries "ugly" - but this begs the question of whether we should listen to people used to ugly standards when they call something non-standard "ugly".os.remove is supposed to work fine:
