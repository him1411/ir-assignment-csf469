Can JavaScript classes/objects have constructors? How are they created?Using prototypes:Hiding "color" (somewhat resembles a private member variable):Usage:Here\'s a template I sometimes use for OOP-similar behavior in JavaScript. As you can see, you can simulate private (both static and instance) members using closures. What new MyClass() will return is an object with only the properties assigned to the this object and in the prototype object of the "class."I\'ve been asked about inheritance using this pattern, so here goes:And an example to use it all:As you can see, the classes correctly interact with each other (they share the static id from MyClass, the announce method uses the correct get_name method, etc.)One thing to note is the need to shadow instance properties. You can actually make the inherit function go through all instance properties (using hasOwnProperty) that are functions, and automagically add a super_<method name> property. This would let you call this.super_get_name() instead of storing it in a temporary value and calling it bound using call.For methods on the prototype you don\'t need to worry about the above though, if you want to access the super class\' prototype methods, you can just call this.constructor.super.prototype.methodName. If you want to make it less verbose you can of course add convenience properties. :)It seems to me most of you are giving example of getters and setters not a constructor, ie http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructor_(object-oriented_programming).lunched-dan was closer but the example didn\'t work in jsFiddle.This example creates a private constructor function that only runs during the creation of the object.If you wanted to assign public properties then the constructor could be defined as such:So what is the point of "constructor"\n  property? Cannot figure out where it\n  could be useful, any ideas?The point of the constructor property is to provide some way of pretending JavaScript has classes. One of the things you cannot usefully do is change an object\'s constructor after it\'s been created. It\'s complicated.I wrote a fairly comprehensive piece on it a few years ago: http://joost.zeekat.nl/constructors-considered-mildly-confusing.htmlExample here: http://jsfiddle.net/FZ5nC/Try this template:You must adjust your namespace if you are defining a static class:Example class:Example instantiation:Notice functions are defined as A.B = function A_B(). This is to make your script easier to debug. Open Chrome\'s Inspect Element panel, run this script, and expand the debug backtrace:This is a constructor:When you doMyClass is executed, and a new object is returned of that class.I found this tutorial very useful. This approach is used by most of jQuery plug-ins. http://www.htmlgoodies.com/html5/tutorials/create-an-object-oriented-javascript-class-constructor.html#fbid=OVYAQL_TDpKNow ,This pattern has served me well. With this pattern, you create classes in separate files, load them into your overall app "as needed".Yes, you can define a constructor inside a class declaration like this:I guess I\'ll post what I do with javascript closure since no one is using closure yet. Comments and suggestions to this solution are welcome. :)Using Nick\'s sample above, you can create a constructor for objects without parameters using a return statement as the last statement in your object definition. Return your constructor function as below and it will run the code in __construct each time you create the object:They do if you use Typescript - open source from MicroSoft :-)Typescript lets you \'fake\' OO constructs that are compiled into javascript constructs. If you\'re starting a large project it may save you a lot of time and it just reached milestone 1.0 version.http://www.typescriptlang.org/Content/TypeScript%20Language%20Specification.pdfThe above code gets \'compiled\' to :In JavaScript the invocation type defines the behaviour of the function:The function is invoked as a constructor when calling using new operator:Any instance or prototype object in JavaScript have a property constructor, which refers to the constructor function.  Check this post about constructor property.While using Blixt\'s great template from above, I found out that it doesn\'t work well with multi-level inheritance (MyGrandChildClass extending MyChildClass extending MyClass) \xe2\x80\x93 it cycles on calling first parent\'s constructor over and over. So here is a simple workaround \xe2\x80\x93 if you need multi-level inheritance, instead of using this.constructor.super.call(this, surName); use chainSuper(this).call(this, surName); with the chain function defined like this:http://www.jsoops.net/ is quite good for oop in Js. If provide private, protected, public variable and function, and also Inheritance feature. Example Code:just to offer up some variety. ds.oop is a nice way to declare classes with constructors in javascript. It supports every possible type of inheritance (Including 1 type that even c# does not support) as well as Interfaces which is nice.Maybe it\'s gotten a little simpler, but below is what I\'ve come up with now in 2017:In using the class above, I have the following:As you can see, the constructor takes in two parameters, and we set the object\'s properties. We also alter the object\'s color and shape by using the setter functions, and prove that its change remained upon calling getInfo() after these changes.A bit late, but I hope this helps. I\'ve tested this with a mocha unit-testing, and it\'s working well.In most cases you have to somehow declare the property you need before you can call a method that passes in this information. If you do not have to initially set a property you can just call a method within the object like so. Probably not the most pretty way of doing this but this still works.
