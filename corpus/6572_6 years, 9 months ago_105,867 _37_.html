Is there a way to create a link in Markdown that opens in a new window? If not, what syntax do you recommend to do this. I\'ll add it to the markdown compiler I use. I think it should be an option.As far as the Markdown syntax is concerned, if you want to get that detailed, you\'ll just have to use HTML.Most Markdown engines I\'ve seen allow plain old HTML, just for situations like this where a generic text markup system just won\'t cut it. (The StackOverflow engine, for example.) They then run the entire output through an HTML whitelist filter, regardless, since even a Markdown-only document can easily contain XSS attacks. As such, if you or your users want to create _blank links, then they probably still can.If that\'s a feature you\'re going to be using often, it might make sense to create your own syntax, but it\'s generally not a vital feature. If I want to launch that link in a new window, I\'ll ctrl-click it myself, thanks.Kramdown supports it. It\'s compatibile with standard Markdown syntax, but has many extensions too. You would use it like this:I don\'t think there is a markdown feature.Though there may be other options available if you want to open links which point outside your own site automatically with JavaScript. jsFiddle.If you\'re using jQuery it\'s a tad simpler...jsFiddle.With Markdown-2.5.2, you can use this:You can do this via native javascript code like so:JSFiddle CodeIn my project I\'m doing this and it works fine:LinkBut not all parsers let you do that.For ghost markdown use:Found it here:\nhttps://cmatskas.com/open-external-links-in-a-new-window-ghost/There\'s no easy way to do it, and like @alex has noted you\'ll need to use JavaScript. His answer is the best solution but in order to optimize it, you might want to filter only to the post-content links.The code is compatible with IE8+ and you can add it to the bottom of your page. Note that you\'ll need to change the ".post-content a" to the class that you\'re using for your posts.As seen here: http://blog.hubii.com/target-_blank-for-links-on-ghost/You can add any attributes using {[attr]="[prop]"}For example [Google] (http://www.google.com){target="_blank"}I\'m using Grav CMS and this works perfectly:Body/Content:\nSome text[1]Body/Reference:\n[1]: http://somelink.com/?target=_blankJust make sure that the target attribute is passed first, if there are additional attributes in the link, copy/paste them to the end of the reference URL.I ran into this problem when trying to implement markdown using PHP. Since the user generated links created with markdown need to open in a new tab but site links need to stay in tab I changed markdown to only generate links that open in a new tab. So not all links on the page link out, just the ones that use markdown.In markdown I changed all the link output to be <a target=\'_blank\' href="..."> which was easy enough using find/replace.I do not agree that it\'s a better user experience to stay within one browser tab.  If you want people to stay on your site, or come back to finish reading that article, send them off in a new tab. Building on @davidmorrow\'s answer, throw this javascript into your site and turn just external links into links with target=_blank:If one would like to do this systematically for all external links, CSS is no option. However, one could run the following sed command once the (X)HTML has been created from Markdown:For completed alex answered (Dec 13 \'10)A more smart injection target could be done with this code :You could change the regexp exceptions with adding more extension in (?!html?|php3?|aspx?) group construct (understand this regexp here: https://regex101.com/r/sE6gT9/3).and for a without jQuery version, check code below:
