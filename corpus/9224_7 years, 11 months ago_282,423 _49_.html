I want to install a specific JDK (the latest for example). For this, I went to the JDK download homepage: http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp.\nI looked for a Mac version, but I\'m a bit surprised to only see downloadable versions for Linux, Windows and Solaris...Here\'s the message for Mac:"Apple Computer supplies their own version of Java. Use the Software\n  Update feature (available on the Apple menu) to check that you have\n  the most up-to-date version of Java for your Mac."OK BUT... when I update Java with Mac I have a JRE and not a JDK...I don\'t understand why a JDK version doesn\'t exist that is easily downloadable/installable (like a jar to unzip?) for Mac...In a comment under @Thilo\'s answer, @mobibob asked how to set JAVA_HOME in your .bash_profile on a Mac. Answer:This will dynamically assign to JAVA_HOME the location of the first JDK listed in the "General" tab of "Java Preferences" utility.See Apple Technical Q&A 1170: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/qa/qa1170/_index.htmlEDIT:If you prefer parentheses to backticks for command substitution, this also works:As the message says, you have to go to Apple, not Sun, for Java on the Mac. As far as I know, Apple JDK 6 is installed by default on Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard). Maybe you need to install the developer tools from your Mac OS X installation DVD (the dev tools are an optional install from the OS DVD).See: http://developer.apple.com/java/NOTE This answer from 16 Oct 2009 is now outdated; you can get the JDK for Mac OS X from the regular JDK download page on Oracle\'s website now.For people using any LION OS X 10.7.X They uploaded  Java SE 6 version 1.6.0_26 available herehttp://support.apple.com/kb/dl1421I bought a MacBook Pro yesterday (Mac OS X v10.8 (Mountain Lion)) and there is no JDK installed by default...As well as javac, I also found it didn\'t have packages such as SVN installed. It turns out you can get everything from the Apple developer page (you will need to register with your AppleID). SVN is part of the "Command Line Tools" package.This is what happens on a fresh MacBook:Hopefully this will help out other newbies like me ;)Mac comes with the JDK, for more information check: http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Java/Conceptual/Java14Development/02-JavaDevTools/JavaDevTools.htmlThe explanation is that JDK is a bit specific and does not contain the library tools.jar. For my development, I need this library and Mac\'s JDK doesn\'t provide it:(Cf. http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Java/Conceptual/Java14Development/02-JavaDevTools/JavaDevTools.html)tools.jar does not exist. Classes usually located here are instead included in classes.jar. Scripts that rely on the existence of tools.jar need to be rewritten accordingly.It sucks!Compiling with -source 1.5 -target 1.5 (in a JDK 6 environment) will honor only language elements that were in 1.5 and prior.  Great.  But there were no language changes in 6 anyway.  Problem with this approach (on Mac with 1.6) is that using classes that came AFTER 1.5 will still compile because they exist in the rt.jar.  So one could run in a 1.5 env and get a class not found exception with no prior warning when compiling.  I found this out the hard way with javax.swing.event.RowSorterEvent/Listener.  Both entered "Since 1.6" but are not caught with -source 1.5If you installed brew, cmd below will be helpful:brew cask install javaAs of Mac OS X v10.6 (Snow Leopard), you can run Java 6 in 32-bit mode on either 32-bit or 64-bit Intel processor equipped Macs.If you cannot upgrade to Snow Leopard, Soy Latte is a pre-compiled version of Java 6 for Intel 32-bit.  There are various tricky issues with having multiple versions of Java (Apple\'s own Java 6 and Oracle JDK 7 or even 8) on one\'s Mac OS X system, and using different versions for different applications.  I spent some time writing up my experience of my experience of installing and configuring various versions of JDK on Mac OS X 10.9.2.I think this other Stack Overflow question could help:How to get JDK 1.5 on Mac OS XIt basically says that if you need to compile or execute a Java application with an older version of the JDK (for example 1.4 or 1.5), you can do it using the 1.6 because it is backwards compatible. To do it so you will need to add the parameter -source 1.5 and/or -target 1.5 in the javac options or in your IDE.JDK is the Java Development Kit (used to develop Java software).JRE is the Java Runtime Environment (used to run any .jar file \'Java software\').The JDK contains a JRE inside it.On Windows when you update Java, it updates the JRE automatically.On Mac you do not have a JRE separated you have it, but inside the JDK, so when you update Java it will update your JRE which is inside your JDK;\nit doesn\'t install an JDK for you. You need to get it from somewhere else.The easiest way is to use Homebrew. \nInstall Homebrew and then:You can list all available versions using the following command:\nbrew cask search javaAs a rule you cannot install other versions of Java on a Mac than those provided by Apple through Software Update.  If you need Java 6 you must have a 64-bit Intel computer.  You should always have Java 5 and 1.4 and perhaps 1.3 installed if you have at least OS X 10.4.If you have VERY much elbow grease and is willing to work with beta software you can install the OpenJDK under OS X, but I don\'t think you want to go there.Check this awesome tool sdkman to manage your jdk and other jdk related tools with great ease!e.g.
