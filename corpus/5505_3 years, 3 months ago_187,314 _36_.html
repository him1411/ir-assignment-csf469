I\'m looking for a way to replace characters in a Swift String.Example: "This is my string"I\'d like to replace  with + to get:  "This+is+my+string".How can I achieve this?This answer has been updated for Swift 3. If you\'re still using Swift 1 or 2, see the revision history.You have a couple of options. You can do as @jaumard suggested and use replacingOccurrences()And as noted by @cprcrack below, the options and range parameters are optional, so if you don\'t want to specify string comparison options or a range to do the replacement within, you only need the following.Or, if the data is in a specific format like this, where you\'re just replacing separation characters, you can use components() to break the string into and array, and then you can use the join() function to put them back to together with a specified separator.Or if you\'re looking for a more Swifty solution that doesn\'t utilize API from NSString, you could use this.You can use this:If you add this extension method anywhere in your code:Swift 3:Swift 3 SolutionDid you test this : A Swift 3 solution along the lines of Sunkas\'s:Use:Output:I am using this extension:Usage:A category that modifies an existing mutable String:Use: Swift 3 solution based on Ramis\' answer:Tried to come up with an appropriate function name according to Swift 3 naming convention.Here is the example for Swift 3: If you don\'t want to use the Objective-C NSString methods, you can just use split and join:split(string, isSeparator: { $0 == " " }) returns an array of strings (["This", "is", "my", "string"]).join joins these elements with a +, resulting in the desired output: "This+is+my+string".I\'ve implemented this very easy func:So you can write:I think Regex is the most flexible and solid way:Swift extension:Go on and use it like let replacedString = yorString.stringByReplacing(replaceStrings: [" ","?","."], with: "+")The speed of the function is something that i can hardly be proud of, but you can pass an array of String in one pass to make more than one replacement.Here\'s an extension for an in-place occurrences replace method on String, that doesn\'t no an unnecessary copy and do everything in place:(The method signature also mimics the signature of the built-in String.replacingOccurrences() method)May be used in the following way:
