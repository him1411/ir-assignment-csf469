Is Eclipse at all theme-able? I would like to install a dark color scheme for it, since I much prefer white text on dark background than the other way around.As posted to a few related questions already, I\'m working on a plugin for easy, cross-editor color theme management:http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/eclipse-color-themeIt is still work in progress, but already supports many editors and a few dark color themes.I\'ve created my own dark color scheme (based on Oblivion from gedit), which I think is very nice to work with.Preview & details at: http://www.rogerdudler.com/?p=362We\'re happy to announce the beta of eclipsecolorthemes.org, a new website to download, create and maintain Eclipse color themes / schemes. The theme editor allows you to copy an existing theme and edit the colors with a live preview of your changes on specific editors. The downloadable themes support a lot of editors (PHP, Java, SQL, Ant, text, HTML, CSS, and more to follow)There\'s a growing list of themes already available on the site:You can read more about the launch here.Here\'s a guy that posted his Eclipse preferences for changing the colors like a theme:http://blog.codefront.net/2006/09/28/vibrant-ink-textmate-theme-for-eclipse/And here\'s more about how to set the colors in the Ganymede Eclipse version (v. 3.4, mid 2008):http://help.eclipse.org/ganymede/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/concepts/accessibility/fontsandcolors.htmFor Linux users, assuming you run a compositing window manager (Compiz), you can just turn the window negative. I use Eclipse like this all the time, the normal (whitie) looks is blowing my eyes off.These are the pleasing colors for my eyes during coding. Jazz music not included in theme.Eclipse Color Themes Plugin file: LukinaJama3.xml on depositfilesThis is the best place for Eclipse color themes:http://www.eclipsecolorthemes.org/I have to say, this is one area where Eclipse is really weak. Specifically, the import/export of preferences applies to ALL preferences. There is no way to import say just the fonts/color preferences (like you can with Visual Studio) without mucking up my key binding preferences.Also, I have tried several of these preference files referenced above, and they completely break my Eclipse install.I\'ve created several color themes, and a script to extract a new one from someone\'s color preferences.  I\'m currently using one I still have yet to post on the site, but I should eventually get to it.http://eclipsecolorthemes.jottit.comEasiest way:  change the Windows Display Properties main window background color.  I went to Appearance tab, changed to Silver scheme, clicked Advanced, clicked on "Active Window" and changed Color 1 to a light gray.  All Eclipse views softened.Since Luna (4.4) there seems to be a full Dark them inWindow -> Preferences -> General -> Appearance -> Theme -> DarkFor the quick hack, on Linux running GNOME with a Windows keyboard, Windows-Key-M will inverse-color all windows, and Windows-Key-N will inverse color a single window.  It\'s an awesome feature, in my book.As I replied to "Is there a simple, consistent way to change the color scheme of Eclipse editors?":I\'ve been looking for this too and\n  after a bit of research found a\n  workable solution. This is based on\n  the FDT editor for Eclipse, but I\'m\n  sure you could apply the same logic to\n  other editors.My blog post: Howto create a\n  color-scheme for FDTHope this helps!The best solution I\'ve found is to leave Eclipse in normal bright mode, and use an OS level screen inverter.On OSÂ X you can do Command + Option + Ctrl + 8, inverts the whole screen.On Linux with Compiz, it\'s even better, you can do Windows + N to darken windows selectively (or Windows + M to do the whole screen).On Windows, the only decent solution I\'ve found is powerstrip, but it\'s only free for one year... then it\'s like $30 or something...Then you can invert the screen, adjust the syntax-level colours to your liking, and you\'re off to the races, with cool shades on.If you use Aptana then you can download a dark color theme!  I have been looking for one recently and found the Aptana one.  Thought others might be interested!Check out: http://www.nightlion.net/themes/2009/aptana-dark-color-theme/Checkout this color scheme I created for Eclipse PDT. It is based on the Vim Zenburn color scheme developed by slinkyHere\'s a rev 0.0.1 of an attempt at a dark background colour scheme for Eclipse (and a screenshot). Any feedback at all? (this is a big departure from what I normally use for Vim.Some people posted options for Linux and Mac, and the Windows (free) equivalent is, if you can deal with it globally:Set Windows desktop appearance theme window background color. You can keep current/desired theme, just modify the background color of windows. By default, it is set to white. I change it to a shade of grey. I tried dark grey and black before, but then you have to change text font colors globally, and all that\'s painful.But a simple shade of grey as background does the trick globally, works with any color text font as long as the shade of grey is not too dark.It\'s not the best solution for all editors/IDEs, as I prefer black, but it\'s the next best free & global workaround on Windows.I have finally found exactly what I have been looking for, i.e. a dark theme for PyDev (although I still feel like Eclipse is missing out on this).This is another dark Eclipse theme: http://blog.prabir.me/post/Dark-Eclipse-Theme.aspx.I have the Visual Studio equivalent of the theme.I played with customizing the colors. I went with the yellow text/blue background I\'ve liked from Turbo Pascal. The problem I ran into was it let you set the colors of the editors but then the other views like Package Explorer or Navigator stayed with the default black-on-white colors.  I\'m sure you could do it programatically but there are waaaay to many settings for my patience. In response to this comment I made a filter for Color Filter plugin for Compiz. Here\'s what I got: Howto:Filter code:You also can play with the filter. May be you will get something more facinating :) Feel free to share!
