Block syntax in Objective C (and indeed C, I presume) is notoriously incongruous. Passing blocks as arguments looks different than declaring blocks as ivars, which looks different than typedefing blocks.Is there a comprehensive list of block-declaration syntax that I could keep on hand for quick reference?Throughout, letAnd remember that you can create as many parameters as you\'d like.Possibly the most common for of declaration.Much like declaring blocks as variables, however subtly different.Note that this is distinct from "Blocks as Arguments"; in this instance, you\'re declaring a method that wants a block argument.Note that this is distinct from "Blocks as Parameters"; in this instance, you\'re calling a method that wants a block argument with an anonymous block. If you have already declared a block variable, it is sufficient to pass the variable name as the argument.This is functionally an anonymous block, however the syntax for assigning blocks to variables is simply to set the variable equal to an anonymous block.This allows you to set up a short name that can be referenced just like any other class name during the declaration of blocks.To then later use blockName instead of the standard block declaration syntax, simply substitute.This is arguably a less useful utilization of blocks, but may have its place nonetheless. An inline block is an anonymous block called immediately after instantiation.Inline blocks are primarily useful for scope offsetting, and are roughly equivalent to simple brace-delimited chunks of code.This allows you to call a block from itself, creating a loop that can be used during callbacks and GCD calls. This instantiation method is free of retain cycles in ARC.A method can return a block,as can a function, if a bit strangely.If I\'ve missed anything, please let me know in comments, and I\'ll research/add them.It\'s almost like it\'s a language feature.I personally like using this website (http://fuckingblocksyntax.com). The name is easier to remember than the block syntax itself: and if you can\'t load URLs with bad words in them you can use this mirror: http://goshdarnblocksyntax.com Typedef:Inline:Method:The Xcode 4 snippet library contains templates for block typedefs and inline blocks as variables. They are also available via auto-completion (typedefblock and inlineblock).For blocks as arguments to methods, I\'d recommend declaring a typedef and then simply using that. It makes the code much easier to read.I wrote a completionBlock for a class which will return the values of a dice after they have been shaked:Define typedef with returnType (.h above @interface declaration)Define a @property for the block (.h)Define a method with finishBlock (.h)Insert previous defined method in .m file and commit finishBlock to @property defined beforeTo trigger completionBlock pass predefined variableType to it \n(Don\'t forget to check whether the completionBlock exists)If you need to work back in Xcode 4.2, you can also @synthesize a block declared as a property just like you would with a non block property.  Don\'t let the block syntax throw you.If your block property is this:Then your @synthesize is this:Cheers.
