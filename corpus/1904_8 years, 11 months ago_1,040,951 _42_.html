I need to do an HTTP GET request in JavaScript. What\'s the best way to do that?I need to do this in a Mac OS X dashcode widget.You can use functions provided by the hosting environment through javascript:However, synchronous requests are discouraged, so you might want to use this instead:Note: Starting with Gecko 30.0 (Firefox 30.0 / Thunderbird 30.0 / SeaMonkey 2.27), synchronous requests on the main thread have been deprecated due to the negative effects to the user experience.In jQuery:Lots of great advice above, but not very reusable, and too often filled with DOM nonsense and other fluff that hides the easy code.Here\'s a Javascript class we created that\'s reusable and easy to use.  Currently it only has a GET method, but that works for us.  Adding a POST shouldn\'t tax anyone\'s skills.Using it is as easy as:A version without callbackHere is code to do it directly with JavaScript. But, as previously mentioned, you\'d be much better off with a JavaScript library. My favorite is jQuery.In the case below, an ASPX page (that\'s servicing as a poor man\'s REST service) is being called to return a JavaScript JSON object.The new window.fetch API is a cleaner replacement for XMLHttpRequest that makes use of ES6 promises. There\'s a nice explanation here, but it boils down to (from the article):Browser support is now good in the latest releases (works in Chrome, Firefox, Edge (v14), Safari (v10.1), Opera, Safari iOS (v10.3), Android browser, and Chrome for Android), however IE will likely not get official support. GitHub has a polyfill available which is recommended to support older browsers still largely in use (esp versions of Safari pre March 2017 and mobile browsers from the same period).I guess whether this is more convenient than jQuery or XMLHttpRequest or not depends on the nature of the project.Here\'s a link to the spec https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/A copy-paste ready versionIE will cache URLs in order to make loading faster, but if you\'re, say, polling a server at intervals trying to get new information, IE will cache that URL and will likely return the same data set you\'ve always had.Regardless of how you end up doing your GET request - vanilla JavaScript, Prototype, jQuery, etc - make sure that you put a mechanism in place to combat caching. In order to combat that, append a unique token to the end of the URL you\'re going to be hitting. This can be done by:This will append a unique timestamp to the end of the URL and will prevent any caching from happening.Prototype makes it dead simpleI\'m not familiar with Mac OS Dashcode Widgets, but if they let you use JavaScript libraries and support XMLHttpRequests, I\'d use jQuery and do something like this:In your widget\'s Info.plist file, don\'t forget to set your AllowNetworkAccess key to true.For those who use AngularJs, it\'s $http.get:Same thing can be done for post request as well.\nHave a look at this link JavaScript post request like a form submitThe best way is to use AJAX ( you can find a simple tutorial on this page Tizag). The reason is that any other technique you may use requires more code, it is not guaranteed to work cross browser without rework and requires you use more client memory by opening hidden pages inside frames passing urls parsing their data and closing them. \nAJAX is the way to go in this situation. That my two years of javascript heavy development speaking. It might also prove very useful to try REQUESTIFY- a library that Simplifies node HTTP request making. https://github.com/ranm8/requestifyGetting a request:And to json:You can get an HTTP GET request in two ways:This approach based on xml format. You have to pass the URL for the request.  This one is based on jQuery. You have to specify the URL and function_name you want to call.One solution supporting older browsers:Maybe somewhat overkill but you definitely go safe with this code.Usage:\nIf you want to use the code for a Dashboard widget, and you don\'t want to include a JavaScript library in every widget you created, then you can use the object XMLHttpRequest that Safari natively supports.As reported by Andrew Hedges, a widget doesn\'t have access to a network, by default; you need to change that setting in the info.plist associated with the widget.AjaxYou\'d be best off using a library such as Prototype or jQuery.You can do it with pure JS too:See: for more details: https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/
