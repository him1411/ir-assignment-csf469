Is it possible to add a key to a Python dictionary after it has been created? It doesn\'t seem to have an .add() method.I feel like consolidating info about Python dictionaries:Feel free to add more!Yeah, it\'s pretty easy. Just do the following:Yes it is possible, and it does have a method that implements this, but you don\'t want to use it directly.To demonstrate how and how not to use it, let\'s create an empty dict with the dict literal, {}:To update this dict with a single new key and value, you can use the subscript notation (see Mappings here) that provides for item assignment: my_dict is now:We can also update the dict with multiple values efficiently as well using the update method.  We may be unnecessarily creating an extra dict here, so we hope our dict has already been created and came from or was used for another purpose:my_dict is now:Another efficient way of doing this with the update method is with keyword arguments, but since they have to be legitimate python words, you can\'t have spaces or special symbols or start the name with a number, but many consider this a more readable way to create keys for a dict, and here we certainly avoid creating an extra unnecessary dict:and my_dict is now:So now we have covered three Pythonic ways of updating a dict. There\'s another way of updating a dict that you shouldn\'t use, which uses the __setitem__ method. Here\'s an example of how one might use the __setitem__ method to add a key-value pair to a dict, and a demonstration of the poor performance of using it:So we see that using the subscript notation is actually much faster than using __setitem__. Doing the Pythonic thing, that is, using the language in the way it was intended to be used, usually is both more readable and computationally efficient.If you want to add a dictionary within a dictionary you can do it this way. Example: Add a new entry to your dictionary & sub dictionaryOutput:NOTE: Python requires that you first add a sub  before adding entries.The orthodox syntax is d[key] = value, but if your keyboard is missing the square bracket keys you could do:In fact, defining __getitem__ and __setitem__ methods is how you can make your own class support the  square bracket syntax. See http://www.diveintopython.net/object_oriented_framework/special_class_methods.htmlyou can create onegivesThis popular question addresses functional methods of merging dictionaries a and b.Here are some of the more straightforward methods (tested in Python 3)...Note: The first method above only works if the keys in b are strings.To add or modify a single element, the b dictionary would contain only that one element...This is equivalent to...results in This is exactly how I would do it:\n    # fixed data with sapceThis works for me. Enjoy!we can add new keys to dictionary by this way:Dictionary_Name[New_Key_Name] = New_Key_ValueHere is the Example:Output:It has a update method which you can use like this:dict.update({"key" : "value"})Basically two simple ways with which you can add new key in the dict
