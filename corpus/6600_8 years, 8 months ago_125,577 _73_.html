I am trying to use UIImagePickerController with UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypePhotoLibrary, but it says, "No photos". Where does the simulator get the images from? Where should I copy the images so that they are displayed in the simulator?Note - while this is valid, and works, I think Koen\'s solution below is now a better one, since it does not require rebooting the simulator.Identify your simulator by going to xCode->Devices, selecting your simulator, and checking the Identifier value.Go to ~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/[Simulator Identifier]/data/Media/DCIM/100APPLEand add IMG_nnnn.THM and IMG_nnnn.JPG. You will then need to reset your simulator (Hardware->Reboot) to allow it to notice the new changes. It doesn\'t matter if they are not JPEGs - they can both be PNGs, but it appears that both of them must be present for it to work. You may need to create DCIM if it doesn\'t already exist, and in that case you should start nnnn from 0001. The JPG files are the fullsize version, while the THM files are the thumbnail, and are 75x75 pixels in size. I wrote a script to do this, but there\'s a better documented one over here.You can also add photos from safari in the simulator, by Tapping and Holding on the image. If you drag an image (or any other file, like a PDF) to the simulator, it will immediately open Safari and display the image, so this is quite an easy way of getting images to it.Explain step by step of Airsource Ltd\'s answer for adding image to simulator:Update: for iOS Simulator 4.2, do these steps twice to get it work. Thanks kevboh!Update: This also works for iOS Simulator 6.13 Simple Steps Watch YouTube Video ( add images to iphone simulator)With iOS 8.0, we added the ability to just drag and drop images into the iOS Simulator.  You can drag a bunch of images into the window, and they should be imported into the photo reel for that simulated device.  You can also do this with the simctl command line tool. \'xcrun simctl addphoto  \'I just stumbled upon how to bulk upload images on the iOS Simulator. (I\'ve only confirmed it on 6.1.)Backup the folder:Copy all your images into the folder:Move or delete the folder:Restart iOS SimulatorOpen the Photos appThe simulator will restore all the images from the 100APPLE folder!For iOS 7 I did the following:copy photos to these two folders:delete these 4 files only (to avoid duplicates on relaunch):Its simple. Just follow these steps :This displays actionSheet with Save, Cancel option (Also copy in case of iOS 7 simulator).Save the image. The image gets added into Library.Since Xcode 6 you can use the command line tool xcrun simctl.Usage is very simple; to add a photo to the currently running simulator you use the booted placeholder.To add it to any other simulator, you use its device id, which can be found by running xcrun simctl list.This is MUCH easier with the new iOS Simulator that comes with Xcode 6+ (iOS Simulator 8.1 and above.)  Now all you have to do is drag one or more photos onto the iOS Simulator window, and instead of opening Safari, the Photos app opens, and instantly adds all dragged-in photos to the device.None of the answers had the exact solution that I needed.The steps I\'ve found for myself working on iOS 5.0 and above simulator are as follows:Close the simulator if it is running xcode project.Run simulator from the dock by clicking on it.Drag & drop the image into simulator.Tap and hold the image (opened in safari) and select the save option.You are done.For iOS 5.1 this is further changed to new path~/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/5.1/Media/DCIM/100APPLEAs of iOS 8, you can just drag all your photos onto the simulator window and they\'ll save to camera roll automatically. You can do as many at a time as you want.If you need to import more than just one or two photos then take a look at this article that I wrote. It describes an easy way to perform a bulk import of photos and works for iOS 4.x.For iOS 8, If there is no need to retain photo capture date and location, just drop photo files to the simulator.To retain photo meta data, do the following:Note: You need to replace {USER} with your user name and {UDID} with the UDID of the simulator. To find UDID for your simulator, from Terminal, run \'xcrun simctl list\'.Just drag images to the iPhone simulator.For iOS 4.2 I had to go and create the 100APPLE folder and restart the simulator, then it worked.try this app I\'ve made. download the code and run it in simulator https://github.com/cristianbica/CBSimulatorSeedAdding an image to the Iphone Simulation running IOS 8.0 is even easier.No need to deal with Safari anymoreFor iOS 8.0,the answer is out of date.I found the media resource in the following path:\n~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/[DeviceID]/data/Media/DCIM/100APPLEJust Drag and Drop image into iphone simulator. browser will open to show your image.\npress on image until you not receive options to save Image. then Save image.\nthats it :). you will see your image in to Photo app in your simulator....I wrote a bash script to do this.\nCheck the link[1][1] : https://gist.github.com/firesofmay/5194901Just to tell you : KONG\'s solution also works on iOS 7 beta.His solution was: Drag the image to simulator, then Safari opens (or browse to the Image in the internet using Safari)\nHold your click on the image\nWhen the pop-up appears, choose Save Image and enjoy ;)I just needed some random images for testing, so this is how I did it.I have the simplest solution in the world. Just open Safari in the simulator, go to Google images (or your own web or Dropbox URL), view an image, hold down the mouse button for 2 seconds, and you\'ll see "Save Image" - it will save right into the Photos library. Rinse and repeat.an even easier way, is :\nopen safari on simulator > tap www.google.com\nsearch for random photos "nature"\nopen each image, press on it  and save it.With the drag and drop feature you will lose all the metadata of the photos.I\'ve created a project that make it really easy to import assets to the simulator: MBAssetsImporter.It enables you to import both videos and photos while preserving all the original metadata of the files.1. CD to this path:/Users/[macOS user]/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/[Simulator\n  Identifier]/data/Media/DCIM/100APPLE[Simulator Identifier] or UDID can be found at : Hardware => device => manage devices.eg. cd /Users/rnDeveloper/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/7508171A-DC5D-47CF-9BE1-FF950326E3DB/data/Media/DCIM/100APPLE2. Download photo by run this command: curl -o pic_001.jpg\n  "https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/474x/49/25/7a/49257a4b3287b7841922ecdff855fd80.jpg"3. Restart your simulator to see the new files.The simplest solution is to simply sign into iCloud on the simulator then use that to transfer any files in the drive, including photos.
