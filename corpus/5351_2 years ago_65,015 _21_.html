I\'m trying to submit my universal iOS 9 app to Apple (built with Xcode 7 GM) but I receive this error message for the bundle in iTunes Connect, just when I select Submit for Review:Invalid Bundle. iPad Multitasking support requires these orientations: \'UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait,UIInterfaceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown,UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft,UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight\'. Found \'UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait,UIInterfaceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown\' in bundle \'com.bitscoffee.PhotoMarks.iOS\'.My app has support for Portrait and PortraitUpsideDown orientations but not for the other two. So is there a work around this imposed requirement, or all iOS 9 iPad apps have to have all four orientations?iPad Multitasking support requires all the orientations but your app does not, so you need to opt out of it, just add the UIRequiresFullScreen key to your Xcode project\xe2\x80\x99s Info.plist file and apply the Boolean value YES.In Xcode, check the "Requires Full Screen" checkbox under General > Targets, as shown below.I am using Xamarin and there is no available option in the UI to specify "Requires full screen". I, therefore, had to follow @Michael Wang\'s answer with a slight modification. Here goes:Open the info.plist file in a text editor and add the lines: I tried setting the value to "YES" but it didn\'t work, which was kind of expected.In case you are wondering, I placed the above lines below the UISupportedInterfaceOrientations sectionHope this helps someone. Credit to Michael.as Michael said,Check the "Requires full screen" of the target of xcodeproj, if you don\'t need to support multitasking.or Check the following device orientationsIn this case, we need to support launch storyboard.Unchecked all Device orientation and checked only "Requires full screen". Its working properlyGo to your project target in Xcode > General > Set "Requires full screen" (under Hide status bar) to true. As Michael said check the "Requires Full Screen" checkbox under General > Targetsand also delete the \'CFBundleIcons-ipad\' from the info.plstThis worked for me
