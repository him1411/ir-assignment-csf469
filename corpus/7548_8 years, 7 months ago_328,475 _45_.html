I like how Java has a Map where you can define the types of each entry in the map, for example <String, Integer>. What I\'m looking for is a type of collection where each element in the collection is a pair of values.  Each value in the pair can have its own type (like the String and Integer example above), which is defined at declaration time.  The collection will maintain its given order and will not treat one of the values as a unique key (as in a map).  Essentially I want to be able to define an ARRAY of type <String,Integer> or any other 2 types.  I realize that I can make a class with nothing but the 2 variables in it, but that seems overly verbose.  I also realize that I could use a 2D array, but because of the different types I need to use, I\'d have to make them arrays of OBJECT, and then I\'d have to cast all the time.  I only need to store pairs in the collection, so I only need two values per entry.  Does something like this exist without going the class route?  Thanks!The Pair class is one of those "gimme" generics examples that is easy enough to write on your own. For example, off the top of my head:And yes, this exists in multiple places on the Net, with varying degrees of completeness and feature.  (My example above is intended to be immutable.)Easy you are looking for this:How can you fill it?This simplifies to:And, with the help of a createEntry method, can further reduce the verbosity to:Since ArrayList isn\'t final, it can be subclassed to expose an of method (and the aforementioned createEntry method), resulting in the syntactically terse:These built-in classes are an option, too:Apache common lang3 has Pair class and few other libraries mentioned in this thread What is the equivalent of the C++ Pair<L,R> in Java?Example matching the requirement from your original question:If you\'re using Java 8 (or Java 9\'s javafx.base module), you can use javafx.util.Pair.If you\'re writing for Android, you can use android.util.Pair.If you\'re using Apache Commons Lang, you can use org.apache.commons.lang3.tuple.Pair.Otherwise, you can use AbstractMap.SimpleImmutableEntry, or simply copy and paste the following code (which, unlike the class listed in the answer above, guards against NullPointerExceptions):To anyone developing for Android, you can use android.util.Pair. :)You could write a generic Pair<A, B> class and use this in an array or list.  Yes, you have to write a class, but you can reuse the same class for all types, so you only have to do it once.What about "Apache Commons Lang 3" Pair class and the relative subclasses ?ImmutablePair is a specific subclass that does not allow the values in the pair to be modified, but there are others implementations with different semantic. These are the Maven coordinates, if you need them.I was going to ask if you would not want to just use a List<Pair<T, U>>? but then, of course, the JDK doesn\'t have a Pair<> class.  But a quick Google found one on both Wikipedia, and forums.sun.com.  CheersThe preferred solution as you\'ve described it is a List of Pairs (i.e. List).To accomplish this you would create a Pair class for use in your collection. This is a useful utility class to add to your code base. The closest class in the Sun JDK providing functionality similar to a typical Pair class is AbstractMap.SimpleEntry. You could use this class rather than creating your own Pair class, though you would have to live with some awkward restrictions and I think most people would frown on this as not really the intended role of SimpleEntry. For example SimpleEntry has no "setKey()" method and no default constructor, so you may find it too limiting.Bear in mind that Collections are designed to contain elements of a single type. Related utility interfaces such as Map are not actually Collections (i.e. Map does not implement the Collection interface). A Pair would not implement the Collection interface either but is obviously a useful class in building larger data structures.Expanding on the other answers a generic immutable Pair should have a static method to avoid cluttering your code with the call to the constructor:  if you name the static method "of" or "pairOf" the code becomes fluent as you can write either: its a real shame that the core java libraries are so sparse on such things that you have to use commons-lang or other 3rd parties to do such basic stuff. yet another reason to upgrade to scala...This is based on JavaHelp4u \'s code. Less verbose and shows how to do in one line and how to loop over things.Apache Crunch also has a Pair class:\nhttp://crunch.apache.org/apidocs/0.5.0/org/apache/crunch/Pair.htmljust create a class likethen create List of this objects of tuplesso you can also implement other new data structures in the same way.I mean, even though there is no Pair class in Java there is something pretty simmilar: Map.EntryMap.Entry DocumentationThis is (simplifying quite a bit) what HashMap , or actually any Map stores.You can create an instance of Map store your values in it and get the entry set. You will end up with a Set<Map.Entry<K,V>> which effectively is what you want.So:What about com.sun.tools.javac.util.Pair?
