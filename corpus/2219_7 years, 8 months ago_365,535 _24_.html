How can I get a color from a hexadecimal color code (e.g. #FFDFD991)?I am reading a file and am getting a hexadecimal color code. I need to create the corresponding System.Windows.Media.Color instance for the hexadecimal color code. Is there an inbuilt method in the framework to do this?I\'m assuming that\'s an ARGB code... Are you referring to System.Drawing.Color or System.Windows.Media.Color? The latter is used in WPF for example. I haven\'t seen anyone mention it yet, so just in case you were looking for it:Assuming you mean the HTML type RGB codes (called Hex codes, such as #FFCC66), use the ColorTranslator class:If, however you are using an ARGB hex code, you can use the ColorConverter class from the System.Windows.Media namespace:If you don\'t want to use the ColorTranslator, you can do it in easily:The colorcode is just the hexadecimal representation of the ARGB value.There is also this neat little extension method:In use:The three variants below give exactly the same color. The last one has the benefit of being highlighted in the Visual Studio 2010 IDE (maybe it\'s ReSharper that\'s doing it) with proper color.You could use the following code:I needed to convert a shade of Alice Blue as a background on a WPF form and found it took longer than expected to find the answer:--If you want to do it with a Windows Store App, following by @Hans Kesting and @Jink answer:This post has become the goto for anyone trying to convert from a hex color code to a system color.  Therefore, I thought I\'d add a comprehensive solution that deals with both 6 digit (RGB) and 8 digit (ARGB) hex values.By default, according to Microsoft, when converting from an RGB to ARGB value The alpha value is implicitly 255 (fully opaque).This means by adding FF to a 6 digit (RGB) hex color code it becomes an 8 digit ARGB hex color code.  Therefore, a simple method can be created that handles both ARGB and RGB hex\'s and converts them to the appropriate Color struct.This was inspired by Hans Kesting\'s answer.?You can see Silverlight/WPF sets ellipse with hexadecimal colour for using a hex value:If you mean HashCode as in .GetHashCode(), I\'m afraid you can\'t go back. Hash functions are not bi-directional, you can go \'forward\' only, not back.Edit: Follow Oded\'s suggestion if you need to get the color based on the hexadecimal value of the color.WPF:
