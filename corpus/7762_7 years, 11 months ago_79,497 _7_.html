I tried but failed:Use GREATEST()E.g.: To get the maximum value of a column across a set of rows:To get the maximum value of a set of columns, literals, or variables for each row:You can use GREATEST function with not nullable fields.\nIf one of this values (or both) can be NULL, don\'t use it (result can be NULL).You can change NULL to your preferred default value (if both values is NULL).
