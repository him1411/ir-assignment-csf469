What is the difference between using the delete operator on the array element as opposed to using the Array.splice method? For example:Why even have the splice method if I can delete array elements like I can with objects?delete will delete the object property, but will not reindex the array or update its length. This makes it appears as if it is undefined:Splice(start, deleteCount) actually removes the element from the array:John Resig, creator of jQuery created a very handy Array.remove method that I always use it in my projects.and here\'s some examples of how it could be used:John\'s websiteBecause delete only removes the object from the element in the array, the length of the array won\'t change. Splice removes the object and shortens the array.The following code will display "a", "b", "undefined", "d"Whereas this will display "a", "b", "d"I stumbled onto this question while trying to understand how to remove every occurrence of an element from an Array. Here\'s a comparison of splice and delete for removing every \'c\' from the items Array.From  Core JavaScript 1.5 Reference > Operators > Special Operators > delete Operator :When you delete an array element, the\n  array length is not affected. For\n  example, if you delete a[3], a[4] is\n  still a[4] and a[3] is undefined. This\n  holds even if you delete the last\n  element of the array (delete\n  a[a.length-1]).splice will work with numeric indices.whereas delete can be used against other kind of indices..example:It\'s probably also worth mentioning that splice only works on arrays. (Object properties can\'t be relied on to follow a consistent order.)To remove the key-value pair from an object, delete is actually what you want: delete Vs splicewhen you delete an item from an arraywhen you splicein case of delete the element is deleted but the index remains emptywhile in case of splice element is deleted and the index of rest elements is reduced accordinglydelete acts like a non real world situation, it just removes the item, but the array length stays the same:example from node terminal:Here is a function to remove an item of an array by index, using slice(), it takes the arr as the first arg, and the index of the member you want to delete as the second argument. As you can see, it actually deletes the member of the array, and will reduce the array length by 1What the function above does is take all the members up to the index, and all the members after the index , and concatenates them together, and returns the result.Here is an example using the function above as a node module, seeing the terminal will be useful:please note that this will not work one array with dupes in it, because indexOf("c") will just get the first occurance, and only splice out and remove the first "c" it finds.As stated many times above, using splice() seems like a perfect fit. Documentation at Mozilla:The splice() method changes the content of an array by removing existing elements and/or adding new elements.Index at which to start changing the array. If greater than the length of the array, actual starting index will be set to the length of the array. If negative, will begin that many elements from the end.An integer indicating the number of old array elements to remove. If deleteCount is 0, no elements are removed. In this case, you should specify at least one new element. If deleteCount is greater than the number of elements left in the array starting at start, then all of the elements through the end of the array will be deleted.If deleteCount is omitted, deleteCount will be equal to (arr.length - start).The elements to add to the array, beginning at the start index. If you don\'t specify any elements, splice() will only remove elements from the array.An array containing the deleted elements. If only one element is removed, an array of one element is returned. If no elements are removed, an empty array is returned.[...]If you want to iterate a large array and selectively delete elements, it would be expensive to call splice() for every delete because splice() would have to re-index subsequent elements every time. Because arrays are associative in Javascript, it would be more efficient to delete the individual elements then re-index the array afterwards. You can do it by building a new array. e.gBut I don\'t think you can modify the key values in the original array, which would be more efficient - it looks like you might have to create a new array.Note that you don\'t need to check for the "undefined" entries as they don\'t actually exist and the for loop doesn\'t return them. It\'s an artifact of the array printing that displays them as undefined. They don\'t appear to exist in memory.It would be nice if you could use something like slice() which would be quicker, but it does not re-index. Anyone know of a better way?Actually, you can probably do it in place as follows which is probably more efficient, performance-wise:you can use something like thisShould display [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]example:banana is deleted and array length = 2They\'re different things that have different purposes.splice is array-specific and, when used for deleting, removes entries from the array and moves all the previous entries up to fill the gap. (It can also be used to insert entries, or both at the same time.) splice will change the length of the array (assuming it\'s not a no-op call: theArray.splice(x, 0)).delete is not array-specific; it\'s designed for use on objects: It removes a property (key/value pair) from the object you use it on. It only applies to arrays because standard (e.g., non-typed) arrays in JavaScript aren\'t really arrays at all*, they\'re objects with special handling for certain properties, such as those whose names are "array indexes" (which are defined as string names "...whose numeric value i is in the range +0 \xe2\x89\xa4 i < 2^32-1") and length. When you use delete to remove an array entry, all it does is remove the entry; it doesn\'t move other entries following it up to fill the gap, and so the array becomes "sparse" (has some entries missing entirely). It has no effect on length.A couple of the current answers to this question incorrectly state that using delete "sets the entry to undefined". That\'s not correct. It removes the entry (property) entirely, leaving a gap.Let\'s use some code to illustrate the differences:* (that\'s a post on my anemic little blog)Currently there are two ways to do this using splice()arrayObject.splice(index, 1);using deletedelete arrayObject[index];But I always suggest to use splice for array objects and delete for object attributes because delete does not update array length. IndexOf accepts also a reference type. Suppose the following scenario:Differently:If the desired element to delete is in the middle (say we want to delete \'c\', which its index is 1):var arr = [\'a\',\'b\',\'c\'];You can use:\n\nvar indexToDelete = 1;\nvar newArray = arr.slice(0, indexToDelete).combine(arr.slice(indexToDelete+1, arr.length))\nEasiest way is probably Hope this helps. \nReference: https://lodash.com/docs#compactWhy not just filter? I think it is the most clear way to consider the arrays in js.For those who wants to use Lodash can use:\nmyArray = _.without(myArray, itemToRemove)Or as I use in Angular2// result : myArray = [\'b\', \'c\', \'d\'];
