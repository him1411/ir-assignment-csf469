I know the combination Ctrl+A to jump to the beginning of the current command, and Ctrl+E to jump to the end. But is there any way to jump word by word, like Alt+←/→ in Cocoa applications does?Out of the box you can use the quite bizarre Esc+F to move to the beginning of the next word and Esc+B to move to the beginning of the current word.Here\'s how you can do itBy default, the Terminal has these shortcuts to move (left and right) word-by-word:You can configure alt+← and → to generate those sequences for you:Alternatively, you can refer to this blog post over at textmate:http://blog.macromates.com/2006/word-movement-in-terminal/On Mac OS X - the following keyboard shortcuts work by default. Note that you have to make Option key act like Meta in Terminal preferences (under keyboard tab)I have observed that default emacs key-bindings for simple text navigation seem to work on bash shells. You can useSwitch to iTerm2. It\'s free and much nicer than plain old terminal. Also it has a lot more options for customization, like keyboard shortcuts.Also I love that you can use cmd and 1-9 to switch between tabs. Try it and you will never go back to regular terminal :)How to set up custom keyboard preferences in iterm2I often hit the wrong button (cmd / control / alt) with an arrow key and so i have my arrow key combinations with those buttons all set to jump forward and back words, but please do what fits you best.Actually there is a much better approach.  Hold option and press the arrow keys left or right to move by word.  Simple as that.option←\noption→Also ctrle will take you to the end of the line and ctrla will take you to the start.I have Alt+←/→ working: open Preferences \xc2\xbb Settings \xc2\xbb Keyboard, set the entry for option cursor left to send string to shell: \\033b, and set option cursor right to send string to shell: \\033f. You can also use this for other Control key combinations.Actually it depends on what shell you use, however most shells have similar bindings. The bindings you are referring to (e.g. Ctrl+A and Ctrl+E) are bindings you will find in many other programs and they are used for ages, BTW also work in most UI apps.Here\'s a look of default bindings for Bash:Most Important Bash Keyboard ShortcutsPlease also note that you can customize them. You need to create a file, name as you wish, I named mine .bash_key_bindings and put it into my home directory. There you can set some general bash options and you can also set key bindings. To make sure they are applied, you need to modify a file named ".bashrc" that bash reads in upon start-up (you must create it, if it does not exist) and make the following call there:~ means home directory in bash, as stated above, you can name the file as you like and also place it where you like as long as you feed the right path+name to bind.Let me show you some excerpts of my .bash_key_bindings file:These just set a couple of options (e.g. disable the bell; this can be all looked up on the bash webpage).These make sure that the characters alone just do nothing but making sure the character is "typed" (they insert themselves on the shell).This is quite interesting. If I hit Ctrl+D alone (I selected d for delete), nothing happens. But if I then type a lower case w, the word to the left of the cursor is deleted. If I type an upper case, however, the word to the right of the cursor is killed. Same goes for l and L regarding the whole line starting from the cursor. If I type an "a", the whole line is actually deleted (everything before and after the cursor).I placed jumping one word forward on Ctrl+F and one word backward on Ctrl+BAs you can see, you can make a shortcut, that leads to an action immediately, or you can make one, that just inits a character sequence and then you have to type one (or more) characters to cause an action to take place as shown in the example further above.So if you are not happy with the default bindings, feel free to customize them as you like. Here\'s a link to the bash manual for more information.If you happen to be a Vim user, you could try bash\'s vim mode. Run this or put it in your ~/.bashrc file:By default you\'re in insert mode; hit escape and you can move around just like you can in normal-mode Vim, so movement by word is w or b, and the usual movement keys also work.If you check Use option as meta key in the keyboard tab of the preferences, then the default emacs style commands for forward- and backward-word and \xe2\x8c\xa5F (Alt+F) and \xe2\x8c\xa5B (Alt+B) respectively.I\'d recommend reading From Bash to Z-Shell. If you want to increase your bash/zsh prowess!As of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, Terminal maps Option-Left/Right Arrow to Esc-b/f by default, so this is now built-in for bash and other programs that use these emacs-compatible keybindings.In Bash, these are bound to Esc-B and Esc-F.\nBash has many, many more keyboard shortcuts; have a look at the output of bind -p to see what they are.
