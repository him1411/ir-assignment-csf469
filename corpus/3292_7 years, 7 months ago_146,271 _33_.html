I\'m currently looking at other search methods rather than having a huge SQL query.\nI saw elasticsearch recently and played with whoosh (a Python implementation of a search engine).Can you give reasons for your choice(s)?As the creator of ElasticSearch, maybe I can give you some reasoning on why I went ahead and created it in the first place :).Using pure Lucene is challenging. There are many things that you need to take care for if you want it to really perform well, and also, its a library, so no distributed support, its just an embedded Java library that you need to maintain.In terms of Lucene usability, way back when (almost 6 years now), I created Compass. Its aim was to simplify using Lucene and make everyday Lucene simpler. What I came across time and time again is the requirement to be able to have Compass distributed. I started to work on it from within Compass, by integrating with data grid solutions like GigaSpaces, Coherence and Terracotta, but its not enough.At its core, a distributed Lucene solution needs to be sharded. Also, with the advancement of HTTP and JSON as ubiquitous APIs, it means that a solution that many different systems with different languages can easily be used.This is why I went ahead and created ElasticSearch. It has a very advanced distributed model,  speaks JSON natively, and exposes many advanced search features, all seamlessly expressed through JSON DSL.Solr is also a solution for exposing an indexing/search server over HTTP, but I would argue that ElasticSearch provides a much superior distributed model and ease of use (though currently lacking on some of the search features, but not for long, and in any case, the plan is to get all Compass features into ElasticSearch). Of course, I am biased, since I created ElasticSearch, so you might need to check for yourself.As for Sphinx, I have not used it, so I can\'t comment. What I can refer you is to this thread at Sphinx forum which I think proves the superior distributed model of ElasticSearch.Of course, ElasticSearch has many more features then just being distributed. It is actually built with cloud in mind. You can check the feature list on the site.We use Lucene regularly to index and\n   search tens of millions of documents.\n   Searches are quick enough, and we use\n   incremental updates that do not take\n   a long time. It did take us some time\n   to get here. The strong points of\n   Lucene are its scalability, a large\n   range of features and an active\n   community of developers. Using bare\n   Lucene requires programming in Java.If you are starting afresh, the tool for you in the Lucene family is Solr, which is much easier to set up than bare Lucene, and has almost all of Lucene\'s power. It can import database documents easily. Solr are written in Java, so any modification of Solr requires Java knowledge, but you can do a lot just by tweaking configuration files.I have also heard good things about Sphinx, especially in conjunction with a MySQL database. Have not used it, though.IMO, you should choose according to:I have used both Sphinx, Solr and Elasticsearch. Solr/elasticsearch are built on top of Lucene. It adds many common functionality: web server api, faceting, caching, etc.If you want to just have a simple full text search setup, sphinx is a better choice. If you want to customize your search at all, elasticsearch and solr are the better choices. They very extensible: you can write your own plugins to adjust result scoring. Some example usages:We use Sphinx in a Vertical Search project with 10.000.000 + of MySql records and 10+ different database .\nIt has got very excellent support for MySQL and high performance on indexing , research is fast but maybe a little less than Lucene.\nHowever it\'s the right choice if you need quickly indexing every day and use a MySQL db.An experiment to compare ElasticSearch and SolrMy sphinx.confTest script:Sample result:Sphinx query time:Sphinx query time (1k concurrent):MySQL query time:MySQL query time (1k concurrent):Lucene is nice and all, but their stop word set is awful. I had to manually add a ton of stop words to StopAnalyzer.ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS_SET just to get it anywhere near usable.I haven\'t used Sphinx but I know people swear by its speed and near-magical "ease of setup to awesomeness" ratio.Try indextank.As the case of elastic search, it was conceived to be much easier to use than lucene/solr. It also includes very flexible scoring system that can be tweaked without reindexing.The only elasticsearch vs solr performance comparison I\'ve been able to find so far is here:Solr vs elasticsearch Deathmatch!
