I am creating a web page where I have an input text field in which I want to allow only numeric characters like (0,1,2,3,4,5...9) 0-9.How can I do this using jQuery?Have a look at this plug-in (Fork of texotela\'s numeric jquery plugin). This (jStepper) is another one.This is a link if you want to build it yourself.NOTE: If your webpage uses HTML5, you can use the built in <input type="number"> and use the min and max properties to control the minimum and maximum value.The following is minimized and also allows for use of CTRL+x, CTRL+c, and CTRL+vHere is the function I use:You can then attach it to your control by doing:Inline:Unobtrusive style (with jQuery):You could just use a simple JavaScript regular expression to test for purely numeric characters:This returns true if the input is numeric or false if not.or for event keycode, simple use below :You can use on input event like this:But, what\'s this code privilege? Use JavaScript function isNaN,    if (isNaN(document.getElementById(\'inputid\').val())) Update:\nAnd here a nice article talking about it but using jQuery: Restricting Input in HTML Textboxes to Numeric ValuesShort and sweet - even if this will never find much attention after 30+ answers ;)Source: http://snipt.net/GerryEng/jquery-making-textfield-only-accept-numeric-valuesI use this in our internal common js file.  I just add the class to any input that needs this behavior.Simpler one for me isYou can do the same by using this very simple solutionI referred to this link for the solution. It works perfectly!!!You can try the HTML5 number input:For non-compliant browsers there are Modernizr and Webforms2 fallbacks.Why so complicated? You don\'t even need jQuery because there is a HTML5 pattern attribute:The cool thing is that it brings up a numeric keyboard on mobile devices, which is way better than using jQuery.The pattern attribute in HTML5 specifies a regular expression that the  element\'s value is checked against.Note: The pattern attribute works with the following input types: text, search, url, tel, email, and password.[0-9] can be replaced with any regular expression condition.{1,3} it represents minimum of 1 and maximum of 3 digit can be entered. Something fairly simple using jQuery.validatefunction suppressNonNumericInput(event){You can use this JavaScript function:And you can bind it to your textbox like this:I use the above in production, and it works perfectly, and it is cross-browser. Furthermore, it does not depend on jQuery, so you can bind it to your textbox with inline JavaScript:I think it will help everyoneI came to a very good and simple solution that doesn\'t prevent the user from selecting text or copy pasting as other solutions do. jQuery style :)Here is a quick solution I created some time ago. you can read more about it in my article: http://ajax911.com/numbers-numeric-field-jquery/Here is an answer that uses jQuery UI Widget factory. You can customize what characters are allowed easily.That would allow numbers, number signs and dollar amounts.I wanted to help a little, and I made my version, the onlyNumbers function...Just add in input tag "...input ... id="price" onkeydown="return onlyNumbers(event)"..." and you are done ;)I wrote mine based off of @user261922\'s post above, slightly modified so you can select all, tab and can handle multiple "number only" fields on the same page.  I also would like to answer :)That\'s it...just numbers. :) Almost it can work just with the \'blur\', but...You would want to allow tab:This seems unbreakable.Simple way to check that enter value is numeric is:Just need to apply this method in Jquery and you can validate your textbox to just accept number only.Try this solution hereYou can try the HTML5 number input:This input tag element would now take value only between 0 to 9\nas min attribute is set to 0 and max attribute is set to 9. for more information on visit http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_input_types.asp Need to make sure you have the numeric keypad and the tab key working too
