How can I view the change history of an individual file in Git, complete details with what has changed?I have got as far as: which shows me the commit history of the file, but how do I get at the content of each of the file changes?I\'m trying to make the transition from MS SourceSafe and that used to be a simple right-click \xe2\x86\x92 show history.For this I\'d use:or to follow filename past renamesYou can use to let git generate the patches for each log entry. Seefor more options - it can actually do a lot of nice things :) To get just the diff for a specific commit you can or any other revision by identifier. Or use to browse the changes visually.git log --follow -p -- fileThis will show the entire history of the file (including history beyond renames and with diffs for each change).In other words, if the file named bar was once named foo, then git log -p bar (without the --follow option) will only show the file\'s history up to the point where it was renamed -- it won\'t show the file\'s history when it was known as foo. Using git log --follow -p bar will show the file\'s entire history, including any changes to the file when it was known as foo. The -p option ensures that diffs are included for each change.If you prefer to stay text-based, you may want to use tig.Quick Install:Use it to view history on a single file: tig [filename]\nOr browse detailed repo history: tigSimilar to gitk but text based. Supports colors in terminal!git whatchanged -p filename is also equivalent to git log -p filename in this case.You can also see when a specific line of code inside a file was changed with git blame filename. This will print out a short commit id, the author, timestamp, and complete line of code for every line in the file. \nThis is very useful after you\'ve found a bug and you want to know when it was introduced (or who\'s fault it was).If you use SourceTree to visualize your repository (it\'s free and quite good) you can right click a file and select Log SelectedThe display (below) is much friendlier than gitk and most the other options listed. Unfortunately (at this time) there is no easy way to launch this view from the command line \xe2\x80\x94 SourceTree\'s CLI currently just opens repos.To show what revision and author last modified each line of a file:or if you want to use the powerful blame GUI:Summary of other answers after reading through them and playing a bit:The usual command line command would be But you can also use either gitk (gui) or tig (text-ui) to give much more human-readable ways of looking at it.Under debian/ubuntu, the install command for these lovely tools is as expected :And I\'m currently using:so that I can just type gdf dir to get a focussed history of everything in subdirectory dir.Add this alias to your .gitconfig:And use the command like this:The output will look almost exactly the same as the gitk output. Enjoy.Or: gitx -- <path/to/filename>if you\'re using gitxI wrote git-playback for this exact purposeThis has the benefit of both displaying the results in the command line (like git log -p) while also letting you step through each commit using the arrow keys (like gitk).If you want to see the whole history of a file, including on all other branches use:With the excellent Git Extensions, you go to a point in the history where the file still existed (if it have been deleted, otherwise just go to HEAD), switch to the File tree tab, right-click on the file and choose File history.By default, it follows the file through the renames, and the Blame tab allows to see the name at a given revision.It has some minor gotchas, like showing fatal: Not a valid object name in the View tab when clicking on the deletion revision, but I can live with that. :-)If you\'re using the git GUI (on Windows) under the Repository menu you can use "Visualize master\'s History".  Highlight a commit in the top pane and a file in the lower right and you\'ll see the diff for that commit in the lower left.Lately I discovered tig and found it very useful. There are some cases I\'d wish it does A or B but most of the time it\'s rather neat.For your case, tig <filename> might be what you\'re looking for.http://jonas.nitro.dk/tig/If you use TortoiseGit you should be able to right click on the file and do TortoiseGit --> Show Log. In the window that pops up, make sure:\'Show Whole Project\' option is not checked.\'All Branches\' option is checked.The answer I was looking for that wasn\'t in this thread is to see changes in files that I\'d staged for commit. i.e.You can also try this which lists the commits that has changed a specific part of a file (Implemented in Git 1.8.4).Result returned would be the list of commits that modified this particular part. Command goes like :where upperLimit is the start_line_number and lowerLimit is the ending_line_number of the file.SmartGit:If you are using eclipse with the git plugin, it has an excellent comparison view with history. Right click the file and select "compare with"=> "history"git diff -U <filename> give you a unified diff. It should be colored on red and green. If it\'s not, run: git config color.ui auto first.
