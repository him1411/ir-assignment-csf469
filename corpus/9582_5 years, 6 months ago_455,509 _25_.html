This is the code I have so far:The problem is that I think the exception block is being triggered (because when I remove the try-catch, I get a server error (500) message.  But I don\'t see the Console.Out lines I put in the catch block.My Console:I\'m using Visual Studio 2011 Beta, and .NET 4.5 Beta.The ASP.Net Web API has replaced the WCF Web API previously mentioned.I thought I\'d post an updated answer since most of these responses are from early 2012, and this thread is one of the top results when doing a Google search for "call restful service c#".Current guidance from Microsoft is to use the Microsoft ASP.NET Web API Client Libraries to consume a RESTful service. This is available as a NuGet package, Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Client.Here\'s how your example would look when implemented using the ASP.Net Web API Client Library:For more details, including other examples, go here: http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/web-api-clients/calling-a-web-api-from-a-net-clientThis blog post may also be useful: http://johnnycode.com/2012/02/23/consuming-your-own-asp-net-web-api-rest-service/My suggestion would be to use RestSharp. You can make calls to REST services and have them cast into POCO objects with very little boilerplate code to actually have to parse through the response. This will not solve your particular error, but answers your overall question of how to make calls to REST services. Having to change your code to use it should pay off in the ease of use and robustness moving forward. That is just my 2 cents thoughUnrelated, I\'m sure, but do wrap your IDisposable objects in using blocks to ensure proper disposal:Please use below code for your REST api requestUpdate for calling a REST API when using .NET 4.5. I would suggest DalSoft.RestClient (caveat I created it). The reason being because it uses dynamic typing you can wrap everything up in one fluent call including serialization/de-serialization. Below is a working PUT example:Since you are using Visual Studio 11 Beta you will want to use the latest and greatest. The new Web Api contains classes for this.See HttpClient: http://wcf.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=WCF%20HTTPCheck out Refit for making calls to rest services from .net.  I\'ve found it very easy to use: https://github.com/paulcbetts/refitRefit: The automatic type-safe REST library for .NET Core, Xamarin and\n  .NETRefit is a library heavily inspired by Square\'s Retrofit library, and\n  it turns your REST API into a live interface:This is an example code that works for sure. It took me a day to make this to read a set of object from Rest service:RootObject is the type of the object Im reading from the rest service. You can try using the simpler WebClient class:http://www.dotnetperls.com/webclientNote: To serialize and desirialze JSON I used Newtonsoft.Json NuGet package.
