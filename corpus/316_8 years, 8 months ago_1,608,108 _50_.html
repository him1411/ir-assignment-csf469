I am using jQuery. How do I get the path of the current URL and assign it to a variable?Example URL:To get the path, you can use:In pure jQuery style:The location object also has other properties, like host, hash, protocol, and pathname.This will work only if you have jQuery. For example:If you need the hash parameters present in the URL, window.location.href may be a better choice.You\'ll want to use JavaScript\'s built-in window.location object.Just add this function in JavaScript, and it will return the absolute path of the current path.I hope it works for you.window.location is an object in javascript. it returns following datain jquery you can use This is a more complicated issue than many may think.  Several browsers support built-in JavaScript location objects and associated parameters/methods accessible through window.location or document.location. However, different flavors of Internet Explorer (6,7) don\'t support these methods in the same way, (window.location.href?  window.location.replace() not supported) so you have to access them differently by writing conditional code all the time to hand-hold Internet Explorer.So, if you have jQuery available and loaded, you might as well use jQuery (location), as the others mentioned because it resolves these issues. If however, you are doing-for an example-some client-side geolocation redirection via JavaScript (that is, using Google Maps API and location object methods), then you may not want to load the entire jQuery library and write your conditional code that checks every version of Internet Explorer/Firefox/etc.Internet Explorer makes the front-end coding cat unhappy, but jQuery is a plate of milk.For the host name only, use:This will also work:You can log window.location and see all the options, for just the URL use:for the whole path use:there\'s also location.__This will return the absolute URL of the current page using JavaScript/jQuery. document.URL$("*").context.baseURIlocation.hrefIf there is someone who wants to concatenate the URL and hash tag, combine two functions:java-script provides many methods to retrieve current URL which is displayed in browser\'s address bar.Test URL : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5515310/is-there-a-standard-function-to-check-for-null-undefined-or-blank-variables-in/32942762?rq=1&page=2&tab=active&answertab=votes#32942762Function:EX: With default port numbersDomain names are which you register by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System(DNS) tree.

This will give you the complete URL.window.location will give you the current URL, and you can extract whatever you want from it...If you want to get the path of the root site, use this:var path = location.pathname returns the path of the current URL in jQuery. There is no need to use window.See purl.js. This will really help and can also be used, depending on jQuery. Use it like this:You can simply get your path using js itself, window.location or location will give you the object of current URLIn jstl we can access current url path using pageContext.request.contextPath, If you want to do a ajax call,Ex: in the page http://stackoverflow.com/questions/406192 this will give http://stackoverflow.com/controller/pathvar newURL = window.location.protocol + "//" + window.location.host + "/" + window.location.pathname;Very Commonly Used top 3 ones are
