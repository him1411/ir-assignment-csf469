I\'ve found a few "would be" solutions for the classic "How do I insert a new record or update one if it already exists" but I cannot get any of them to work in SQLite.I have a table defined as follows:What I want to do is add a record with a unique Name. If the Name already exists, I want to modify the fields. Can somebody tell me how to do this please?Have a look at http://sqlite.org/lang_conflict.html.You want something like:Note that any field not in the insert list will be set to NULL if the row already exists in the table. This is why there\'s a subselect for the ID column: In the replacement case the statement would set it to NULL and then a fresh ID would be allocated.This approach can also be used if you want to leave particular field values alone if the row in the replacement case but set the field to NULL in the insert case.For example, assuming you want to leave Seen alone:You need to set a constraint on the table to trigger a "conflict" which you then resolve by doing a replace:Then you can issue:The "SELECT * FROM data" will give you:Note that the data.id is "3" and not "1" because REPLACE does a DELETE and INSERT, not an UPDATE. This also means that you must ensure that you define all necessary columns or you will get unexpected NULL values.You should use the INSERT OR IGNORE command followed by an UPDATE command:\nIn the following example \'name\' is a primary key:example:The first command will insert the record. If the record exists it will ignore the error caused by the conflict with an existing primary key.The second command will update the record (which is now definitely exists)Firstly update it. If affected row count = 0 then insert it. Its the easiest and suitable for all RDBMS.INSERT OR REPLACE will replace the other fields (TypeID, Level) to default value.I am using thisYou can also usebut I think the first method more easy to readI believe you want UPSERT."INSERT OR REPLACE" without the additional trickery in that answer will reset any fields you don\'t specify to NULL or other default value. (This behavior of INSERT OR REPLACE is unlike UPDATE; it\'s exactly like INSERT, because it actually is INSERT; however if what you wanted is UPDATE-if-exists you probably want the UPDATE semantics and will be unpleasantly surprised by the actual result.)The trickery from the suggested UPSERT implementation is basically to use INSERT OR REPLACE, but specify all fields, using embedded SELECT clauses to retrieve the current value for fields you don\'t want to change.If you have no primary key, You can insert if not exist, then do an update. The table must contain at least one entry before using this.I think it\'s worth pointing out that there can be some unexpected behaviour here if you don\'t thoroughly understand how PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE interact.As an example, if you want to insert a record only if the NAME field isn\'t currently taken, and if it is, you want a constraint exception to fire to tell you, then INSERT OR REPLACE will not throw and exception and instead will resolve the UNIQUE constraint itself by replacing the conflicting record (the existing record with the same NAME). Gaspard\'s demonstrates this really well in his answer above.If you want a constraint exception to fire, you have to use an INSERT statement, and rely on a separate UPDATE command to update the record once you know the name isn\'t taken.
