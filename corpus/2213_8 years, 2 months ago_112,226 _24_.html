I\'d like to know if it is possible to extract a single file or diff of a file from a git stash without popping the stash changeset off.Might anyone be able to provide some suggestions/ideas about this?In git stash manpage you can read that (in "Discussion" section, just after "Options" description):A  stash  is  represented  as  a commit whose tree records the state of the\n   working directory, and its first parent is the  commit  at  HEAD  when  the\n   stash  was  created.So you can treat stash (e.g. stash@{0} is first / topmost stash) as a merge commit, and use:Explanation: stash@{0}^1 shortcut means first parent of given stash, which as stated in explanation above is commit at which changes were stashed away. We use this form of "git diff" (with two commits) because stash@{0} / refs/stash is a merge commit, and we have to tell git which parent we want to diff against. More cryptic:should also work (see git rev-parse manpage for explanation of rev^! syntax, in "Specifying ranges" section).Likewise, you can use git checkout to check a single file out of the stash:or to save it under another filename:or(note that here <full filename> is full pathname of a file relative to top directory of a project (think: relative to stash@{0})).You might need to protect stash@{0} from shell expansion, i.e. use "stash@{0}" or \'stash@{0}\'.If you use git stash apply rather than git stash pop, it will apply the stash to your working tree but still keep the stash.With this done, you can add/commit the file that you want and then reset the remaining changes.You can get the diff for a stash with "git show stash@{0}" (or whatever the number of the stash is; see "git stash list").  It\'s easy to extract the section of the diff for a single file.To see the whole file: git show stash@{0}:<filename>To see the diff: git diff stash@{0}^1 stash@{0} -- <filename>The simplest concept to understand, although maybe not the best, is you have three files changed and you want to stash one file.If you do git stash to stash them all, git stash apply to bring them back again and then git checkout f.c on the file in question to effectively reset it.When you want to unstash that file run do a git reset --hard and then run git stash apply again, taking advantage ofthe fact that git stash apply doesn\'t clear the diff from the stash stack.There is an easy way to get changes from any branch, including stashes:You may omit the file spec if you want to patch in many parts. Or omit patch (but not the path) to get all changes to a single file. Replace 0 with the stash number from git stash list, if you have more than one. Note that this is like diff, and offers to apply all differences between the branches. To get changes from only a single commit/stash, have a look at git cherry-pick --no-commit.Note:1) Make sure you put space after the "--" and the file name parameter\n     2) replace zero(0) with your specific stash number. to get stash list use Based on @Jakub Nar\xc4\x99bski answer -- Shorter version
