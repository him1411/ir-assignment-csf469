I\'ve compiled Trebuchet launcher from CyanogenMod 9, and trying to install it with adb:I tried on Nexus S with CM9 and Galaxy Nexus with stock JB. Why I\'m getting this error?it means the application which you want to install is already installed. just remove the old one and try again.TryIt works for me. I have remove my app using Titanium Backup. However,I think Titanium backup didn\'t removed my app totally.Uninstalling the application would be enough to avoid this problem.but sometimes even uninstalling the message is raised again, it occurs in Android OS 5.0 +, so this is the solution:Go to Settings > Apps and you will find your app with the message: "Not installed for this user"\n  We have to uninstall manually for all users!, then we can install our compiled application with no problems.Use Android Debug Bridge command:adb uninstall [PACKAGE NAME]Two ways that can be works1: Uninstall app from mobile device manually 2: Open command prompt , trace path of adband execute following command I just renamed the package and it worked for me.This maybe because you have more than one user in your device and you\'ve just deleted the app on one (leaving the apk still present for the other(s)).I\'ve deleted in all accounts, and it worked afterwards.I installed Astro file manager and searched for a previous version of the apk-file, found one on the sdcard and deleted the apk-file using Astro file manager.If your device supports multiple users, you might have to delete the app for each account as well.I usually use adb and that does the trick\nadb uninstall <your-package-name>In my case there was no version of the App I could find through device manager or Astro. What I ended up doing was:1) Download the latest version of the App from the app store2) The app was still not visible in device manager until I restarted my device.3) Remove the app from device manager4) Run my project again 5) Everything works Hope this helps someone Go to Setting/Apps/ \nSearch for your app and unistall...It\xc2\xb4s worked for meIt\xc2\xb4s worked for meThe question was why he\'s getting this error. Uninstalling will solve this problem but in my case, while I was installing the compiled version of the apk, the problem raised. I was trying to build an update for my application. So what I did, I built a signed apk and then tried to install the apk and the apk installed perfectly. So, rather removing the old apk, I had to sign the newer update and then installed it. if the APK is built in project with Android.mk file. Maybe it\'s because of the sign certificate has been changed.in my problem, I have add LOCAL_CERTIFICATE := platform. as the original apk is signed without this tag.For MIUI users, apart for usual USB debugging option be sure to enable these settings as well:Install via USB\nUSB debugging(Security settings)then accept the prompt when you try installing app again.In my case, I have installed Application from Playstore and after when I am trying to run from Eclipse or Android Studio so it will try to install again on that APK that will not allow. So First of all you have to Uninstall that Siged APK and after that you have to try.Thank you.RankoR@ you must have installed the application from a different computer. in my case thats where the problem arose .. all you need to do is just uninstall the application and reinstall it or run it from the computer you are working .. this might be a late reply but it will help some one .. thanks
