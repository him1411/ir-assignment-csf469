Can anybody tell me what daemon threads are in Java?A daemon thread is a thread that does not prevent the JVM from exiting when the program finishes but the thread is still running. An example for a daemon thread is the garbage collection.You can use the setDaemon(boolean) method to change the Thread daemon properties before the thread starts.A few more points (Reference: Java Concurrency in Practice)  Normal thread and daemon threads differ in what happens when\nthey exit. When the JVM halts any remaining daemon threads are\nabandoned: Due to this reason daemon threads\nshould be used sparingly and it is dangerous to use them for tasks\nthat might perform any sort of I/O.All the above answers are good. Here\'s a simple little code snippet, to illustrate the difference. Try it with each of the values of true and false in setDaemon.Traditionally daemon processes in UNIX were those that were constantly running in background, much like services in Windows.A daemon thread in Java is one that doesn\'t prevent the JVM from exiting. Specifically the JVM will exit when only daemon threads remain. You create one by calling the setDaemon() method on Thread.Have a read of Daemon threads.Daemon threads are like a service providers for other threads or objects running in the same process as the daemon thread. Daemon threads are used for background supporting tasks and are only needed while normal threads are executing. If normal threads are not running and remaining threads are daemon threads then the interpreter exits.For example, the HotJava browser uses up to four daemon threads named "Image Fetcher" to fetch images from the file system or network for any thread that needs one.Daemon threads are typically used to perform services for your application/applet (such as loading the "fiddley bits"). The core difference between user threads and daemon threads is that the JVM will only shut down a program when all user threads have terminated. Daemon threads are terminated by the JVM when there are no longer any user threads running, including the main thread of execution.setDaemon(true/false) ? This method is used to specify that a thread is daemon thread.public boolean isDaemon() ? This method is used to determine the thread is daemon thread or not. Eg:OutPut:A daemon thread is a thread that is considered doing some tasks in the background like handling requests or various chronjobs that can exist in an application.When your program only have damon threads remaining it will exit. That\'s because usually these threads work together with normal threads and provide background handling of events.You can specify that a Thread is a demon one by using setDaemon method, they usually don\'t exit, neither they are interrupted.. they just stop when application stops.Java has a special kind of thread called daemon thread. What are daemon threads used for?  Normally used as service providers for normal threads.\nUsually have an infinite loop that waits for the service request or performs the tasks of the thread.\nThey can\xe2\x80\x99t do important jobs. (Because we don\'t know when they are going to have CPU time and they can finish any time if there aren\'t any other threads running. )A typical example of these kind of threads is the Java garbage collector.There\'s more...  One misconception I would like to clarify:What is Daemon thread in java? Daemon Thread and User Threads. Generally all threads created by programmer are user thread (unless you specify it to be daemon or your parent thread is a daemon thread). User thread are generally meant to run our programm code. JVM doesn\'t terminates unless all the user thread terminate. Daemon thread is just like a normal thread except that the JVM will only shut down when the other non daemon threads are not existing. Daemon threads are typically used to perform services for your application.Daemon threads are as everybody explained, will not constrain JVM to exit, so basically its a happy thread for Application from exit point of view.Want to add that daemon threads can be used when say I\'m providing an API like pushing data to a 3rd party server / or JMS, I might need to aggregate data at the client JVM level and then send to JMS in a separate thread. I can make this thread as daemon thread, if this is not a mandatory data to be pushed to server.\nThis kind of data is like log push / aggregation. Regards,\nManishDaemon thread in Java are those thread which runs in background and mostly created by JVM for performing background task like Garbage collection and other house keeping tasks.Points to Note : Any thread created by main thread, which runs main method in Java is by default non daemon because Thread inherits its daemon nature from the Thread which creates it i.e. parent Thread and since main thread is a non daemon thread, any other thread created from it will remain non-daemon until explicitly made daemon by calling setDaemon(true).Thread.setDaemon(true) makes a Thread daemon but it can only be called before starting Thread in Java. It will throw IllegalThreadStateException if corresponding Thread is already started and running.Difference between Daemon and Non Daemon thread in Java :1) JVM doesn\'t wait for any daemon thread to finish before existing.2) Daemon Thread are treated differently than User Thread when JVM terminates, finally blocks are not called, Stacks are not unwounded and JVM just exits.Daemon thread is like daemon process which is responsible for managing resources,a daemon thread is created by the Java VM to serve the user threads.\nexample updating system for unix,unix is daemon process.\nchild of daemon thread is always daemon thread,so by default daemon is false.you can check thread as daemon or user by using "isDaemon()" method.\nso daemon thread or daemon process are basically responsible for managing resources.\nfor example when you starting jvm there is garbage collector running that is daemon thread whose priority is 1 that is lowest,which is managing memory.\njvm is alive as long as user thread is alive,u can not kill daemon thread.jvm is responsible to kill daemon threads.Daemon threads are generally known as "Service Provider" thread. These threads should not be used to execute program code but system code. These threads run parallel to your code but JVM can kill them anytime. When JVM finds no user threads, it stops it and all daemon threads terminate instantly. We can set non-daemon thread to daemon using : Daemon threads are like assistants. Non-Daemon threads are like front performers. Assistants help performers to complete a job. When the job is completed, no help is needed by performers to  perform anymore. As no help is needed the assistants leave the place. So when the jobs of Non-Daemon threads is over, Daemon threads march away.To specify that a thread is a daemon thread, call the setDaemon method with the argument true. To determine if a thread is a daemon thread, use the accessor method isDaemon.Hope this may help!!!!!!For me, daemon thread it\'s like house keeper for user threads.\nIf all user threads finished , the daemon thread has no job and \nkilled by JVM.\nI explained it in the YouTube video.Daemon threads are threads that run in background as long as other non-daemon threads of the process are still running. Thus, when all of the non-daemon threads complete, the daemon threads are terminated. An example for non-daemon thread is the thread running the Main.\nA thread is made daemon by calling the setDaemon() method before the thread is startedFor More Reference : Daemon thread in JavaLet\'s talk only in code with working examples. I like russ\'s answer above but to remove any doubt I had, I enhanced it a little bit. I ran it twice, once with the worker thread set to deamon true  (deamon thread) and another time set it to false (user thread). It confirms that the deamon thread ends when the main thread terminates.Daemon threads die when the creator thread exits.Non-daemon threads (default) can even live longer than the main thread.In Java, Daemon Threads are one of the types of thread which does not prevent Java Virtual Machine (JVM) from exiting.\nThe main purpose of daemon thread is to execute background task especially in case of some routine periodic task or work. With JVM exits, daemon thread also dies.By setting a thread.setDaemon(true), a thread becomes a daemon thread. However, you can only set this value before the thread start.
