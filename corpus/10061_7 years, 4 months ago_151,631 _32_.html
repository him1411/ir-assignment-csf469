I am reusing ImageViews for my displays, but at some point I don\'t have values to put it.So how to clear an ImageView in Android?I\'ve tried:None of them have cleared the view, it still shows previous image.I used to do it with the dennis.sheppard solution:it works but it is not documentated so it isn\'t realy clear if it effects something else in the view (you can check the ImageView code if you like, i didn\'t).I think the best solution is:I like this solution the most cause there isn\'t anything tricky in reverting the state and it\'s also clear what it is doing.I had a similar problem, where I needed to basically remove ImageViews from the screen completely.  Some of the answers here led me in the right direction, but ultimately calling setImageDrawable() worked for me: I know this is old, but I was able to accomplish this with Doesn\'t seem like it should work, but I tried it on a whim, and it worked perfectly.It sounds like what you want is a default image to set your ImageView to when it\'s not displaying a different image.  This is how the Contacts application does it:I tried this for to clear Image and DrawableCache in ImageViewI hope this works for you !If none of these solutions are clearing an image you\'ve already set (especially setImageResource(0) or setImageResources(android.R.color.transparent), check to make sure the current image isn\'t set as background using setBackgroundDrawable(...) or something similar.Your code will just set the image resource in the foreground to something transparent in front of that background image you\'ve set and will still show.Hey i know i am extremely late to this answer, but just thought i must share this,The method to call when u reset the image must be the same method that u called while u were setting it.When u want to reset the image source @dennis.sheepard answer works fine only if u are originally setting the image in the bitmap using setImageResource()for instance,i had used setImageBitmap() and hence setting setImageResource(0) didn work, instead i used setImageBitmap(null). I was able to achieve this by defining a drawable (something like blank_white_shape.xml):Then when I want to clear the image view I just call This works beautifully for me!For ListView item image you can set ImageView.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE) or ImageView.setImageBitmap(null) in list adapter for "no image" case.As kwasi wrote and golu edited, you can use transparent, instead of white:File drawable/transparent.xmlInside an activity, view, etc:To remove the image in ImageView use:\ntitle_image.setImageResource(-1);\nit works for meCan i just point out what you are all trying to set and int where its expecting a drawable.should you not be doing the following?Try mPhotoView.setAlpha(0) to make the image completely transparent (restore with 255).
