Is there a way to make Python logging using the logging module automatically output things to stdout in addition to the log file where they are supposed to go? For example, I\'d like all calls to logger.warning, logger.critical, logger.error to go to their intended places but in addition always be copied to stdout. This is to avoid duplicating messages like:All logging output is handled by the handlers; just add a logging.StreamHandler() to the root logger.Here\'s an example configuring a stream handler (using stdout instead of the default stderr) and adding it to the root logger:the simplest way:It\'s possible using multiple handlers.Please see: https://docs.python.org/2/howto/logging-cookbook.htmlThe simplest way to log to file and to stderr:You could create two handlers for file and stdout and then create one logger with handlers argument to basicConfig. It could be useful if you have the same log_level and format output for both handlers:hackish, but simpler:then whenever you need to print+log something just calland at then end of the script close the log file:
