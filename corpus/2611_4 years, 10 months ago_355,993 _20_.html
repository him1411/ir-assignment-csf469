If there\'s no way to do something like that in JavaScript, I want to know an alternative solution that also follows DRY concept.Use the fall-through feature of the switch statement. A matched case will run until a break (or the end of the switch statement) is found, so you could write it like:Here\'s different approach avoiding the switch statement altogether:This works in regular JavaScriptCheers.In Js for assign multiple cases in switch We have to define different case without break like given below:Please see example click on linkIf you\'re using ES6, you can do this:Or for earlier versions of JavaScript, you can do this:Note that this won\'t work in older IE browsers, but you could patch things up fairly easily. See the question determine if string is in list in javascript for more information.you can use the \'in\' operator... \nrelies on the object/hash invocation... \nso its as fast as javascript can be... Enjoy, ZEEIn node it appears that you are allowed to do this:This makes for much more compact code in some cases.It depends. Switch evaluates once and only once.  Upon a match, all subsequent case statements until \'break\' fire no matter what the case says.In this example, if the value of myVariable is A, B, or C, it will execute the code under case "C":.You could write it like this:just switch the switch condition aprroach
