If I have a file or directory that is a symbolic link and I commit it to a git repo what happens to it?I would assume that it leaves it as a symbolic link until the file is deleted and then if you pull the file back from an old version it just creates a normal file.What does it do when I delete the file it references? Does it just commit the dangling link?git just stores the contents of the link (i.e. the path of the file system object that it links to) in a \'blob\' just like it would for a normal file. It then stores the name, mode and type (including the fact that it is a symlink) in the tree object that represents its containing directory.When you checkout a tree containing the link, it restores the object as a symlink regardless of whether the target file system object exists or not.If you delete the file that the symlink references it doesn\'t affect the git-controlled symlink in any way. You will have a dangling reference. It is up to the user to either remove or change the link to point to something valid if needed.Symlinked directories:It\'s important to note what happens when there is a directory which is a soft link.\nAny git pull with an update removes the link and makes it a normal directory. This is what I learnt hard way. Some insights here and here.ExampleBeforegit add/commit/pushAfter git pull AND some updates foundTL;DR: The data referenced by the symlink is not stored in the repository.You can find out what Git does with a file by seeing what it does when you add it to the index. The index is like a pre-commit. With the index committed, you can use git checkout to bring everything that was in the index back into the working directory. So, what does Git do when you add a symbolic link to the index?To find out, first, make a symbolic link:Git doesn\'t know about this file yet. git ls-files lets you inspect your index (-s prints stat-like output):Now, add the contents of the symbolic link to the Git object store by adding it to the index. When you add a file to the index, Git stores its contents in the Git object store.So, what was added?The hash is a reference to the packed object that was created in the Git object store. You can examine this object if you look in .git/objects/15/96f9db1b9610f238b78dd168ae33faa2dec15c. The 120000 is the file mode. It would be something like 100644 for a regular file and is the mode special for links. From man git-config:core.symlinksIf false, symbolic links are checked out as small plain files that contain the link text. git-update-index(1) and git-add(1) will not change the recorded type to regular file. Use git cat-file -p to pretty-print the contents:So, that\'s what Git does to a symbolic link: when you git checkout the symbolic link, you either get a text file with a reference to a full filesystem path, or a symlink, depending on configuration. The data referenced by the symlink is not stored in the repository.
