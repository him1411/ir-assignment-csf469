On iPhone NSLocalizedString returns the string in the language of the iPhone.\nIs it possible to force NSLocalizedString to use a specific language to have the app\nin a different language than the device ?NSLocalizedString() (and variants thereof) access the "AppleLanguages" key in NSUserDefaults to determine what the user\'s settings for preferred languages are.  This returns an array of language codes, with the first one being the one set by the user for their phone, and the subsequent ones used as fallbacks if a resource is not available in the preferred language.  (on the desktop, the user can specify multiple languages with a custom ordering in System Preferences)You can override the global setting for your own application if you wish by using the setObject:forKey: method to set your own language list.  This will take precedence over the globally set value and be returned to any code in your application that is performing localization.  The code for this would look something like:This would make German the preferred language for your application, with English and French as fallbacks.  You would want to call this sometime early in your application\'s startup.  You can read more about language/locale preferences here: Internationalization Programming Topics: Getting the Current Language and LocaleI usually do this in this way, but  you MUST have all localization files in your project.I had the same problem recently and I didn\'t want to start and patch my entire NSLocalizedString nor force the app to restart for the new language to work. I wanted everything to work as-is.My solution was to dynamically change the main bundle\'s class and load the appropriate bundle there:Header fileImplementationSo basically, when your app starts and before you load your first controller, simply call:When your user changes his preferred language in your setting screen, simply call it again:To reset back to system defaults, simply pass nil:Enjoy...Do not use on iOS 9.  This returns nil for all strings passed through it.I have found another solution that allows you to update the language strings, w/o restarting the app and compatible with genstrings:Put this macro in the Prefix.pch:and where ever you need a localized string use: To set the language use:Works even with consecutive language hopping like:As said earlier, just do:But to avoid having to restart the app, put the line in the main method of main.m, just before UIApplicationMain(...).The trick to use specific language by selecting it from the app is to force the NSLocalizedString to use specific bundle depending on the selected language ,here is the post i have written for this \nlearning advance localization in ios appsand here is the code of one sample app advance localization in ios appsI like best Mauro Delrio\'s method.\nI also have added the following in my Project_Prefix.pchSo if you ever want to use the standard method (that uses NSLocalizedString) you can make a quick syntax substitution in all files.As Brian Webster mentions, the language needs to be set "sometime early in your application\'s startup". I thought applicationDidFinishLaunching: of the AppDelegate should be a suitable place to do it, since it\'s where I do all other initialization.But as William Denniss mentions, that seems to have an effect only after the app is restarted, which is kind of useless.It seems to work fine if I put the code in the main function, though:I\'d appreciate any comments on this.NSLocalizedString() reads the value for the key AppleLanguages from the standard user defaults ([NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]). It uses that value to choose an appropriate localization among all existing localizations at runtime. When Apple builds the user defaults dictionary at app launch, they look up the preferred language(s) key in the system preferences and copy the value from there. This also explains for example why changing the language settings in OS X has no effect on running apps, only on apps started thereafter. Once copied, the value is not updated just because the settings change. That\'s why iOS restarts all apps if you change then language.However, all values of the user defaults dictionary can be overwritten by command line arguments. See NSUserDefaults documentation on the NSArgumentDomain. This even includes those values that are loaded from the app preferences (.plist) file. This is really good to know if you want to change a value just once for testing.So if you want to change the language just for testing, you probably don\'t want to alter your code (if you forget to remove this code later on ...), instead tell Xcode to start your app with a command line parameters (e.g. use Spanish localization):No need to touch your code at all. Just create different schemes for different languages and you can quickly start the app once in one language and once in another one by just switching the scheme.I came up with a solution that allows you to use NSLocalizedString. I create a category of NSBundle call NSBundle+RunTimeLanguage. The interface is like this.The implementation is like this.Than just add import NSBundle+RunTimeLanguage.h into the files that use NSLocalizedString. As you can see I store my languageCode in a property of AppDelegate.  This could be stored anywhere you\'d like.This only thing I don\'t like about it is a Warning that NSLocalizedString marco redefined.  Perhaps someone could help me fix this part.It\'s the first thing you have to do is to localise your app with at least two languages (english and french in this example).In your code, instead of using NSLocalizedString(key, comment), use a macro MYLocalizedString(key, comment) defined like this :\n#define MYLocalizedString(key, comment) [[MYLocalizationSystem sharedInstance] localizedStringForKey:(key) value:(comment)];This MYLocalizationSystem singleton will :When user changed application language in french, call [[MYLocalizationSystem sharedInstance] setLanguage:@"fr"];In this example this method set localized bundle to fr.lprojOnce you\'ve set the localized bundle, you\'ll be able to get the right localised string from him with this method :Hope this will help you.You\'ll find more details in this article from NSWinery.ioSwift Version:In file .pch to define:    Maybe you should complement with this (on .pch file after #import ):What do you think about this solution for Swift 3?Simple usage:You could build a sub-bundle with the set of localized strings that you want to do this with, and then use NSLocalizedStringFromTableInBundle() to load them. (I\'m assuming that this is content separate from the normal UI localization you might be doing on the app.)for my case i have two localized file , ja and en and i would like to force it to en if the preferred language in the system neither en or jai\'m going to edit the main.m filei \'ll check whether the first preferred is en or ja , if not then i \'ll change the second preferred language to  en.This function will try to get localized string for current language and if it\'s not found it will get it using english language.I wanted to add support for a language that isn\'t officially supported by iOS (not listed in Language section under system settings). By following the Apple\'s Internationalization Tutorial and few hints here by Brian Webster and geon, I came up with this piece of code (put it in main.m):This works well for both Storyboard and NSLocalizedString code. The code assumes that user will have an option to manually change language inside app later on.Of course, don\'t forget to add proper Storyboard translations and Localizable.strings translations (see link to Apple page above for how to do that).You can do something like this:Here is a decent solution for this problem, and it does not require application restart.https://github.com/cmaftuleac/BundleLocalizationThis implementation works by tweaking inside NSBundle. The idea is that you override the method localizedStringForKey on the instance of NSBundle object, and then call this method on a different bundle with a different language. Simple and elegant fully compatible with all types of resources.Based on Tudorizer\'s answer to change language without leaving or restarting the application. Instead of a macro, use a class for accessing the preferred language in order to check if a specific language code is present.Below is a class used to obtain the current language bundle that is working for iOS 9:Use the class above to reference a string file / image / video / etc:Change language in-line like below or update the "changeCurrentLanguage" method in the class above to take a string parameter referencing the new language.Swift 3 extensions:Usage:whatever you all do, the best way is to take the short_name for the specified language, i.e.: fr, en, nl, de, it, etc... and assign the same to a global value.make a picker view to pop up like a drop down menu (combination of a button on click of which a picker view appears from below with a list of languages) and select the language you desire. let the short name be stored internally.\nmake a .h + .m file named LocalisedString.Set the global value of short_name to be equal to the obtained value in LocalisedString.m\nWhen the required language is selected assign the NSBundlePath to create project sub-directories for the needed language. for eg, nl.proj, en.proj.When the particular proj folder is selected call the localised string for the respective language and change the language dynamically.no rules broken.Swift 3 solution:Gave some examples of language codes that can be used. Hope this helps
