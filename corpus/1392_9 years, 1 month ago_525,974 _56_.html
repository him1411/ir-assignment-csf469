In a C# (feel free to answer for other languages) loop, what\'s the difference between break and continue as a means to leave the structure of the loop, and go to the next iteration?Example:break will exit the loop completely, continue will just skip the current iteration.For example:The break will cause the loop to exit on the first iteration - DoSomeThingWith will never be executed. This here:Will not execute DoSomeThingWith for i = 0, but the loop will continue and DoSomeThingWith will be executed for i = 1 to i = 9.A really easy way to understand this is to place the word "loop" after each of the keywords.  The terms now make sense if they are just read like everyday phrases.break loop - looping is broken and stops.continue loop - loop continues to execute with the next iteration.break causes the program counter to jump out of the scope of the innermost loopWorks like thiscontinue jumps to the end of the loop.  In a for loop, continue jumps to the increment expression.Works like thisbreak would stop the foreach loop completely, continue would skip to the next DataRow.There are more than a few people who don\'t like break and continue. The latest complaint I saw about them was in JavaScript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford. But I find that sometimes using one of them really simplifies things, especially if your language doesn\'t include a do-while or do-until style of loop.I tend to use break in loops that are searching a list for something. Once found, there\'s no point in continuing, so you might as well quit.I use continue when doing something with most elements of a list, but still want to skip over a few.The break statement also comes in handy when polling for a valid response from somebody or something. Instead of:You could eliminate some duplication and use:The do-until loop that I mentioned before is the more elegant solution for that particular problem:No duplication, and no break needed either.All have given a very good explanation. I am still posting my answer just to give an example if that can help.Here is the output:0[Printed] 1[Printed] 2[Printed] So 3[Printed] & 4[Printed] will not be displayed as there is break when i == 3Here is the output:0[Printed] 1[Printed] 2[Printed] 4[Printed] So 3[Printed]  will not be displayed as there is continue when i == 3By examplePrints 1, 2, 3 (on separate lines).Add a break condition at i = 2Now the loop prints 1 and stops.Replace the break with a continue.Now to loop prints 1 and 3 (skipping 2).Thus, break stops the loop, whereas continue skips to the next iteration.BreakBreak forces a loop to exit immediately. ContinueThis does the opposite of break. Instead of terminating the loop, it immediately loops again, skipping the rest of the code.Ruby unfortunately is a bit different. \nPS: My memory is a bit hazy on this so apologies if I\'m wronginstead of break/continue, it has break/next, which behave the same in terms of loopsLoops (like everything else) are expressions, and "return" the last thing that they did. Most of the time, getting the return value from a loop is pointless, so everyone just does thisYou can however do thisHOWEVER, a lot of ruby code \'emulates\' a loop by using a block.\nThe canonical example isAs it is much more common for people to want to do things with the result of a block, this is where it gets messy.\nbreak/next mean different things in the context of a block.break will jump out of the code that called the blocknext will skip the rest of the code in the block, and \'return\' what you specify to the caller of the block. This doesn\'t make any sense without examples.So yeah. Ruby is awesome, but it has some awful corner-cases. This is the second worst one I\'ve seen in my years of using it :-)Simple answer: Break exits the loop immediately.\nContinue starts processing the next item. (If there are any, by jumping to the evaluating line of the for/while)Please let me state the obvious: note that adding neither break nor continue, will resume your program; i.e. I trapped for a certain error, then after logging it, I wanted to resume processing, and there were more code tasks in between the next row, so I just let it fall through.To break completely out of a foreach loop, break is used;To go to the next iteration in the loop, continue is used;Break is useful if you\xe2\x80\x99re looping through a collection of Objects (like Rows in a Datatable) and you are searching for a particular match, when you find that match, there\xe2\x80\x99s no need to continue through the remaining rows, so you want to break out.Continue is useful when you have accomplished what you need to in side a loop iteration. You\xe2\x80\x99ll normally have continue after an if.if you don\'t want to use break you just increase value of I in such a way that it make iteration condition false and loop will not execute on next iteration.
