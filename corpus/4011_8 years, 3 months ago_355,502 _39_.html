Can someone tell me, what command to put at the end of a batch file to prevent auto-closing of console after the execution of file?In Windows/DOS batch files:This prints a nice "Press any key to continue . . . " messageOr, if you don\'t want the "Press any key to continue . . ." message, do this instead:Depends on the exact question!Normally pause does the job within a .bat file.If you want cmd.exe not to close to be able to remain typing, use cmd /k command.If you want cmd.exe to not close, and able to continue to type, use cmd /kJust felt the need to clarify what /k does (from windows website):/k : Carries out the command specified by string and continues.So cmd /k without follow up command at the end of bat file will just keep cmd.exe window open for further use.On the other hand pause at the end of a batch file will simply pause the process and terminate cmd.exe on first button press Add cmd.exe as a new line below the code you want to execute:The below way of having commands in a batch file will open  new command prompt windows and the new windows will not exit automatically. Call cmd at the end of the batch file.my way is to write an actual batch (saying "foo.bat") to finish the job; then create another "start.bat":I find this is extremely useful when I set up one-time environment variables.besides  pause.can be used .It will expect user input and will release the flow when enter is pressed.orwhich will do the same except nothing from the user input will be displayed nor will remain in the command history.Possibility 1:\nJust make 2 .bat files and write into the first:Batch file 2 is the file that wont close in the end.\nSo now when you open batch nr.1 It will start the 2nd and cloe itself.\nWhen the 2nd finishes it will not close entirely (as long as you wont put exit at the end)Possibility 2:\nBatch file 1:When the 2nd file ends then it will proceed to file 1 again and output the rest of it. With that you can even make error handlers. If nr.1 crashes it goes into nr.2 and displays itThere are two ways to do it depend on use case1) If you want Windows cmd prompt to stay open so that you can see execution result and close it afterwards; usepause2) if you want Windows cmd prompt to stay open and allow you to execute some command afterwords; usecmdEasy, add cmd to your last line of bat, BUT! if you reset or clear your system path, you must start your cmd with the full path, like: For example, I have a bat file to reset jdk to old version like this:since I reset the system path, I have to run cmd with the full path, or the system can\'t find cmd.exe, it will fail to run cmd, and just close the window, and you can\'t see the error msg.type to show: and the window will close after a key press. To hide the text printed in the command prompt, type I know I\'m late but my prefereed way is this:In this way the user cannot exit using enter.
