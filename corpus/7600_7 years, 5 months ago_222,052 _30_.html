What does this line of code mean?The ? and : confuse me.This is the C ternary operator (Objective-C is a superset of C):is semantically equivalent toThe ternary with no first element (e.g. variable ?: anotherVariable) means the same as (valOrVar != 0) ? valOrVar : anotherValOrVarIt\'s the ternary or conditional operator. It\'s basic form is:Where the values will only be evaluated if they are chosen.Building on Barry Wark\'s excellent explanation...What is so important about the ternary operator is that it can be used in places that an if-else cannot. ie: Inside a condition or method parameter....which is a great use for preprocessor constants:This saves you from having to use and release local variables in if-else patterns. FTW!Simply, the logic would be(condition) ? (code for YES) : (code for NO)That\'s just the usual ternary operator.  If the part before the question mark is true, it evaluates and returns the part before the colon, otherwise it evaluates and returns the part after the colon.is likeThis is part of C, so it\'s not Objective-C specific.  Here\'s a translation into an if statement:It\'s just a short form of writing an if-then-else statement. It means the same as the following code:                   It is ternary operator, like an if/else statement.In ternary operator it is like that: \ncondition ? what to do if condition is true : what to do if it is false;I just learned something new about the ternary operator. The short form that omits the middle operand is truly elegant, and is one of the many reasons that C remains relevant. FYI, I first really got my head around this in the context of a routine implemented in C#, which also supports the ternary operator. Since the ternary operator is in C, it stands to reason that it would be in other languages that are essentially extensions thereof (e. g., Objective-C, C#).As everyone referred that, It is a way of representing conditional operatorusing ternary operator (condition)? true:false\nTo add additional information, In swift we have new way of representing it using ??.Which is similar to is equivalent to if (a>c)?a:c ==> Is equal to if (a>c)?:cinstead of ?: we can use ?? is swift.meansTernary operator example.If the value of isFemale\n  boolean variable is YES, print "GENDER IS FEMALE" otherwise "GENDER IS\n  MALE"Objective-CFor Swift
