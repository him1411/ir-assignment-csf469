Why are hexadecimal numbers prefixed as 0x?\n I understand the usage of the prefix but I don\'t understand the significance of why 0x was chosen.Short story: The 0 tells the parser it\'s dealing with a constant (and not an identifier/reserved word). Something is still needed to specify the number base: the x is an arbitrary choice.Long story: In the 60\'s, the prevalent programming number systems were decimal and octal \xe2\x80\x94 mainframes had 12, 24 or 36 bits per byte, which is nicely divisible by 3 = log2(8).The BCPL language used the syntax 8 1234 for octal numbers. When Ken Thompson created B from BCPL, he used the 0 prefix instead. This is great becauseWhen C was created from B, the need for hexadecimal numbers arose (the PDP-11 had 16-bit words) and all of the points above were still valid. Since octals were still needed for other machines, 0x was arbitrarily chosen (00 was probably ruled out as awkward).C# is a descendant of C, so it inherits the syntax.Note:  I don\'t know the correct answer, but the below is just my personal speculation!As has been mentioned a 0 before a number means it\'s octal:Imagine needing to come up with a system to denote hexadecimal numbers, and note we\'re working in a C style environment.  How about ending with h like assembly?  Unfortunately you can\'t - it would allow you to make tokens which are valid identifiers (eg. you could name a variable the same thing) which would make for some nasty ambiguities.You can\'t lead with a character for the same reason:Using a hash was probably thrown out because it conflicts with the preprocessor:In the end, for whatever reason, they decided to put an x after a leading 0 to denote hexadecimal.  It is unambiguous since it still starts with a number character so can\'t be a valid identifier, and is probably based off the octal convention of a leading 0.SIMPLE It\'s a prefix to indicate the number is in hexadecimal rather than in some other base. The C programming language uses it to tell compiler. Example :0x6400 translates to  6*16^3 + 4*16^2 + 0*16^1 +0*16^0 = 25600.\nWhen compiler reads 0x6400, It understands the number is hexadecimal with the help of 0x  term.  Usually we can understand by (6400)16 or (6400)8 or whatever .. For Binary it will be0b00000001Hope Helped in some way.Good day,The preceding 0 is used to indicate a number in base 2, 8, or 16.In my opinion, 0x was chosen to indicate hex because \'x\' sounds like hex.Just my opinion, but I think it makes sense.Good Day!
