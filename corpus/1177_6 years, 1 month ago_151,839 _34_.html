Once upon a time, there was a file in my project that I would now like to be able to get.The problem is: I have no idea of when have I deleted it and on which path was it at.How can I locate the commits of this file when it existed?If you do not know the exact path you may useIf you know the path the file was at, you can do this:This should show a list of commits in all branches which touched that file. Then, you can find the version of the file you want, and display it with...Or restore it into your working copy with:git checkout <SHA>^ -- <path-to-file>Note the caret symbol (^), which gets the checkout prior to the one identified, because at the moment of <SHA> commit the file is deleted, we need to look at the previous commit to get the deleted file\'s contentsGet a list of the deleted files and copy the full path of the deleted file Execute the next command to find commit id of that commit and copy the commit id Show diff of deleted file Remember, you can write output to a file using > like Could not edit the accepted response so adding it as an answer here,to restore the file in git, use the following (note the \'^\' sign just after the SHA)@Amber gave correct answer! Just one more addition, if you do not know the exact path of the file you can use wildcards! This worked for me.Try using one of the viewers, such as gitk so that you can browse around the history to find that half remembered file. (use gitk --all if needed for all branches)One of the things which is tedious here is to get the path of the deleted file so I just wrote down a simple command, where a dev or a git user can pass a deleted file name and get the history:If anybody, can improve the command, please do. Suppose you want to recover a file called MyFile, but are uncertain of its path (or its extension, for that matter):Prelim.: Avoid confusion by stepping to the git rootA nontrivial project may have multiple directories with similar or identical names.Find the full pathgit log --diff-filter=D --summary | grep delete | grep MyFiledelete mode 100644 full/path/to/MyFile.jsfull/path/to/MyFile.js is the path & file you\'re seeking.Determine all the commits that affected that filegit log --oneline --follow -- full/path/to/MyFile.jsbd8374c Some helpful commit messageba8d20e Another prior commit message affecting that filecfea812 The first message for a commit in which that file appeared.Checkout the fileIf you choose the first-listed commit (the last chronologically, here bd8374c), the file will not be found, since it was deleted in that commit.Just select the preceding (append a caret) commit:
