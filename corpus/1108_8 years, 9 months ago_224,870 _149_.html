This question relates to iOS pre-3.2. As of 3.2 this functionality is easily achievable using samvermette\'s answer below, and I have changed the Accepted Answer (from commanda to samvermette) to reflect this. I can\'t give credit to both answers (besides upvotes) but they are both good.I would like to have an app include a custom font for rendering text, load it, and then use it with standard UIKit elements like UILabel. Is this possible?I found these links:but these would require me to render each glyph myself, which is a bit too much like hard work, especially for multi-line text.I\'ve also found posts that say straight out that it\'s not possible, but without justification, so I\'m looking for a definitive answer.EDIT - failed -[UIFont fontWithName:size:] experimentI downloaded Harrowprint.tff (downloaded from here) and added it to my Resources directory and to the project. I then tried this code:which resulted in an exception being thrown. Looking at the TTF file in Finder confirmed that the font name was Harrowprint. EDIT - there have been a number of replies so far which tell me to read the documentation on X or Y. I\'ve experimented extensively with all of these, and got nowhere. In one case, X turned out to be relevant only on OS X, not on iPhone. Consequently I am setting a bounty for this question, and I will award the bounty to the first person who provides an answer (using only documented APIs) who responds with sufficient information to get this working on the device. Working on the simulator too would be a bonus. EDIT - It appears that the bounty auto-awards to the answer with the highest number of votes. Interesting. No one actually provided an answer that solved the question as asked - the solution that involves coding your own UILabel subclass doesn\'t support word-wrap, which is an essential feature for me - though I guess I could extend it to do so. iOS 3.2 and later support this. Straight from the What\'s New in iPhone OS 3.2 doc:Custom Font Support\n  Applications that want to use custom fonts can now include those fonts in their application bundle and register those fonts with the system by including the UIAppFonts key in their Info.plist file. The value of this key is an array of strings identifying the font files in the application\xe2\x80\x99s bundle. When the system sees the key, it loads the specified fonts and makes them available to the application.Once the fonts have been set in the Info.plist, you can use your custom fonts as any other font in IB or programatically.There is an ongoing thread on Apple Developer Forums: \nhttps://devforums.apple.com/thread/37824 (login required)And here\'s an excellent and simple 3 steps tutorial on how to achieve this (broken link removed)Also: Make sure the fonts are in your Copy Bundle Resources.Edit: As of iOS 3.2, this functionality is built in. If you need to support pre-3.2, you can still use this solution.I created a simple module that extends UILabel and handles loading .ttf files.  I released it opensource under the Apache license and put it on github here: git://github.com/zynga/FontLabel.gitThe important files are FontLabel.h and FontLabel.m.It uses some of the code from Genericrich\'s answer.Browse the source here: http://github.com/zynga/FontLabel/tree/masterORCopy your font file into resourcesAdd a key to your Info.plist file called UIAppFonts. ("Fonts provided by application)Make this key an array For each font you have, enter the full name of your font file (including the extension) as items to the UIAppFonts array Save Info.plistNow in your application you can simply call [UIFont fontWithName:@"CustomFontName" size:15] to get the custom font to use with your UILabels and UITextViews, etc\xe2\x80\xa6For More InformationThere is a simple way to use custom fonts in iOS 4.Unfortunately, IB doesn\'t allow to initialize labels with custom fonts. See this question to solve this problem. My favorite solution is to use custom UILabel subclass:In Info.plist add the entry "Fonts provided by application" and include the font names as strings:Then check to make sure your font is included by running :Note that your ttf file name might not be the same name that you use when you set the font for your label (you can use the code above to get the "fontWithName" parameter):edit: This answer is defunct as of iOS3.2; use UIAppFontsThe only way I\'ve been able to successfully load custom UIFonts is via the private GraphicsServices framework.The following will load all the .ttf fonts in the application\'s main bundle:Once fonts are loaded, they can be used just like the Apple-provided fonts:GraphicsServices can even be loaded at runtime in case the API disappears in the future:With iOS 8+ and Xcode 6+ you can make this easily. Here are the steps:1) Drag and drop your font to Xcode Supporting Files folder. Don\'t forget to mark your app at "Add to targets" section. From this moment you can use this font in IB and choose it from font pallet.2) To make this font available to in your device, open your info.plist and add Fonts provided by application key. It will contain Item 0 key, you must add your font name as the value. Font name can vary from your font file name. But first, try to add your filename  in most cases this work. If not, this article always helped me.Here is swift snippet of the code from this article to help you find your font name.I want to mention, that you need to add font files to your Target\'s Build Phases, Copy Bundle Resources. Without it, you won\'t see your font on the device. And it could lead to unexpected behaviour. For example, I encounter a bug, when UITextField have custom font, but this font wasn\'t in the Copy Bundle Resources. And when I segue to the view controller with this text field, there is a delay about 4 seconds before viewDidLoad function was called. Resolving font troubles removed this delay. So, recommend to check it twice. (rdar://20028250) Btw, I wasn\'t able to reproduce the bug, but I\'m sure that problem was with the font.I have done this like this:Load the font:Now, in your drawRect:, do something like this:Basically you have to do some brute force looping through the text and futzing about with the magic number to find your offset (here, see me using 29) in the font, but it works.Also, you have to make sure the font is legally embeddable. Most aren\'t and there are lawyers who specialize in this sort of thing, so be warned.If you are using xcode 4.3, you have to add the font to the Build Phase under Copy Bundle Resources, according to https://stackoverflow.com/users/1292829/arne in the thread, Custom Fonts Xcode 4.3. This worked for me, here are the steps I took for custom fonts to work in my app:Yes, you can include custom fonts. Refer to the documentation on UIFont, specifically, the fontWithName:size: method.1) Make sure you include the font in your resources folder.2) The "name" of the font is not necessarily the filename.3) Make sure you have the legal right to use that font. By including it in your app, you\'re also distributing it, and you need to have the right to do that.Here\'s the step by step instructions how to do it. No need extra library or any special coding. http://shang-liang.com/blog/custom-fonts-in-ios4/Most of the time the issue is with the font not the method. The best way to do it is to use a font that for sure will work, like verdana or geogia. Then change to the intended font. If it does not work, maybe the font name is not right, or the font is not a well formated font.It is very easy to add a new font on your existing iOS App.You just need to add the font e.g. font.ttf into your Resource Folder.Open your application info.plist. Add a new row as "Fonts provided by application" and type the font name as font.ttf.And when setting the font do as setFont:"corresponding Font Name"You can check whether your font is added or not by NSArray *check = [UIFont familyNames];.It returns all the font your application support.Find the TTF in finder and "Get Info". Under the heading "Full name:" it gave me a name which I then used with fontWithName (I just copied and pasted the exact name, in this case no \'.ttf\' extension was necessary).I would recommend following one of my favorite short tutorials here: http://codewithchris.com/common-mistakes-with-adding-custom-fonts-to-your-ios-app/ from which this information comes.Step 1 - Drag your .ttf or .otf from Finder into your ProjectNOTE - Make sure to click the box to \'Add to targets\' on your main application targetIf you forgot to click to add it to your target then click on the font file in your project hierarchy and on the right side panel click the main app target in the Target Membership sectionTo make sure your fonts are part of your app target make sure they show up in your Copy Bundle Resources in Build PhasesStep 2 - Add the font file names to your PlistGo to the Custom iOS Target Properties in your Info Section and add a key to the items in that section called Fonts provided by application (you should see it come up as an option as you type it and it will set itself up as an array. Click the little arrow to open up the array items and type in the names of the .ttf or .otf files that you added to let your app know that these are the font files you want availableNOTE - If your app crashes right after this step then check your spelling on the items you add hereStep 3 - Find out the names of your fonts so you can call themQuite often the font name seen by your application is different from what you think it is based on the filename for that font, put this in your code and look over the log your application makes to see what font name to call in your codeSwiftObjective CYour log should look something like this:Step 4 - Use your new custom font using the name from Step 3SwiftObjective COne important notice: You should use the "PostScript name" associated with the font, not its Full name or Family name. This name can often be different from the normal name of the font.It\'s not out yet, but the next version of cocos2d (2d game framework) will support variable length bitmap fonts as character maps. http://code.google.com/p/cocos2d-iphone/issues/detail?id=317The author doesn\'t have a nailed down release date for this version, but I did see a posting that indicated it would be in the next month or two.Maybe the author forgot to give the font a Mac FOND name?You could also give the "Apple" option in the export dialog a try.DISCLAIMER: I\'m not a IPhone developer!I\'ve combined some of the advice on this page into something that works for me on iOS 5.First, you have to add the custom font to your project. Then, you need to follow the advice of @iPhoneDev and add the font to your info.plist file.After you do that, this works:However, you need to know the Postscript name of your font. Just follow @Daniel Wood\'s advice and press command-i while you\'re in FontBook.Then, enjoy your custom font.First add the font in .odt format to your resources, in this case we will use DINEngschriftStd.otf, then use this code to assign the font to the labelTo make sure your font is loaded on the project just callOn the .plist you must declare the font. Just add a \'Fonts provided by application\' record and add a item 0 string with the name of the font (DINEngschriftStd.otf)follow this step1)Copy your font in your project2)open your .plist file in source code mode...(Note- Dont open info.plist)3)Before that - Right click on your font and open it in fontforge or similar editor and        install it in your system  ,It should be intall4)Type this5)Type this code in your class .mHere lblPoints will be change as of your UILableDone!!\nIf still your font not work,check your fonts compatibility first For iOS 3.2 and above:\nUse the methods provided by several above, which are:BUT\nThe "Real Font Name" is not always the one you see in Fontbook. The best way is to ask your device which fonts it sees and what the exact names are.I use the uifont-name-grabber posted at:\nuifont-name-grabberJust drop the fonts you want into the xcode project, add the file name to its plist, and run it on the device you are building for, it will email you a complete font list using the names that UIFont fontWithName: expects.Look up ATSApplicationFontsPathA simple plist entry that allows you to include the font file(s) in your app resources folder and they "just work" in your app.I have been trying out the various suggestions on this page on iOS 3.1.2 and these are my conclusions:Simply using [UIFont fontWithName:size:] with the fonts in the Resources directory will not work, even if the FOND name is set using FontForge.[UIFont fontWithName:size:] will work if the fonts are loaded first using GSFontAddFromFile. But GSFontAddFromFile is not part of iOS 3.1.2 so it has to be dynamically loaded as described by @rpetrich.Better solution is to add a new property "Fonts provided by application" to your info.plist file. Then, you can use your custom font like normal UIFont.There is a new way to use custom fonts, starting with iOS 4.1. It allows you to load fonts dynamically, be they from files included with the app, downloaded data, or what have you. It also lets you load fonts as you need them, whereas the old method loads them all at app startup time, which can take too long if you have many fonts.The new method is described at ios-dynamic-font-loadingYou use the CTFontManagerRegisterGraphicsFont function, giving it a buffer with your font data. It\'s then available to UIFont and web views, just as with the old method. Here\'s the sample code from that link:I made everything possible but the new fonts dont appear so I found the solution:When you drag the fot files(otf or ttf) DONT forget to check the checkbox under "Add to targets".After doing that your font will appear and everything will work fine.Although some of the answers above are correct, I have written a detailed visual tutorial for people still having problems with fonts.The solutions above which tell you to add the font to the plist and useare the correct ones. Please do now use any other hackish way. If you are still facing problems with finding font names and adding them, here is the tutorial - Using custom fonts in ios applicationYou can add the required "FONT" files within the resources folder. Then go to the Project Info.plist file and use the KEY "Fonts provided by the application" and value as "FONT NAME".Then you can call the method [UIFont fontwithName:@"FONT NAME" size:12];yes you can use custom font in your applicationstep by step following there:after applying this if your not getting correct font \n then you double click on the  custom font , and see carefully top side font name is comming\nand copy this font , paste, here [UIFont fontWithName:@" here  past your Custom font Name" size:20]\n i hope you will get correct answeryes you can use custom font in your applicationstep by step following there:Add your custom font files into your project in supporting filesAdd a key to your Info.plist file called UIAppFonts.Make this key an arrayFor each font you have, enter the full name of your font file (including the extension) as items to the UIAppFonts arraySave Info.plist Now in your application you can simply call [UIFont fontWithName:@"your Custom font Name" size:20] to get the custom font to use with your UILabels\nafter applying this if your not getting correct font then you double click on the custom font , and see carefully top side font name is comming and copy this font , paste, here [UIFont fontWithName:@" here past your Custom font Name" size:20] i hope you will get correct answerAdd the required fonts to your project (just like adding images, just drag to Xcode), make sure that they are targeted to your project\nadd this method and load custom fonts (recommended in appDelegate didFinishLaunchingWithOptions)Use example:Use the font:
