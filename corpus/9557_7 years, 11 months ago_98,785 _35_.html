I have a server that I\'m taking down.  The only thing I have left to migrate is my repository.  This server is listed as the origin (master) for one of my projects.  What is the proper way to move the repository to keep the history.To add the new repo location, Then push the content to the new locationFinally remove the old oneAfter that you can do what bdonlan said and edit the.git/config file to change the new_repo_name to origin. If you don\'t remove the origin (original remote repository), you can simply just push changes to the new repo with If you want to migrate all branches and tags you should use the following commands:to clone the old repo with all branchesto setup a new remoteto push all refs under refs/heads (which is probably what you want)Copy it over. It\'s really that simple. :)On the client side, just edit .git/config in the client\'s local repo to point your remotes to the new URL as necessary.This worked for me flawlessly. I have to mention though that this creates a mirror of your current repo and then pushes that to the new location. Therefore, this can take some time for large repos or slow connections.I\'m just reposting what others have said, in a simple to follow list of instructions.Move the repository: Simply login to the new server, cd to the parent directory where you now want to hold the repository, and use rsync to copy from the old server:Make clients point to the new repository: Now on each client using the repository, just remove the pointer to the old origin, and add one to the new one.This is sort of done in parts in some of the other answers.Take a look at this recipe on GitHub: \nhttps://help.github.com/articles/importing-an-external-git-repositoryI tried a number of methods before discovering git push --mirror.Worked like a charm!I followed the instructions on BitBucket to move a repo with all its branches there. Here come the steps with explanations following the # character:Worked nicely for me.You can use the following command : Example from http://gitref.org/remotes/Should be as simple as:This way you keep the name origin for your new repo - then push to the new repo the old one as detailed in the other answers. Supposing you work alone and you have a local repo you want to mirror with all your cruft in it, you might as well (from inside your local repo)but see Is "git push --mirror" sufficient for backing up my repository? (in all don\'t use --mirror but once).All the information (orgin, trunk, etc.) about the repository are stored in a folder named \'.git\', where you are initializing the repository. So, you need to copy the contents to the new server, using the instructions provided HerePlease follow the steps:follow these instructions If you want to keep all the commits and branches from old to new repoIf you want to migrate a  #git repository from one server to a new one you can do it like this:All remote branches and tags from the old repository will be copied to the new repository.Running this command alone:would only copy a master branch (only tracking branches) to the new repository.You can use git-copy to duplicate the repo with all histories.
