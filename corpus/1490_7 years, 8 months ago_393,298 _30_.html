How do I perform case insensitive string comparison in JavaScript?The simplest way to do it (if you\'re not worried about special Unicode characters) is to call toUpperCase:The best way to do a case insensitive comparison in JavaScript is to use RegExp match() method with the \'i\' flag.  JavaScript: case-insensitive searchWhen both strings being compared are variables (not constants), then it\'s a little more complicated \'cause you need to generate a RegExp from the string but passing the string to RegExp constructor can result in incorrect matches or failed matches if the string has special regex characters in it.If you care about internationalization don\'t use toLowerCase() or toUpperCase() as it doesn\'t provide accurate case-insensitive comparisons in all languages.http://www.i18nguy.com/unicode/turkish-i18n.htmlRemember that casing is a locale specific operation. Depending on scenario you may want to take that in to account. For example, if you are comparing names of two people you may want to consider locale but if you are comparing machine generated values such as UUID then you might not. This why I use following function in my utils library (note that type checking is not included for performance reason).With the help of regular expression also we can achieve./i is for ignore case. If not necessary we can ignore and test for NOT case sensitive match likeif you are concerned about the direction of the inequality (perhaps you want to sort a list)\nyou pretty-much have to do case-conversion, and as there are more lowercase characters in unicode than uppercase toLowerCase is probably the best conversion to use.Javascript seems to use locale "C" for string comparisons so the resulting ordering will\nbe ugly if the strings contain other than ASCII letters. there\'s not much that can be done about that without doing much more detailed inspection of the strings.There are two ways for case insensitive comparison:Use the "search" string method for case insensitive search.\nRead about search and other string methods at:\nhttp://www.thesstech.com/pattern-matching-using-string-methods I have recently created a micro library that provides case-insensitive string helpers: https://github.com/nickuraltsev/ignore-case. (It uses toUpperCase internally.)Suppose we want to find the string variable needle in the string variable haystack. There are three gotchas:Taking points (1) and (2) into consideration, an example would be: Even this question have already answered. I have a different approach to use RegExp and match to ignore case sensitive. Please see my link \nhttps://jsfiddle.net/marchdave/7v8bd7dq/27/Lots of answers here, but I like to add a sollution based on extending the String lib:This way you can just use it like you do in Java!Example:Output will be:Since no answer clearly provided a simple code snippet for using RegExp, here\'s my attempt:It has several advantages:How about NOT throwing exceptions and NOT using slow regex?The above snippet assumes you don\'t want to match if either string is null or undefined.If you want to match null/undefined, then:If for some reason you care about undefined vs null:I wrote a extension. very trivial
