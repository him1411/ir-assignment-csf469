Currently I have an Angular.js page that allows searching and displays results. User clicks on a search result, then clicks back button. I want the search results to be displayed again but I can\'t work out how to trigger the search to execute.  Here\'s the detail:How do I get the search function to execute again without the user having to press the "search button"? If it was jquery then I would execute a function in the documentready function. I can\'t see the Angular.js equivalent.On the one hand as @Mark-Rajcok said you can just get away with private inner function:Also you can take a look at ng-init directive. Implementation will be much like:But take care about it as angular documentation implies (since v1.2) to NOT use ng-init for that. However imo it depends on architecture of your app.I used ng-init when I wanted to pass a value from back-end into angular app:Try this?I could never get $viewContentLoaded to work for me, and ng-init should really only be used in an ng-repeat (according to the documentation), and also calling a function directly in a controller can cause errors if the code relies on an element that hasn\'t been defined yet. This is what I do and it works for me:Unless you\'re using ui-router. Then it\'s:Dimitri\'s/Mark\'s solution didn\'t work for me but using the $timeout function seems to work well to ensure your code only runs after the markup is rendered.Hope it helps.You can do this if you want to watch the viewContentLoaded DOM object to change and then do something. using $scope.$on works too but differently especially when you have one page mode on your routing.  You can use angular\'s $window object: Another alternative:(via https://stackoverflow.com/a/30258904/148412)When using $routeProvider you can resolve on .state and bootstrap your service. This is to say, you are going to load Controller and View, only after resolve your Service:ui-routesServiceFound Dmitry Evseev answer quite useful.Case 1 : Using angularJs alone:\nTo execute a method on page load, you can use ng-init in the view and declare init method in controller, having said that use of heavier function is not recommended, as per the angular Docs on ng-init:This directive can be abused to add unnecessary amounts of logic into your templates. There are only a few appropriate uses of ngInit, such as for aliasing special properties of ngRepeat, as seen in the demo below; and for injecting data via server side scripting. Besides these few cases, you should use controllers rather than ngInit to initialize values on a scope.HTML:Controller:Warning : Do not use this controller for another view meant for a different intention as it will cause the search method be executed there too.Case 2 : Using Ionic:\nThe above code will work, just make sure the view cache is disabled in the route.js as:route.jsHope this helpsI had the same problem and only this solution worked for me (it runs a function after a complete DOM has been loaded). I use this for scroll to anchor after page has been loaded:Yet another alternative if you have a controller just specific to that page:You can save the search results in a common service which can use from anywhere and doesn\'t clear when navigate to another page , And then you can set the search results with the saved data for the click of back button
