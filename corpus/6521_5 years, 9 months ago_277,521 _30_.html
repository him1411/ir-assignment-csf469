I have a very weird requirement, wherein I am required to have no option selected by default in drop down menu in HTML. However,I cannot use this,Because, for this I will have to do validation to handle the first option. Can anyone help me in achieving this target without actually including the first option as part of the select tag? Maybe this will be helpful-- select an option -- Will be displayed by default. But if you choose an option,you will not be able select it back.You can also hide it using by adding an empty option<option style="display:none">so it won\'t show up in the list anymore.You could use Javascript to achieve this. Try the following code:HTMLJSor JQueryThis is valid HTML5 and sends a blank (not a space) to the server:Verified validity on http://validator.w3.org/checkVerified behavior with Win7(IE11 IE10 IE9 IE8 FF35 Safari5.1) Ubuntu14.10(Chrome40, FF35) OSX_Yosemite(Safari8, Chrome40) Android(Samsung-Galaxy-S5)The following also passes validation today, but passes some sort of space character too the server from most browsers (probably not desirable) and a blank on others (Chrome40/Linux passes a blank):According to my notes, the non-breaking-space entity inside the option tags shown above produced the following error in 2013:Error: W3C Markup Validaton Service (Public): The first child option\n  element of a select element with a required attribute and without a\n  multiple attribute, and whose size is 1, must have either an empty\n  value attribute, or must have no text content.At that time, a regular space was valid XHTML4 and sent a blank (not a space) to the server from every browser:It would make my heart glad if the spec was updated to explicitly allow a blank option.  Preferably using the briefest syntax.  Either of the following would be great:BR: S\xc3\xb3 colocar "hidden" na op\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o que deseja esconder na lista. ;)EN: Just put "hidden" on option you want to hide on dropdown list. ;)Use jQuery:Tried and tested for jQuery v1.7.2 (latest version as of Apr. 18th, 2012), however \'prop\' does not work for this version.There is no HTML solution. By the HTML 4.01 spec, browser behavior is undefined if none of the option elements has the selected attribute, and what browsers do in practice is that they make the first option pre-selected.As a workaround, you could replace the select element by a set of input type=radio elements (with the same name attribute). This creates a control of the same kind though with different appearance and user interface. If none of the input type=radio elements has the checked attribute, none of them is initially selected in most modern browsers.You can avoid custom validation in this case.Try this:Validates in HTML5. Works with required attribute in select element. Can be re-selected. Works in Google Chrome 45, Internet Explorer 11, Edge, Firefox 41.
