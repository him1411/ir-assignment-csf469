I want to display a dialog/popup window with a message to the user that shows "Are you sure you want to delete this entry?" with one button that says \'Delete\'. When Delete is touched, it should delete that entry, otherwise nothing.I have written a click listener for those buttons, but how do I invoke a dialog or popup and its functionality?You could use the alert builder for this:Try this code:The code which David Hedlund has posted gave me the error:Unable to add window \xe2\x80\x94 token null is not validIf you are getting the same error use the below code. It works!!Just a simple one! Create a dialog method, something like this anywhere in your Java class:Now create Layout XML dialog_demo.xml and create your UI/design. Here is a sample one I created for demo purposes:Now you can call openDialog() from anywhere you like :) Here is the screenshot of above code.Note that text and color are used from strings.xml and colors.xml. You can define your own.Nowadays it\'s better to use DialogFragment instead of direct AlertDialog creation.You can use this code:I have created a dialog for asking a Person whether he wants to call a Person or not.This is a basic sample of how to create an Alert Dialog :This is definitely help for you. Try this code: On click of a button, you can put one, two or three buttons with an alert dialog...for meyou can try this....For more info,check this link...Just be careful when you want to dismiss the dialog - use dialog.dismiss(). In my first attempt I used dismissDialog(0) (which I probably copied from some place) which sometimes works. Using the object the system supplies sounds like a safer choice.you may try this way also, it will provide you material style dialogsAlso check out my blog on Dialogs in Android, you will find all the details here: http://www.fahmapps.com/2016/09/26/dialogs-in-android-part1/.
