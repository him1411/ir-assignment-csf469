Update: Now that it\'s 2016 I\'d use PowerShell for this unless there\'s a really compelling backwards-compatible reason for it, particularly because of the regional settings issue with using date. See @npocmaka\'s https://stackoverflow.com/a/19799236/8479What\'s a Windows command line statement(s) I can use to get the current datetime in a format that I can put into a filename?I want to have a .bat file that zips up a directory into an archive with the current date and time as part of the name, for example, Code_2008-10-14_2257.zip. Is there any easy way I can do this, independent of the regional settings of the machine?I don\'t really mind about the date format, ideally it\'d be yyyy-mm-dd, but anything simple is fine.So far I\'ve got this, which on my machine gives me Tue_10_14_2008_230050_91:I can live with this, but it seems a bit clunky. Ideally it\'d be briefer and have the format mentioned earlier.I\'m using Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP Professional. I don\'t want to install additional utilities to achieve this (although I realise there are some that will do nice date formatting).See Windows Batch File (.bat) to get current date in MMDDYYYY format:If you prefer the time in 24 hour/military format, you can replace the second FOR line with this:C:> .\\date.bat \n  2008-10-14_0642If you want the date independently of the region day/month order, you can use "WMIC os GET LocalDateTime" as a source, since it\'s in ISO order:C:>test.cmd\n  Local date is [2012-06-19 10:23:47.048]The output format of %DATE% and of the dir command is regionally dependent and thus neither robust nor smart. date.exe (part of UnxUtils) delivers any date and time information in any thinkable format. You may also extract the date/time information from any file with date.exe.date.exe +"%Y-%m-%d"\n2009-12-22  date.exe +"%T"\n18:55:03  date.exe +"%Y%m%d %H%M%S: Any text"\n20091222 185503: Any textdate.exe +"Text: %y/%m/%d-any text-%H.%M"\nText: 09/12/22-any text-18.55Command: date.exe +"%m-%d """%H %M %S """"\n07-22 "18:55:03"`The date/time information from a reference file:\ndate.exe -r c:\\file.txt +"The timestamp of file.txt is: %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"Using it in a CMD script to get year, month, day, time information:Using it in a CMD script to get a timestamp in any required format:Extracting the date/time information from any reference file.Adding to a file its date/time information:date.exe is part of the free GNU tools which need no installation.NOTE: Copying date.exe into any directory which is in the search path may cause other scripts to fail that use the Windows built-in date command.Two more ways that do not depend on the time settings (both taken from :How get data/time independent from localization:). And both also get the day of the week and none of them requires admin permissions!:MAKECAB - will work on EVERY Windows system (fast, but creates a small temp file) (the foxidrive script):More information about get-date function.ROBOCOPY - it\'s not native command for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, but it can be downloaded from microsoft site. But is built-in in everything from Windows Vista and above:And three more ways that uses other Windows script languages. They will give you more flexibility e.g. you can get week of the year, time in milliseconds and so on.JScript/batch hybrid (need to be saved as .bat). JScript is available on every system form NT and above, as a part of Windows Script Host (though can be disabled through the registry it\'s a rare case):VSCRIPT/BATCH hybrid (Is it possible to embed and execute VBScript within a batch file without using a temporary file?) same case as JScript, but hybridization is not so perfect:PowerShell - can be installed on every machine that has .NET - download from Microsoft (v1, v2, v3 (only for Windows 7 and above)). It is installed by default on everything from Windows 7/Windows Server 2008 and above:To use it from a batch file:Self-compiled jscript.net/batch (never seen a Windows machine without .NET, so I think this is a pretty portable):Logman This cannot get the year and day of the week. It\'s comparatively slow and also creates a temporary file and is based on the time stamps that logman puts on its log files. It will work on everything from Windows XP and above. It probably will be never used by anybody - including me - but is one more way...One more way with WMIC which also gives week of the year and the day of the week, but not the milliseconds (for milliseconds check foxidrive\'s answer):Using TYPEPERF with some efforts to be fast and compatible with different language settings and as fast as possible:MSHTA allows calling JavaScript methods similar to the JScript method demonstrated in #3 above. Bear in mind that JavaScript\'s Date object properties involving month values are numbered from 0 to 11, not 1 to 12. So a value of 9 means October.Here\'s a variant from alt.msdos.batch.nt that works local-independently.Put this in a text file, e.g. getDate.cmdTo get the code to work sans error msg\'s to stderr, I had to add the single quotes arount the variable assignments for %%a, %%b and %%c.  My locale (PT) was causing errors at one stage in the looping/parsing where stuff like "set =20" was getting executed. The quotes yield a token (albeit empty) for the left-hand side of the assignment statement.The downside is the messy locale variable names: \'yy\', \'mm\' and \'dd\'. But hey, who cares!I use this (again not region independent (UK))Unfortunately this is not immune to regional settings, but it does what you want.Amazing the stuff you can find on Wikipedia.Please use the following script to get the current day in the command line:This isn\'t really briefer but might be a more flexible way (credit):Another way (credit):Note that both my answers here are still reliant on the order of the day and month as determined by regional settings - not sure how to work around that.The first four lines of this code will give you reliable YY DD MM YYYY HH Min Sec variables in Windows XP Professional and higher.Here\'s a way to get date time in a single line:In the US this will output "yyyy-mm-dd hhmm". Different regional settings will result in different %date% outputs, but you can modify the token order.If you want a different format, modify the echo statement by rearranging the tokens or using different (or no) separators.And here is a similar batch-file for the time portion.  --jeroenI changed the answer with the batch file from vMax so it works with the Dutch language too.\nThe Dutch - persistent as we are - have a few changes in the %date%, date/t, and date that break the original batch-file.It would be nice if some people can check this against other Windows locales as well, and report back the results.\nIf the batch-file fails at your location, then please include the output of these two statements on the command prompt:\necho:^|date\ndate/t This is a sample of the output you should get from the batch-file:Here is the revised code with comments on why:--jeroenMatthew Johnson\'s one-liner solution to get the one-liner date and time is eloquent and useful.It does however need a simple modification to work from within a batch file:Just use this line:This is what I\'ve used:If you want further ideas for automating backups to 7-Zip archives, I have a free/open project you can use or review for ideas: http://wittman.org/ziparcy/A function that is based on wmic:Upside: Region independent. Downside: Only system administrators can run wmic.exe.Usage:This echos a string like this:Note that function parameters are out-Parameters - that is, you must supply variable names instead of values.All parameters are optional, so call:Now Y M is a valid call if you only want to get year and month.I had a similar problem. I have an automatic daily download from an FTP server of an encrypted file. I wanted to decrypt the file using gpg, rename the file to the current date (YYYYMMDD format) and drop the decrypted file into a folder for the correct department.I went through several suggestions for renaming the file according to date and was having no luck until I stumbled upon this simple solution.It worked perfectly (i.e., the filename comes out as "2011-06-14.txt").(Source)http://sourceforge.net/projects/unxutils/files/Look inside the ZIP file for something called "Date.exe" and rename it "DateFormat.exe" (to avoid conflicts).Put it in your Windows system32 folder.It has a lot of "date output" options.For help, use DateFormat.exe --hI\'m not sure how you would put its output into an environment variable... using SET.Regional independent solution generating the ISO date format:What could still be optimized:\nOther processes might get confused if using the date format in the short period while it is modified. So parsing the output according to the existing format string could be \'safer\' - but will be more complicatedGiven a known locality, for reference in functional form. The ECHOTIMESTAMP call shows how to get the timestamp into a variable (DTS in this example.)And saved to file, timestamp.bat, here\'s the output:With Windows 7, this code works for me:I know that there are numerous ways mentioned already. But here is my way to break it down to understand how it is done. Hopefully, it is helpful for someone who like step by step method.
