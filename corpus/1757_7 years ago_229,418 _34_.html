Is there any way I can create a text file on the client side and prompt the user to download it, without any interaction with the server?\nI know I can\'t write directly to their machine (security and all), but can I create and prompt them to save it?You can use data URIs.  Browser support varies; see Wikipedia.  Example:The octet-stream is to force a download prompt.  Otherwise, it will probably open in the browser.For CSV, you can use:Try the jsFiddle demo.Simple solution for HTML5 ready browsers...UsageAll of the above example works just fine in chrome and IE, but fail in Firefox.\nPlease do consider appending an anchor to the body and removing it after click.All the above solutions didn\'t work in all browsers. Here is what finally works on IE 10+, Firefox and Chrome (and without jQuery or any other library):Note that, depending on your situation, you may also want to call URL.revokeObjectURL after removing elem. According to the docs for URL.createObjectURL:Each time you call createObjectURL(), a new object URL is created, even if you\'ve already created one for the same object. Each of these must be released by calling URL.revokeObjectURL() when you no longer need them. Browsers will release these automatically when the document is unloaded; however, for optimal performance and memory usage, if there are safe times when you can explicitly unload them, you should do so.I\'m happily using FileSaver.js. Its compatibility is pretty good (IE10+ and everything else), and it\'s very simple to use:The following method works in IE11+, Firefox 25+ and Chrome 30+:See this in Action: http://jsfiddle.net/Kg7eA/Firefox and Chrome support data URI for navigation, which allows us to create files by navigating to a data URI, while IE doesn\'t support it for security purposes. On the other hand, IE has API for saving a blob, which can be used to create and download files.This solution is extracted directly from tiddlywiki\'s (tiddlywiki.com) github repository. I have used tiddlywiki in almost all browsers and it works like a charm:Github repo:\nDownload saver moduleSolution that work on IE10:\n(I needed a csv file, but it\'s enough to change type and filename to txt)If you just want to convert a string to be available for download you can try this using jQuery.As of April 2014, FileSytem APIs may not be standardized in W3C. Anyone looking at the solution with blob should thread with caution, I guess.HTML5 rocks heads upW3C Mailing List on FileSytem APIBased on @Rick answer which was really helpful.You have to scape the string data if you want to share it this way:`\n Sorry I can not comment on @Rick\'s answer due to my current low reputation in StackOverflow.An edit suggestion was shared and rejected.You can even do one better than just URI\'s - using Chrome you are also able to suggest the name the file will take, as explained in this blog post about naming a download when using URIs.As mentioned about filesaver is a grate package to work with files in client side. But, it is not good to deal with large files. StreamSaver.js is an alternative solution (which is pointed in FileServer.js) to deal with large files:If the file contains text data, a technique I use is to put the text into a textarea element and have the user select it (click in textarea then ctrl-A) then copy followed by a paste to a text editor.It actually IS possible - use Flash.You can either generate the content with JS and then initialize some flash vars or just do everything within a flash movie.Please take a look at this for some important remarks.
