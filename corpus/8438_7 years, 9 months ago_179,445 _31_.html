Someone explain to me what InputStream and OutputStream are?I am confused about the use cases for both InputStream and OutputStream.If you could also include a snippet of code to go along with your explanation, that would be great. Thanks!The goal of InputStream and OutputStream is to abstract different ways to input and output: whether the stream is a file, a web page, or the screen shouldn\'t matter.  All that matters is that you receive information from the stream (or send information into that stream.)InputStream is used for many things that you read from.OutputStream is used for many things that you write to.Here\'s some sample code. It assumes the InputStream instr and OutputStream osstr have already been created:InputStream is used for reading, OutputStream for writing. They are connected as decorators to one another such that you can read/write all different types of data from all different types of sources.For example, you can write primitive data to a file:To read the written contents:You can use other types of streams to enhance the reading/writing. For example, you can introduce a buffer for efficiency:You can write other data such as objects:You can read from other different input sources:For most input streams there is an output stream, also. You can define your own streams to reading/writing special things and there are complex streams for reading complex things (for example there are Streams for reading/writing ZIP format).From the Java Tutorial:A stream is a sequence of data. A program uses an input stream to read data from a source, one item at a time:A program uses an output stream to write data to a destination, one item at time:The data source and data destination pictured above can be anything that holds, generates, or consumes data. Obviously this includes disk files, but a source or destination can also be another program, a peripheral device, a network socket, or an array.Sample code from oracle tutorial:This program uses byte streams to copy xanadu.txt file to outagain.txt , by writing one byte at a timeHave a look at this SE question to know more details about advanced Character streams, which are wrappers on top of Byte Streams :byte stream and character streamyou read from an InputStream and write to an OutputStream.for example, say you want to copy a file. You would create a FileInputStream to read from the source file and a FileOutputStream to write to the new file.If your data is a character stream, you could use a FileReader instead of an InputStream and a FileWriter instead of an OutputStream if you prefer.OutputStream is an abstract class that represents writing output.  There are many different OutputStream classes, and they write out to certain things (like the screen, or Files, or byte arrays, or network connections, or etc).  InputStream classes access the same things, but they read data in from them.Here is a good basic example of using FileOutputStream and FileInputStream to write data to a file, then read it back in.An output stream is generally related to some data destination like a file or a network etc.In java output stream is a destination where data is eventually written and it ends
