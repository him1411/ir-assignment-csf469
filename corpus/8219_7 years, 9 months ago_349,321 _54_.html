What\'s the difference between VARCHAR and CHAR in MySQL?I am trying to store MD5 hashes.VARCHAR is variable-length.CHAR is fixed length.If your content is a fixed size, you\'ll get better performance with CHAR.See the MySQL page on CHAR and VARCHAR Types for a detailed explaination (be sure to also read the comments).Used to store character string value of fixed length.The maximum no. of characters the data type can hold is 255 characters.It\'s 50% faster than VARCHAR.Uses static memory allocation.Used to store variable length alphanumeric data.The maximum this data type can hold is up toIn MySQL 5.0.3+: 65,535 characters shared for the row.It\'s slower than CHAR.Uses dynamic memory allocation*.CHAR Vs VARCHARCHAR is used for Fixed Length Size Variable\nVARCHAR is used for Variable Length Size Variable.E.g.Output will beConclusion: To use storage space efficiently must use VARCHAR Instead CHAR if variable length is variableA CHAR(x) column can only have exactly x characters.\nA VARCHAR(x) column can have up to x characters.Since your MD5 hashes will always be the same size, you should probably use a CHAR.However, you shouldn\'t be using MD5 in the first place; it has known weaknesses.\nUse SHA2 instead.\nIf you\'re hashing passwords, you should use bcrypt.What\'s the difference between VARCHAR and CHAR in MySQL?To already given answers I would like to add that in OLTP systems or in systems with frequent updates consider using CHAR even for variable size columns because of possible VARCHAR column fragmentation during updates.I am trying to store MD5 hashes.MD5 hash is not the best choice if security really matters. However, if you will use any hash function, consider BINARY type for it instead (e.g. MD5 will produce 16-byte hash, so BINARY(16) would be enough instead of CHAR(32) for 32 characters representing hex digits. This would save more space and be performance effective.In most RDBMSs today, they are synonyms.  However for those systems that still have a distinction, a CHAR field is stored as a fixed-width column.  If you define it as CHAR(10), then 10 characters are written to the table, where "padding" (typically spaces) is used to fill in any space that the data does not use up.  For example, saving "bob" would be saved as ("bob"+7 spaces).  A VARCHAR (variable character) column is meant to store data without wasting the extra space that a CHAR column does.As always, Wikipedia speaks louder.Varchar cuts off trailing spaces if the entered characters is shorter than the declared length, while char will not. Char will pad spaces and will always be the length of the declared length. In terms of efficiency, varchar is more adept as it trims characters to allow more adjustment. However, if you know the exact length of char, char will execute with a bit more speed. To see more details about this, check out:http://www.allthingsdiscussed.com/More/Difference-between-char-and-varchar-in-mysqlCHAR is a fixed length field; VARCHAR is a variable length field. If you are storing strings with a wildly variable length such as names, then use a VARCHAR, if the length is always the same, then use a CHAR because it is slightly more size-efficient, and also slightly faster.Following are the differences between CHAR and VARCHAR:CHAR is fixed length and VARCHAR is variable length. CHAR always uses the same amount of storage space per entry, while VARCHAR only uses the amount necessary to store the actual text.This answer from www.mssqlcity.com seems to sum it up nicely:The char is a fixed-length character data type, the varchar is a variable-length character data type.Because char is a fixed-length data type, the storage size of the char value is equal to the maximum size for this column. Because varchar is a variable-length data type, the storage size of the varchar value is the actual length of the data entered, not the maximum size for this column.You can use char when the data entries in a column are expected to be the same size.\nYou can use varchar when the data entries in a column are expected to vary considerably in size.Char has a fixed length (supports 2000 characters), it is stand for character is a data type Varchar has a variable length (supports 4000 characters)CHAR vs VARCHARCHAR data type:It is a fixed length data type\nIf the value provided to a variable of CHAR data type is shorter than the length of a column of declared the size of the variable, then the value would be right-padded with blanks to match the size of column length. DECLARE @string CHAR(20)\nSET @string = \'Vicky\'\nSELECT @string AS \'String\', DATALENGTH(@string) AS \'Datalength\' , LEN(@string) AS \'Len\'  As you can see above, the bytes occupied by the variable are 20 even though the length of the characters is 5. That means that irrespective of the character stored in the column, it will occupy all bytes to store the value.VARCHAR data type:It is a variable length data type\nDECLARE @string VARCHAR(20)\nSET @string = \'Vicky\'\nSELECT @string AS \'String\', DATALENGTH(@string) AS \'Datalength\' , LEN(@string) AS \'Len\'  As you can see above, it is showing DATALENGTH as 5 which means it will use only the number of bytes equal to the number of characters. This will allow me to avoid wasting database space.When to use what?\nIf you are sure about the fixed length of the data that would be captured for any specific column then go for CHAR data type and if the data may vary then go for VARCHAR. Char or varchar- it is used to enter texual data where the length can be indicated in brackets\nEg- name char (20)CHAR : VARCHAR :any comments......!!!!
