Is there any difference between p and puts in Ruby?p foo prints foo.inspect followed by a newline, i.e. it prints the value of inspect instead of to_s, which is more suitable for debugging (because you can e.g. tell the difference between 1, "1" and "2\\b1", which you can\'t when printing without inspect).It is also important to note that puts "reacts" to a class that has to_s defined, p does not. For example:This follows directly from the .inspect call, but is not obvious in practice.p foo is the same as puts foo.inspectFrom ruby-2.4.1 documentputs(obj, ...) \xe2\x86\x92 nilWrites the given object(s) to ios.
