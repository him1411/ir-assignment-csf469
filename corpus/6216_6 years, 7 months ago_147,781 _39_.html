Basically, as the title says. I\'m wondering how I could add 1 day to an NSDate.So if it were:It would become:Or if it were:It would become:This should be self-explanatory.Since iOS 8 you can use NSCalendar.dateByAddingUnitExample in Swift 1.x:Swift 2.0:Swift 3.0:Try this     iOS 8+, OSX 10.9+, Objective-CUse the below function and use days paramater to get the date daysAhead/daysBehind just pass parameter as positive for future date or negative for previous dates:In swiftA working Swift 3 implementation based on Andy\'s answer and as a Date extension with additional options to change year, month and time:Usage for only adding a day as asked by OP would then be:You can use NSDate\'s method - (id)dateByAddingTimeInterval:(NSTimeInterval)seconds where seconds would be 60 * 60 * 24 = 86400In Swift 2.1.1 and xcode 7.1 OSX 10.10.5 ,you can add any number of days forward and backwards using functionfunction call for incrementing current date by 9 daysfunction call for decrement current date by 80 daysIt\'s work!Here is a general purpose method which lets you add/subtract any type of unit(Year/Month/Day/Hour/Second etc) in the specified date.Using Swift 2.2Swift 3.0 very simple implemetation would be:Ok - I thought this was going to work for me. However, if you use it to add a day to the 31st March 2013, it\'ll return a date that has only 23 hours added to it. It may well actually have the 24, but using in calculations has only 23:00 hours added.Similarly, if you blast forward to 28th Oct 2013, the code adds 25 hours resulting in a date time of 2013-10-28 01:00:00.Very strange.In order to add a day I was doing the thing at the top, adding the:But this was a real mess for certain dates, principally due to daylight saving. Objective-C, dates are a nightmare.In swift you can make extension to add method in NSDateyou can use this asfor swift 2.2:Hope this helps someone!Use following code:Asis now deprecated.I had the same problem; use an extension for NSDate:Swift 2.0
