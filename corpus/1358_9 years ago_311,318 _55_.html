I\'m currently generating an 8-character pseudo-random uppercase string for "A" .. "Z":but it doesn\'t look clean, and it can\'t be passed as an argument since it isn\'t a single statement.  To get a mixed-case string "a" .. "z" plus "A" .. "Z", I changed it to:but it looks like trash.Does anyone have a better method?I spend too much time golfing.And a last one that\'s even more confusing, but more flexible and wastes fewer cycles:Why not use SecureRandom?SecureRandom also has methods for:see: http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.2/libdoc/securerandom/rdoc/SecureRandom.htmlI use this for generating random URL friendly strings.It generates random strings of lowercase a-z and 0-9. It\'s not very customizable but it\'s short and clean.This solution generates a string of easily readable characters for activation codes; I didn\'t want people confusing 8 with B, 1 with I, 0 with O, L with 1, etc.Others have mentioned something similar, but this uses the  URL safe function.The result may contain A-Z, a-z, 0-9, \xe2\x80\x9c-\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c_\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9c=\xe2\x80\x9d is also used if padding is true.Generate a random 8 letter string (e.g. NVAYXHGR)Generate a random 8 character string (e.g. 3PH4SWF2), excludes 0/1/I/O. Ruby 1.9I can\'t remember where I found this, but it seems like the best and the least process intensive to me:If you want a string of specified length, use:It will generate a random string of length 2n containing 0-9 and a-fArray.new(n){[*"0".."9"].sample}.join,\nwhere n=8 in your case.Generalized: Array.new(n){[*"A".."Z", *"0".."9"].sample}.join, etc. - from this answerHere is one line simple code for random string with length 8You can also use it for random password having length 8i hope it will help and amazing.Ruby 1.9+:Here is one simple code for random password with lenth 8Hope it will help.Be aware: rand is predictable for an attacker and therefore probably insecure. You should definitely use SecureRandom if this is for generating passwords. I use something like this:Another method I like to useAdd ljust if you are really paranoid about the correct string length:I think this is a nice balance of conciseness, clarity and ease of modification. For example, including digits:Uppercase hexadecimal:For a truly impressive array of characters:Something from DeviseJust adding my cents here...you can use String#random from the Facets of Ruby Gem facets:https://github.com/rubyworks/facets/blob/126a619fd766bc45588cac18d09c4f1927538e33/lib/core/facets/string/random.rbit basically does this:My favorite is (:A..:Z).to_a.shuffle[0,8].join.  Note that shuffle requires Ruby > 1.9.This solution needs external dependency, but seems prettier than another.I just write a small gem random_token to generate random tokens for most use case, enjoy ~https://github.com/sibevin/random_tokenGiven:Single expression, can be passed as an argument, allows duplicate characters:With this method you can pass in an abitrary length. It\'s set as a default as 6.I like Radar\'s answer best, so far, I think. I\'d tweak a bit like this:I was doing something like this recently to generate an 8 byte random string from 62 characters.  The characters were 0-9,a-z,A-Z.  I had an array of them as was looping 8 times and picking a random value out of the array.  This was inside a rails app.str = \'\'\n8.times {|i| str << ARRAY_OF_POSSIBLE_VALUES[rand(SIZE_OF_ARRAY_OF_POSSIBLE_VALUES)] }The weird thing is that I got good number of duplicates.  Now randomly this should pretty much never happen.  62^8 is huge, but out of 1200 or so codes in the db i had a good number of duplicates.  I noticed them happening on hour boundaries of each other. In other words I might see a duple at 12:12:23 and 2:12:22 or something like that...not sure if time is the issue or not.This code was in the before create of an activerecord object.   Before the record was created this code would run and generate the \'unique\' code.  Entries in the db were always produced reliably, but the code (str in the above line) was being duplicated much too often.I created a script to run through 100000 iterations of this above line with small delay so it would take 3-4 hours hoping to see some kind of repeat pattern on an hourly basis, but saw nothing.  I have no idea why this was happening in my rails app.Here is another method:Needs require "securerandom"My 2 cents:
