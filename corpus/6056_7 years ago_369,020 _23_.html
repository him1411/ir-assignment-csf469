How do I create Directory/folder?Once I have tested System.getProperty("user.home");I have to create a directory (directory name "new folder" ) if and only if new folder does not exist.Here "directory" is the name of the directory you want to create/exist.With Java 7, you can use Files.createDirectories().For instance:You can try FileUtils#forceMkdirThis library have a lot of useful functions.If you want to create a single directory use mkdirIf you want to create a hierarchy of folder structure use mkdirsCreate a single directory.Create a directory named \xe2\x80\x9cDirectory2 and all its sub-directories \xe2\x80\x9cSub2\xe2\x80\xb3 and \xe2\x80\x9cSub-Sub2\xe2\x80\xb3 together.Source: this perfect tuto , you find also an example of use.The following method should do what you want, just make sure you are checking the return value of mkdir() / mkdirs()Though this question has been answered. I would like to put something extra, i.e. \nif there is a file exist with the directory name that you are trying to create than it should prompt an error. For future visitors. Just wanted to point out to everyone calling File.mkdir() or File.mkdirs() to be careful the File object is a directory and not a file.  For example if you call mkdirs() for the path /dir1/dir2/file.txt, it will create a folder with the name file.txt which is probably not what you wanted.  If you are creating a new file and also want to automatically create parent folders you can do something like this:For java 7 and up: Neat and clean:try with this.for more information see this.This the way work for me do one single directory or more or them:\nneed to import java.io.File;\n/*enter the code below to add a diectory dir1 or check if exist dir1, if does not, so create it and same with dir2 and dir3 */This function allows you to create a directory on the user home directory.You can also refer makdir() function for creating a new directory in a folder where you want.
