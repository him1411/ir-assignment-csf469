I am writing a program that needs A LOT of words of the English language. I am trying to find a dictionary file that has a lot of words. Does anyone know of a good source? I tried many sources but they don\'t seem to have it.What about /usr/share/dict/words on any Unix system? How many words are we talking about? Like OED-Unabridged?Also take a look at:For an English dictionary .txt file, you can use Custom Dictionary.You can also generate a list aspell or wordlist with own settings.http://www.math.sjsu.edu/~foster/dictionary.txt350,000 wordsVery late, but might be useful for others.There\'s also WordNet. Its data files format are well-documented.\nI used it for building an embeddable dictionary library for iOS developers (www.lexicontext.com) and also in one of my apps.@Future-searchers: you can use aspell to do the dictionary checks, it has bindings in ruby and python. It would make your job much simpler.
