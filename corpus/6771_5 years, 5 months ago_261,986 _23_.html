I am hosting special HTTP and HTTPS services on the ports 8006 and 8007 respectively. I use iptables to "activate" the server; i.e. to route the incoming HTTP and HTTPS ports:This works like a charm. However I would like to create another script that disables my server again; i.e. restore iptables to the state it was in before running the lines above. However I am having a hard time figuring out the syntax to remove these rules. The only thing that seems to work is a complete flush:But that will also delete other iptables rules which is undesired.Execute the same commands but replace the "-A" with "-D". For example:becomesYou may also use the rule\'s number (--line-numbers):Example output :So if you would like to delete second rule :If you use(d) a specific table (eg nat), you have to add it to the delete command (thx to @ThorSummoner for the comment)The best solution that works for me without any problems looks this way:\n1. Add temporary rule with some comment:2. When the rule added and you wish to remove it (or everything with this comment), do:So, you\'ll 100% delete all rules that match the $comment and leave other lines untouched. This solution works for last 2 months with about 100 changes of rules per day - no issues.Hope, it helps First list all iptables rules with this command:Then copy the specific rule you want to delete.Finally delete the rule with this command: Use -D command, this is how man page explains it:Do realize this command, like all other command(-A, -I) works on certain table. If you\'are not working on the default table(filter table), use -t TABLENAME to specify that target table.Note: This only deletes the first rule matched. If you have many rules matched(this can happen in iptables), run this several times.Other than counting the number you can list the line-number with --line-number parameter, for example:Assume that, if you want to remove NAT rules,List the appended IPtables using the command below,If you would like to remove the nat rule from the IPtables, just execute the command,Then, you can verify that,
