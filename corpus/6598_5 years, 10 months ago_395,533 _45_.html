Details:I\'m extending ActionBarActivity.\nEclipse and SDK fully patched as of 2011-11-06.  Deployed to Samsung device with Android 2.3.3\nApplication has android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Light" Issue: application is light, but ActionBar is blue with grey icons, hardly visible against the blue background color. I also want the ActionBar to be light, so they grey icons are more visible.I\'ve tried modifying the styles but to no avail.\nI\'m probably missing something trivial.  How do I change the background color of the ActionBar of an ActionBarActivity using XML ?As per documentation - "You can control the behaviors and visibility of the action bar with the ActionBar APIs, which were added in Android 3.0 (API level 11)."So, ActionBar will not work for your target environment which is at API level 10 (Android 2.3.3).Just in case, if you target for minimum API level 11 , you can change ActionBar\'s background color by defining custom style, as:And, set "MyTheme" as theme for application / activity.Hope this helps...Try thistry this:Use this - http://jgilfelt.github.io/android-actionbarstylegenerator/Its an amazing tool that lets you customize your actionbar with a live preview.I tried the earlier answers but always had problems with changing other colors like the tabs and letters and spent hours tweaking stuff. This tool helped me get my design done in just a couple of minutes.All the best! :)I had the same problem, where my Action Bar would turn grey when I entered that code. Chances are your original style sheet looked like this:The "DarkActionBar" was what was keeping your Action Bar grey. I changed it to this, and it worked:I also threw in how to edit the text color. Also, no need to change anything surrounding the resources.-WarrenSee the Android Official Documentation for referenceI am building an app with minSdkVersion = "9" and targetSdkVersion = "21" I changed the color of action bar and it works fine with API level 9Here is an xmlres/values/themes.xmland set the color of actionbar you wantres/values/colors.xmlActionbar color can also be defined in .class file, the snippet isbut this will not work with the API < 11, so styling the actionbar in xml is only way for API < 11On the Nexus 4 people this seems to make the color go grey.(all credit to this post, but it is buried in the comments, so I wanted to surface it here) \nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/17198657/1022454Direct add this line with your color codenot need to create ActionBar object every time...try one line code :Use below code to provide different color to actionbar text and actionbar background just use below theme in manifest against the activity in which you want output :)This code may be helpful This is how you can change the color of Action Bar.From your MainActivity.java change the action bar color like thisUse This code ..to change action bar background color.\nopen "res/values/themes.xml" (if not present, create it)\nand add Note : this code works for android 3.0 and higher versions onlyUse this, it would work.color.xml file:
