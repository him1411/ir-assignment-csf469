I want to change the author of one specific commit in the history. It\'s not last commit.I know about this question - How do I change the author of a commit in git?But I am thinking about something, where I identify the commit by hash or short-hash.Interactive rebase off of a point earlier in the history than the commit you need to modify (git rebase -i <earliercommit>). In the list of commits being rebased, change the text from pick to edit next to the hash of the one you want to modify. Then when git prompts you to change the commit, use this:For example, if your commit history is A-B-C-D-E-F with F as HEAD, and you want to change the author of C and D, then you would...The accepted answer to this question is a wonderfully clever use of interactive rebase, but it unfortunately exhibits conflicts if the commit we are trying to change the author of used to be on a branch which was subsequently merged in. More generally, it does not work when handling messy histories.Since I am apprehensive about running scripts which depend on setting and unsetting environment variables to rewrite git history, I am writing a new answer based on this post which is similar to this answer but is more complete.The following is tested and working, unlike the linked answer.\nAssume for clarity of exposition that 03f482d6 is the commit whose author we are trying to replace, and 42627abe is the commit with the new author. Checkout the commit we are trying to modify. Make the author change.Replace the old commit with the new one locally.Rewrite all future commits based on the replacement.Remove the replacement for cleanliness.Push the new history (after sanity checking with git log).Github documentation contains a script that replaces the committer info for all commits in a branch.The answers in the question to which you linked are good answers and cover your situation (the other question is more general since it involves rewriting multiple commits).As an excuse to try out git filter-branch, I wrote a script to rewrite the Author Name and/or Author Email for a given commit:You can change author of last commit using the command below.git commit --amend --author="Author Name <email@address.com>"However, if you want to change more than one commits author name, it\'s a bit tricky. You need to start an interactive rebase then mark commits as edit then ammend them one by one and finish.Start rebasing with git rebase -i. It will show you something like this. Change the pick keyword to edit for the commits you want to change the author name.Then close the editor. For the beginners, hit Escape then type :wq and hit Enter.Then you will see your terminal like nothing happened. Actually you are in the middle of an interactive rebase. Now it\'s time to amend your commit\'s author name using the command above. It will open the editor again. Quit and continue rebase with git rebase --continue. Repeat the same for the commit count you want to edit. You can make sure that interactive rebase finished when you get the No rebase in progress? message.Reset your email in the config globally:git config --global user.email example@email.comNow reset the author of your commit without edit required:git commit --amend --reset-author --no-editThere is one additional step to Amber\'s answer if you\'re using a centralized repository:git push -f to force the update of the central repository.Be careful that there are not a lot of people working on the same branch because it can ruin consistency.When doing git rebase -i there is this interesting bit in the doc:If you want to fold two or more commits into one, replace the command "pick" for the second and subsequent commits with "squash" or "fixup". If the commits had different authors, the folded commit will be attributed to the author of the first commit. The suggested commit message for the folded commit is the concatenation of the commit messages of the first commit and of those with the "squash" command, but omits the commit messages of commits with the "fixup" command.then you can do:Example of what git rebase -i B^ will give you:change that to:It will prompt you to edit the messages:and you can just remove the first few lines.
