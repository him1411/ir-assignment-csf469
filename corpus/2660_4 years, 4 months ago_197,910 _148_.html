I have a multi-project (~10 modules) of which building takes about 20-30 seconds each time. When I press Run in Android Studio, I have to wait every time to rebuild the app, which is extremely slow.Is it possible to automate building process in Android Studio? Or do you have any advice on how to make this process faster?In Eclipse, thanks to automatic building, running the same project on an emulator takes about 3-5 seconds.This is my build.gradle file (app module):I\'m sorry, but upgrading development station to SSD and tons of ram has probably a bigger influence than points below combined. Increasing build performance has major priority for the development teams, so make sure you are using latest Gradle and Android Gradle Plugin.Create a file named gradle.properties in whatever directory applies:Append:Gradle properties works local if you place them at projectRoot\\gradle.properties and globally if you place them at user_home\\.gradle\\gradle.properties. Properties applied if you run gradle tasks from console or directly from idea:It is possible to tweak Gradle-IntelliJ integration from the IDE settings GUI. Enabling "offline work" (check answer from yava below) will disable real network requests on every "sync gradle file".One of the slowest steps of the apk build is converting java bytecode into single dex file. Enabling native multidex (minSdk 21 for debug builds only) will help the tooling to reduce an amount of work (check answer from Aksel Willgert below).Prefer @aar dependencies over library sub-projects. Search aar package on mavenCentral, jCenter or use jitpack.io to build any library from github. If you are not editing sources of the dependency library you should not build it every time with your project sources. Consider to exclude project and cache files from antivirus scanning. This is obviously a trade off with security (don\'t try this at home!). But if you switch between branches a lot, then antivirus will rescan files before allowing gradle process to use it, which slows build time (in particular AndroidStudio sync project with gradle files and indexing tasks). Measure build time and process CPU with and without antivirus enabled to see if it is related. Gradle has built-in support for profiling projects. Different projects are using a different combination of plugins and custom scripts. Using --profile will help to find bottlenecks. You can ignore gradle update-to-date checks.For Windows running Android Studio 1.5: Go to File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build tools -> Gradle -> Check Offline work (as shown in image)down from ~30+ sec to ~3 secSearched everywhere for this and finally found a solution that works for us. Enabling parallel builds (On OSX: preferences -> compiler -> gradle -> "Compile independent modules in parallel") and enabling \'make project automatically\' brought it down from ~1 min to ~20 sec. Thanks to /u/Covalence.http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/1k3nb3/gradle_and_android_studio_way_slower_to_build/I recently bought a new SSD and went from Windows to Linux.My build times are now an order of magnitude faster, and no longer annoying. Though it does not directly answer your question as to why it\'s slower than eclipse, it shows that the process is disk-bounded and an upgrade to an SSD might be a (somewhat expensive) solution. I\'m guessing there will be people googling the issue and ending up here, who might appreciate my experience. If using google play services, depending on just the libraries you need instead of the whole blob can make things faster.If your only need is maps, use:instead of:The latter brings 20k methods (see blog) into the classpath, which might tip the total method count over 64k. That would force the use of proguard or multidex even for debug builds. For one of my projects i had the following build timesIf developing on sdk 21+, it would possible to optimize multidex builds as stated in the android documentationThe accepted answer is for older versions of android studio and most of them works still now. Updating android studio made it a little bit faster. Don\'t bother to specify heap size as it\'ll increase automatically with the increase of Xms and Xmx. Here\'s some modification with the VMoptionsIn bin folder there\'s a studio.vmoptions file to set the environment configuration. In my case this is studio64.vmoptions\nAdd the following lines if they\'re not added already and save the file. In my case I\'ve 8GB RAM.Start android studio. Go to File-> Settings-> Build, Execution, Deployment-> CompilerIn case of using mac, at first I couldn\'t find the vmoptions. Anyway, here\'s a nice article about how we can change the vmoptions in MAC OSX. Quoting from this article here.Open your terminal and put this command to open the vmoptions in MAC OSX:Just create a file named gradle.properties in the following directory:Add this line to the file:For me the speed is now equal to Eclipse.Source: https://www.timroes.de/2013/09/12/speed-up-gradle/Speed Up Gradle Build In Android Studio 2Ever feel like you are waiting for the builds to complete in Android Studio for minutes? Me too. And it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty annoying.\nFortunately, there are a few ways that you can use to improve this. Android uses Gradle for building. The latest version is 2.14.1 has a huge performance boost over previous versions (see Release notes for details).Step 1: Update Gradle version\nAn easier way to accomplish this is to go to: Open Module Settings (your project) > Project StructureUPDATEChange to Gradle version: 3.1\nChange to Android Plugin Version: 2.2.3Download Gradle Release distributive from https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-3.1-all.zip\nAnd copy it to the Gradle folder:Last step is to add your discribution in Settings > GradleDon\xe2\x80\x99t forget to click Apply to save changes.Step 2: Enable Offline mode, Gradle daemon and parallel build for the project\nOffline mode tells Gradle to ignore update-to-date checks. Gradle asks for dependencies everytime and having this option makes it just uses what is already on the machine for dependencies.\nGo to Gradle from android studio Setting and click in Offline work box.The next step is to enable the Gradle daemon and parallel build for your project. Parallel builds will cause your projects with multiple modules (multi-project builds in Gradle) to be built in parallel, which should make large or modular projects build faster.These settings could enabled by modifiing a file named gradle.properties in Gradle scripts directory(i.e., ~/.gradle/gradle.properties).Some of these options (e.g. Complie modules in parallel) are available from Android Studio and also enabled there by default, but putting them in the gradle.properties file will enabled them when building from the terminal and also making sure that your colleagues will use the same settings. But if you\xe2\x80\x99re working on a team, sometimes you can\xe2\x80\x99t commit this stuff.Using the daemon will make your builds startup faster as it won\xe2\x80\x99t have to start up the entire Gradle application every time. The Gradle Daemon is not enabled by default, but it\xe2\x80\x99s recommend always enabling it for developers\xe2\x80\x99 machines (but leaving it disabled for continuous integration servers). FAQ about this mode could be found here https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_daemon.html.\nThe parallel builds setting could be unsafe for some projects. The requirement is that all your modules must be decoupled or your build could fail (see http://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/multi_project_builds.html#sec:decoupled_projects for details).Step 3: Enable incremental dexign and tweak memory settings\nYou can speed up your builds by turning on incremental dexing. In your module\xe2\x80\x99s build file:Add this option to your android block:In that dexOptions block you can also specify the heap size for the dex process, for example:Where \xe2\x80\x9c12g\xe2\x80\x9d is 12GB of memory. Additional information about this could be found here google.github.io/android-gradle-dsl/current/\nYou can also configure Gradle parameters in the settings file, e.g. increase the max heap size in case you have a large project:See all list of parameters here: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide_single.html#sec:gradle_configuration_properties for details.Step 4: Disable Antivirus\nConsider to exclude project and cache files from antivirus scanning. This is obviously a trade off with security. But if you switch between branches a lot, then antivirus will rescan files before allowing gradle process to use it, which slows build time (in particular Android Studio sync project with gradle files and indexing tasks). Measure build time and process CPU with and without antivirus enabled to see if it is related.\nI hope this helps. Leave a comment if you have any question or some other tips for improving the build performance.helpful link You could make the process faster, if you use gradle from command line. There is a lot of optimization to do for the IDE developers. But it is just an early version.For more information read this discussion on g+ with some of the devs.If anyone is working a project which is synced via Subversion and this still happening, I think this can slow the process of workflow in Android Studio. For example if it work very slow while: scrolling in a class,xml etc, while my app is still running on my device.All answers are great, and I encourage to use those methods with this one to improve build speed.After release of android 2.2 on September 2016, Android released experimental build cache feature to speed up gradle build performance, which is now official from Android Studio 2.3 Canary. (Official Release note) It introduces a new build cache feature, which is enable by default, can speed up build times (including full builds, incremental builds, and instant run) by storing and reusing files/directories that were created in previous builds of the same or different Android project. How to use:Add following line in your gradle.properties fileClean the cache: There is a new Gradle task called cleanBuildCache for you to more easily clean the build cache. You can use it by typing the following in your terminal: ./gradlew cleanBuildCacheOR You can clean the cache for Android studio 2.2 by deleting all the files store at locationC:\\Users\\<username>\\.android\\build-cacheSolved mine with File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools ->\n  Gradle -> Offline workGradle builds went from 8 minutes to 3 seconds.After change this settings my compile duration 10 minutes changed to ~10 secs.Step 1:Settings(ctrl+Alt+S) -> Build,Execution,Deployment -> Compiler -> type "--offline" in command-line Options box.Step 2: check the \xe2\x80\x9cCompile independent modules in parallel\xe2\x80\x9d checkbox.& click Apply -> OKReference - https://www.sundoginteractive.com/blog/speed-up-gradle-in-android-studioDisadvantage:You will not be able to pull down the latest versions of the dependencies identified in your build.gradle file. It runs faster because it uses a cached snapshot of those imported libraries.Important Note: When you deploy the application remove this settings & build with latest versions of dependencies.Please follow the following steps.Enable offline mode :  Please check below print screen.https://i.stack.imgur.com/RF9uG.pngEnable Instant Run : Please check below print screen.https://i.stack.imgur.com/mvHKJ.pngIf you want to learn more about instant run please visit android developer site.Here\'s what helped this beginning Android programmer (former professional programmer, years ago) in speeding up Android Studio 2.2. I know this is a rehash, but, just summarizing in one place. Initial builds can still be brutally slow, but restarts of running apps are now usually very tolerable. I\'m using a sub-optimal PC: AMD Quad-Core A8-7410 CPU, 8MB RAM, non-SSD HD, Win 10. (And, this is my first Stack Overflow posting.... ;)IN SETTINGS -> GRADLE:yes for "Offline work"  (this is perhaps the most import setting).IN SETTINGS -> COMPILER:yes for "Compile independent modules in parallel"  (not sure if this does in fact help utilize multicore CPUs).IN GRADLE SCRIPTS, "build.gradle (Module: app)":ALSO IN GRADLE SCRIPTS, "gradle.properties (Project Properties)":org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx3048m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8org.gradle.parallel=true\norg.gradle.daemon=trueAdditionally, testing on a physical device instead of the emulator is working well for me; a small tablet that stands up is convenient.You could try opening the gradle menu on the right side of studio, and assemble only the modules you have changed, then run the install command. When you press run it assembles everything regardless of any changes you you may have made to the code it is assemblingI\'m far from being an expert on Gradle but my environment had the following line in .gradle/init.gradle Yet I have no idea why that line was there, but I try changing to  and now I finally can work without swearing to Android Studio & Gradle buildind scheme. In our specific case, the problem was due to having the retrolambda plugin, which forced all projects and subprojects to recompile everytime we tried to launch our application, even if no code had been altered in our core modules.Removing retrolamba fixed it for us. Hope it helps someone.Just try this first. It is my personal experience. I had the same problem. What i had done is just permanently disable the antivirus (Mine was Avast Security 2015). Just after  disabling the antivirus , thing gone well.   the gradle  finished successfully. \nFrom now within seconds the gradle is finishing ( Only taking 5-10 secs). Hi I know this is very very late answer but maybe help someone\nin my case I was using       in my app Gradle dependency\nbut in one of my libraries it was       after change all to latest version my problem solved.This setup goes really fast for me \n(about 2 seconds the build)build.gradlegradle.propertiesmy PC:project files\n - All located in local HDUSE this\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386 zlib1g:i386Android Studio fails to build new project, timed out while wating for slave aapt processA trivial change (to a resoruce xml) still took 10 minutes.\nAs @rivare says in his answer, a command line build is mutch faster (took this down to 15 seconds).\nHere are some steps to at least make a trivial build fast from the command line for Windows.Go to your projects root (where the gradlew.bat is):cd c:\\android\\MaskActivityexecute the build:gradlew assembleDebuguninstall the apk from the phone directly (drag it to uninstall).When the build is finished, kill the BIG java process using Windows\nTask Manager.OR if you have unix tools on your Windows machine:"pid" \'s are shown:Now install your apk:adb -d install C:\\Android\\MaskActivity\\app\\build\\outputs\\apk\\app-debug.apkAccording to the android documentation, add this in the gradle file of app module.Following the steps will make it 10 times faster and reduce build time 90%First create a file named gradle.properties in the following directory:Add this line to the file:And check this options in Android Studio
