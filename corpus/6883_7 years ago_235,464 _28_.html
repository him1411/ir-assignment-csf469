I need to increment a date value by one day in JavaScript.For example, I have a date value 2010-09-11 and I need to store the date of the next day in a JavaScript variable.How can I increment a date by a day?Three options for you:My previous answer for #1 was wrong (it added 24 hours, failing to account for transitions to and from daylight saving time; Clever Human pointed out that it would fail with November 7, 2010 in the Eastern timezone). Instead, Jigar\'s answer is the correct way to do this without a library:This works even for the last day of a month (or year), because the JavaScript date object is smart about rollover:(This answer is currently accepted, so I can\'t delete it. Before it was accepted I suggested to the OP they accept Jigar\'s, but perhaps they accepted this one for items #2 or #3 on the list.)(Beware that add modifies the instance you call it on, rather than returning a new instance, so today.add(1, \'days\') would modify today. That\'s why we start with a cloning op on var tomorrow = ....)None of the examples in this answer seem to work with Daylight Saving Time adjustment days. On those days, the number of hours in a day are not 24 (they are 23 or 25, depending on if you are "springing forward" or "falling back".)The below AddDays javascript function accounts for daylight saving time:Here are the tests I used to test the function:You first need to parse your string before following the other people\'s suggestion:If you want it back in the same format again you will have to do that "manually":But I suggest getting Date.js as mentioned in other replies, that will help you alot.The easiest way is to convert to milliseconds and add 1000*60*60*24 milliseconds e.g.:Get the string value of the date using the dateObj.toJSON() method Ref: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toJSON\nSlice the date from the returned value and then increment by the number of days you want.Two methods: 1:2: Similar to the previous methodNot entirelly sure if it is a BUG(Tested Firefox 32.0.3 and Chrome 38.0.2125.101), but the following code will fail on Brazil (-3 GMT):Result:Adding one Hour to the date, will make it work perfectly (but does not solve the problem).Result:Getting the next 5 days:You could use this open source component I wrote as well. It works with other time intervals as well (hours, minutes, weeks, months, etc) and takes daylight saving time into account. You can just use the dateAdd() method to add days in a single call.Example using your date:I prefer this because it\'s vanilla javascript and doesn\'t require a full library.
