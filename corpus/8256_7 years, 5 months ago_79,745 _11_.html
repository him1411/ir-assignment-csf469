How do I find the full path of the currently running Python interpreter from within the currently executing Python script?sys.executable contains full path of the currently running Python interpreter.which is now documented hereJust noting a different way of questionable usefulness, using os.environ:e.g.There are a few alternate ways to figure out the currently used python in Linux is:\n1) which python command.\n2) command -v python command\n3) type python commandSimilarly On Windows with Cygwin will also result the same.If you are already in the python shell.

In my case it is in C Drive and in that Python folder
