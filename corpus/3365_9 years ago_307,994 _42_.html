I\'m importing a MySQL dump and getting the following error.Apparently there are attachments in the database, which makes for very large inserts.This is on my local machine, a Mac with MySQL 5 installed from the MySQL package.Where do I change max_allowed_packet to be able to import the dump?  Is there anything else I should set?  Just running mysql --max_allowed_packet=32M \xe2\x80\xa6 resulted in the same error.You probably have to change it for both the client (you are running to do the import) AND the daemon mysqld that is running and accepting the import.For the client, you can specify it on the command line:Also, change the my.cnf or my.ini file under the mysqld section and set:or you could run these commands in a MySQL console connected to that same server:(Use a very large value for the packet size.)As michaelpryor said, you have to change it for both the client and the daemon mysqld  server.His solution for the client command-line is good, but the ini files don\'t always do the trick, depending on configuration. So, open a terminal, type mysql to get a mysql prompt, and issue these commands:Keep the mysql prompt open, and run your command-line SQL execution on a second terminal..This can be changed in your my.ini file (on Windows, located in \\Program Files\\MySQL\\MySQL Server) under the server section, for example:By default, my.cnf is nowhere to be found.You need to copy one of /usr/local/mysql/support-files/my*.cnf to /etc/my.cnf and restart mysqld. (Which you can do in the MySQL preference pane if you installed it.)In etc/my.cnf try changing the max_allowed _packet and net_buffer_length toif this is not working then try changing toThe fix is to increase the MySQL daemon\xe2\x80\x99s max_allowed_packet. You can do this to a running daemon by logging in as Super and running the following commands. Then to import your dump:On CENTOS 6 /etc/my.cnf , under [mysqld] section the correct syntax is:Use a max_allowed_packet variable issuing a command likemysql --max_allowed_packet=32M\n -u root -p database < dump.sqlSlightly unrelated to your problem, so here\'s one for Google.If you didn\'t mysqldump the SQL, it might be that your SQL is broken. I just got this error by accidentally having an unclosed string literal in my code. Sloppy fingers happen.That\'s a fantastic error message to get for a runaway string, thanks for that MySQL!It is  a security risk to have max_allowed_packet at higher value, as an attacker can push bigger sized packets and crash the system. So, Optimum Value of max_allowed_packet to be tuned and tested.It is to better to change when required (using set global max_allowed_packet = xxx) \nthan to have it as part of my.ini or my.conf.Set max_allowed_packet to the same (or more) than what it was when you dumped it with mysqldump. If you can\'t do that, make the dump again with a smaller value.That is, assuming you dumped it with mysqldump. If you used some other tool, you\'re on your own.I am working in a shared hosting environment and I have hosted a website based on Drupal. I cannot edit the my.ini file or my.conf file too.So, I deleted all the tables which were related to Cache and hence I could resolve this issue. Still I am looking for a perfect solution / way to handle this problem.Edit - Deleting the tables created problems for me, coz Drupal was expecting that these tables should be existing. So I emptied the contents of these tables which solved the problem.Sometimes type setting:in my.ini is not working. Try to determine the my.ini as follows:orThen restart the server:
