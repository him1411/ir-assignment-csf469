Lets say I have an array What is the easiest way to get rid of the first element? (0)"pop"ing the first element of an Array is called "shift" ("unshift"\nbeing the operation of adding one element\nin front of the array).Use the shift method on arrayIf you want to remove n starting elements you can use x.shift(n)and additionally:So unlike shift or slice this returns the modified array (useful for one liners).This is pretty neat:As written in the comments, there\'s an advantage of not mutating the original list.or a.delete_at 0You can use:slice! generalizes to any index or range.Use shift methodhttps://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html#method-i-shiftYou can use Array.delete_at(0) method which will delete first element.You can use:\narr - [arr[0]]\nor else\narr - [arr.shift()]\nor simply\narr.shift(1)
