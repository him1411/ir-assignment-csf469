How do you use an image referenced by URL in an ImageView?From Android developer:Make sure you have the following permissions set in your AndroidManifest.xml to access the internet.You\'ll have to download the image firstly Then use the Imageview.setImageBitmap to set  bitmap into the ImageView1. Picasso allows for hassle-free image loading in your application\xe2\x80\x94often in one line of code!Use Gradle:Just one line of code!Many common pitfalls of image loading on Android are handled automatically by Picasso2. Glide An image loading and caching library for Android focused on smooth scrolling Use Gradle:// For a simple view:// For a simple image list:I wrote a class to handle this, as it seems to be a recurring need in my various projects:https://github.com/koush/UrlImageViewHelperUrlImageViewHelper will fill an\n  ImageView with an image that is found\n  at a URL.The sample will do a Google Image\n  Search and load/show the results\n  asynchronously.UrlImageViewHelper will automatically\n  download, save, and cache all the\n  image urls the BitmapDrawables.\n  Duplicate urls will not be loaded into\n  memory twice. Bitmap memory is managed\n  by using a weak reference hash table,\n  so as soon as the image is no longer\n  used by you, it will be garbage\n  collected automatically.Anyway people ask my comment to post it as answer. i am posting.thanks.The accepted answer above is great if you are loading the image based on a button click, however if you are doing it in a new activity it freezes up the UI for a second or two. Looking around I found that a simple asynctask eliminated this problem. To use an asynctask add this class at the end of your activity:And call from your onCreate() method using:The result is a quickly loaded activity and an imageview that shows up a split second later depending on the user\'s network speed.You could also use this LoadingImageView view to load an image from a url:http://blog.blundellapps.com/imageview-with-loading-spinner/Once you have added the class file from that link you can instantiate a url image view:in xml:In code:And update it using:I have recently found a thread here, as I have to do a similar thing for a listview with images, but the principle is simple, as you can read in the first sample class shown there (by jleedev).\nYou get the Input stream of the image (from web)Then you store the image as Drawable and you can pass it to the ImageView (via setImageDrawable). Again from the upper code snippet take a look at the entire thread. Hi I have the most easiest code try this main.xmltry thisLots of good info in here...I recently found a class called SmartImageView that seems to be working really well so far.  Very easy to incorporate and use.http://loopj.com/android-smart-image-view/https://github.com/loopj/android-smart-image-viewUPDATE: I ended up writing a blog post about this, so check it out for help on using SmartImageView.2ND UPDATE: I now always use Picasso for this (see above) and highly recommend it. :)The best modern library for such a task for my opinion is Picasso by Square. It allows to load an image to an ImageView by URL with one-liner:This will help you...Define imageview and load image into it .....Then Define this method : A simple and clean way to do this is to use the open source library Prime.This code is tested, it is completely working.Working for imageView in any container , like listview grid view , normal layout Version with exception handling and async task:Try this way,hope this will help you to solve your problem.Here I explain about how to use "AndroidQuery" external library for load image from url/server in asyncTask manner with also cache loaded image to device file or cache area.activity_main.xmlMainActivity.javaAndroid Query can handle that for you and much more (like cache and loading progress).Take a look at here.I think is the best approach.This is a late reply, as suggested above AsyncTask will will and after googling a bit i found one more way for this problem.I tried this myself and i have not face any issue yet.
