I want to convert a duration of time, i.e., number of seconds to colon-separated time string (hh:mm:ss)I found some useful answers here but they all talk about converting to x hours and x minutes format.So is there a tiny snippet that does this in jQuery or just raw JavaScript?You can use it now like:To get the time part in the format hh:MM:ss, you can use this regular expression:(This was mentioned above in same post by someone, thanks for that.)You can manage to do this without any external JS library with the help of JS Date method like following:I recommend ordinary javascript, using the Date object:(Of course, the Date object created will have an actual date associated with it, but that data is extraneous, so for these purposes, you don\'t have to worry about it.)A Google search turned up this result:Variation on a theme. Handles single digit seconds a little differentlyI like the first answer.\nSome optimizations for him:Result code:Using the amazing moment.js library:This allows you to specify any duration  be it hours, minutes, seconds, mills, and returns a human readable version.new Date().toString().split(" ")[4];result 15:08:03result:It\'s pretty easy,I loved Powtac\'s answer, but I wanted to use it in Angular, so I created a filter using his code. It\'s functionally identical, except that I added in an optional decimals field to display fractional seconds. Use it like you would any other filter:{{ elapsedTime | HHMMSS }} displays: 01:23:45{{ elapsedTime | HHMMSS : 3 }} displays: 01:23:45.678I liked Webjins answer the most, so i extended it to display days with a d suffix, made display conditional and included a s suffix on plain seconds:returns "3d 16:32:12" or "16:32:12" or "32:12" or "12s"Here is a modern ES6 version:Expected results:ExamplesA regular expression can be used to match the time substring in the string returned from the toString() method of the Date object, which is formatted as follows: "Thu Jul 05 2012 02:45:12 GMT+0100 (GMT Daylight Time)". Note that this solution uses the time since the epoch: midnight of January 1, 1970. This solution can be a one-liner, though splitting it up makes it much easier to understand.Here is yet another version, which handles days also:I think performance wise this is by far the fastest:I\'m personally prefer the leading unit (days, hours, minutes) without leading zeros. But seconds should always be leaded by minutes (0:13), this presentation is easily considered as \'duration\', without further explanation (marking as min, sec(s), etc.), usable in various languages (internationalization).//imitating the server side (.net, C#) duration formatting like:You can use Momement.js with moment-duration-format plugin:See also this FiddleThis is how i did ittimeFromSecs(22341938) will return \'258d 14h 5m 38s\'I\'d upvote artem\'s answer, but I am a new poster.  I did expand on his solution, though not what the OP asked for as followsTo get04Oct 16:31:28 PDTThis works for me...But if you are starting with just a time quantity, I use two functions; one to format and pad, and one to calculate:If you know the number of seconds you have, this will work. It also uses the native Date() object.Here\'s how I did it.  It seems to work fairly well, and it\'s extremely compact.  (It uses a lot of ternary operators, though)...and for formatting strings...Non-prototype version of toHHMMSS:Here is my vision of solution. You can try my snippet below.This version of the accepted answer makes it a bit prettier if you are dealing with video lengths for example:1:37:40 (1 hour / 37 minutes / 40 seconds)1:00 (1 minute)2:20 (2 minutes and 20 seconds)Milliseconds to duration, the simple way:It converts 327577 to 00:05:27.577.UPDATEAnother way for different scenario:If you use the XDate() library you can use this function
