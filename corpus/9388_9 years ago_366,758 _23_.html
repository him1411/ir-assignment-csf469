I have never "hand-coded" object creation code for SQL Server and foreign key decleration is seemingly different between SQL Server and Postgres. Here is my sql so far:When I run the query I get this error:Msg 8139, Level 16, State 0, Line 9\n  Number of referencing columns in\n  foreign key differs from number of\n  referenced columns, table\n  \'question_bank\'.Can you spot the error?And if you just want to create the constraint on its own, you can use ALTER TABLEI wouldn\'t recommend the syntax mentioned by Sara Chipps for inline creation, just because I would rather name my own constraints.You can also name your foreign key constraint by using:I like AlexCuse\'s answer, but something you should pay attention to whenever you add a foreign key constraint is how you want updates to the referenced column in a row of the referenced table to be treated, and especially how you want deletes of rows in the referenced table to be treated. If a constraint is created like this:.. then updates or deletes in the referenced table will blow up with an error if there is a corresponding row in the referencing table.That might be the behaviour you want, but in my experience, it much more commonly isn\'t.If you instead create it like this:..then updates and deletes in the parent table will result in updates and deletes of the corresponding rows in the referencing table.(I\'m not suggesting that the default should be changed, the default errs on the side of caution, which is good. I\'m just saying it\'s something that a person who is creating constaints should always pay attention to.)This can be done, by the way, when creating a table, like this:--That will work too. Pehaps a bit more intuitive construct?To Create a foreign key on any table Like you, I don\'t usually create foreign keys by hand, but if for some reason I need the script to do so I usually create it using ms sql server management studio and before saving then changes,  I select Table Designer | Generate Change ScriptNecromancing.\nActually, doing this correctly is a little bit trickier. You first need to check if the primary-key exists for the column you want to set your foreign key to reference to. In this example, a foreign key on table T_ZO_SYS_Language_Forms is created, referencing dbo.T_SYS_Language_Forms.LANG_UID This script is about creating tables with foreign key and I added referential integrity constraint sql-server.If you want to create two table\'s columns into a relationship by using a query try the following:
