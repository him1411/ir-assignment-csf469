I have UTF-8 encoded NSData from windows server and I want to convert it to NSString for iPhone. Since data contains characters (like a degree symbol) which have different values on both platforms, how do I convert data to string?If the data is not null-terminated, you should use -initWithData:encoding:If the data is null-terminated, you should instead use -stringWithUTF8String: to avoid the extra \\0 at the end.(Note that if the input is not properly UTF-8-encoded, you will get nil.)Swift variant:If the data is null-terminated, you could go though the safe way which is remove the that null character, or the unsafe way similar to the Objective-C version above.You could call this method I humbly submit a category to make this less annoying:and(Note that if you\'re not using ARC you\'ll need an autorelease there.)Now instead of the appallingly verbose:You can do:The Swift version from String to Data and back to String:Xcode 8.3.1 \xe2\x80\xa2 Swift 3.1PlaygroundSometimes, the methods in the other answers don\'t work. In my case, I\'m generating a signature with my RSA private key and the result is NSData. I found that this seems to work:Objective-CSwiftJust to summarize, here\'s a complete answer, that worked for me.My problem was that when I used The string I got was unpredictable:  Around 70% it did contain the expected value, but too often it resulted with Null or even worse: garbaged at the end of the string.After some digging I switched to And got the expected result every time.
