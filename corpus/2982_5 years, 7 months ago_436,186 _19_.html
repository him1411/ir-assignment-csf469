I use a FileUploader control in my application. I want to save a file in a specified folder. Now I want, if this folder does not exist, to first create it, and then save my file to this folder.  If the folder already exists, then just save the file in it.How I can do this?As others have said, use System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectoryBut, you don\'t need to check if it exists first.  From the docsAny and all directories specified in path are created, unless they\n  already exist or unless some part of path is invalid. The path\n  parameter specifies a directory path, not a file path. If the\n  directory already exists, this method does nothing.Use the below code as per http://forums.asp.net/p/1226236/2209871.aspx:Just write this line :Reference: Article about Directory.CreateDirectory at MSDNYou can create the path if it doesn\'t exist yet with a method like the following:Directory.Exists This will explain how to check if a FilePath ExistDirectory.CreateDirectory This will explain how to try and to Create the FilePath if it does not existYou can use a try/catch clause and check to see if it exist:This method will create folder if not exist and do nothing if existsFollowing code is the best line(s) of code i use that will create directory if not present .Use below code. I used this code for file copy and create new folder.You can use the Directory.Exist to check if the directory exist or not.The CreateDirectory is also used to create a sub directory. All you have to do is to specify the path of the directory in which this subdirectory will be created in. The following code snippet creates a Mahesh subdirectory in C:\\Temp directory.Derived/combined from multiple answers, implementing it for me was as easy as this:string createfolder = "E:/tmp/" + uId;\n  System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(createfolder);
