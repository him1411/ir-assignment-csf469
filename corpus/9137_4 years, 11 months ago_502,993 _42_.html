I\'m using Eclipse, I have the following line of code:Eclipse marks this line as an error. I imported the required libraries:But again, both of them are shown as errors. I found a similar post here: import sun.misc.BASE64Encoder results in error compiled in EclipseI used Apache Commons as the solution suggested by including:and importing the JAR files downloaded from: http://commons.apache.org/codec/But the problem still exists, Eclipse still shows the errors previously mentioned; please advise. You need to change the import of your Class.probably somthing like this:And then change your Class to use the BASE64 class.here some example code:Then read why you shouldn\'t use sun.* packages.You can now java.util.Base64 with Java8. First, import it as you normally do:Then use the Base64 static methods as follow:See Javadocs for Base64 for more: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Base64.htmlUse Java 8\'s never-too-late-to-join-in-the-fun class: java.util.Base64You can also convert using base64 encoding. To do this you can use javax.xml.bind.DatatypeConverter#printBase64Binary methodFor example:In Java 8 it can be done asHere is a short, self-contained complete examplegives outputGoogle Guava is a good choice to encode and decode base64 data:POM config:Sample code:Eclipse gives you an error/warning because you are trying to use internal classes that are specific to a JDK vendor and not part of the public API. Jakarta Commons provides its own implementation of base64 codecs, which of course reside in a different package. Delete those imports and let Eclipse import the proper Commons classs for you.To convert this you need Encoder & Decoder which you will get from http://www.source-code.biz/base64coder/java/. It is File Base64Coder.java you will need.Now to access this class as per your requirement you will need class below:In Android you can convert your Bitmap to Base64 for Uploading to Server/Web Service.This \xe2\x80\x9cencodedImage\xe2\x80\x9d is text representation of your Image. You can use this for either uploading purpose or for diplaying directly into HTML Page as below (Reference):Documentation: http://dwij.co.in/java-base64-image-encoderapache commons has nice implementation of base64. you can do this as simply as you can find more details about base64 encoding at http://faisalbhagat.blogspot.com/2014/06/base64-encoding-using-java-and.htmlFor java 6-7 best option is to borrow code from Android repository. It has no dependencies.https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base/blob/master/core/java/android/util/Base64.javaOn Android, use the static methods of the android.util.Base64 utility class. The referenced documentation says that the Base64 class was added in API level 8 (Froyo).Simple example with Java 8:In Java 7 I coded this methodIf you are using Spring framework at least version 4.1, you can use org.springframework.util.Base64Utils class:It will delegate to Java 8\'s Base64, Apache Commons Codec or JAXB DatatypeConverter, depending on what is available.I tried with the following code snippet. It worked well. :-)If you are stuck to an earlier version of Java than 8 but already using AWS SDK for Java, you can use com.amazonaws.util.Base64.it works for me in Android.
