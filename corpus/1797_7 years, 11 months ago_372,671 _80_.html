I got a AsyncTask that is supposed to check the network access to a host name. But the doInBackground() is never timed out. Anyone have a clue?@Eddie.  Just a minor edit to your solution - if the device is in airplane mode (or presumably in other situations where there\'s no available network), cm.getActiveNetworkInfo() will be null, so you need to add a null check.Modified solution below:Also add the following permission to the AndroidManifest.xml:One other small point, if you absolutely need a network connection at the given point in time, then it might be better to use netInfo.isConnected() rather than netInfo.isConnectedOrConnecting.  I guess this is up to the individual use-case however.+ could run on main thread- does not work on some old devices (see comments), only fast with internet connection+ very fast (either way), works on all devices, very reliable- can\'t run on the ui taskThis works pretty much everywhere, and is very fast, but it needs to run in a separate task (e.g. ScheduledExecutorService or AsyncTask). It works pretty well, for me though. Recommend it!Is it really fast enough?Yes, very fast ;-)Is there no reliable way to check internet, other than testing something on the internet?Not as far as I know, but let me know, and I will edit my answer.What if the DNS is down?Google DNS (e.g. 8.8.8.8) is the largest public DNS in the world. As of 2013 it serves 130 billion requests a day. Let \'s just say, your app would probably not be the talk of the day.Which permissions are required?Just internet access - surprise ^^ (Btw have you ever thought about, how some of the methods suggested here could even have a remote glue about internet access, without this permission?)No need to be complex. The simplest and framework manner is to use ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permission and just make a connected methodYou can also use requestRouteToHost if you have a particualr host and connection type (wifi/mobile) in mind.You will also need:in your android manifest.To get getActiveNetworkInfo() to work you need to add the following to the manifest.check this code... it worked for me :)Then, I define the handler:...and launch the test:Take a look at the ConnectivityManager class. You can use this class to get information on the active connections on a host. http://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/ConnectivityManager.htmlEDIT: You can use     orand parse the DetailedState enum of the returned NetworkInfo objectEDIT EDIT: To find out whether you can access a host, you can use Obviously, I\'m using Context.getSystemService(Context.CONNECTIVITY_SERVICE) as a proxy to sayFound at and modified (!) from this link :In your manifest file add at least:You probably already have the INTERNET permission if you are accessing it. Then a boolean function that allows to test for connectivity is:I made this code, it is the simplest and it is just a boolean.\nby asking if(isOnline()){You get if there is a connection and if it can connect to a page the status code 200 (stable connection).    Make sure to add the correct INTERNET and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permissions.It does works for me:To verify network availability:To verify internet access:Of everything I have seen so far shortest and cleanest way should be:PS: This does not ping any host, it just checks the connectionstatus, so if your router has no internet connection and your device is connected to it this method would return true although you have no internet.\nFor an actual test I would recommend execuding a HttpHead request (e.g. to www.google.com) and check the status, if its 200 OK everything is fine and your device has an internet connection.One important use case on mobile devices to it ensure an actual connection exists. This is a common problem when a mobile user enters a Wifi network with a "Captive Portal", in which they need to sign in. I use this blocking function in the background to ensure a connection exists.You can iterate over all network connections and chek whether there is at least one available connection:For me it was not a good practice to check the connection state in the Activity class, because should be called there, or you need to push down your Activity instance (context) to the connection handler class to able to check the connection state there\nWhen no available connection (wifi, network) I catch the UnknownHostException exception:In this way I can handle this case along with the other cases in the same class (my server always response back with a json string)It\'s works for me. Try it out.Here is the method I use:Even better, check to make sure it is "connected":Here is how to use the method:Permission needed:https://stackoverflow.com/a/16124915/950427Im using this code instead of the InetAddress :It is not complex to check Android network / internet connectivity status. The below DetectConnection class will help you to check this status:For more details visit \nHow to Check Android Network / Internet Connectivity StatusBest approach:Following is the code from my Utils class:You can use this method to detect network availability-The other answers that use ConnectivityManager are wrong because having a network connection doesn\'t mean you have internet access. For example, the user might be connected to a coffee shop\'s WiFi portal but can\'t get to the internet. To check that the internet is accessible you have to try to connect to an actual server. Normally when you want to do this you have a specific server in mind that you want to connect to, so go ahead and check if you can connect to that server. Here\'s a simple method for checking connectivity to a server.The reason for setting the ConnectTimeout is that otherwise it defaults to the TCP timeout which can be many seconds long. Note also that Android won\'t let you run this on your main thread. This method gives you the option for a really fast method (for real time feedback) or a slower method (for one off checks that require reliability)This is covered in android docs\nhttp://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/connectivity-monitoring.htmlI have applied the solution provided by @Levit and created function that will not call the extra Http Request.It will solve the error Unable to Resolve HostNow call it like,Just create the following class which checks for an internet connection:This class simply contains a method which returns the boolean value of the connection status. Therefore in simple terms, if the method finds a valid connection to the Internet, the return value is true, otherwise false if no valid connection is found.The following method in the MainActivity then calls the result from the method previously described, and prompts the user to act accordingly:In the above code, if the result is false, (therefore there is no internet connection, the user is taken to the Android wi-fi panel, where he is prompted to connect to a wi-fi hotspot.Update 29/06/2015\nIf you are using Xamarin.Android and want to check for connectivity, you can use a Nuget package that would give you this functionality on multiple platforms. Good candidates are here and here. \n[End of Update]The Answers above are quite good, but they are all in Java, and almost all of them check for a connectivity. In my case, I needed to have connectivity with a specific type of connection and I am developing on Xamarin.Android. Moreover, I do not pass a reference to my activities Context in the Hardware layer, I use the Application Context. So here is my solution, in case somebody comes here with similar requirements. I have not done full testing though, will update the answer once I am done with my testingI have done it this way.\nA little bit shorter and more readable I guess.Cheers!Saiyanuser this Its so great to have more then one way to code.\nHere is my example.Good luck.
