In PHP you can do amazing/horrendous things like this:Is there any way of doing something like this with Javascript?E.g. if I have a var name = \'the name of the variable\'; can I get a reference to the variable with name name?Since ECMA-/Javascript is all about Objects and Contexts (which, are also somekind of Object), every variable is stored in a such called Variable- (or in case of a Function, Activation Object).So if you create variables like this:In the Global scope (= NO function context), you implicitly write those variables into the Global object (= window in a browser).Those can get accessed by using the "dot" or "bracket" notation:orThis only works for the global object in this particular instance, because the Variable Object of the Global Object is the window object itself. Within the Context of a function, you don\'t have direct access to the Activation Object. For instance:new creates a new instance of a self-defined object (context). Without new the scope of the function would be also global (=window). This example would alert undefined and 1 respectively. If we would replace this.a = 1; this.b = 2 with:Both alert outputs would be undefined. In that scenario, the variables a and b would get stored in the Activation Object from foobar, which we cannot access (of course we could access those directly by calling a and b).eval is one option.you can use the window object to get at it . window[\'myVar\']Window has a reference to all global variables and global functions you are using. Try this...Just don\'t know what a bad answer gets so many votes. It\'s quite easy answer but you make it complex.This is an example : Another example :So, the value "coco" of myVariable becomes a variable coco.Because all the variables in the global scope are properties of the Window object.In Javascript you can use the fact that all properties are key value pairs. jAndy already mentioned this but I don\'t think his answer show how it can be exploited.Usually you are not trying to create a variable to hold a variable name but are trying to generate variable names and then use them. PHP does it with $$var notation but Javascript doesn\'t need to because property keys are interchangeable with array keys.gives 123. Usually you want to construct the variable which is why there is the indirection so you can also do it the other way around.what they mean is no, you can\'t.\nthere is no way to get it done.\nso it was possible you could do something like thishaving a create function just like the one implemented in ECMAScript 5.If you don\'t want to use a global object like window or global (node), you can try something like this:eval() did not work in my tests. But adding new JavaScript code to the DOM tree is possible. So here is a function that adds a new variable:I needed to draw multiple FormData on the fly and object way worked wellThen in my loops whereever i needed to create a form data i usedBetter late than never!When faced with the same problem, I asked myself givenIt follows then that
