With new android API 22 getResources().getDrawable() is now deprecated.\nNow the best approach is to use only getDrawable().What change? You have some options to handle this deprecation the right (and future proof) way, depending on which kind of drawable you are loading:A) drawables with theme attributesYou\'ll obtain a styled Drawable as your Activity theme instructs.\nThis is probably what you need.B) drawables without theme attributesYou\'ll get your unstyled drawable the old way. Please note: ResourcesCompat.getDrawable() is not deprecated!EXTRA) drawables with theme attributes from another themeYou should use the following code from the support library instead:Using this method is equivalent to calling:As of API 21, you should use the getDrawable(int, Theme) method instead of getDrawable(int), as it allows you to fetch a drawable object associated with a particular resource ID for the given screen density/theme. Calling the deprecated getDrawable(int) method is equivalent to calling getDrawable(int, null).Replace this line :\n    getResources().getDrawable(R.drawable.your_drawable)with ResourcesCompat.getDrawable(getResources(), R.drawable.your_drawable, null)EDITResourcesCompat is also deprecated now.
