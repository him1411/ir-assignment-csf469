I have a service like:I would like to test it from the JavaScript console and call the function f1() of the service. How can I do that?So I found out that you can not simply call angular.injector([\'app\']) if there already exists an injector. Because this function tries to create a new injector.Instead you have to call injector = angular.element(document.body).injector()From the retrieved injector you can then get whatever service you like with injector.get(\'ServiceName\')So in one line the command would look like this:More information on that in this answer: Can't retrieve the injector from angular \nAnd even more here: Call Angular JS from legacy code\nFirst of all, a modified version of your service. This returns an object, nothing to new here.Now the way to get this from the console is One of the things you were doing there earlier was to assume that the app.factory returns you the function itself or a new\'ed version of it. Which is not the case. In order to get a constructor you would either have to do This returns an ExampleService constructor which you will next have to do a \'new\' on.Or alternatively,This returns new ExampleService() on injection.@JustGoscha\'s answer is spot on, but that\'s a lot to type when I want access, so I added this to the bottom of my app.js.  Then all I have to type is x = getSrv(\'$http\') to get the http service.It adds it to the global scope but only in debug mode.  I put it inside the @if DEBUG so that I don\'t end up with it in the production code.  I use this method to remove debug code from prouduction builds.
