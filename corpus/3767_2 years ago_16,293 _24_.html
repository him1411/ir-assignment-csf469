I was trying to create a branch from master with the following command,when Git suddenly stopped responding. I suspect the unescaped () must have done something to it. Now, whenever I try to run any Git command, I get the same error:(with the number after git increasing every time I type a command)Can anyone explain what happened? And how do I get back to normal? I\'d love to be able to delete that branch, but Git won\'t work for me.Can anyone explain what happened? [...] I\'d love to be able to delete that branch, but Git won\'t work for me.By runningin zsh, you did not create any branch. Instead, you accidentally defined three shell functions, called git, branch, and SSLOC-201_Implement___str__, which ignore their parameters (if any) and whose body is _of_ProductSearchQuery. You can check for yourself that this is indeed what happened, by invoking the builtin zsh command called functions, which lists all existing shell functions:Unfortunately, although the other two shell functions are not problematic, the shell function called "git" now shadows the bona fide git command!Therefore, you will subsequently get the errorwhenever you attempt to run a Git command, e.g. git log, git status, etc. (assuming, of course, that no command called _of_ProductSearchQuery exists).[...] I get the same error:(with the number after git increasing every time I type a command)That number simply corresponds to the value of HISTCMD, an environment variable that holds[t]he current history event number in an interactive shell, in other words the event number for the command that caused $HISTCMD to be read.See the zsh manual for more details.And how do I get back to normal?Simply delete the problematic shell function (and the other two you created by accident, while you\'re at it):Then everything should be fine.Good question! I refer you to Wumpus W. Wumbley\'s excellent comment below.Yes, as pointed out in the comments, parentheses are valid characters in Git branch names; you just need to quote the name appropriately, e.g.However, the need for quoting such names every single time when used as command-line arguments should convince you to eschew parentheses in reference names. More generally, you should (as much as possible) avoid characters that have a special meaning in shells, to prevent surprises like this one.You should keep your branch names short and sweet anyway. Long descriptions likeSSLOC-201_Implement___str__()_of_ProductSearchQuerybelong in commit messages, not in branch names.
