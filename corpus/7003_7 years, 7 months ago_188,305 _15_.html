What is the size of character in C and C++ ? As far as I know the size of char is 1 byte in both C and C++.In C:In C++:No surprises, both of them gives the output : Size of char : 1Now we know that characters are represented as \'a\',\'b\',\'c\',\'|\',... So I just modified the above codes to these:In C:Output:In C++:Output:Why the sizeof(\'a\') returns different values in C and C++?In C, the type of a character constant like \'a\' is actually an int, with size of 4 (or some other implementation-dependent value). In C++, the type is char, with size of 1. This is one of many small differences between the two languages.As Paul stated, it\'s because \'a\' is an int in C but a char in C++.I cover that specific difference between C and C++ in something I wrote a few years ago, at: http://david.tribble.com/text/cdiffs.htmIn C the type of character literals are int and char in C++. This is in C++ required to support function overloading. See this example:Output:
