I have the following:What I like to do is to make Ral case insensitive, so that it can be RAl, rAl, etc. and still match.Is there a way to say that Ral has to be case-insensitive? Add .toLowerCase() after referrer. This method turns the string in a lower case string. Then, use .indexOf() using ral instead of Ral.The same can also be achieved using a Regular Expression (especially useful when you want to test against dynamic patterns):Another options is to use the search method as follow:It looks more elegant then converting the whole string to lower case and it may be more efficient. \nWith toLowerCase() the code have two pass over the string, one pass is on the entire string to convert it to lower case and another is to look for the desired index.\nWith RegExp the code have one pass over the string which it looks to match the desired index.Therefore, on long strings I recommend to use the RegExp version (I guess that on short strings this efficiency comes on the account of creating the RegExp object though)Use a RegExp:Or, use .toLowerCase():There are a couple of approaches here.If you want to perform a case-insensitive check for just this instance, do something like the following.Alternatively, if you\'re performing this check regularly, you can add a new indexOf()-like method to String, but make it case insensitive.To do a better search use the following code,In the first alert(), JavaScript returned "-1" - in other words, indexOf() did not find a match: this is simply because "JavaScript" is in lowercase in the first string, and properly capitalized in the second. To perform case-insensitive searches with indexOf(), you can make both strings either uppercase or lowercase. This means that, as in the second alert(), JavaScript will only check for the occurrence of the string you are looking for, capitalization ignored.Reference,\nhttp://freewebdesigntutorials.com/javaScriptTutorials/jsStringObject/indexOfMethod.htmIt\'s 2016, and there\'s no clear way of how to do this? I was hoping for some copypasta. I\'ll have a go.Design notes: I wanted to minimize memory usage, and therefore improve speed - so there is no copying/mutating of strings. I assume V8 (and other engines) can optimise this function.My reason for the name:Why not...:Here\'s my take:Script:HTML: Codepen
