I am creating my first Bower component. After running bower init the script asks me \'what types of modules does this package expose?\' with these options:what is the difference between these options?If you don\'t know, it\'s quite likely globals is the right answer for you.Either way, you need to understand:This feature was introduced very recently in bower and is not documented at all yet (AFAIK). It essentially describes the moduleType, which states for what module technology the package is meant to be consumed (see above).Right now, It doesn\'t have any effect apart from setting the moduleType property in the bower.json file of the package.See https://github.com/bower/bower/pull/934 for the original pull-request.A few additional points, to answer comments:What I would do if I were to author a package for a not-listed package manager and publish it on bower?I would author an es6 module, and use / patch es6-transpiler to output the package format I need. Then I would either/and:Disclaimer: I don\'t have real-life experience authoring angularjs modules.I\'m using bower init for first time too.The options should refer to the different ways to modularize some JavaScript code:In my case I wrote a Node.js module dflow but I\'m using browserify to create a dist/dflow.js file that exports a global dflow var: so I selected globals.The command I used to browserify dflow as a window global object was\nbrowserify -s dflow -e index.js -o dist/dflow.js\nI changed it cause I prefer to use require also inside the browser, so now I am using\nbrowserify -r ./index.js:dflow -o dist/dflow.js\nand so I changed the bower.moduleType to node in my bower.json file.The main motivation was that if my module name has a dash, for example my project flow-view, I need to camelize the global name in flowView.This new approach has two other benefits:This is another topic, but, it is really worth that you consider how it is useful the latter benefit: let me share the npm.scripts.browserify attribute I use in my package.json "browserify": "browserify -r ./index.js:${npm_package_name} -o dist/${npm_package_name}.js"Just for reference, this is precisely what bower specifies regarding the module types:The type of module defined in the main JavaScript file. Can be one or an array of the following strings:Relevant link: https://github.com/bower/spec/blob/master/json.md#moduletype
