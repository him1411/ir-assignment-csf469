Should I useorto sort a vector in descending order? Are there any benefits or drawbacks with one approach or the other?Actually, the first one is a bad idea. Use either the second one, or this:That way your code won\'t silently break when someone decides numbers should hold long or long long instead of int.Use the first:It\'s explicit of what\'s going on - less chance of misreading rbegin as begin, even with a comment. It\'s clear and readable which is exactly what you want.Also, the second one may be less efficient than the first given the nature of reverse iterators, although you would have to profile it to be sure.What about this?According to my machine, sorting a long long vector of [1..3000000] using the first method takes around 4 seconds, while using the second takes about twice the time. That says something, obviously, but I don\'t understand why either. Just think this would be helpful.Same thing reported here.As said by Xeo, with -O3 they use about the same time to finish.With c++14 you can do this:Instead of a functor as Mehrdad proposed, you could use a Lambda function.First approach refers:   You may use the first approach because of getting more efficiency than second.\nThe first approach\'s time complexity less than second one.I don\'t think you should use either of the methods in the question as they\'re both confusing, and the second one is fragile as Mehrdad suggests.I would advocate the following, as it looks like a standard library function and makes its intention clear:You can either use the first one or try the code below, which is equally efficient:
