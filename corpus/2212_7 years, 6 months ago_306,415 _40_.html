I need to find which event handlers are registered over an object.For example:$("#el") has click and mouseover registered.Is there a function to find out that, and possibly iterate over the event handlers?If it is not possible on a jQuery object through proper methods, is it possible on a plain DOM object?As of jQuery 1.8, the event data is no longer available from the "public API" for data.  Read this jQuery blog post.  You should now use this instead:elem should be an HTML Element, not a jQuery object, or selector.Please note, that this is an internal, \'private\' structure, and shouldn\'t be modified.  Use this for debugging purposes only.In older versions of jQuery, you might have to use the old method which is:You can do it like this:If you\'re on jQuery 1.4+, this will alert the event and functions bound to it:\xe2\x80\x8bYou can play with it on jsFiddle here\n    \xe2\x80\x8bFor jQuery 1.8+, this will no longer work because the internal data is placed in a different object.The latest unofficial (but works in previous versions as well, at least in 1.7.2) way of doing it now is -\n$._data(element, "events")The underscore ("_") is what makes the difference here. Internally, it is calling $.data(element, name, null, true), the last (fourth) parameter is an internal one ("pvt").Shameless plug, but you can use findHandlerJSTo use it you just have to include findHandlersJS (or just copy&paste the raw javascript code to chrome\'s console window) and specify the event type and a jquery selector for the elements you are interested in.For your example you could quickly find the event handlers you mentioned by doingThis is what gets returned:You can try it hereI use eventbug plugin to firebug for this purpose.I\'ve combined both solutions from @jps to one function:But beware, this function can only return that events that was setted with jQuery itself.As of 1.9 there is no documented way to retrieve the events, other than to use the Migrate plugin to restore the old behavior. You could use the _.data() method as jps mentions, but that is an internal method. So just do the right thing and use the Migrate plugin if you need this functionality.From the jQuery documentation on .data("events")Prior to 1.9, .data("events") could be used to retrieve jQuery\'s\n  undocumented internal event data structure for an element if no other\n  code had defined a data element with the name "events". This special\n  case has been removed in 1.9. There is no public interface to retrieve\n  this internal data structure, and it remains undocumented. However,\n  the jQuery Migrate plugin restores this behavior for code that depends\n  upon it.In a modern browser with ECMAScript 5.1 / Array.prototype.map, you can also usein your browser console, which will print the source of the handlers, comma delimited. Useful for glancing at what all is running on a particular event.Events can be retrieved using:or jQuery 1.8+:Note:\nEvents bounded using $(\'selector\').live(\'event\', handler)\ncan be retrieved using:I have to say many of the answers are interesting, but recently I had a similar problem and the solution was extremely simple by going the DOM way. It is different because you don\'t iterate but aim directly at the event you need, but below I\'ll give a more general answer.I had an image in a row:And that image had a click event handler attached to it:My intention was to expand the clickable area to the whole row, so I first got all images and relative rows:Now in the actual anwer line I just did as follows, giving an answer to the original question:So I fetched the event handler directly from the DOM element and put it into the jQuery click event handler. Works like a charm.Now, to the general case. In the old pre-jQuery days you could get all events attached to an object with two simple yet powerful functions gifted to us mortals by Douglas Crockford:Another way to do it is to just use jQuery to grab the element, then go through actual Javascript to get and set and play with the event handlers. For instance:Try jquery debugger plugin if you\'re using chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jquery-debugger/dbhhnnnpaeobfddmlalhnehgclcmjimi?hl=en
