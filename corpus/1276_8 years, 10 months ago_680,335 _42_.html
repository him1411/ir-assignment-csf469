With jQuery, how do I find out which key was pressed when I bind to the keypress event?I want to trigger a submit when ENTER is pressed.[Update]Even though I found the (or better: one) answer myself, there seems to be some room for variation ;)Is there a difference between keyCode and which - especially if I\'m just looking for ENTER, which will never be a unicode key?Do some browsers provide one property and others provide the other one? Actually this is better:Try thisIf you are using jQuery UI you have translations for common key codes. In ui/ui/ui.core.js:There\'s also some translations in tests/simulate/jquery.simulate.js but I could not find any in the core JS library. Mind you, I merely grep\'ed the sources. Maybe there is some other way to get rid of these magic numbers.You can also make use of String.charCodeAt and .fromCharCode:Given that you are using jQuery, you should absolutely use .which.  Yes different browsers set different properties, but jQuery will normalize them and set the .which value in each case.  See documetation at http://api.jquery.com/keydown/ it states:To determine which key was pressed, we can examine the event object that is passed to the handler function. While browsers use differing properties to store this information, jQuery normalizes the .which property so we can reliably use it to retrieve the key code. ... this example prevents form submission (regularly the basic intention when capturing keystroke #13):edit: This only works for IE...I realize this is an old posting, but someone might find this useful.The key events are mapped, so instead of using the keycode value you can also use the key value to make it a little more readable.Here is a cheat sheet with the mapped keys which I got from this blog\nCheckout the excellent jquery.hotkeys plugin which supports key combinations:Hope this may help you!!!Okay, I was blind:will contain the ASCII code of the key.See https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/Event.whichHere is an at-length description of the behaviour of various browsers http://unixpapa.com/js/key.htmlI\'ll just supplement solution code with this line e.preventDefault();.\nIn case of input field of form we don\'t attend to submit on enter pressedHere\'s a jquery extension that will handle the enter key being pressed.A working example can be found here\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/EnjB3/8/Add hidden submit, not type hidden, just plain submit with style="display:none". Here is an example (removed unnecessary attributes from code).it will accept enter key natively, no need for JavaScript, works in every browser.you should have firbug to see a result in consoleWitch ;)Demo : http://jsfiddle.net/molokoloco/hgXyq/24/Some browsers use keyCode, others use which. If you\'re using jQuery, you can reliably use which as jQuery standardizes things. Actually,According to Kilian\'s answer:If only enter key-press is important:The easiest way that I do is:I have just made a plugin for jQuery that allows easier keypress events. Instead of having to find the number and put it in, all you have to do is this:It\'s that simple. Please note that theKeyYouWantToFireAPressEventFor is not a number, but a string (e.g "a" to fire when A is pressed, "ctrl" to fire when CTRL (control) is pressed, or, in the case of a number, just 1, no quotes. That would fire when 1 is pressed.)Because the long version is so... well... long, I have made a PasteBin link for it:http://pastebin.com/VUaDevz1This is pretty much the complete list of keyCodes:Try this:
