I am storing a SQL query in my strings.xml file and I want to use String.Format to build the final string in code.  The SELECT statement uses a like, something like this:In order to format that I replace \'something\' with %1$s so it becomes:I escape the single quotes with the backslash.  However I am not able to escape the % sign.  How can I include a like statement in my strings.xml file?To escape %, you will need to double it up: %%.To complement the previous stated solution, use:This is a stronger regex replace that won\'t replace %% that are already doubled in the input.I can\'t believe that this isn\'t a simple solved problem by now, but hey, here\'s my stab at itTo sanitise the message before passing it to String.format, you can use the followingNote that this works with any number of formatting characters, so it will replace % with %%, %%% with %%%%, %%%%% with %%%%%% etc.It will leave any already escaped characters alone (e.g. %%, %%%% etc.)
