I was running the following PHP code:There were no parse errors and the output was "?>" (example).In similar cases I do get a parse error:Parse error: syntax error, unexpected \'<\' in ...Why doesn\'t <?php </script> ?> give the same error?This must be because there are various ways of starting a block of PHP code:<? ... ?> (known as short_open_tag)<?php ... ?> (the standard really)<script language="php"> ... </script> (not recommended)<% ... %> (deprecated and removed ASP-style tag after 5.3.0)Apparently, you can open a PHP block one way, and close it the other.

So the parser assumes that all the text after the closing script tag is normal HTML.Read more in Escaping from HTML.
