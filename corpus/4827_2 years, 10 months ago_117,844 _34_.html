In my app "Tide Now WA" which I recently tested for compatibility using\nthe new Nexus 9 tablet (Lollipop - API 21).It writes some button text. This app writes the text correctly using Android 2.3 and Android\n4.0. I.e. mixed capital and lower case letters. When same app is run on my Nexus 9 all the letters\nin the text are capitalized. FWIW my manifest contains the following statement:uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="10" android:targetSdkVersion="14"Can I fix this in my code or is it a bug in the O.S.\nthanksI don\'t have idea why it is happening but there 3 trivial attempts to make:Use android:textAllCaps="false" in your layout-v21Programmatically change the transformation method of the button.  mButton.setTransformationMethod(null);Check your style for AllcapsNote: public void setAllCaps (boolean allCaps) android:textAllCaps are available from API version 14.Here\'s what I did in my values/themes.xmlThis is fixable in the application code by setting the button\'s TransformationMethod, e.g.Set android:textAllCaps="false". If you are using an appcompat style, make sure textAllCaps comes before the style. Otherwise the style will override it. For example:add this line in style \nLollipop default comes with "textAllCaps true", so you have to manually make it to falseAdd android:textAllCaps="false" in <Button> tag that\'s it.There is an easier way which works for all buttons, just change appearance of buttons in your theme, try this:in values-21/styles.xmlPS: it\'s recommended to follow material design\'s principles, you should show capitalized text in Buttons, http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/buttons.htmlIn Android Studio IDE, you have to click the Filter icon to show expert properties. Then you will see the textAllCaps property. Check it, then uncheck it.You could add android:textAllCaps="false" to the button.The button text might be transformed to uppercase by your app\'s theme that applies to all buttons. Check themes / styles files for setting the attribute android:textAllCaps.Using the android.support.v7.widget.AppCompatButton in the XML layout will allow you to avoid having to have a layout-21 or programmatically changing anything. Naturally this will also work with AppCompat v7 library.Hope this helps.OK, just ran into this. Buttons in Lollipop come out all uppercase AND the font resets to \'normal\'. But in my case (Android 5.02) it was working in one layout correctly, but not another!? Changing APIs didn\'t work. Setting to all caps requires min API 14 and the font still resets to \'normal\'. It\'s because the Android Material Styles forces a change to the styles if there isn\'t one defined (that\'s why it worked in one of my layout and not the other because I defined a style). So the easy fix is to define a style in the manifest for each activity which in my case was just:  android:theme="@android:style/Theme.NoTitleBar.Fullscreen" \n(hope this helps someone, would have saved me a couple of hours last night)If you have arrived here because your facebook button text appears in all caps then just add this android:textAllCaps="false" in your xml file. It worked for me.If you use appcompat-v7, you can subclass AppCompatButtonand setSupportAllCaps(false), then use this class for all your buttons.See AppCompatButton#setSupportAllCaps(boolean) Android docs.I do not know why the answer of @user1010160 got rating of 0. I would have given it +1 if I had enough reputations.Since my app is designed for API less than 14 and I did not want to add code to my program I did not find a solution until I read his answer. What he said was that even though you have done what is needed in the Application styles it will not work unless you add a style to your activity and there you set textAllCaps to false.It is not enough to have a style for the activity (my activity had a style), because the style might defaults to the AllCaps property. You have to set explicitly, in the activity too, that property to false.I now have it both in the Application and in the Activity parts of the manifest file.
