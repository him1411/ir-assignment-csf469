Meet Fred. He\'s a table:Fred\'s apartment has a bizarre habit of changing size, so he\'s learned to hide some of his content so as not to push all the other units over and shove Mrs. Whitford\'s living room off into oblivion:This works, but Fred has a nagging feeling that if his right cell (which he\'s nicknamed Celldito) gave up a little space, his left cell wouldn\'t be truncated quite as much of the time. Can you save his sanity?In summary: How can a table\'s cells overflow evenly, and only when they\'ve all given up all their whitespace?http://jsfiddle.net/7CURQ/I believe I have a non-javascript solution! Better late than never, right? After all this is an excellent question and Google is all over it. I didn\'t want to settle for a javascript fix because I find the slight jitter of things moving around after the page is loaded to be unacceptable.Features:How it works: Inside the table cell place two copies of the content in two different elements within a relatively-positioned container element. The spacer element is statically-positioned and as such will affect the width of the table cells. By allowing the contents of the spacer cell to wrap we can get the "best-fit" width of the table cells that we are looking for. This also allows us to use the absolutely-positioned element to restrict the width of the visible content to that of the relatively-positioned parent.Tested and working in: IE8, IE9, IE10, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, OperaResult Images:\nJSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/zAeA2/Sample HTML/CSS:I\'ve been faced the same challenge few days ago. It seems Lucifer Sam found the best solution.But I noticed you should duplicate content at spacer element. Thought it\'s not so bad, but I\'d like also to apply title popup for clipped text. And it means long text will appear third time in my code.Here I propose to access title attribute from :after pseudo-element to generate spacer and keep HTML clean.Works on IE8+, FF, Chrome, Safari, Operahttp://jsfiddle.net/feesler/HQU5J/If Javascript is acceptable, I put together a quick routine which you could use as a starting point.  It dynamically tries to adapt the cell widths using the inner width of a span, in reaction to window resize events.  Currently it assumes that each cell normally gets 50% of the row width, and it will collapse the right cell to keep the left cell at its maximum width to avoid overflowing.  You could implement much more complex width balancing logic, depending on your use cases. Hope this helps:Markup for the row I used for testing:JQuery which hooks up the resize event:There\'s a much easier and more elegant solution.Within the table-cell that you want to apply truncation, simply include a container div with css table-layout: fixed. This container takes the full width of the parent table cell, so it even acts responsive.Make sure to apply truncation to the elements in the table.Works from IE8+and css:here\'s a working Fiddle\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/d0xhz8tb/The problem is the \'table-layout:fixed\' which create evenly-spaced-fixed-width columns. But disabling this css-property will kill the text-overflow because the table will become as large as possible (and than there is noting to overflow).I\'m sorry but in this case Fred can\'t have his cake and eat it to.. unless the landlord gives Celldito less space to work with in the first place, Fred cannot use his..You could try to "weight" certain columns, like this:You can also try some more interesting tweaks, like using 0%-width columns and using some combination of the white-space CSS property.You get the idea.Yep I would say thirtydot has it, there is no way to do it unless you use a js method. You are talking about a complex set of rendering conditions that you will have to define. e.g. what happens when both cells are getting too big for their apartments you will have to decide who has priority or simply just give them a percentage of the area and if they are overfull they will both take up that area and only if one has whitespace will you stretch your legs in the other cell, either way there is no way to do it with css. Although there are some pretty funky things people do with css that I have not thought of. I really doubt you can do this though.Like samplebias answer, again if Javascript is an acceptable answer, I made a jQuery plugin specifically for this purpose: https://github.com/marcogrcr/jquery-tableoverflowTo use the plugin just typeFull example: http://jsfiddle.net/Cw7TD/3/embedded/result/Edits:Use some css hack, it seems the display: table-column; can come to rescue:JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/blai/7u59asyp/Check if "nowrap" solve the issue to an extent. Note: nowrap is not supported in HTML5you can set the width of right cell to minimum of required width, then apply overflow-hidden+text-overflow to the  inside of left cell, but Firefox is buggy here...although, seems, flexbox can helpI\'ve been recently working on it. Check out this jsFiddle test, try it yourself changing the width of the base table to check the behavior).The solution is to embedded a table into another:Is Fred now happy with Celldito\'s expansion?Don\'t know if this will help anyone, but I solved a similar problem by specifying specific width sizes in percentage for each column. Obviously, this would work best if each column has content with width that doesn\'t vary too widely.I had the same issue, but I needed to display multiple lines (where text-overflow: ellipsis; fails). I solve it using a textarea inside a TD and then style it to behave like a table cell.Given that \'table-layout:fixed\' is the essential layout requirement, that this creates evenly spaced non-adjustable columns, but that you need to make cells of different percentage widths, perhaps set the \'colspan\' of your cells to a multiple?For example, using a total width of 100 for easy percentage calculations, and saying that you need one cell of 80% and another of 20%, consider:Of course, for columns of 80% and 20%, you could just set the 100% width cell colspan to 5, the 80% to 4, and the 20% to 1.
