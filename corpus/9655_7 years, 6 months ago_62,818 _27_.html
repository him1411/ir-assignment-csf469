I have a git checkout. All the file permissions are different than what git thinks they should be therefore they all show up as modified.Without touching the content of the files (just want to modify the permissions) how do I set all the files permissions to what git thinks they should be?Git keeps track of filepermission and exposes permission changes when creating patches using git diff -p. So all we need is:As a one-liner:you can also add it as an alias to your git config......and you can invoke it via:Note, if you shell is bash, make sure to use \' instead of " quotes around the !git, otherwise it gets substituted with the last git command you ran.Thx to @Mixologic for pointing out that by simply using -R on git diff, the cumbersome sed command is no longer required.Try git config core.filemode falseFrom the git config man page:core.fileModeIf false, the executable bit differences between the index and the working copy are ignored; useful on broken filesystems like FAT. See git-update-index(1).The default is true, except git-clone(1) or git-init(1) will probe and set core.fileMode false if appropriate when the repository is created.Git doesn\'t store file permissions other than executable scripts. Consider using something like git-cache-meta to save file ownership and permissions.Git can only store two types of modes:  755 (executable) and 644 (not executable).  If your file was 444 git would store it has 644.will work in most cases but if you have external diff tools like meld installed you have to add --no-ext-diffwas needed in my situationThe easiest thing to do is to just change the permissions back.  As @kroger noted git only tracks executable bits.  So you probably just need to run chmod -x filename to fix it (or +x if that\'s what\'s needed.You could also try a pre/post checkout hook might do the trick.See: Customizing Git - Git Hooksgit diff -p used in muhqu\'s answer may not show all discrepancies. This code reads the metadata directly instead:A non-production-grade one-liner (replaces masks entirely):(Credit for "$\'\\0\'" goes to http://transnum.blogspot.ru/2008/11/bashs-read-built-in-supports-0-as.html)The etckeeper tool can handle permissions and with:You can use it for other dirs than /etc.Install by using your package manager or get sources from above link.
