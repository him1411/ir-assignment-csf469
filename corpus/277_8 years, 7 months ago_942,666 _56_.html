Why won\'t vertical-align: middle work?  And yet, vertical-align: top does work.Actually, in this case it\'s quite simple: apply the vertical align to the image. Since it\'s all in one line, it\'s really the image you want aligned, not the text.Tested in FF3.Here are some simple techniques for vertical-align:This one is easy: set the line-height of the text element to equal that of the containerAbsolutely position an inner div relative to its containerIn order to get this to work correctly across the board, you\'ll have to hack the CSS a bit.

The main difference in behavior between vertical-align: middle and top is that the first moves elements relative to the box\'s baseline (which is placed wherever needed to fulfill all vertical alignments and thus feels rather unpredictable) and the second relative to the outer bounds of the line box (which is more tangible).The technique used in the accepted answer works only for single-lined text (demo), but not multi-line text (demo) - as noted there.If anyone needs to vertically center multi-lined text to an image, here are a few ways\n(Methods 1 and 2 inspired by this CSS-tricks article)CSS:CSS:CSS (The above fiddle contains vendor prefixes):This code works in IE as well as FF:Because you have to set the line-height to the height of the div for this to workBasically, you\'ll have to get down to CSS3.For the record, alignment "commands" shouldn\'t work on a SPAN, because it is an in-line tag, not a block-level tag.
