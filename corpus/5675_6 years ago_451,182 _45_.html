Given a transparent PNG displaying a simple shape in white, is it possible to somehow change the color of this through CSS? Some kind of overlay or what not?You can use filters by -webkit-filter and filter:\nFilters are very new to browsers and is only support in very modern browsers.\nYou can change an image to grayscale, sepia and lot more (look at the example). So you can now change color of a PNG file with filters now.SourceYou might want to take a look at Icon fonts. http://css-tricks.com/examples/IconFont/EDIT: I\'m using Font-Awesome on my latest project. You can even bootstrap it. Simply put this in your <head>:And then go ahead and add some icon-links like this:Here\'s the full cheat sheet--edit--Font-Awesome uses different class names in the new version, probably because this makes the CSS files drastically smaller, and to avoid ambiguous css classes.\nSo now you should use:EDIT 2:Just found out github also uses its own icon font: Octicons\nIt\'s free to download. They also have some tips on how to create your very own icon fonts.The img tag has a background property just like any other. If you have a white PNG with a transparent shape, like a stencil, then you can do this:Yes :)WebKit now supports alpha masks in CSS. Masks allow you to overlay the content of a box with a pattern that can be used to knock out portions of that box in the final display. In other words, you can clip to complex shapes based off the alpha of an image.\n  [...]\n  We have introduced new properties to provide Web designers with a lot of control over these masks and how they are applied. The new properties are analogous to the background and border-image properties that already exist.In most browsers, you can use filters :on both <img> elements and background images of other elementsand set them either statically in your CSS, or dynamically using JavaScriptSee demos below.You can apply this technique to a <img> element :You can apply this technique to a background image :You can use JavaScript to set a filter at runtime :Think I have a solution for this that\'s a) exactly what you were looking for 5 years ago, and b) is a bit simpler than the other code options here.With any white png (eg, white icon on transparent background), you can add an ::after selector to recolor.See this codepen (applying the color swap on hover): http://codepen.io/chrscblls/pen/bwAXZOI\'ve been able to do this using SVG filter. You can write a filter that multiplies the color of source image with the color you want to change to. In the code snippet below, flood-color is the color we want to change image color to (which is Red in this case.) feComposite tells the filter how we\'re processing the color. The formula for feComposite with arithmetic is (k1*i1*i2 + k2*i1 + k3*i2 + k4) where i1 and i2 are input colors for in/in2 accordingly. So specifying only k1=1 means it will do just i1*i2, which means multiplying both input colors together.Note: This only works with HTML5 since this is using inline SVG. But I think you might be able to make this work with older browser by putting SVG in a separate file. I haven\'t tried that approach yet.Here\'s the snippet:\nThere\'s no need for a whole font set if you only need one icon, plus I feel it being more "clean" as an individual element. So, for this purpose, in HTML5 you can place a SVG directly inside the document flow. Then you can define a class in your .CSS stylesheet and access its background color with the fill property:Working fiddle:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/qmsj0ez1/Note that, in the example, I\'ve used :hoverto illustrate the behaviour; if you just want to change color for the "normal" state, you should remove the pseudoclass.I required a specific colour, so filter didn\'t work for me.Instead, I created a div, exploiting CSS multiple background images and the linear-gradient function (which creates an image itself). If you use the overlay blend mode, your actual image will be blended with the generated "gradient" image containing your desired colour (here, #BADA55)Answering because I was looking for a solution for this.the pen in @chrscblls answer works well if you have a white or black background, but mine wasn\'t. Aslo, the images were generated with ng-repeat, so I couldn\'t have their url in my css AND you can\'t use ::after on img tags.So, I figured a work around and thought it might help people if they too stumble here.So what I did is pretty much the same with three main differences:To change it from black to white or white to black the background color need to be white. \nFrom black to colors, you can choose whatever color.\nFrom white to colors tho, you\'ll need to choose the opposite color of the one you want.https://codepen.io/spaceplant/pen/oZyMYGTo literally change the color, you could incorporate a CSS transition with a -webkit-filter where when something happens you would invoke the -webkit-filter of your choice. For example:
