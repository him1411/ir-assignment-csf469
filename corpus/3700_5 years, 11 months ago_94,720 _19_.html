Does Go have anything similar to the python\'s multiline strings: If not, what is the preferred way of writing strings spanning multiple lines?According to the language specification you can use a raw string literal, where the string is delimited by backticks instead of double quotes.You can write :Which is the same as Unlike using backquotes it will preserve escape characters. Note that the "+" must be on the \'leading\' line iegenerates an errorFrom String literals:But, if your multi-line string has to include a backquote (`), then you will have to use an interpreted string literal:You cannot directly put a backquote (`) in a raw string literal (``xx\\).\nYou have to use (as explained in "how to put a backquote in a backquoted string?"):Use raw string literals for multi-line strings:Raw string literals are character sequences between back quotes, as in foo. Within the quotes, any character may appear except back quote.A significant part is that is raw literal not just multi-line and to be multi-line is not the only purpose of it.The value of a raw string literal is the string composed of the uninterpreted (implicitly UTF-8-encoded) characters between the quotes; in particular, backslashes have no special meaning...So escapes will not be interpreted and new lines between ticks will be real new lines.Possibly you have long line which you want to break and you don\'t need new lines in it. Than you could use string concatenation.Since " " is interpreted string literal escapes will be interpreted.You can put content with `` around it, like You have to be very careful on formatting and line spacing in go, everything counts and here is a working sample, try it https://play.golang.org/p/c0zeXKYlmF
