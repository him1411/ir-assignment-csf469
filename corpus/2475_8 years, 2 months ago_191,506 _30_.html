I would think the following piece of code should work, but it doesn\'t (Edited: Now works in PHP 5.5+):Where getError() is simply:Yet I end up with this error:can\'t use method return value in write contextWhat does this mean? Isn\'t this just a read?empty() needs to access the value by reference (in order to check whether that reference points to something that exists), and PHP before 5.5 didn\'t support references to temporary values returned from functions.However, the real problem you have is that you use empty() at all, mistakenly believing that "empty" value is any different from "false".Empty is just an alias for !isset($thing) || !$thing. When the thing you\'re checking always exists (in PHP results of function calls always exist), the empty() function is nothing but a negation operator.PHP doesn\'t have concept of emptyness. Values that evaluate to false are empty, values that evaluate to true are non-empty. It\'s the same thing. This code:and this:has always the same result, in all cases, for all datatypes (because $x is defined empty() is redundant).Return value from the method always exists (even if you don\'t have return statement, return value exists and contains null). Therefore:is logically equivalent to:Note: This is a very high voted answer with a high visibility, but please note that it promotes bad, unnecessary coding practices! See @Kornel\'s answer for the correct way.Note #2: I endorse the suggestions to use @Kornel\'s answer. When I wrote this answer three years ago, I merely meant to explain the nature of the error, not necessarily endorse the alternative.  The code snippet below is not recommended.It\'s a limitation of empty() in PHP versions below 5.5.Note: empty() only checks variables as\n  anything else will result in a parse\n  error. In other words, the following\n  will not work: empty(trim($name)).You\'d have to change to thisAccording to the PHP docs:empty() only checks variables as anything else will result in a parse errorYou cannot use empty() directly on a function\'s return value.  Instead, set the return from getError() to a variable and run empty() on the variable.I usually create a global function called is_empty() just to get around this issueThen anywhere I would normally have used empty() I just use is_empty()As pointed out by others, it\'s a (weird) limitation of empty(). For most purproses, doing this is equal as calling empty, but this works:The issue is this, you want to know if the error is not empty.Adding a method isErrorSet() will solve the problem.Now this will work fine with this code with no notice.The alternative way to check if an array is empty could be:It works for me without that error
