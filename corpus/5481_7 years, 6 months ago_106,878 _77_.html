I created a new local Git repository:Is there any git command to create a new remote repo and push my commit to GitHub from here? I know it\'s no big deal to just fire up a browser and head over to Create a New Repository, but if there is a way to achieve this from the CLI I would be happy.I read a vast amount of articles but none that I found mention how to create a remote repo from the CLI using git commands. Tim Lucas\'s nice article Setting up a new remote git repository is the closest I found, but GitHub does not provide shell access.You can create a GitHub repo via the command line using the GitHub API. Check out the repository API. If you scroll down about a third of the way, you\'ll see a section entitled "Create" that explains how to create a repo via the API (right above that is a section that explains how to fork a repo with the API, too). Obviously you can\'t use git to do this, but you can do it via the command line with a tool like curl.Outside of the API, there\'s no way to create a repo on GitHub via the command line. As you noted, GitHub doesn\'t allow shell access, etc., so aside from the GitHub API, the only way to create a repo is through GitHub\'s web interface.CLI commands for github API v3 (replace all CAPS keywords):This can be done with three commands:(updated for v3 Github API)If you install defunkt\'s excellent Hub tool, then this becomes as easy asgit createIn the words of the author, "hub is a command-line wrapper for git that makes you better at GitHub."There is an official github gem which, I think, does this. I\'ll try to add more information as I learn, but I\'m only just now discovering this gem, so I don\'t know much yet.UPDATE: After setting my API key, I am able to create a new repo on github via the create command, however I am not able to use the create-from-local command, which is supposed to take the current local repo and make a corresponding remote out on github.If anyone has some insight on this, I\'d love to know what I\'m doing wrong. There\'s already an issue filed.UPDATE: I did eventually get this to work. I\'m not exactly sure how to re-produce the issue, but I just started from scratch (deleted the .git folder)Now this line will create the remote repo and even push to it, but unfortunately I don\'t think I can specify the name of the repo I\'d like. I wanted it to be called "dotfiles" out on github, but the gh gem just used the name of the current folder, which was "jason" since I was in my home folder. (I added a ticket asking for the desired behavior)This command, on the other hand, does accept an argument to specify the name of the remote repo, but it\'s intended for starting a new project from scratch, i.e. after you call this command, you get a new remote repo that\'s tracking a local repo in a newly-created subfolder relative to your current position, both with the name specified as the argument.Simple steps (using git + hub => GitHub):Install Hub (GitHub).otherwise (having Go as well):Go to your repo or create empty one: mkdir foo && cd foo && git init.Run: hub create, it\'ll ask you about GitHub credentials for the first time.Usage: hub create [-p] [-d DESCRIPTION] [-h HOMEPAGE] [NAME]Example: hub create -d Description -h example.com org_name/foo_repoHub will prompt for GitHub username & password the first time it needs to access the API and exchange it for an OAuth token, which it saves in ~/.config/hub.To explicitly name the new repository, pass in NAME,\n  optionally in ORGANIZATION/NAME form to create under an organization\n  you\'re a member of.With -p, create a private repository, and with\n  -d and -h set the repository\'s description and homepage URL, respectively.To avoid being prompted, use GITHUB_USER and GITHUB_PASSWORD environment variables.Then commit and push as usual or check hub commit/hub push.For more help, run: hub help.See also: Importing a Git repository using the command line at GitHub.It is cumbersome to type the complete code every time a repository is to be created\ncurl -u \'USER\' https://api.github.com/user/repos -d \'{"name":"REPO"}\'\ngit remote add origin git@github.com:USER/REPO.git\ngit push origin master\nAn easier approach is:N.B. Here $1 is the repository name that is passed as an argument when invoking the script\nChange YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME before saving the script.Set required permissions to the script file\n\nchmod 755 githubscript.sh\nInclude the scripts directory in the environment configuration file.\n\nnano ~/.profile;\nexport PATH="$PATH:$HOME/Desktop/my_scripts"\nAlso set an alias to run the githubscript.sh file.\n\nnano ~/.bashrc;\nalias githubrepo="bash githubscript.sh"\nNow reload the .bashrc and .profile files in the terminal.\n\nsource ~/.bashrc ~/.profile;\nNow to create a new repository i.e. demo:\n\ngithubrepo demo;\nI wrote a nifty script for this called Gitter using the REST APIs for GitHub and BitBucket: https://github.com/dderiso/gitterBitBucket: GitHub: I\'ve created a Git alias to do this, based on Bennedich\'s answer. Add the following to your ~/.gitconfig:To use it, runfrom anywhere inside the local repository, and enter your Github password when prompted.For users with two-factor authentication, you can use bennedich\'s solution, but you just need to add the X-Github-OTP header for the first command. Replace CODE with the code that you get from the two-factor authentication provider. Replace USER and REPO with the username and name of the repository, as you would in his solution.Based on the other answer by @Mechanical Snail, except without the use of python, which I found to be wildly overkill. Add this to your ~/.gitconfig:For directions on creating a token, go here This is the command you will type (as of the date of this answer. (replace all CAPS keywords):Once you enter your password you will see the following which contains your token. You can revoke your token anytime by going hereWhat you need is hub. Hub is a command-line wrapper for git. It has been made to integrate with native git using alias. It tries to provide github actions into git including creating new repository.For Rubyists:enter username and pw as promptedSource: Elikem Adadevoh For rep reasons, I can\'t add this as a comment (where it would better go with bennedich\'s answer), but for Windows command line, here is the correct syntax:curl -u YOUR_USERNAME https://api.github.com/user/repos -d "{\\"name\\":\\"YOUR_REPO_NAME\\"}"It\'s the same basic form, but you have to use double quotes (") instead of single, and escape the double quotes sent in the POST parameters (after the -d flag) with backslashes.  I also removed the single quotes around my username, but if your username had a space (possible?) it would probably need double quotes.For all the Python 2.7.* users. There is a Python wrapper around the Github API that is currently on Version 3, called GitPython. Simply install using easy_install PyGithub or pip install PyGithub.The Repository object docs are here.Nope, you have to open a browser atleast once to create your username on GitHub, once created, you can leverage GitHub API to create repositories from command line, following below command:For example:Found this solution which I liked: https://medium.com/@jakehasler/how-to-create-a-remote-git-repo-from-the-command-line-2d6857f49564You first need to create a Github Personal Access TokenOpen up your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc in your favorite text editor. Add the following line near the top of your file, where the rest of the export \xe2\x80\x98ed variables are:export GITHUB_API_TOKEN=<your-token-here>Somewhere below, by your other bash functions, you can paste something similar to the following:Now, whenever you\xe2\x80\x99re creating a new project, you can run the command $ new-git awesome-repo to create a new public remote repository on your Github user account.here is my initial git commands (possibly, this action takes place in C:/Documents and Settings/your_username/):I recently found out about create-github-repo.
