I need to run web.exe file from my developer command prompt in Visual Studio 2013. By default, the command prompt is not installed in Visual Studio 2013.Previously, I was using Visual Studio 2012. It had developer command prompt installed by default.Does anyone know why VS2013 doesn\'t have developer command prompt by default? How can I setup developer command prompt for VS2013?From VS2013 Menu Select "Tools", then Select "External Tools". Enter as below:Click OK.\nNow you have command prompt access under the Tools Menu.For some reason, it doesn\'t properly add an icon when running Windows 8+. Here\'s how I solved it:Using Windows Explorer, navigate to:In that folder, you\'ll see a shortcut named Visual Studio Tools that maps to (assuming default installation):Double-click the shortcut (or go to the folder above).From that folder, copy the shortcut named Developer Command Prompt for VS2013 (and any others you find useful) to the first directory (for the Start Menu). You\'ll likely be prompted for administrative access (do so). Once you\'ve done that, you\'ll now have an icon available for the 2013 command prompt.I used a modified version of this answer - based on my experiences adding it to VS 2010:Now you have command prompt access under the Tools Menu.See also: Add command prompt to Visual C# Express 2010You can simply go to Menu > All Programs > Visual Studio 2013. Select the folder link "Visual Studio Tools". This will open the folder. There is bunch of shortcuts for command prompt which you can use. They worked perfectly for me.I think the trick here might be there are different versions for different processors, hence they put them all together.I don\'t know if this changed recently -- the answer given by Samuel did not apply to me even though that link seemed authoritative.A couple of things1) For some reason, the folder in the start menu is called Visual Studio 2013, and not Microsoft Visual Studio 2013.  Using the win8 apps interface you might see the 2010 entry Microsoft Visual Studio 2010, and since you don\'t see the new 2013 folder Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 next to it, you assume it isn\'t there.   But it is..  Just a few page scrolls away..2) It seems the Windows 8 (or 8.1 at least) cannot display sub-folders.   I tried creating a folder underneath the Visual Studio 2013 folder with shortcuts, and the entire folder just didn\'t show.3) Which is why what is installed is a shortcut.  Not sure what the windows 7 behavior is with a shortcut in the start menu, but the apps menu just displays it like a folder.  When you click on it, it brings you to the so-called missing shortcuts in explorer.Final solution:  under C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs, create a new folder called Microsoft Visual Studio 2013.  Copy the shortcuts from C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\\Common7\\Tools\\Shortcuts to that new folder.  Then you\'ll have your icons using the windows 8 app interface under the heading which is the new folder name.You\'ll also be able to just start typing from the start screen VS2013, and the icons will now show up.Since any solution given so far will open the command prompt on the project folder, you would still have to navigate to the project\'s folder. If you are interested in getting the command prompt directly into the project\'s folder, here is my 2 steps:Et voila! Hope that helpsVisual studio command prompt is nothing but the regular command prompt where few environment variables are set by default. This variables are set in the batch script : C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\\Common7\\Tools\\VsDevCmd.bat . So basically to get a visual studio command prompt for a particular version, just open regular command prompt and run this batch script : C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\\Common7\\Tools\\VsDevCmd.bat (Change the visual studio version based on your installed version). Voila you have got the visual studio command prompt. You can write a script to run the batch file and open cmd.exe.Works with VS 2017\nI did installed Visual Studio Command Prompt (devCmd) extension tool.\nYou can download it here: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ShemeerNS.VisualStudioCommandPromptdevCmd#review-details Double click on the file, make sure IDE is closed during installation. Open visual studio and Run Developer Command Prompt from VS2017I\'m using VS 2012, so I navigated to "C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Microsoft Visual Studio 2012\\Visual Studio Tools" and ran as administrator this "Developer Command Prompt for VS2012" shortcut. In command shell I pasted the suggested  aspnet_regiis -iand as I suspected this did not yield any success on Windows 10:\nSo all I needed to do was "Turn Windows Features On/Off" at Control Panel and restart my machine to effect the changes. That did resolve the issue. Thanks.
