I need files to be downloaded to /tmp/cron_test/. My wget code isSo is there some parameter to specify the directory?From the manual page:So you need to add -P /tmp/cron_test/ to your command.-O is the option to specify the path of the file you want to download to.-P is prefix where it will download the file in the directoryMake sure you have the url correct for whatever you are downloading first of all, urls with characters like \'?\' and such cannot be parsed and resolved, this will confuse the cmd line and accept any characters that arent resolved into the source url name as the file name you are downloading into. i.e, wget "sourceforge.net/projects/ebosse/files/latest/download?source=typ_redirect" will download into a file named ?source=typ_redirect.As you can see knowing a thing or two about urls helps to understand wget.I am booting from a hirens disk and only had Linux 2.6.1 as a resource (import os is unavailable). The correct syntax that solved my problem, downloading an iso onto the physical hard drive, was: one could figure the correct url by finding at what point wget downloads into a file named "index.html" (the default file) ,and has the correct size/other attributes of the file you need shown by the following command:once that url and source file is correct and it is downloading into index.html, you can stop the download (ctrl + z) and change the output file by using \n-O "<specified download directory>/filename.extension" after the source url.In my case this results in downloading an iso and storing it as a binary file under isofile.iso, which hopefully mounts.try this method -
