Let\'s suppose if we have a class likeNow I have a list of this class: List<Person> persons;Now this list can have multiple instances with same PersonIDs, for example: Is there a way I can group by personID and get the list of all the cars he has? For example, expected result would be So after grouping, I would get: From what I have done so far: Could someone please point me in the right direction? Absolutely - you basically want:Or as a non-query expression:Basically the contents of the group (when view as an IEnumerable<T>) is a sequence of whatever values were in the projection (p.car in this case) present for the given key.For more on how GroupBy works, see my Edulinq post on the topic.(I\'ve renamed PersonID to PersonId in the above, to follow .NET naming conventions.)Alternatively, you could use a Lookup:You can then get the cars for each person very easily:You can also Try this.tryor to check if any person is repeating in your list tryTry this :But performance-wise the following practice is better and more optimized in memory usage (when our array contains much more items like millions):
