If I defined an object in JS with:How can I convert the object to JSON? The output string should be:All current browsers have native JSON support built in. So as long as you\'re not dealing with prehistoric browsers like IE6/7 you can do it just as easily as that:With JSON.stringify() found in json2.js or native in most modern browsers.Check out updated/better way:Update May 17, 2008: Small sanitizer\n  added to the toObject-method. Now\n  toObject() will not eval() the string\n  if it finds any malicious code in\n  it.For even more security: Don\'t set\n  the includeFunctions flag to true.Douglas Crockford, father of the JSON concept, wrote one of the first stringifiers for JavaScript. Later Steve Yen at Trim Path wrote a nice improved version which I have used for some time. It\'s my changes to Steve\'s version that I\'d like to share with you. Basically they stemmed from my wish to make the stringifier:Json Stringify can convert your js object to jsonYou can use JSON.stringify() method to convert JSON object to String.For reverse process, you can use JSON.parse() method to convert JSON String to JSON Object.If you\'re using AngularJS, the \'json\' filter should do it:In angularJS obj:\nInput to be serialized into JSON.pretty(optional):\nIf set to true, the JSON output will contain newlines and whitespace. If set to an integer, the JSON output will contain that many spaces per indentation.(default: 2)JSON.stringify(j,null,4) would give you beautified JSON in case you need beautification alsoI was having issues with stringify running out of memory and other solutions didnt seem to work (at least I couldn\'t get them to work) which is when I stumbled on this thread. Thanks to Rohit Kumar I just iterate through my very large JSON object to stop it from crashingMyObjectStringify  would give you your string representaion (just as mentioned other times in this thread) except if you have a large object, this should also work - just make sure you build it to fit your needs - I needed it to have a name than arrayJSON.stringify turns a Javascript object into JSON text and stores that JSON text in a string.The conversion is an Object to StringJSON.parse turns a string of JSON text into a Javascript object.The conversion is a String to Objectto make it a JSON String following could be used.For more info you can refer to this link below.https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringifyOne custom defined for this , until we do strange from stringify methodOUTPUTLIVE http://jsfiddle.net/mailmerohit5/y78zum6v/Woking... Easy to useThanksJust Copy and paseyou can use native stringify function like thisif you want to get json properties value in string format use the following way if you have a json string and it\'s not wrapped with [] then wrap it up firstOR
