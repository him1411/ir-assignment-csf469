I can see these definitions in the Swift library:What\'s the difference between a member function defined as static func and another one defined as class func? Is it simply that static is for static functions of structs and enums, and class for classes and protocols? Are there any other differences that one should know about? What is the rationale for having this distinction in the syntax itself?That\'s the main difference. Some other differences are that class functions are dynamically dispatched and can be overridden by subclasses.Protocols use the class keyword, but it doesn\'t exclude structs from implementing the protocol, they just use static instead. Class was chosen for protocols so there wouldn\'t have to be a third keyword to represent static or class.From Chris Lattner on this topic:We considered unifying the syntax (e.g. using "type" as the keyword), but that doesn\'t actually simply things.  The keywords "class" and "static" are good for familiarity and are quite descriptive (once you understand how + methods work), and open the door for potentially adding truly static methods to classes.  The primary weirdness of this model is that protocols have to pick a keyword (and we chose "class"), but on balance it is the right tradeoff.And here\'s a snippet that shows some of the override behavior of class functions:To be clearer, I make an example here,static is same as class finalBecause it is final, we can not override it in subclass as below:To declare a type variable property, mark the declaration with the static declaration modifier. Classes may mark type computed properties with the class declaration modifier instead to allow subclasses to override the superclass\xe2\x80\x99s implementation. Type properties are discussed in Type Properties.NOTE\n    In a class declaration, the keyword static has the same effect as marking the declaration with both the class and final declaration modifiers.Source: The Swift Programming Language - Type Variable PropertiesI did some experiments in playground and got some conclusions.TL;DR\nAs you can see, in the case of class, the use of class func or static func is just a question of habit.Playground example with explanation:From Swift2.0, Apple says:"Always prefix type property requirements with the static keyword when you define them in a protocol. This rule pertains even though type property requirements can be prefixed with the class or static keyword when implemented by a class:"According to the Swift 2.2 Book published by apple:\xe2\x80\x9cYou indicate type methods by writing the static keyword before the method\xe2\x80\x99s func keyword. Classes may also use the class keyword to allow subclasses to override the superclass\xe2\x80\x99s implementation of that method.\xe2\x80\x9dthe main difference is that structs are value types and classes are reference types.When you make a copy of a value type, it copies all the data from the thing you are copying into the new variable. They are 2 seperate things and changing one does not affect the otherWhen you make a copy of a reference type, the new variable refers to the same memory location as the thing you are copying. This means that changing one will change the other since they both refer to the same memory location
