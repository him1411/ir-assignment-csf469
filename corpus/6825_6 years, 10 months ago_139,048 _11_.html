How can I use ORDER BY descending in a SQLAlchemy query like the following?This query works, but returns them in ascending order:If I try:then I get: NameError: global name \'desc\' is not defined.Just as an FYI, you can also specify those things as column attributes. For instance, I might have done:This is handy since you can use it on other places such as in a relation definition, etc.Usage from @jpmc26One other thing you might do is:This will result in: ORDER BY name desc. The disadvantage here is the explicit column name used in order by.You can do use .desc() function in your query just like thisThis will order by amount in descending order
