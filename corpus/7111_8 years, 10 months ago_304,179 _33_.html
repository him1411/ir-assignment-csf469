I am trying to convert a date with individual parts such as 12, 1, 2007 into a datetime in SQL Server 2005. I have tried the following:but this results in the wrong date. What is the correct way to turn the three date values into a proper datetime format.Assuming y, m, d are all int, how about:Please see my other answer for SQL Server 2012 and aboveTry this:It works as well, has added benefit of not doing any string conversions, so it\'s pure arithmetic processing (very fast) and it\'s not dependent on any date format\nThis capitalizes on the fact that SQL Server\'s internal representation for datetime and smalldatetime values is a two part value the first part of which is an integer representing the number of days since 1 Jan 1900, and the second part is a decimal fraction representing the fractional portion of one day (for the time) --- So the integer value 0 (zero) always translates directly into Midnight morning of 1 Jan 1900... or, thanks to suggestion from @brinary,Edited October 2014. As Noted by @cade Roux, SQL 2012 now has a built-in function:\nDATEFROMPARTS(year, month, day)\nthat does the same thing.Edited 3 Oct 2016, (Thanks to @bambams for noticing this, and @brinary for fixing it), The last solution, proposed by @brinary. does not appear to work for leap years unless years addition is performed first SQL Server 2012 has a wonderful and long-awaited new DATEFROMPARTS function (which will raise an error if the date is invalid - my main objection to a DATEADD-based solution to this problem):http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh213228.aspxorOr using just a single dateadd function:Sql Server 2012 has a function that will create the date based on the parts (DATEFROMPARTS). For the rest of us, here is a db function I created that will determine the date from the parts (thanks @Charles)...You can call it like this...Returns...Try CONVERT instead of CAST.CONVERT allows a third parameter indicating the date format.List of formats is here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms187928.aspxUpdate after another answer has been selected as the "correct" answer:I don\'t really understand why an answer is selected that clearly depends on the NLS settings on your server, without indicating this restriction.It is safer and neater to use an explicit starting point \'19000101\'You can also use Works in SQL since ver.2012 and AzureSQLIf you don\'t want to keep strings out of it, this works as well (Put it into a function):I add a one-line solution if you need a datetime from both date and time parts:Try For SQL Server versions below 12 i can recommend use of CAST in combination with SET DATEFORMAThow you create those strings is up to youTry this query:Result:I personally Prefer Substring as it provide cleansing options and ability to split the string as needed. The assumption is that the data is of the format \'dd, mm, yyyy\'.Here is a demonstration of how it can be sued if the data is stored in a column. Needless to say, its ideal to check the result-set before applying to the column
