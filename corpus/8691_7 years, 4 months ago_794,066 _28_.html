I have the following code:Those two appends are not compiling. How would that work correctly?The size of an array can\'t be modified. If you want a bigger array you have to instantiate a new one.A better solution would be to use an ArrayList which can grow as you need it. The method ArrayList.toArray( T[] a ) gives you back your array if you need it in this form.If you need to convert it to a simple array...But most things you do with an array you can do with this ArrayList, too:Use a List<String>, such as an ArrayList<String>. It\'s dynamically growable, unlike arrays (see: Effective Java 2nd Edition, Item 25: Prefer lists to arrays).If you insist on using arrays, you can use java.util.Arrays.copyOf to allocate a bigger array to accomodate the additional element. This is really not the best solution, though.This is O(N) per append. ArrayList, on the other hand, has O(1) amortized cost per operation.There is another option which i haven\'t seen here and which doesn\'t involve "complex" Objects or Collections.There is no method append() on arrays.  Instead as already suggested a List object can service the need for dynamically inserting elements eg.Or if you are really keen to use an array:but then this is a fixed size and no elements can be added.As tangens said, the size of an array is fixed. But you have to instantiate it first, else it will be only a null reference.This array can contain only 10 elements. So you can append a value only 10 times. In your code you\'re accessing a null reference. That\'s why it doesnt work. In order to have a \ndynamically growing collection, use the ArrayList.You need to use a Collection List.  You cannot re-dimension an array.Adding new items to String array.I\'m not that experienced in Java but I have always been told that arrays are static structures that have a predefined size. \nYou have to use an ArrayList or a Vector or any other dynamic structure.If you would like to store your data in simple array like this and you want to add some elements to it like numbers please us StringBuilder which is much more efficient than concatenating string.This is much better method to build your string and store it into your \'where\' array.you can create a arraylist, and use Collection.addAll() to convert the string array to your arraylistSize of array cannot be modified. If you have to use an array, you can use System.arraycopy(src, srcpos, dest, destpos, length); You can simply do this:Apache Commons Lang hasit returns a new array, but if you\'re really working with arrays for some reason, this may be the ideal way to do this.I\'ve made this code! It works like a charm!I hope you like it!!
