All of a sudden I keep getting a MetadataException on instantiating my generated ObjectContext class. The connection string in App.Config looks correct - hasn\'t changed since last it worked - and I\'ve tried regenerating a new model (edmx-file) from the underlying database with no change.Anyone have any ideas?Further details: I haven\'t changed any properties, I haven\'t changed the name of any output assemblies, I haven\'t tried to embed the EDMX in the assembly. I\'ve merely waited 10 hours from leaving work until I got back. And then it wasn\'t working anymore.I\'ve tried recreating the EDMX. I\'ve tried recreating the project. I\'ve even tried recreating the database, from scratch. No luck, whatsoever.This means that the application is unable to load the EDMX. There are several things which can cause this.In short, there is not really enough detail in your question to give an accurate answer, but hopefully these ideas should get you on the right track.Update: I\'ve written a blog post with more complete steps for troubleshooting.This little change help with this problem.I have Solution with 3 project.change toYou can get this exception when the Edmx is in one project and you are using it from another.  The reason is Res://*/ is a uri which points to resources in the CURRENT assembly.  If the Edm is defined in a different assembly from the code which is using it, res://*/ is not going to work because the resource cannot be found.  Instead of specifying \xe2\x80\x98*\xe2\x80\x99, you need to provide the full name of the assembly instead (including public key token).  Eg:A better way to construct connection strings is with EntityConnectionStringBuilder:If you still encounter the exception, open the assembly in reflector and check the filenames for your .csdl, .ssdl and .msl files.  When the resources have different names to the ones specified in the metadata value, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to work.I had a similar error.  I had recreated the project (long story), and pulled everything over from the old project.  I hadn\'t realized that my model had been in a directory called \'Model\' before, and was now in a directory called \'Models\'.  Once I changed the connection in my Web.Config from this:to this:Everything worked (changed Model to Models).  Note that I had to change this three places in this string. And a quick way to check the model name without Reflector.... look for the directory...obj/{config output}/edmxResourcesToEmbedand check that the .csdl, .msl, and .ssdl resource files are there. If they are in a sub-directory, the name of the sub-directory must be prepended to the model name.For example, my three resource files are in a sub-directory Data, so my connection string had to bemetadata=res://*/Data.MyModel.csdl|res://*/Data.MyModel.ssdl|res://*/Data.MyModel.msl;(versus metadata=res://*/MyModel.csdl|res://*/MyModel.ssdl|res://*/MyModel.msl;).I also had this problem and it was because the connectionstring in my web.config was slightly different than the one in the app.config of the assembly where my EDMX is located. No idea why it changed, but here are the two different versions.App.config:Web.config:What fixed it was simply copying the app.config string (notice the small difference at the end - instead of "App=EntityFramework" it wanted "application name=EntityFramework") into the web.config and problem was solved. :)This happened to me when I accidentally switched the Build Action of the edmx file (appears under Properties in the IDE) from \'EntityDeploy\' to \'None\'. EntityDeploy is what populates the metadata for you: see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc982037.aspxI\'ve just spent a happy 30 minutes with this. I\'d renamed the entities object, renamed the entry in the config file, but there\'s more  ... you have to change the reference to the csdl as wellvery easy to miss - if you\'re renaming, make sure you get everything ....I was able to resolve this in Visual Studio 2010, VB.net (ASP.NET) 4.0.During the entity model wizard, you will be able to see the entity connection string. From there you can copy and paste into your connection string.The only thing I was missing was the "App_Code." in the connections string.I had the same problem. I looked into my complied dll with reflector and have seen that the name of the resource was not right. I renamed and it looks fine now.For my case, it is solved by changing the properties of edmx file.this solved the problem for me.\nThe problem is, when the container try to find the meta data, it cant find it. so simply make it in the same assembly.\nthis solution will not work if you have your edmx files in another assemblyI spent a whole day on this errorif you are working with n-tear architecture or you tried to separate Models generated by EDMX form DataAccessLayer to DomainModelLayer maybe you will get this error Second which is Very important the connection string which is the problem from where on earth I got Modelor whatever .csdl in my connection string where are theyhere I our solution look at the picture hope the help you The ultimate solution (even after recreating the database on two other machines, as well as the EDMX and other sundries) was to not use the first edition of Entity Framework. Looking forward to evaluating it again in .NET 4.0.After running into the same problem again and searching all over for an answer, I finally found someone who\'d had the same problem. It appears that the connection string wasn\'t correctly generated by Visual Studio\'s wizard, and the link to the metadata resources was missing an important path.v1.0 BUG?: Unable to load the specified metadata resource. Scripts != ModelsUpdate 2013-01-16: Having transitioned to almost exclusively using EF Code First practices (even with existing databases) this problem is no longer an issue. For me, that was a viable solution to reducing the clutter from auto-generated code and configuration and increasing my own control over the product.My issue and solution, the symptoms were the same "Unable to load the specified metadata resource" but the root cause was different.  I had 2 projects in solution one was the EntityModel and the other the solution.  I actually deleted and recreated the EDMX file in the EntityModel.  The solution was that I had to go back to the Web Application project and add this line into the config file. The new model had changed a few items which had to be duplicated in the "other" project\'s Web.Config file.  The old configuration was no longer good.After hours of googling and trying to solve none of the solutions suggested worked. I have listed several solution here. I have also noted the one that worked for me. (I was using EF version 6.1.1, and SQL server 2014 - but an older DB)...and many more which I had tried [like: reverting the EntityFramework version to a later version(not sure about it)]what worked for me:from this article here, it helped me solve my problem. I just changed my ProviderManifestToken="2012" to ProviderManifestToken="2008" in the EDMX file. To do this:Solution ExplorerI hope that helps. In my case, this issue was related to renaming my model\'s edmx file... correcting the app.config connection string for the csdl/ssdl/msl files fixed my issue.If you\'re using the EF 4.0 designer to generate your csdl/ssdl/msl, these 3 "files" will actually be stored within the model\'s main edmx file. In this case, the post by Waqas is pretty much on the mark. It\'s important to understand that "Model_Name" in his example will need to be changed to whatever the current name of your model\'s .edmx file (without the .edmx).  Also, if your edmx file is not at the root level of your project, you need to preface Model_Name with the relative path, e.g.would specify the csdl/ssdl/msl xml is stored in the model file \'WidgetModel.edmx\' which is stored in a folder named \'MyModel\'.I have written this helper class to create instances of ObjectContext objects when they are defined in a different project than the project using it. I parse the connection string in the config file and replace \'*\' by the full assembly name.It is not perfect because it uses reflection to build the object, but it is the most generic way of doing it that I could find.Hope it helps someone.For all of you SelftrackingEntities Users , \nif you have followed the Microsoft Walk-through and separated the Object context class into \nthe wcf service project (by linking to the context .tt) so this answer is for you : part of the shown answers in this post that includes code like : WILL NOT WORK FOR YOU  !! the reason is that YourObjectContextType.Assembly now resides in a different Assembley (inside the wcf project assembly) , So you should replace YourObjectContextType.Assembly.FullName  with -->have fun.I was having problems with this same error message.  My issue was resolved by closing and re-opening Visual Studio 2010.Had same issue because I renamed an assembly.I had to also rename it in AssemblyTitle and AssemblyProduct attributes in project Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs, and also deleting and re adding the reference to the edmx file.Then it worked just fine.With having same problem I re-created edmx from Database.\nSolves my problem.I also had the same problem and solution as per Rick, except that I was importing an existing .edmx to a new project, and while the base namespace didn\'t matter it was imported into a different subdirectory so I also had to update the connection string inside Web.Config  in three places, to include the different subdirectory naming:\n    I had the same problem with a solution which contained projects in a Solution Folder, when they were moved to the Solution Root (in order to overcome a suspected bug with the Mvc3AppConverter due to project locations).Although the solution compiled after all* project references were re-added as needed, the error was thrown when the website was fired up.The EDMX is in one of the projects which was moved (the \'Data\' project), but of course the lack of a reference to the Data project didn\'t cause a compile error, just a run-time error.Simply adding the missing reference to the primary project resolved this problem, no need to edit the connection at all.I hope this helps someone else.A poor app.config or web.config file can do this.. I had copied the app.config connection string to my web.config in my UI and ended up entering:I simply hadn\'t referenced my class library that contained the EDMX file. My theory is that if you have more than one edmx file with same name (Model1 for example), it will give that exception.\nI\'ve got same problem when I decided to name all my edmx files (sitting in different projects) as Model1 because I thought they should be independent.Another cause for this exception is when you include a related table in an ObjectQuery, but type in the wrong navigation property name.Example:Sometimes the assembly that contains the model is not loaded:The type MallApp lives in the same assembly as the entity model. Without the explicit loading, an System.Data.MetadataException will be thrown.As for me, I had separated Data Access Layer and User Interface layer.\nSo I have entity connection string for each layer.Before I modify these two separated connection strings to be the same, I still found that below error.So I make to be the same connection strings for those two layers (DAL , UI), It work perfect.My solution is to make all connection string to be the same no matter where they already presented.When I got the metadata issue sorted out, I had a follow-on problem in the form of an invokation exception unable to find a connection string for XXXEntities in app.config (where my goal was no dependency on app.config). Through sheer luck I found that referencing System.Data in my unit test project cleared this final hurdle. So to summarise:I now have my metadata in a class library which can update from a reference db, and I can point my application and unit tests to any db on any server at runtime.Addendum: When I moved my edmx to a folder, I got the error again. After a bit of research, I found that you want your metadata string to look like: metadata=res://EPM.DAL/Models.EPM.csdl, where EPM.DAL is the name of the assembly and EPM.edmx is in the models folder.
