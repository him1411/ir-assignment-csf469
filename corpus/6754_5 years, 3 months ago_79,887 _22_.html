I have two branches A and B and, I want to merge branch A\'s single file with Branch B\'s corresponding file. How can I do that?I came across the same problem. To be precise, I have two branches A and B with the same files but a different programming interface in some files. Now the methods of file f, which is independent of the interface differences in the two branches, were changed in branch B, but the change is important for both branches. Thus, I need to merge just file f of branch B into file f of branch A.A simple command already solved the problem for me if I assume that all changes are committed in both branches A and B:The first command switches into branch A, into where I want to merge B\'s version of the file f. The second command patches the file f with f of HEAD of B. You may even accept/discard single parts of the patch. Instead of B you can specify any commit here, it does not have to be HEAD.Here\'s what I do in these situations. It\'s a kludge but it works just fine for me. I tried patching and my situation was too ugly for it. So in short it would look like this:Working Branch: A \nExperimental Branch: B (contains file.txt which has changes I want to fold in.)Create new branch based on A:Merge B into tempABCopy the sha1 hash of the merge:Checkout your working branch:Checkout your fixed-up file:And there you should have it. Commit your result. This uses git\'s internal difftool.\nMaybe a little work to do but straight forward.You could use:Tip: https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge-file.htmlMy edit got rejected, so I\'m attaching how to handle merging changes from a remote branch here.If you have to do this after an incorrect merge, you can do something like this:Assuming B is the current branch:Note that this only applies changes to the local file. You\'ll need to commit afterwards.The following command will\n(1) compare the file  of the correct branch, to master\n(2) interactively ask you which modifications to apply.git checkout --patch master
