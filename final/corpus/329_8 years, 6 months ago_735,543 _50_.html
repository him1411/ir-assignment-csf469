Say I have an enum which is justand I would like to find the enum value of a string, for example "A" which would be Blah.A. How would it be possible to do this?Is the Enum.valueOf() the method I need? If so, how would I use this?Yes, Blah.valueOf("A") will give you Blah.A.Note that the name must be an exact match, including case: Blah.valueOf("a") and Blah.valueOf("A ") both throw an IllegalArgumentException.The static methods valueOf() and values() are created at compile time and do not appear in source code. They do appear in Javadoc, though; for example, Dialog.ModalityType shows both methods.Another solution if the text is not the same to the enumeration value:Here\'s a nifty utility I use:Then in my enum class I usually have this to save some typing:If your enums are not all caps, just change the Enum.valueOf line.Too bad I can\'t use T.class for Enum.valueOf as T is erased.You should also be careful with your case. Let me explain: doing Blah.valueOf("A") works, but Blah.valueOf("a") will not work. Then again Blah.valueOf("a".toUpperCase(Locale.ENGLISH)) would work.edit\nChanged toUpperCase to toUpperCase(Locale.ENGLISH) based on tc. comment and the java docsedit2\nOn android you should use Locale.US, as sulai points out.Here\'s a method that can do it for any Enum, and is case insensitive.Using Blah.valueOf(string) is best but you can use Enum.valueOf(Blah.class, string) as well.If you don\'t want to write your own utility use Google\'s guava library:Unlike the built in java function it let\'s you check if A is present in Blah and doesn\'t throw an exception.Use the pattern from Joshua Bloch, Effective Java:(simplified for brevity)Also see:Oracle Java Example using Enum and Map of instancesExecution order of of static blocks in an Enum typeHow can I lookup a Java enum from its String valueYou may need to this :One More Addition :This will return you the Value by a Stringified Enum Name For e.g. if you provide "PERSON" in the fromEnumName it\'ll return you the Value of Enum i.e. "Person"Another way of doing this by using implicit static method name() of Enum. name will return the exact string used to create that enum which can be used to check against provided string:Testing:System.out.println(Blah.getEnum("B").name()); inspiration: 10 Examples of Enum in JavaSolution using Guava libraries. Method getPlanet () is case insensitive, so\ngetPlanet ("MerCUrY") will return Planet.MERCURY.To add to the previous answers, and address some of the discussions around nulls and NPE I\'m using Guava Optionals to handle absent/invalid cases.  This works great for URI/parameter parsing.For those not aware, here\'s some more info on avoiding null with Optional: https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/UsingAndAvoidingNullExplained#Optionaljava.lang.Enum defines several useful methods, which is available to all enumeration type in Java:In this code snippet, valueOf() method returns an Enum constant Gender.MALE, calling name on that returns "MALE".O(1) method inspired from thrift generated code which utilize a hashmap.In Java 8 the static Map pattern is even easier and is my preffered method. If you want to use the Enum with Jackson you can override toString and use that instead of name, then annotate with @JsonValueApache\'s commons-lang library has a static function org.apache.commons.lang3.EnumUtils.getEnum which will map a String to your Enum type. Same answer essentially as Geoffreys but why roll your own when it\'s out there in the wild already. My 2 cents here: using Java8 Streams + checking an exact string:Another utility capturing in reverse way. Using a value which identify that Enum, not from its name.Example:EnumUtil.from(Foo.class, "drei") returns Foo.THREE, because it will use getValue to match "drei", which is unique public, not final and not static method in Foo.\nIn case Foo has more than on public, not final and not static method, for example, getTranslate which returns "drei", the other method can be used: EnumUtil.from(Foo.class, "drei", "getTranslate").Adding on to the top rated answer, with a helpful utility...valueOf() throws two different Exceptions in cases where it doesn\'t like its input.If your requirements are such that you don\'t have any guarantee that your String will definitely match an enum value, for example if the String data comes from a database and could contain old version of the enum, then you\'ll need to handle these often...So here\'s a reusable method I wrote which allows us to define a default Enum to be returned if the String we pass doesn\'t match.Use it like this:I like to use this sort of process to parse commands as strings into enumerations.  I normally have one of the enumerations as "unknown" so it helps to have that returned when the others are not found (even on a case insensitive basis) rather than null (that meaning there is no value).  Hence I use this approach.In Java 8:
