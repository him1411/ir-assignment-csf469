I am trying to generate a random intvalue with Java, but in a specific range. For example:My range is 5-10, meaning that 5 is the smallest possible value and 10 is the biggest. Any other number in between these numbers is possible to be a value, too. In Java, there is a method random() in the Math class, which returns a double value between 0.0 and 1.0. In the class Random there is the method nextInt(int n), which returns a random int value in the range of 0 (inclusive) and n (exclusive). I couldn\'t find a method, which returns a random integer value between two numbers.I have tried the following things, but I still have problems:\n(minimum and maximum are the smallest and biggest numbers).Solution 1:Problem:randomNum can be bigger than maximum.Solution 2:Problem:randomNum can be smaller than minimum.How do I solve these problems?I have tried also browsing through the archive and found:But I couldn\'t solve the problem.In Java 1.7 or later, the standard way to do this is as follows:See the relevant JavaDoc.  This approach has the advantage of not needing to explicitly initialize a java.util.Random instance, which can be a source of confusion and error if used inappropriately.However, conversely there is no way to explicitly set the seed so it can be difficult to reproduce results in situations where that is useful such as testing or saving game states or similar.  In those situations, the pre-Java 1.7 technique shown below can be used.Before Java 1.7, the standard way to do this is as follows:See the relevant JavaDoc.  In practice, the java.util.Random class is often preferable to java.lang.Math.random().In particular, there is no need to reinvent the random integer generation wheel when there is a straightforward API within the standard library to accomplish the task.Note that this approach is more biased and less efficient than a nextInt approach, https://stackoverflow.com/a/738651/360211One standard pattern for accomplishing this is:The Java Math library function Math.random() generates a double value in the range [0,1). Notice this range does not include the 1.In order to get a specific range of values first, you need to multiply by the magnitude of the range of values you want covered. This returns a value in the range [0,Max-Min), where \'Max-Min\' is not included.For example, if you want [5,10], you need to cover five integer values so you useThis would return a value in the range [0,5), where 5 is not included.Now you need to shift this range up to the range that you are targeting. You do this by adding the Min value.You now will get a value in the range [Min,Max). Following our example, that means [5,10):But, this still doesn\'t include Max and you are getting a double value. In order to get the Max value included, you need to add 1 to your range parameter (Max - Min) and then truncate the decimal part by casting to an int. This is accomplished via:And there you have it. A random integer value in the range [Min,Max], or per the example [5,10]:Use:The integer x is now the random number that has a possible outcome of 5-10.Use:You can edit your second code example to:Just a small modification of your first solution would suffice.See more here for implementation of Random class:\nRandomWith java-8 they introduced the method ints(int randomNumberOrigin, int randomNumberBound) in the Random class.For example if you want to generate five random integers (or a single one) in the range [0, 10], just do:The first parameter indicates just the size of the IntStream generated (which is the overloaded method of the one that produces an unlimited IntStream).If you need to do multiple separate calls, you can create an infinite primitive iterator from the stream:You can also do it for double and long values.Hope it helps! :)ThreadLocalRandom equivalent of class java.util.Random for multithreaded environment. Generating a random number is carried out locally in each of the threads. So we have a better performance by reducing the conflicts. x,y - intervals e.g. (1,10)The Math.Random class in Java is 0-based. So, if you write something like x will be between 0-9 inclusive.So given the following array of 25 items, the code to generate a random number between \n0 (the base of the array) and array.length would be:Since i.Length will return 25, the nextInt(i.Length) will return a number between the range of 0-24. The other option is going with Math.Random which works in the same way.For a better understanding, check out forum post Random Intervals (archive.org).Forgive me for being fastidious, but the solution suggested by the majority, i.e., min + rng.nextInt(max - min + 1)), seems perilous due to the fact that:A foolproof solution would return correct results for any min <= max within [Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE]. Consider the following na\xc3\xafve implementation:Although inefficient, note that the probability of success in the while-loop will always be 50% or higher.Let us take an example.Suppose I wish to generate a number between 5-10.Let us understand this...Initialize max with highest value and min with the lowest value. Now, we need to determine how many possible values can be obtained. For this example, it would be 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10So, count of this would be max-min+1. i.e. 10-5+1=6The random number will generate a number between 0-5. i.e.   0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5Adding the min value to the random number would produce5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10      Hence we obtain the desired range. I wonder if any of the random number generating methods provided by an Apache Commons Math library would fit the bill. For example: RandomDataGenerator.nextInt or RandomDataGenerator.nextLongGenerate a random number for the difference of min and max by using the nextint(n) method and then add min number to the result:TryHere\'s a helpful class to generate random ints in a range with any combination of inclusive/exclusive bounds:This methods might be convenient to use:This method will return a random number between the provided min and max value:and this method will return a random number from the provided min and max value (so the generated number could also be the min or max number):In case of rolling a dice it would be random number between 1 to 6 (not 0 to 6), so: Here is a simple sample that shows how to generate random number from closed [min, max] range, while min <= max is trueYou can reuse it as field in hole class, also having all Random.class methods in one placeResults example:Sources:Or take a look to RandomUtils from Apache Commons.Just use the Random class: When you need a lot of random numbers, I do not recommend the Random class in the API. It has just a too small period. Try the Mersenne twister instead. There is a Java implementation.I found this example on http://www.javapractices.com/topic/TopicAction.do?Id=62: This example generates random integers in a specific range. An example run of this class :If you want to try the answer with the most votes above, you can simply use this code:It is just clean and simple.It\'s better to use SecureRandom rather than just Random.Another option is just using Apache Commons: ORThis is working fine. You can achieve that concisely in Java 8.
