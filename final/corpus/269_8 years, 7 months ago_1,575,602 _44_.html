I would like to know how to put a time delay in a Python script.Here is another example where something is run approximately once a minute:You can use the sleep() function in the time module. It can take a float argument for sub second resolution.Please read https://web.archive.org/web/20090207081238/http://faqts.com/knowledge_base/view.phtml/aid/2609/fid/378, which can help you further:Try the sleep function in the time module.And put this in a while loop and a statement will only execute on the\n  minute...  That allows you to run a statement at predefined intervals\n  regardless of how long the command takes (as long as it takes less than \n  a minute or 5 or 60 or whatever you set it to)  For example, I wanted to \n  run a ping once a minute.  If I just time.sleep(60) or time.sleep(45) \n  even, the ping will not always take the same amount of time.  Here\'s the \n  code :)The [5] just pulls the seconds out of the time.localtime()\'s return \n  value.The great thing about time.sleep is that it supports floating point \n  numbers!http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-time.htmlA bit of fun with sleepy generator.The question is about time delay. It can be fixed time, but in some cases we might need a delay measured since last time. Here is one possible solutions:The situation can be, we want to do something as regularly as possible and we do not want to bother with all the last_time, next_time stuff all around our code.Following code (sleepy.py) defines buzzergen gerenaratorand running it we see:We can also use it directly in a loop:and running it we might see:As we see, this buzzer is not too rigid and allow us to catch up regular sleepy intervals even if we oversleep and get out of regular schedule.In a single thread I suggest the sleep function:This actually suspends the processing of the thread in which it is called by the operating system, allowing other threads and processes to execute while it sleeps.Use it for that purpose, or simply to delay a function from executing. For example:"hooray!" printed 3 seconds after I hit Enter.Again, sleep suspends your thread - it uses next to zero processing power.To demonstrate, create a script like this (I first attempted this in an interactive Python 3.5 shell, but sub-processes can\'t find the party_later function for some reason):Example output from this script:You can trigger a function to be called at a later time in a separate thread with the Timer threading object:The blank line illustrates that the function printed to my standard out and I had to hit Enter to ensure I was on a prompt.The upside of this method is that while the Timer thread was waiting, I was able to do other things, in this case, hitting Enter one time - before the function executed (see the first empty prompt).There isn\'t a respective object in the multiprocessing library. You can create one, but it probably doesn\'t exist for a reason. A sub-thread makes a lot more sense for a simple timer than a whole new sub-process.The tkinter library in the Python standard library is an interactive tool which you can import. Basically, you can create buttons and boxes and popups and stuff that appear as windows which you manipulate with code.If you use tkinter, DO NOT USE TIME.SLEEP() because it will muck up your program. This happened to me. Instead, use root.after() and replace the values for however many seconds, with a milliseconds. E.g, time.sleep(1) is equivalent to root.after(1000) on tkinter.Otherwise, time.sleep(), which many answers have pointed out, is the way to go.delays are done with the time library, specifically the time.sleep() function...To just make it wait for a second:This works because by doing:you extract the sleep function only from the time library which means you can just call it with:rather than having to type out:which is awkwardly long to type. With this method, you wouldn\'t get access to the other features of the time library and you can\'t have a variable called sleep. but you could create a variable called time.Doing from [library] import [function] (, [function2]) is great if you just want certain parts of a module.You could equally do it as:and you would have access to the other features of the time library like time.clock() as long as you type time.function but you couldn\'t create the variable time.To put a time delay you should import the time module. And with that module you only need to write:For example if you want to put a time delay of a second before the computer runs another line you should put:That\'s all :)
