What command can be used to check if a directory exists or not, within a shell script?To check if a directory exists in a shell script you can use the following:Or to check if a directory doesn\'t exist:However, as Jon Ericson points out (thanks Jon), subsequent commands may not work as intended if you do not take into account that a symbolic link to a directory will also pass this check.\nE.g. running this:Will produce the error message:So symbolic links may have to be treated differently, if subsequent commands expect directories:Take particular note of the double-quotes used to wrap the variables, the reason for this is explained by 8jean in another answer. If the variables contain spaces or other unusual characters it will probably cause the script to fail.Remember to always wrap variables in double quotes when referencing them in\na bash script. Kids these days grow up with the idea that they can have spaces and lots of other funny characters in their directory names. (Spaces! Back in my days, we didn\'t have no fancy spaces! ;))One day, one of those kids will run your script with $DIRECTORY set to "My M0viez" and your script will blow up. You don\'t want that. So use this.I find the double-bracket version of test makes writing logic tests more natural:Note the -d test can produce some surprising results:File under: "When is a directory not a directory?"  The answer: "When it\'s a symlink to a directory."  A slightly more thorough test:You can find more information in the Bash manual on Bash conditional expressions and the [ builtin command and the [[ compound commmand.Shorter form:To check if a directory exists you can use simple if structure like this:You can do it also in negativeNote: Be careful, leave empty spaces on either side of both opening and closing braces.With the same syntax you can use:You can use test -d (see man test).-d file       True if file exists and is a directory.For example:Note: The test command is same as conditional expression [ (see: man [), so it\'s portable across shell scripts.[ - This is a synonym for the test builtin, but the last argument must, be a literal ], to match the opening [.For possible options or further help, check:Or for something completely useless:Here\'s a very pragmatic idiom:I typically wrap it in a function:Or:The nice thing about this approach is that I do not have to think of a good error message.cd will give me a standard one line message to stderr already.  It will also give more information than I will be able to provide. By performing the cd inside a subshell ( ... ), the command does not affect the current directory of the caller.  If the directory exists, this subshell and the function are just a no-op.Next is the argument that we pass to cd: ${1:?pathname expected}.  This is a more elaborate form of parameter substitution which is explained in more detail below.Tl;dr: If the string passed into this function is empty, we again exit from the subshell ( ... ) and return from the function with the given error message. Quoting from the ksh93 man page:If  parameter  is set and is non-null then substitute its value;\n  otherwise, print word and exit from the shell (if not interactive).\n  If word is omitted then a standard message is printed.andIf the colon : is omitted from  the  above  expressions,  then  the\n  shell only checks whether parameter is set or not.The phrasing here is peculiar to the shell documentation, as word may refer\nto any reasonable string, including whitespace.In this particular case, I know that the standard error message 1: parameter not set is not sufficient, so I zoom in on the type of value that we expect here - the pathname of a directory.A philosphical note:\nThe shell is not an object oriented language, so the message says pathname, not directory.  At this level, I\'d rather keep it simple - the arguments to a function are just strings.The above code checks if the directory exists and if it is writable.Type this code on the bash promtActually, you should use several tools to get a bulletproof approach:No need to worry about spaces and special characters as long as you use "${}".Note that [[]] is not as portable as [], but since most people work with modern versions of Bash (since after all, most people don\'t even work with command line :-p), the benefit is greater than the trouble.Check existence of the folder within sub-directories:Check existence of one or several folders based on a pattern within the current directory:Both combinations. In the following example, it checks the existence of the folder in the current directory:To check more than one directory use this code:N.B: Quoting variables is a good practice.Check if directory exists, else make one Using the -e check will check for files and this includes directories.This answer wrapped up as a shell scriptAs per Jonathan comment:If you want to create the directory and it does not exist yet, then the simplest technique is to use mkdir -p which creates the directory \xe2\x80\x94 and any missing directories up the path \xe2\x80\x94 and does not fail if the directory already exists, so you can do it all at once with:This is not completely true... \nIf you want to go to that directory, you also needs to have the execute rights on the directory. Maybe you need to have write rights as well.Therfore:The ls command in conjunction with -l (long listing) option returns attributes information about files and directories.\nIn particular the first character of ls -l output it is usually a d or a - (dash). In case of a d the one listed is a directory for sure.The following command in just one line will tell you if the given ISDIR variable contains a path to a directory or not:Practical usage:Great solutions out there, but ultimately every script will fail if you\'re not in the right directory. So code like this:will execute successfully only if at the moment of execution you\'re in a directory that has a subdirectory that you happen to check for. I understand the initial question like this: to verify if a directory exists irrespective of the user\'s position in the file system. So using the command \'find\' might do the trick:This solution is good because it allows the use of wildcards, a useful feature when searching for files/directories. The only problem is that, if the searched directory doesn\'t exist, the \'find\' command will print nothing to stdout (not an elegant solution for my taste) and will have nonetheless a zero exit. Maybe someone could improve on this. If you want to check if a directory exists, regardless if it\'s a real directory or a symlink, use this:Explanation: The "ls" command gives an error "ls: /x: No such file or directory" if the directory or symlink does not exist, and also sets the return code, which you can retrieve via "$?", to non-null (normally "1").\nBe sure that you check the return code directly after calling "ls".(1)(2)(3)If found an issue with one of the approach provided above.With ls command; the cases when directory does not exists - an error message is shown$ [[ ls -ld SAMPLE_DIR| grep ^d | wc -l -eq 1 ]] && echo exists || not exists\n-ksh: not: not found [No such file or directory]Below find can be used,From Script file myScript.sh:OR In kind of ternary form,And with test
