I am trying to merge 2 commits into 1, so I followed “squashing commits with rebase” from git ready.I ranIn the resulting editor, I change pick to squash and then save-quit, but the rebase fails with the errorCannot \'squash\' without a previous commitNow that my work tree has reached this state, I’m having trouble recovering. The command git rebase --interactive HEAD~2 fails withInteractive rebase already startedand git rebase --continue fails withCannot \'squash\' without a previous commitGet back to where you started withSay your history isThat is, a was the first commit, then b, and finally c. After committing c we decide to squash b and c together:Running git rebase --interactive HEAD~2 gives you an editor withChanging b\'s pick to squash will result in the error you saw, but if instead you squash c into b (newer into the older) by changing the text toand save-quitting your editor, you\'ll get another editor whose contents areWhen you save and quit, the contents of the edited file become commit message of the new combined commit:If there are multiple commits, you can use git rebase -i to squash two commits into one.If there are only two commits you want to merge, and they are the "most recent two", the following commands can be used to combine the two commits into one:First you should check how many commits you have:There are two status:One is that there are only two commits:For example:(In this case, you can\'t use git rebase to do) you need to do following. Another is that there are more than two commits; you want to merge commit C and D.For example:(under this condition, you can use git rebase)And than use "squash" to do. The rest thins is very easy. If you still don\'t know, please read http://zerodie.github.io/blog/2012/01/19/git-rebase-i/ Assuming you were in your own topic branch.  If you want to merge the last 2 commits into one and look like a hero, branch off the commit just before you made the last two commits.  Then squash commit the other branch in this new branch: That will bring in the changes but not commit them.  So just commit them and you\'re done.Now you can merge this new topic branch back into your main branch.you can cancel the rebase withand when you run the interactive rebase command again the \'squash; commit must be below the pick commit in the listI often use git reset --mixed to revert a base version before multiple commits which you want to merge, then I make a new commit, that way could let your commit newest, assure your version is HEAD after you push to server.If I want to merge head two commits into one, first I use : "249cf9392da197573a17c8426c282" was third version, also is your base version before you merge, after that, I make a new commit :It\'s all, hope is another way for everybody.FYI, from git reset --help:A simpler way for most frequent scenario.Actually if all you want is just simply merge several commits into one but do not need drop, reword and other rebase work. Then, use following command to modify the commit message.which is pretty the same as a long range of squash and one pick.And it works for n commits but not just two commits as above answer prompted.$ git rebase --abortRun this code at any time if you want to undo the git rebase$ git rebase -i HEAD~2To reapply last two commits. The above command will open a code editorAfter :wq you will be in active rebase modeNote: You\'ll get another editor if no warning/error messages, If there is an error or warning another editor will not show, you may abort by runnning \n$ git rebase --abort if you see an error or warning else just continue by running $ git rebase --continueYou will see your 2 commit message. Choose one or write your own commit message, save and quit [:wq]Note 2: You may need to force push your changes to the remote repo if you run rebase command$ git push -f  $ git push -f origin masterSince I use git cherry-pick for just about everything, to me it comes natural to do so even here.Given that I have branchX checked out and there are two commits at the tip of it, of which I want to create one commit combining their content, I do this:If i want to update branchX as well (and I suppose this is the down side of this method) I also have to:If your master branch git log looks something like following:and you want to merge the top two commits just do following easy steps:That\'s it. You may push this merged version in branch "merged-commits" if you like.Also, you can discard the back-to-back two commits in your master branch now. Just update your master branch as:
