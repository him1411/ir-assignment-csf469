This question already has an answer here:I need to determine if a value exists in an array.I am using the following function:The above function always returns false.The array values and the function call is as below:You can use it like this:CodePen validation/usagejQuery has a utility function for this:Returns index of value in array. Returns -1 if array does not contain value.See also How do I check if an array includes an object in JavaScript?This is generally what the indexOf() method is for. You would say:In ES2016, there is Array.prototype.includes.According to kangax and MDN, the following platforms are supported:Support can be expanded using Babel (using babel-polyfill) or core-js. MDN also provides a polyfill:It\'s almost always safer to use a library like lodash simply because of all the issues with cross-browser compatibilities and efficiency.Efficiency because you can be guaranteed that at any given time, a hugely popular library like underscore will have the most efficient method of accomplishing a utility function like this.If you\'re concerned about the bulk that\'s being added to your application by including the whole library, know that you can include functionality separately:Edit: With lodash 4, this had become _.includes() rather than _.contains(). Thanks @shadowhorst for the heads up.tl;dr ExampleLonger AnswerI know this question isn\'t really about whether or not to extend built-in objects, but the attempt of the OP and the comments on this answer highlight that debate. My comment from Feb 12, \'13 cites an article that outlines this debate really well, however that link broke and I can\'t edit the original comment because too much time has passed, so I include it here.If you\'re looking to extend the built-in Array object with a contains method, probably the best and most responsible way to do this would be to use this polyfill from MDN. (See also this section of the MDN article on Prototypical inheritance, which explains that "The only good reason for extending a built-in prototype is to backport the features of newer JavaScript engines; for example Array.forEach, etc.")Don\'t want strict equality, or want to choose?Since ECMAScript6, one can use Set :Given the implementation of indexOf for IE (as described by eyelidlessness):My little contribution:You can use _.indexOf method or if you don\'t want to include whole Underscore.js library in your app, you can have a look how they did it and extract necessary code.Another option would be to use Array.some (if available) in the following way:The anonymous function passed to Array.some will return true if and only if there is an element in the array that is identical to obj. Absent such an element, the function will not return true for any of the elements of the array, so Array.some will return false as well.If you have access to ECMA 5 you can use the some method.MDN SOME Method LinkIf you have access to ECMA 6 you can use the includes method.MDN INCLUDES Method LinkWow, there are a lot of great answers to this question. I didn\'t see one that takes a reduce approach so I\'ll add it in:Here\'s a fiddle of it in action.The answer provided didn\'t work for me, but it gave me an idea:It isn\'t perfect because items that are the same beyond the groupings could end up matching.  Such as my exampleWhen I call this function with the \'g\' and \'h\' fields containing 1 and 2 respectively, it still finds it because the resulting string from the join is:  1,1,2,2,3,3Since it is doubtful in my situation that I will come across this type of situation, I\'m using this.  I thought I would share incase someone else couldn\'t make the chosen answer work either.Using array .map function that executes a function for every value in an array seems cleanest to me.  Ref: Array.prototype.map()This method can work well both for simple arrays and for arrays of objects where you need to see if a key/value exists in an array of objects.This program checks whether the given element is found or not. Id\n  text1 represents id of textbox and searchele represents element to be\n  searched (got fron user); if you want index, use i valueThe simplest solution for a contains function, would be a function that looks like this :Ideally, you wouldn\'t make this a stand-alone function, though, but part of a helper library :Now, if you happen to be one of those unlucky people who still needs to support IE<9 and thus can\'t rely on indexOf, you could use this polyfill, which I got from the MDN :I prefer simplicity:
