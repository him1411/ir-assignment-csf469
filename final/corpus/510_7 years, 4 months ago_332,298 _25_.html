Possible Duplicate:\n  Change the current branch to master in git I have two branches in my git repo:I created seotweaks with the intention of quickly merging it back into master, however that was 3 months ago and the code in this branch is 13 versions ahead of master, it has effectively become our working master branch as all the code in master is more or less obsolete now. Very bad practice I know, lesson learned.Do you know how I can replace all of the contents of the master branch with those in seotweaks?I could just delete everything in master and merge, but this does not feel like best practice.You should be able to use the "ours" merge strategy to overwrite master with seotweaks like this:The result should be your master is now essentially seotweaks.  (-s ours is short for --strategy=ours)From the docs about the \'ours\' strategy:This resolves any number of heads, but the resulting tree of the merge is always that of the current branch head, effectively ignoring all changes from all other branches. It is meant to be used to supersede old development history of side branches. Note that this is different from the -Xours option to the recursive merge strategy.What about using git branch -m to rename the master branch to another one, then rename seotweaks branch to master?  Something like this:This might remove commits in origin master, please check your origin master before running git push -f origin master.You can rename/remove master on remote, but this will be an issue if lots of people have based their work on the remote master branch and have pulled that branch in their local repo.\nThat might not be the case here since everyone seems to be working on branch \'seotweaks\'.In that case you can:\ngit remote --show may not work.\n(Make a git remote show to check how your remote is declared within your local repo. I will assume \'origin\')\n(Regarding GitHub, house9 comments: "I had to do one additional step, click the \'Admin\' button on GitHub and set the \'Default Branch\' to something other than \'master\', then put it back afterwards")But again:since seotweaks was originally created as a branch from master, merging it back in is a good idea. however if you are in a situation where one of your branches is not really a branch from master or your history is so different that you just want to obliterate the master branch in favor of the new branch that you\'ve been doing the work on you can do this:this is especially helpful if you are getting this errorand you are not using github and don\'t have access to the "Administration" tab to change the default branch for your remote repo. furthermore, this won\'t cause down time or race conditions as you may encounter by deleting master:I found this to be the best way of doing this (i had an issue with my server not letting me delete)On the server that hosts the origin repository, type the following from a directory inside the repository:On your workstation:Back on the server that hosts the origin repository:credit to the author of this pagehttp://www.mslinn.com/blog/?p=772
