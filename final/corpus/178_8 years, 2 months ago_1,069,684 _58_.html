How do I check if a particular key exists in a JavaScript object or array?If a key doesn\'t exist, and I try to access it, will it return false? Or throw an error?Checking for undefined-ness is not an accurate way of testing whether a key exists. What if the key exists but the value is actually undefined?You should instead use the in operator:If you want to check if a key doesn\'t exist, remember to use parenthesis:Or, if you want to particularly test for properties of the object instance (and not inherited properties), use hasOwnProperty:EDIT: For performance comparison between the methods that are in, hasOwnProperty and key is undefined, see this benchmarkHow do I check if a particular key exists in a JavaScript object or array?\n  If a key doesn\'t exist and I try to access it, will it return false? Or throw an error?Accessing directly a missing property using (associative) array style or object style will return an undefined constant.As people have already mentioned here, you could have an object with a property associated with an "undefined" constant. In that case, you will have to use hasOwnProperty or in operator to know if the key is really there. But, but at what price?so, I tell you...in operator and hasOwnProperty are "methods" that use Property Descriptor mechanism in Javascript (similar to Java reflection in the Java language).http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-8.10The Property Descriptor type is used to explain the manipulation and reification of named property attributes. Values of the Property Descriptor type are records composed of named fields where each field\xe2\x80\x99s name is an attribute name and its value is a corresponding attribute value as specified in 8.6.1. In addition, any field may be present or absent.On the other hand, calling an object method or key will use Javascript [[Get]] mechanism. That is far way faster!http://jsperf.com/checking-if-a-key-exists-in-a-javascript-array.The result was The result wasThe result wasThe result wasThat question puzzles me. In Javascript, there are at least two references for absent objects to avoid problems like this: null and undefined. null is the primitive value that represents the intentional absence of any object value, or in short terms, the confirmed lack of value. On the other hand, undefined is unknown value (not defined). If there is a property that will be used later with a proper value consider use null reference instead of undefined because in the initial moment the property is confirmed to lack a value.Compare: Avoid objects with undefined values. Check directly whenever possible and use null to initialize property values. Otherwise, use the slow in operator or hasOwnProperty() method.It will return undefined.undefined is a special constant value.  So you can say, e.g.This is probably the best way to check for missing keys.  However, as is pointed out in a comment below, it\'s theoretically possible that you\'d want to have the actual value be undefined.  I\'ve never needed to do this and can\'t think of a reason offhand why I\'d ever want to, but just for the sake of completeness, you can use the in operatorThe accepted answer refers to Object. Beware using the in operator on Array to find data instead of keys:To test existing elements in an Array: Best way to find if an item is in a JavaScript array?Is likely testing only object attribute values that are very different from array keysThree ways to check if a property is present in a javascript object:Reference: http://book.mixu.net/node/ch5.htmlIf you are using underscore.js library then object/array operations become simple. In your case _.has method can be used. Example:returns true But,returns falseAnswer:Explanation:The in operator will check if the key exists in the object. If you checked if the value was undefined: if (myObj["key"] === \'undefined\'), you could run into problems because a key could possibly exist in your object with the undefined value.For that reason, it is much better practice to first use the in operator and then compare the value that is inside the key once you already know it exists.This keyExists(key, search) can be used to easily lookup a key within  objects or arrays! Just pass it the key you want to find, and search obj (the object or array) you want to find it in.Searching for keys in ObjectsIt\'s been pretty reliable and works well cross-browser.vanila jsIf you want to check if the object has at least one property in es2015The underscore.js way - using Array#some and Object.keys. It will return true if given key exists in the object or false if it doesn\'t.One-line example.Gets the value at path of object. If the resolved value is undefined,\n  the defaultValue is returned in its place.This will effectively check if that key, however deep, is defined and will not throw an error which might harm the flow of your program if that key is not defined.
